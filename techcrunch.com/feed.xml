										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/new-report-details-threats-to-consumers-from-surveillance-based-advertising/">international coalition</a> of consumer protection, digital and civil rights organizations and data protection experts has added its voice to growing calls for a ban on what&#8217;s been billed as &#8220;surveillance-based advertising&#8221;.</p>
<p>The objection is to a form of digital advertising that relies upon a massive apparatus of background data processing which sucks in information about individuals, as they browse and use services, to create profiles which are used to determine which ads to serve (via multi-participant processes like the high speed auctions known as real-time bidding).</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/eus-top-privacy-regulator-urges-ban-on-surveillance-based-ad-targeting/">previously called for a ban on targeted advertising which relies upon pervasive tracking</a> &#8212; warning over a multitude of associated rights risks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">Last fall</a> the EU parliament also urged tighter rules on behavioral ads.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/us-privacy-consumer-competition-and-civil-rights-groups-urge-ban-on-surveillance-advertising/">Back in March</a>, a US coalition of privacy, consumer, competition and civil rights groups also took collective aim at microtargeting. So pressure is growing on lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic to tackle exploitative adtech as consensus builds over the damage associated with mass surveillance-based manipulation.</p>
<p>At the same time,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/on-a-growth-tear-duckduckgo-reveals-it-picked-up-100m-in-secondary-investment-last-year/"> momentum is clearly building</a> for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/protonmail-gets-a-slick-new-look-as-privacy-tech-eyes-the-mainstream/">pro-privacy</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">consumer tech</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/braves-non-tracking-search-engine-is-now-in-beta/">services</a> &#8212; showing the rising store being placed by users and innovators on business models that respect people&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>The growing uptake of such services underlines how alternative, rights-respecting digital business models are not only possible (and accessible, with many freemium offerings) but increasingly popular.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2021-06-22-letter-to-policymakers-surveillance-based-advertising.pdf">open letter</a> addressing EU and US policymakers, the international coalition &#8212; which is comprised of 55 organizations and more than 20 experts including groups like Privacy International, the Open Rights Group, the Center for Digital Democracy, the New Economics Foundation, Beuc, Edri and Fairplay &#8212; urges legislative action, calling for a ban on ads that rely on &#8220;systematic commercial surveillance&#8221; of Internet users in order to serve what Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg likes, euphemistically, to refer to as &#8216;relevant ads&#8217;.</p>
<p>The problem with Zuckerberg&#8217;s (self-serving) framing is that, as the coalition points out, the vast majority of consumers don&#8217;t actually want to be spied upon to be served with these creepy ads.</p>
<p>Any claimed &#8216;relevance&#8217; is irrelevant to consumers who experience ad-stalking as creepy and unpleasant. (And just imagine how the average Internet user would feel if they could peek behind the adtech curtain &#8212; and see the vast databases where people are profiled at scale so their attention can be sliced and diced for commercial interests and sold to the highest bidder).</p>
<p>The coalition points to a <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/consumer-attitudes-to-surveillance-based-advertising.pdf">report </a>examining consumer attitudes to surveillance-based advertising, prepared by one of the letter&#8217;s signatories (the Norwegian Consumer Council; NCC), which found that only one in ten people are positive about commercial actors collecting information about them online &#8212; and only one in five think ads based on personal information are okay.</p>

<p>Neither do we at <a href="https://twitter.com/edri?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@edri</a>, which is why we join over 50 orgs &amp; 20 academics &amp; experts for a transatlantic call to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BanSurveillanceAdvertising?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BanSurveillanceAdvertising</a>.<a href="https://t.co/bTCdZIsSuP">https://t.co/bTCdZIsSuP</a> <a href="https://t.co/3rtDjAMIxA">pic.twitter.com/3rtDjAMIxA</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A full third of respondents to the survey were &#8220;very negative&#8221; about microtargeted ads &#8212; while almost half think advertisers should not be able to target ads based on any form of personal information.</p>
<p>The report also highlights a sense of impotence among consumers when they go online, with six out of ten respondents feeling that they have no choice but to give up information about themselves.</p>
<p>That finding should be particularly concerning for EU policymakers as the bloc&#8217;s data protection framework is supposed to provide citizens with a suite of rights related to their personal data that should protect them against being strong-armed to hand over info &#8212; including stipulating that if a data controller intends to rely on user consent to process data then consent must be informed, specific and freely given; it can&#8217;t be stolen, strong-armed or sneaked through using dark patterns. (Although that remains <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/europes-cookie-consent-reckoning-is-coming/">all too often the case</a>.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Forced consent is not legal under EU law &#8212; yet, per the NCC&#8217;s European survey, a majority of respondents feel they have no choice but to be creeped on when they use the Internet.</p>
<p>That in turn points to an ongoing EU enforcement failure over major adtech-related complaints, scores of which have been filed in recent years under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">some of which are now over three years old</a> (yet still haven&#8217;t resulted in any action against rule-breakers).</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">EU lawmakers have acknowledged problems with patchy GDPR enforcement</a> &#8212; and it&#8217;s interesting to note that the Commission suggested some alternative enforcement structures in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">recent digital regulation proposals</a>, such as for oversight of very large online platforms in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Digital Services Act</a> (DSA).</p>
<p>In the letter, the coalition suggests the DSA as the ideal legislative vehicle to contain a ban on surveillance-based ads.</p>
<p>Negotiations to shape a final proposal which EU institutions will need to vote on remain ongoing &#8212; but it&#8217;s possible the EU parliament could pick up the baton to push for a ban on surveillance ads. It has the power to amend the Commission&#8217;s legislative proposals and its approval is needed for draft laws to be adopted. So there&#8217;s plenty still to play for.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the US, we urge legislators to enact comprehensive privacy legislation,&#8221; the coalition adds.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;US privacy, consumer, competition and civil rights groups urge ban on &#8216;surveillance advertising&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/us-privacy-consumer-competition-and-civil-rights-groups-urge-ban-on-surveillance-advertising/embed/#?secret=ZouBwrzxBi" data-secret="ZouBwrzxBi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The coalition is backing up its call for a ban on surveillance-based advertising with another <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/report-time-to-ban-surveillance-based-advertising.pdf">report</a> (also by the NCC) which lays out the case against microtargeting &#8212; summarizing the raft of concerns that have come to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">attached to manipulative ads</a> as awareness of the adtech industry&#8217;s vast, background people-profiling and data trading has grown.</p>
<p>Listed concerns not only focus on how privacy-stripping practices are horrible for individual consumers (enabling the manipulation, discrimination and exploitation of individuals and vulnerable groups) but also flag the damage to digital competition as a result of adtech platforms and data brokers intermediating and cannibalizing publishers&#8217; revenues &#8212; eroding, for example, the ability of professional journalism to sustain itself and creating the conditions where ad fraud has been able to flourish.</p>
<p>Another contention is that the overall health of democratic societies is put at risk by surveillance-based advertising &#8212; as the apparatus and incentives fuel the amplification of misinformation and create security risks, and even national security risks. (Strong and independent journalism is also, of course, a core plank of a healthy democracy.)</p>
<p>&#8220;This harms consumers and businesses, and can undermine the cornerstones of democracy,&#8221; the coalition warns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although we recognize that advertising is an important source of revenue for content creators and publishers online, this does not justify the massive commercial surveillance systems set up in attempts to &#8216;show the right ad to the right people&#8217;,&#8221; the letter goes on. &#8220;Other forms of advertising technologies exist, which do not depend on spying on consumers, and cases have shown that such alternative models can be implemented without significantly affecting revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no fair trade-off in the current surveillance-based advertising system. We encourage you to take a stand and consider a ban of surveillance-based advertising as part of the Digital Services Act in the EU, and the for U.S. to enact a long overdue federal privacy law.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Data from Dutch public broadcaster shows the value of ditching creepy ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/data-from-dutch-public-broadcaster-shows-the-value-of-ditching-creepy-ads/embed/#?secret=MkRN72Sdym" data-secret="MkRN72Sdym" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The letter is just the latest salvo against &#8216;toxic adtech&#8217;. And advertising giants like Facebook and Google have &#8212; for several years now &#8212; seen the pro-privacy writing on the wall.</p>
<p>Hence Facebook&#8217;s claimed &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/05/facebook-is-pivoting/">pivot to privacy</a>&#8216;; its plan to lock in its first party data advantage (by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/02/facebook-warned-over-privacy-risks-of-merging-messaging-platforms/">merging the infrastructure of different messaging products</a>); and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/facebook-libra/">keen interest in crypto</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also why Google has been working on a stack of alternative adtech that it wants to replace third party tracking cookies. Although its proposed replacement &#8212; the so-called &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">Privacy Sandbox</a>&#8216; &#8212; would still enable groups of Internet users to be opaquely clustered by its algorithms in &#8216;interest&#8217; buckets for ad targeting purposes which still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/google-claims-almost-no-change-in-ad-revenue-from-targeting-proposals-in-its-privacy-sandbox-but-privacy-upside-less-clear/">doesn&#8217;t look great for Internet users&#8217; rights either</a>. (And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">concerns have been raised on the competition front too</a>.)</p>
<p>Where its &#8216;Sandbox&#8217; proposal is concerned, Google may well be factoring in the possibility of legislation that outlaws &#8212; or, at least, more tightly controls &#8212; microtargeting. And it&#8217;s therefore trying to race ahead with developing alternative adtech that would have much the same targeting potency (maintaining its market power) but, by swapping out individuals for cohorts of web users, could potentially sidestep a ban on &#8216;microtargeting&#8217; technicalities.</p>
<p>Legislators addressing this issue will therefore need to be smart in how they draft any laws intended to tackle the damage caused by surveillance-based advertising.</p>
<p>Certainly they will if they want to prevent the same old small- and large-scale manipulation abuses from being perpetuated.</p>
<p>The NCC&#8217;s report points to what it dubs as &#8220;good alternatives&#8221; for digital advertising models which don&#8217;t depend on the systematic surveillance of consumers to function. And which &#8212; it also argues &#8212; provide advertisers and publishers with &#8220;more oversight and control over where ads are displayed and which ads are being shown&#8221;.</p>
<p>The problem of ad fraud is certainly massively underreported. But, well, it&#8217;s instructive to recall how often Facebook has had to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/facebook-knew-for-years-ad-reach-estimates-were-based-on-wrong-data-but-blocked-fixes-over-revenue-impact-per-court-filing/">&#8216;fess up to problems with self reported ad metrics</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible to sell advertising space without basing it on intimate details about consumers. Solutions already exist to show ads in relevant contexts, or where consumers self-report what ads they want to see,&#8221; the NCC&#8217;s director of digital policy, Finn Myrstad, noted in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;A ban on surveillance-based advertising would also pave the way for a more transparent advertising marketplace, diminishing the need to share large parts of ad revenue with third parties such as data brokers. A level playing field would contribute to giving advertisers and content providers more control, and keep a larger share of the revenue.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canadian early stage venture firm <a href="https://www.golden.ventures">Golden Ventures</a> has raised its fourth fund, a $100 million pool of capital that it will use to invest in between 20 to 25 companies, as well as a $20 million &#8216;Opportunities Fund&#8217; that it will use to make follow-on investments in standout performers among its portfolio. This is also the 10th anniversary for Golden Ventures, and its latest fund arrives at a time when the Canadian startup ecosystem looks healthier than ever, with a proliferation of angels emerging from past success stories, a number of new funds being announced, and unicorn valuations on significant funding rounds for multiple Canadian startups.</p>
<p>I spoke to Golden Ventures Founder and Managing Partner Matt Golden, and General Partner Ameet Shah about its plans for this fund, and about the Canadian startup and investment landscape in general.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over time, we&#8217;re certainly seeing more and more interest in institutional LPs, more and more interest in the Canadian ecosystem, which I think is a net positive,&#8221; Golden said. &#8220;Whereas before, the Canadian ecosystem was largely funded by Canadian institutions, so I think that&#8217;s really positive, because you have to sort of be judged on the on the world stage. And we&#8217;re starting to meet that bar as both an ecosystem and as a fund.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Golden said that the game plan with this Fund IV doesn&#8217;t really change in terms of their investment targets; while Golden initially set out to invest primarily in companies working on software products for mobile devices, it eventually shifted to a strategy of backing North American seed stage, mission-driven founders working on venture-scale opportunities across a range of verticals and categories.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that over time, our ratio of deals, Canada to U.S., we&#8217;ve increased the number of deals on a ratio basis that we do in Canada versus the U.S., just by virtue of the fact that the Canadian ecosystem is on a terrific, high-velocity trajectory.&#8221; Golden said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve seen it coming, but I think it&#8217;s really starting to hit its stride now, with lots of founders with &#8216;big swing&#8217; vision, and an increasing interest in capital playing in the ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shah added that he also thinks we&#8217;re trending towards more startups that originate in Canada setting up nodes in different geographies in ways that make most sense for their talent needs, and vice versa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Post-COVID, a lot of companies may start here, but with the geographical boundaries just blurring, there&#8217;s really no reason they can&#8217;t set up locations in different centers of gravity and take advantage of other ecosystems&#8217; competitive advantages,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We had one that recently set up a location in LA, as well as Toronto, capturing some the value of LA but also leveraging all the talent in Toronto as well. I think you&#8217;re gonna start seeing more and more of that, where things are moving more towards networks, and not just cities in general.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for this fund raise, it&#8217;s one of three recent Canadian early stage pools of venture capital to also include an &#8216;Opportunities Fund,&#8217; which in each case has been described as a way for the firms to participate in later stage deals in their star portfolio companies that they wouldn&#8217;t otherwise be set up to invest in as an early stage investment organization. Golden Ventures is also introducing another new type of investment to its roster with Fund IV, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s this concept, we call it &#8216;Angel allocation,&#8217; [&#8230;] it&#8217;s the idea that we can invest smaller checks, sort of 400-to-500 thousand, into companies where maybe the structure of the opportunity or of the deal may not fit what our core checks would be,&#8221; Golden explains. &#8220;That could be, for example, a case where there&#8217;s not enough room left in the round, or the valuation is outside of our core range, or maybe we&#8217;re learning about a completely new space that&#8217;s highly experimental — but we still have a high degree of conviction in the opportunity, in the people behind that opportunity, and the returns that it could generate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Funds for those investments will come out of the main Fund IV pool, but the majority will still be targeting those core 20-25 larger checks. Overall, though, both Golden and Shah emphasize that the primary goal of the fund at this stage is capitalizing on the growing trend they see of more opportunity emerging in the Canadian ecosystem, and the impact that&#8217;s having in terms of startups across North America.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you talk about who are the the top five to ten companies in Canada, for a long time, it was really the same group,&#8221; Shah said. &#8220;Now, you&#8217;ve got this new crop of people that have come in and feel like they&#8217;re still on an upward trajectory, and I think that&#8217;s just really exciting as well.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://aircall.io">Aircall</a> has raised a $120 million Series D round led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Following today’s funding round, the company has reached unicorn status, which means it has a valuation above $1 billion — this is the 16th French unicorn.</p>
<p>The startup has been building a cloud-based phone system for call centers, support lines and sales teams. It integrates with Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk, Slack, Intercom and other popular CRM, support and communication systems.</p>
<p>Aircall customers can create local numbers and set up an interactive voice response directory. The service manages the call queue for you and your agents can start answering inbound calls. Agents can transfer calls and put customers on hold. Admins can see analytics, monitor calls and see how everyone is doing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to Goldman Sachs Asset Management, existing investors DTCP, eFounders, Draper Esprit, Adam Street Partners, NextWorldCap and Gaia are also participating once again in today’s funding round.</p>
<p>As a cloud-based software product, Aircall works well with remote or hybrid teams. For the past year, many companies have been looking for a new phone system with various lockdowns taking place around the world. And Aircall has capitalized on this influx of customers.</p>
<p>When it comes to metrics, it means that signups increased by 65% in 2020. New customers include Caudalie, OpenClassrooms and Too Good To Go. Overall, Aircall has 8,500 customers. 15% of them are based in France, 35% in the U.S. and 50% in other countries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s hard to keep up with the fundraising spree in China&#8217;s autonomous driving industry these days. Guangzhou- and California-based robotaxi company WeRide, which counts Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance as one of its strategic investors, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/chinas-weride-secures-more-funding-pushing-valuation-to-3-3-billion/">raised over $600 million in just under five months</a> from its Series B and C financing rounds.</p>
<p>The four-year-old upstart said in May that its valuation leaped to $3.3 billion in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/chinas-weride-secures-more-funding-pushing-valuation-to-3-3-billion/">Series C fundraising</a>. WeRide has kept details of the backing to itself until today when it disclosed the investment was a lofty sum of $310 million from Alliance Ventures, a strategic venture capital fund operated by Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, China Structural Reform Fund, a Chinese state-owned private equity fund, and Pro Capital, which manages China&#8217;s CDB Equipment Manufacturing Funds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how much WeRide has raised since its inception as some of its investments were undisclosed. It pulled in &#8220;<a href="https://www.weride.ai/series-a-update/">tens of millions of dollars</a>&#8221; from a Series A round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is the second time Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi has shelled out money for WeRide following its initial strategic investment back in 2018. The follow-on funding came as the two companies strengthen ties to develop Level 4 driving vehicles for the Chinese market. Electric cars from the Dongfeng-Nissan joint venture, automated by WeRide software, have been providing robotaxi service in Guangzhou for 18 months. WeRide uses Nissan vehicles in California for research and development.</p>
<p>Ashwani Gupta, COO of Nissan, gave an assuring statement about the partnership: &#8220;As China stands at the forefront of helping define the future of mobility, we are delighted to partner with WeRide to bring even more innovative technologies and services to enrich people’s lives in China.&#8221;</p>
<p>WeRide similarly sounded rosy about the alliance with Nissan. &#8220;Throughout the past three years, they have been playing a critical role in supporting WeRide’s autonomous driving platform, hence, enabling us to establish a leading fleet of robotaxis,&#8221; said Tony Han, WeRide founder and CEO .</p>
<p>&#8220;With the continued support of Nissan, we will accelerate the commercial use of our driverless robotaxis in China.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joyride, a Toronto-based company that provides white label apps, back-end analytics and multi-modal fleet management for shared micromobility startups, has raised $3.7 million — seed money that it says will help it reach a greater number of small, local operators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which operates in more than 160 markets in every continent besides Antarctica, has primarily been able to generate enough revenue to support its business since its founding in 2014. With the fresh capital, Joyride will double down on its ability to help local operators find and finance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the right vehicles, access insurance programs from trusted partners and learn how to deploy a profitable fleet. Joyride has already offered these services to an extent alongside its SaaS business model, but wants to feature them more prominently as its business grows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really early on in the pandemic, we saw companies like Bird and Lime pull out of almost every market they were in, and then almost right away we started to get a lot of local entrepreneurs from those cities contacting us and saying, ‘Hey, Bird and Lime just left. I see a real opportunity here for me to run a micromobility business for myself,’” Joyride’s founder and CEO Vince Cifani told TechCrunch.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since last year, Joyride has seen interest from entrepreneurs looking to start small scooter and e-bike share businesses increase four-fold compared to pre-pandemic numbers, Cifani said. That looks like about 150 requests per week. Joyride’s stats point to an emerging trend of local operators beginning to spring up in the parts of the world perhaps deemed too small fry for the big operators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last couple of years, the industry seems to have been on the consolidation path, especially when we look at acquisitions like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/">Lime buying Jump</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21224164/lime-buys-boosted-electric-skateboard-scooter-acquistion-bankrupt">Boosted</a> and Bird buying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/bird-confirms-acquisition-of-berlin-scooter-competitor-circ/">Circ</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/bird-confirms-acquisition-of-scoot/">Scoot</a>. But we haven’t really seen consolidation among the hundreds of smaller businesses operating locally, said Cifani. And while they may be small individually, they’re mighty in numbers, quietly cropping up in towns and cities across the globe and privately at hotels and on campuses. In some cases, like with The Hague in the Netherlands, fleets are being operated by public transit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As local operators proliferate, the opportunity for companies like Joyride grows. In Germany, a similar software provider </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/wunder-mobilitys-new-lending-business-helps-micromobility-startups-finance-fleets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wunder Mobility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently launched a lending division to help micromobility startups finance fleets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve identified that there are over 10,000 different markets for these types of local operators to run this type of business,” said Cifani. “So if it’s taken Bird, say, half a billion dollars to get into 100 plus markets, are they actually going to raise $100 billion to try and get into every single market opportunity in the world? The inflection point for us is that there’s a huge opportunity for this long tail market, and we’ve seen Bird try to pivot into that space as well with its fleet manager model.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Bird’s fleet manager model, which made up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">94% of the company&#8217;s &#8220;sharing&#8221; revenue in the second half of 2020</a>, the vehicles and software are supplied to local operators. Bird always maintains ownership and branding of the scooters. The fleet managers are responsible for</span> fleet deployment and rebalancing, sanitization, and general care and maintenance of the Bird vehicles. In exchange, the operators receive a portion of the fee that users pay to rent the scooters.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Joyride is different. The company helps customers buy fleets outright from manufacturing partners and in some cases helps them finance their vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where the big players like Bird and Lime have chased scale in the push to become profitable, Cifani says many of Joyride’s operators running smaller operations tell him they’ve paid back the money for all their vehicles within a few months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joyride’s seed round was led by Proeza Ventures, Urban Innovation Fund and Craig Miller, former CPO of Shopify, a platform that has similarly helped democratize the e-commerce space. Cifani says Joyride will be doing a Series A in the near future.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sohail Prasad and Samvit Ramadurgam are cofounders who met during Y Combinator&#8217;s 2012 summer batch and went on to cofound <a href="https://forgeglobal.com/">Forge</a>, which helps accredited investors and institutions buy and sell private company shares and which most recently raised <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/04/forge-pre-ipo-giants-are-surging-this-company-is-reaping-the-rewards.html">$150 million</a> in new funding in May.</p>
<p>Forge &#8212; originally known as Equidate &#8212;  has taken off as demand for private company shares has ballooned. The company, launched in 2014, has now raised $250 million altogether, including from, Deutsche Börse, Temasek, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, and Munich Re. It acquired rival SharesPost last year for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/once-rivals-secondary-market-player-forge-is-acquiring-sharespost-in-a-160-million-cash-and-stock-deal/">$160 million</a> in cash and stock. According to the company, it now has more than $14 billion in assets under custody.</p>
<p>Prasad and Ramadurgam &#8212; who helped hire Forge CEO Kelly Rodriques back in 2018 &#8212; say they&#8217;re excited about that success. They still own a stake in the company; they remain non-voting board members.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But after spending 18 months as co-president of Forge at the outset of Rodrigues&#8217;s tenure, they left early last year to begin tinkering on a new idea, one that Prasad says is centered around giving a much wider pool of people access to private company shares. Called <a href="https://destiny.xyz/">D/XYZ</a> (pronounced “Destiny”), the idea is to enable any investor &#8212; not just the 1% &#8212;  to invest in startups whose services they use and love.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the two aren&#8217;t offering much more of a curtain raiser than that right now, though Prasad suggests D/XYZ is neither a new fund nor a crowdfunding vehicle. It&#8217;s also not selling any tokens, we gather. Instead, Prasad hints at an entirely new product, saying the company is being cautious in how much it shares publicly because it first wants to &#8220;get the go-ahead from regulators, as well as to ensure we have a clear path to market,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the two have raised $5 million in seed funding from numerous founders who like the idea of making private company shares easier for their parents, friends, customers, partners, and everyone else who likes what they&#8217;re building. Among the round&#8217;s participants is Coinbase cofounder Fred Ehrsam; Plaid cofounder and CEO Zach Perret; Quora and Expo cofounder Charlie Cheever; Superhuman founder and CEO Rahul Vohra; and serial entrepreneur Siqi Chen, who most recently founded a finance software company called Runway.</p>
<p>As for some of the nascent startup&#8217;s most obvious competition, Prasad doesn&#8217;t sound concerned. Asked, for example, about Carta, a well-funded company that helps private companies and their employees manage and sell their stock and options and that has long talked about democratizing access to private company shares, Prasad says it remains very much a direct competitor instead to Forge given that both cater first and foremost to companies, not individuals.</p>

<p>And what of SPACs, the special purpose acquisition companies that are moving private companies onto the public market faster, allowing (at least in theory) more people to access high-growth companies at earlier stages? It&#8217;s a partial solution, says Prasad. But the way he sees it, &#8220;SPACs are more a reflection that people want late-stage access to private tech and their best option right now is giving money to a SPAC manager who will hopefully find a promising company to merge with in two years or less.&#8221; He calls them a &#8220;layer of abstraction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s also the question of whether Forge will be a friend of foe if whatever Prasad and Ramadurgam are building succeeds. Could their tech be sold back to their first company? Could Forge come to see them as a rival to its business?</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re doing now is not competitive,&#8221; insists Prasad. &#8220;It&#8217;s more picking up the mantle where we left off. Forge is focused on trading, custody, company solutions and data. It has built what some call boring plumbing.&#8221; Now that the plumbing has been erected, it has &#8220;enabled a lot of other interesting things to be built, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>So is D/XYZ working with Forge in some capacity? Prasad demurs. &#8220;Potentially,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>In other words, stay tuned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The founders of Holy Grail, a two-year-old startup based in Mountain View, California, are taking a micro approach to solving the outsized problem of capturing carbon.</p>
<p>The startup is prototyping a direct air carbon capture device that is modular and small — a departure from the dozens of projects in the U.S. and abroad that aim to capture CO2 from large, centralized emitters, like power plants or industrial facilities. Holy Grail co-founder Nuno Pereira told TechCrunch that this approach will reduce costs and eliminate the need for permits or project financing.</p>
<p>While Holy Grail has a long development and testing phase ahead, the idea has captured the attention and capital from well-known investors and Silicon Valley founders. Holy Grail recently raised $2.7 million in seed funding from LowerCarbon Capital, Goat Capital, Stripe founder Patrick Collison, Charlie Songhurst, Cruise co-founder Kyle Vogt, Songkick co-founder Ian Hogarth, Starlight Ventures and 35 Ventures. Existing investors Deep Science Ventures, Y Combinator and Oliver Cameron, who co-founded Voyage, the autonomous vehicle acquired by Cruise, also participated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The carbon capture device is still in the prototype stage, Pereira said, with many specifics &#8212; such as the anticipated size of the end product and how long it will likely function &#8212; still to be worked out. Cost-effectively separating CO2 from the air is an extremely difficult problem to solve. The company is in the process of filing patents for the technology, so he declined to be too specific about many characteristics of the device, including what it will be made out of. But he did stress that the company is taking a fundamentally different technical approach to carbon capture.</p>
<p>“The current technologies, they are very complex. They are basically either [using] temperature or pressure [to capture carbon],” he said. “There is a lot of things that go into it, compressors, calciners and all these things,” referring to additional parts like mechanical pumps, cryogenic air separators and large quantities of water and energy. Pereira said the company will instead use electricity to control a chemical reaction that binds to the CO2. He added that Holy Grail’s devices are not dependent on scale to achieve cost reductions, either. And they will be modular, so they can be stacked or configured depending on a customer’s requirements.</p>
<p>The scrubbers, as Pereira calls them, will focus on raw capture of CO2 rather than conversion (converting the CO2 into fuels, for example). Pereira instead explained &#8212; with a heavy caveat that much about the end product still needs to be figured out &#8212; that once a Holy Grail unit is full, it could be collected by the company, though where the carbon will end up is still an open question.</p>
<p>The company will start by selling carbon credits, using its devices as the carbon reducing project. The end goal is selling the scrubbers to commercial customers and eventually even individual consumers. That’s right: Holy Grail wants you to have your own carbon capture device, possibly even right in your backyard. But the company still likely has a long road ahead of it.</p>
<p>“We’re essentially shifting the scaling factor from building a very large mega-ton plant and having the project management and all that stuff to building scrubbers in an assembly line, like a consumer product to be manufactured.”</p>
<p>Pereira said many approaches will be needed to tackle the mammoth problem of reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. “The problem is just too big,” he said.</p>
<p><em>The story has been updated to reflect that Holy Grail is based in Mountain View, not Cupertino.</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you're a founder who's getting ready to knock on doors and ask strangers for money, read this first.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Usually, a teacher who grades students on a curve is boosting the efforts of those who didn’t perform well on the test. In the case of cloud companies, however, it’s the other way around.</p>
<p>As of Q1 2021, startups in this sector have median Series A rounds around $8 million, reports PitchBook. With $100+ million Series D rounds becoming more common, company valuations are regularly boosted into the billions.</p>
<p>Andy Stinnes, a general partner at Cloud Apps Capital Partners, says <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/seed-is-not-the-new-series-a/">founders who are between angel and Series A</a> should seek out investors who are satisfied with $200,000 to $500,000 in ARR.</p>

<p>Usually a specialist firm, these VCs are open to betting on startups that haven’t yet found product-market fit.</p>
<p>“At this phase of development, you need a committed partner who has both the time and the experience to guide you,” says Stinnes.</p>
<p>These observations aren’t just for active investors: This post is also a framework for new and seasoned founders who are getting ready to knock on doors and ask strangers for money.</p>

<p>Alex returned from a week of vacation with a dispatch about the profitability of neobanks Revolut, Chime and Monzo.</p>
<p>“In short, while American consumer fintech Chime has disclosed positive EBITDA — an adjusted profitability metric — many neobanks that we’ve seen numbers from have demonstrated a stark inability to paint a path to profitability,” he writes.</p>

<p>After noSQL provider Couchbase filed to go public, joining the ranks of the Great IPO Rush of 2021, Alex Wilhelm looked into its business model and financial performance, with a goal of better understanding the company &#8212; and market comps.</p>
<p>Alex used Red Hat, which recently sold to IBM for around $34 billion, as a comp, determining Couchbase “is worth around $900 million” if you use the Red Hat math.</p>
<p>“The Red Hat-Couchbase comparison is not perfect; 2019 is ages ago in technology time, the database company is smaller and other differences exist between the two companies,” Alex notes. “But Red Hat does allow us the confidence to state that Couchbase will be able to best its final private valuation in its public debut.”</p>

<p>Anna Heim interviewed SaaS entrepreneurs and investors to find out how much early-stage founders should pay themselves.</p>
<p>Startups run by CEOs who take home a small salary tend to do better over the long run, but there are other points to consider, such as geography, marital status, and frankly, what quality of life you desire.</p>
<p>Waterly founder Chris Sosnowski raised his own pay to $14/hour last year; at his prior job, his salary topped $100,000.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had saved money up for over a year before we cut out my pay,” he told Anna. “I can live my life without entertainment … so that’s what we did for 2020.”</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim had been hearing that Series A raises were coming later, while Series Bs were coming in quick succession after startups landed an A.</p>
<p>That piqued their curiosity, so they put feelers out to a bunch of investors to understand what&#8217;s going on in early-stage venture capital markets.</p>
<p>In the first of a two-part series, Alex and Anna examine why seed stage is so chaotic, why As are slow, and why Bs are fast. In their first dispatch, they looked at the U.S. market.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 22, 2021. We have startup product news, funding rounds and a roster of Big Tech updates for you today. But before we get into all of that do not forget to sign up for <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">TechCrunch Spotlight: Pittsburgh startup</a> Pitch-Off. Also the Equity podcast crew are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/register-to-watch-a-livestream-recording-of-equity/">hosting a live taping this Thursday</a> that should be a lot of fun. I’ll be there! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/"><strong>Twitter starts rolling out Super Follows and ticketed Spaces</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The great product push at Twitter continued today with an early rollout of its Super Follow feature. If you have 10,000 followers and tweet about once per day, you could be eligible to charge people from $2.99 to $9.99 per month for bonus tweets. The company is also rolling out ticketed Twitter Spaces, its live-audio product.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/braves-non-tracking-search-engine-is-now-in-beta/"><strong>Another startup taking on Google</strong></a><strong>: </strong>While we await the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/can-you-beat-google-with-googles-brains/">Neeva’s subscription search alternative</a>, Brave has put its own search offering into the market. You can give it a test <a href="https://search.brave.com/">here</a>, if you’d like. The short gist is that it’s a “nontracking search engine built on top of an independent index and touted as a privacy-safe alternative to surveillance tech products like Google search,” TechCrunch wrote.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/"><strong>The early-stage startup funding market in focus</strong></a><strong>: </strong>TechCrunch dug into the world of seed and early-stage venture capital rounds that startups are raising today. After a VC tipped us off to the concept of Series As coming late and Series Bs coming early, we asked a host of other investors about the idea. What did we learn? That some startups can start raising the moment they close their last round. Wild.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups</h2>
<p>Everyone and their favorite pup raised money today, so we’re breaking our startup coverage into two chunks. The first is focused on product news. The second on funding rounds. Let’s go:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Airbank</strong> is building a small and midsized fintech service to help aggregate all of a company’s bank accounts and financial data. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/airbank-centralizes-all-your-business-bank-accounts-and-financial-data/">Read the story here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Racial Inequity Drawdown</strong> is a framework that aims to “address racial inequity in startup investing and in the broader world,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/firm-creates-open-framework-to-help-vcs-and-founders-address-racial-inequity/">TechCrunch reports</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Squad</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/if-you-love-voice-messaging-youll-love-squad/">launched a new mobile app</a> that connects groups of friends through time-gated audio messages. You have 24 hours to hear what your friends said now that Squad has completed its focus-shift to more intimate collections of friends from interest groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Turning to the money world, there are more rounds than we can get to today. But here’s a selection of favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/dutch-payments-startup-mollie-raises-another-800m-at-a-6-5b-valuation/">Mollie raises $800 million for its payment-integration service</a>:</strong> Dutch startup Mollie is now worth $6.5 billion after raising nearly $1 billion in a single round. The startup “provides a way for businesses to integrate payments into sites, documents and other services by way of an API,” TechCrunch wrote. Its new round and valuation implies that there’s room yet in the payments space for more mega-unicorns. Still.</li>
<li>Speaking of fintech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/australian-fintech-zeller-lands-50m-aud-led-by-spark-capital-at-a-400m-aud-valuation/"><strong>Australian startup Zeller just raised AUD$50 million</strong></a> at a AUD$400 million valuation. It provides POS and card services for SMBs.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/lidar-company-quanergy-to-go-public-via-1-4b-spac-deal/"><strong>Lidar-focused Quanergy Systems is going public</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Via a SPAC, of course. You can<a href="http://www.spacbyccac.com/doc/Project%20Vision%20PIPE%20Presentation%20vPublic.pdf"> peruse its investor deck</a> if you want all the gritty projections. What matters here is that the SPAC boom is not done, even if it appears to be slowing. And we’re hearing from Series-B-level founders that SPACs are already hitting them up. Expect more and weirder SPAC deals over time.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/oyster-an-hr-platform-for-distributed-workforces-snaps-up-50m-on-a-475m-valuation/"><strong>Oyster is now a half-unicorn</strong></a><strong>: </strong>That’s what we learned when the startup focused on supporting employees outside of a company’s home country raised a $50 million Series B that valued it at nearly $500 million.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/vantage-raises-4m-to-help-businesses-understand-their-aws-costs/">Vantage raises $4M to help folks manage their AWS spend</a>:</strong> All that growth that Amazon’s AWS cloud service has managed in recent years was built on rising customer spend. And some AWS customers want to spend less. And Vantage is going to help.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/g2-raises-157m-for-its-software-review-service/"><strong>G2 raises $157 million to help companies choose software</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Software is such a huge category that even niches can support a host of competitors. But all that spend means lots of companies making choices about what software to leverage. G2 wants to help. And it is now a unicorn after its investors poured nine-figures of capital into its coffers at a valuation of more than $1 billion.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/transmit-security-raises-543m-series-a-to-kill-off-the-password/">Transmit raises $543 million in a Series A to help kill passwords</a>:</strong> The company is now worth $2.2 billion, with plans to use its new money to “expand its reach and investing in key global areas to grow the organization.” Any move to kill passwords is TechCrunch-approved.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How much to pay yourself as a SaaS founder</h2>
<p>Anna Heim interviewed SaaS entrepreneurs and investors to find out how much early-stage founders should pay themselves.</p>
<p>Startups run by CEOs who take home a small salary tend to do better over the long run, but there are other points to consider, such as geography, marital status, and frankly, what quality of life you desire.</p>
<p>Waterly founder Chris Sosnowski raised his own pay to $14/hour last year; at his prior job, his salary topped $100,000.</p>
<p>“We had saved money up for over a year before we cut out my pay,” he told Anna. “I can live my life without entertainment … so that’s what we did for 2020.”</p>
<p>How much are you willing to sacrifice?</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Another day, another slew of headlines discussing the latest tech and government scrap. Today we learned that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/a-newly-tech-skeptical-ftc-will-reportedly-review-amazons-acquisition-of-mgm/">the U.S. government may review Amazon’s plan to buy a huge movie studio</a>. There was also more from India today, with news breaking that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/india-orders-antitrust-investigation-against-google-over-alleged-abuse-of-androids-dominance-in-smart-tv-market/">the country is digging into Google over its smart TV market</a>.

					<description><![CDATA[Investor Marlon Nichols and founder Chris Bennett review Wonderschool's original pitch deck.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before our conversation on Extra Crunch Live, Marlon Nichols dropped a bomb on me. The MaC Venture Capital founding managing partner hadn’t actually seen Wonderschool’s original pitch deck before investing in the remote education startup. Our conversation with the company’s CEO, Chris Bennett was the first time he’d been through the seed-stage deck.</p>
<p>Their partnership was a bit of Silicon Valley luck, good timing and some old fashioned networking.</p>
<p>“He was a part of an organization that was helping to bring more diverse founders in touch with investors,” says Nichols. “That was happening when I first moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2011. We started to build a casual relationship then. Fast forward to 2016. At my first fund, Cross Culture [Ventures], we were interested in investing in early childhood care. We were actually looking at a number of different companies and one of my partners, Suzy [Ryoo] was like, ‘Have you heard of this company Wonderschool that Chris Bennett was starting, and I was like, ‘Holy shit, I know Chris.’ ”</p>
<p>According to Bennet, Nichols reached out about the opportunity on Facebook Messenger. After the initial conversation and assessing some direct competitors, Nichols says Wonderschool was ultimately the right fit for Cross Culture’s portfolio.</p>
<p>Fittingly, the startup’s origin also has its roots in SV networking.</p>
<p>“I used to go the TED conference every year,” says Bennett. “I met a woman who told me that early childhood education was really important [ … ] She said, ‘A lot of the skills I use today as a CEO, a lot of those seeds were planted before the age of five.’ I thought that was a really wild idea. I started doing research and realized there was a shortage of childcare in America.”</p>
<p>Bennett cringed slightly when we started the process of showing off the company’s early deck. The first thing that jumped out at all of us was just how bare bones the presentation is: white text on a blue background, largely made up of bullet points. There’s not flash — or even graphics — to be found in the entire thing. And the CEO adds that honestly, not much changed aesthetically between that first pitch and the Series A deck.</p>
<p>“It aligned with what we were valuing at the time,” says Bennett. “We were really focused on getting the product-market fit and really trying to understand what our customers needed. And we’re really focused on building the team.”</p>
<p>Perhaps there was something to it, however, as Wonderschool managed to raise $20 million for the latter.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Viva Republica, the Seoul-based fintech company behind <a href="https://toss.im/en">Toss</a>, a super app with more than 40 financial services, announced today it has raised $410 million at a post-money valuation of $7.4 billion. The new funding was led by Alkeon Capital, an American investment firm, and included participation from new investors like Korea Development Bank, and returning backers Altos Ventures and Greyhound Capital.</p>
<p>The company plans to launch Toss Bank, a neobank, in September 2021, which it describes as “the final key component” of its super app strategy. It will also use the funding to continue its expansion in overseas markets, including Vietnam, where Toss launched last year.</p>
<p>Viva Republica, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/09/toss-becomes-koreas-newest-unicorn/">hit unicorn status in 2018</a>, has now raised more than $940 million in equity funding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Founder and chief executive officer SG Lee told TechCrunch that Toss Bank will focus on lending, and also offer savings accounts with competitive interest rates.</p>
<p>“A lot of challenger banks and neobanks are focusing on the banking experience, such as cards, so their main revenue source is interchange fees,” he said. “Toss is quite different because we already cover all that. We cover P2P payment, money transfer, cards and all sorts of services. So we are focusing on loans, unsecured loans, mortgages, all sorts of loans. We are going to use this vehicle to give the most competitive interest rates to users, and Toss Bank will not have a separate app, since we have super app strategy.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168466" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168466" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2168466" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?w=680" alt="Toss founder SG Lee" width="680" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg 2366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2168466" class="wp-caption-text">Toss founder SG Lee</p></div></p>
<p>One of the reasons Toss Bank is focusing on loans is because if someone has a middling credit score, many South Korean banks will only offer them loans at subprime interest rates, Lee said. Toss Bank will be able to offer better rates because its risk-scoring model leverages data from its millions of users.</p>
<p>Toss now claims a total of 20 million users (or more than a third of South Korea’s 51.7 population) and of that amount, 11 million are monthly active users.</p>
<p>The app launched as a Venmo-like peer-to-peer money transfer platform in 2015, before adding more services. Now its users can turn to the app for almost all of their financial needs.</p>
<p>For example, they can check their balances at different banks and credit cards on a dashboard. Merchants can use Toss Payments to send and receive online payments and manage their business finances. Other features include budgeting tools, bill payments, a credit score tracker and insurance plans. Lee said more than 20% of bank accounts and credit cards in South Korea are already registered on Toss.</p>
<p>As a financial super app, Toss Bank will be able to supplement information from South Korea’s main credit rating agencies with its own data about user transactions: for example, where do they spend money, how often do they spend, their cash flow and balances.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The fintech endgame: New supercompanies combine the best of software and financials&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/the-fintech-endgame-new-supercompanies-combine-the-best-of-software-and-financials/embed/#?secret=7fSjE9qpa3" data-secret="7fSjE9qpa3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lee added that one of South Korea’s leading credit bureaus, KCB (Korea Credit Bureau), backtested Toss’ engine with data from over two million users, and it turned out to be 150% better in terms of differential power analysis and 30% lower in delinquency rates. “This is the first engine that counts this asset-related data, and no machine-learning technologies have been used in credit evaluation” in South Korea, he said. “I think Toss Bank is really well-positioned to disrupt the whole loan market.”</p>
<p>In March, Toss also launched an investment service called Toss Securities, designed to make stock trading accessible to new investors who shy away from traditional brokerages. Over the past three months, it has signed up more than 3.5 million users.</p>
<p>Viva Republica launched Toss in Vietnam, its first international market, in 2020, and the app now has services like no-fee money transfers, debit cards and a financial dashboard through a partnership with CIMB bank. Toss currently claims more than three million monthly active users in Vietnam and says it adds more than 500,000 active users every month. Toss is planning to enter other Southeast Asian markets, too.</p>
<p>Toss hasn’t finalized a timeline, but it is targeting Malaysia for its next market by the end of this year. “The product that we built for Vietnam is actually quite scalable across all Southeast Asia markets, so it’s a matter of time,” Lee said. “But we want to focus on the Vietnam market because it’s scaling increasingly fast and we have to cover the growth.”</p>
<p>As for the possibility of holding an initial public offering or finding another exit opportunity, Lee said the company is still finalizing its plans. “As an Asian company, reaching a $7.4 billion valuation is pretty high, and I think at some point we will face not being able to do more fundraising in the private market. So we’re targeting to raise once more by the end of this year or early next year for over $300 million. That will be our last private fundraising, and then we’re thinking a timeline of three years, and we are reviewing not only for a Korean listing but also a U.S. listing.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[GM has launched a series of new subsidiaries tackling electrification, connectivity and even insurance — all part of the automaker's aim to find value beyond its traditional business.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM has launched a series of new subsidiaries in the past year tackling electrification, connectivity and even insurance — all part of the automaker&#8217;s aim to find value (and profits) beyond its traditional business of making, selling and financing vehicles. These startups, including numerous ones that will never make the cut, get their start under Vice President of Innovation Pam Fletcher&#8217;s watch.</p>
<p>Fletcher, who joined TechCrunch on June 9 at the virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> event, runs a group of 170 people developing and launching startups with a total addressable market of about $1.3 trillion.</p>
<p>Today, about 19 companies are making their way through the incubator in hopes of joining recent GM startups like OnStar Guardian, OnStar Insurance, GM Defense and BrightDrop, the commercial electric vehicle delivery business that launched in January. Not everything will make it, Fletcher told the audience, noting &#8220;we add new things all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Launching any startup presents challenges. But launching multiple startups within a 113-year-old automaker that employs 155,000 people globally is another, more complex matter. The bar, which determines whether these startups are ever publicly launched, is specific and high. A GM startup has to be a new idea that can attract new customers and grow the total addressable market for the automaker, using existing assets and IP.</p>
<h2>The Volt effect</h2>
<p>The 2010 Chevrolet Volt is a noteworthy moment on the GM timeline. The vehicle marked the company&#8217;s first commercial push into electrification since the 1990s EV1 program. Fletcher, who was the chief engineer of the Chevy Volt propulsion system from 2008 to 2011, noted that the Volt was the beginning of a change within the automaker that eventually led to other commercial products including the all-electric Chevy Bolt, the hands-free driver assistance system Super Cruise and its current work on autonomous vehicle development with its subsidiary Cruise.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t know that the Volt was a root exactly of what we&#8217;re seeing today. But I think it was definitely the start of a groundswell of really looking at, how do we inject technology that customers are excited about and care about quickly? How do we engage them deeply in the process? … Which we&#8217;ve always done … just, I think there was a climate there where the appetite was so strong with a certain group of customers for the technology that it allowed us to get really a front row seat with them, which was game changing for those of us on the frontlines. And obviously, there have been many programs that have had that in their own ways, but you really see that accelerating now with the advent of everything we&#8217;re doing in electrification and autonomous and a portfolio that is just emerging even to the notion of applying some of these great technologies to our new full size, truck and SUV programs. So it&#8217;s really broad, based across the company, which is exciting. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 4:56)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Fletcher explained how working to commercialize new technology changed how the company interacted with customers.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">With new technologies, one, you get to a new customer base sometimes. So, really understanding what that customer is looking like and putting them at the center of everything. Also, different technologies have different development processes and timelines and pipelines for activity. So, it really allowed us to start to think about how to approach each step of our product development and customer engagement differently. And the Volt was an interesting time too, because that was the advent of new social media was really starting to become much more popular. And so we were very connected with those customers and a great customer base that gave us tremendous feedback very directly, you know, through at the time, what was a new channel. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 3:50)<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is making it even easier to buy stuff while you scroll past photos of your high school lab partner&#8217;s dog. Yes, Instagram Shops and Facebook Marketplace are already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/instagram-swaps-out-its-activity-tab-for-shop-in-new-global-test/">displayed prominently</a> on the apps&#8217; bottom navigation tabs. But now, you can shop on WhatsApp too, along with other updates.</p>
<p>Today on a Live Audio Room, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/new-ways-to-shop-for-products-you-love-across-our-apps/">three e-commerce updates</a> that are coming to Facebook products: Shops on WhatsApp and Marketplace, Shops Ads and Instagram Visual Search.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than 1 billion people use Marketplace each month, so we&#8217;re making it easy for businesses to bring their Shops into Marketplace to reach even more people,&#8221; Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113319652002411">wrote</a> in a Facebook post. When customers view a shop on WhatsApp, they&#8217;ll have the option of chatting with a business before buying something.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2168854" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168854" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2168854 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/whatsapp.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/whatsapp.jpeg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/whatsapp.jpeg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/whatsapp.jpeg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/whatsapp.jpeg?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/whatsapp.jpeg?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/whatsapp.jpeg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168854" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>WhatsApp</p></div></p>
<p>At its F8 conference earlier this month, Facebook revealed updates to WhatsApp for Business &#8212; previously, it could take weeks to set up a business account, but now, businesses can sign up in just a few minutes. Though WhatsApp has more than 2 billion global users, only about 175 million people message with WhatsApp Business accounts daily for things like customer support. Since Facebook has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/instagram-adds-affiliate-and-shop-features-for-creators/">pushing e-commerce</a> on platforms like Instagram, it makes sense that this initiative will expand to WhatsApp too.</p>

<p>The rollout for Shops in WhatsApp will start soon, and Shops inventory in Marketplace is available now for Shops in the U.S. with on-site checkout.</p>
<p>The next feature, Shops Ads, aims to provide a more individualized shopping experience based on people&#8217;s individual shopping habits. Zuckerberg said, &#8220;We&#8217;re launching the ability for a business to send shoppers to where you&#8217;re going to be most likely to make a purchase based on your shopping behavior.&#8221; Starting now, AR Dynamic Ads are available in the United States &#8212; companies like Huda Beauty and Laura Mercier are using these ads to let customers test lipstick shades with AR before making a purchase. These AR try-on experiences are made available through API integrations with Modiface and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/perfect-corp-developer-of-virtual-beauty-app-youcam-makeup-closes-50-million-series-c-led-by-goldman-sachs/">Perfect Corp</a>. Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/pinterest-launches-an-ar-powered-try-on-experience-for-eyeshadow/">Pinterest collaborated with ModiFace</a> to launch an AR eyeshadow try-on.</p>

<p>&#8220;A lot of shopping discovery begins with visual discovery, right, so you see something that you think is awesome. And then, you know, maybe you want to see other products that are like that, or you want to figure out how to get that product,&#8221; Zuckerberg explained. &#8220;And this is the type of problem that AI can really help out with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using this AI, people will be able to upload their own photos &#8212; even ones they haven&#8217;t posted on Instagram &#8212; to find similar items. Facebook isn&#8217;t the first company to use this technology &#8212; see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/cadeera-is-doing-ai-visual-search-for-home-decor/">Cadeera</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/donde-search-picks-up-6-million-to-help-fashion-retailers-with-visual-search/">Donde Search</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/syte/">Stye.ai</a>, for instance. But bringing this technology to major platforms might change the way we shop, which seems to be Facebook&#8217;s current goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The hubbub surrounding the autonomous vehicle industry often focuses on venture capital rounds, speculation about IPOs and acquisitions. But the industry&#8217;s future also hinges on the high-stakes task of proving the technology can operate safer than human drivers do today and gaining the public&#8217;s trust. In short: safety matters.</p>
<p>Zoox <a href="https://www.zoox.com/safety/">issued a safety report</a> Tuesday that aims to give new insight into its custom electric autonomous vehicle and describes in greater detail various design details aimed at preventing crashes and protecting if they do.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you know, and something everybody keeps talking about, is that part of the rationale for doing AVs is because of safety, safety, safety, but they never get to the next bullet [point] right? What are you going to actually do to prevent those crashes, to save those lives?&#8221; Mark Rosekind, the company&#8217;s chief safety innovation officer and former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rosekind says this latest report answers those questions.</p>
<p>Zoox is a bit different from its rivals. It isn&#8217;t just developing the self-driving software stack. The company is responsible for creating the on-demand ride-sharing app and the vehicle itself. Zoox also plans to own, manage and operate its robotaxi fleet.</p>
<p>Zoox unveiled in December the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazons-zoox-unveils-electric-robotaxi-that-can-travel-up-to-75-mph/">electric, autonomous robotaxi</a> it built from the ground up &#8212; a cube-like vehicle loaded with sensors, no steering wheel and a moonroof that is capable of transporting four people at speeds of up to 75 miles per hour. At the time, Zoox shared a few specs on the four-seat vehicle, including the face-to-face symmetrical seating configuration, similar to what a train traveler might encounter, and the 133 kilowatt-hour battery that the company said allows it to operate for up to 16 continuous hours on a single charge. But not everything was revealed, particularly details about how it would protect occupants in the vehicle as well as the pedestrians, cyclists and other drivers it will be sharing the road with.</p>
<p>To be clear, Zoox is not the only AV company issuing safety reports. Voluntary safety self-assessment reports, or VSSAs, have become fairly common in the industry. These voluntary safety reports, which are included in <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/automated-driving-systems/voluntary-safety-self-assessment">NHTSA&#8217;s Automated Driving Systems VSSA Disclosure Index</a>, are supposed to cover 12 areas, including the vehicle&#8217;s design, crash simulation scenarios and benchmarks for testing, as well as protective measures for occupants and other road users.</p>
<p>Zoox&#8217;s <a href="https://www.zoox.com/safety/">first safety report</a> came out in 2018, which outlined the company&#8217;s &#8220;prevent and protect&#8221; philosophy. This latest one reveals how Zoox plans to meet its safety goals, including specific details on the design of the vehicle. And more safety reports are coming — per a few hints in this latest one — including details about its collision avoidance system and the lighting system the vehicle uses for communicating with other road users.</p>
<p>Zoox has designed and included more than 100 safety innovations into its purpose-built vehicle. Rosekind shared details on nine of them that fall into three categories: driving control, no single point of failure and rider protection.</p>
<h2>Driving control</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2168810" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168810" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2168810 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg" alt="Zoox at Coit Tower" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2168810" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zoox</p></div></p>
<p>Zoox&#8217;s vehicle has independent braking and an active suspension system, which means that each of the brakes has its own electronic control unit, allowing for more control over traction on the road and weight distribution. All of that translates to shorter stopping distances.</p>
<p>The vehicle also has four-wheel steering, which Rosekind noted doesn&#8217;t exist on any AV car on the road today, and is bidirectional. Four-wheel steering allows the vehicle to simultaneously adjust where it is headed and its position within the lane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once our software has determined the path for the vehicle, it&#8217;ll stay on that path down to centimeters accuracy — even at speed through a curb, Rosekind explained.</p>
<p>The four-wheel steering combined with the vehicle&#8217;s <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">symmetrical design allows for it to travel bidirectionally. The bidirectional capability means no more U-turns or three-point turns, two </span>maneuvers<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> that are more complex, time consuming and can make occupants more vulnerable to oncoming traffic. </span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 12">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<h2>No single point of failure</h2>
</div>
<p>Rosekind said the company&#8217;s design objective was that there would be no single point of failure for its safety critical systems. For instance, the vehicle has two powertrains. The motors, drive systems and batteries work in conjunction with each other. If one component in the system fails, the other one will take over.</p>
<p>The vehicle also has two batteries as well as a safety diagnostics system that monitors all of the hardware, software and firmware. Sensors like lidar and radar are also placed on the four corners of the vehicle — each one provides a 270-degree field of view.</p>
<p>The diagnostic system goes beyond monitoring and will<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> mitigate a failure or performance problem that it identifies. For instance, if a sensor has degraded performance from damage or debris, it will activate a cleaning system on the vehicle or turn it from </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">bidirectional to unidirectional, placing the sensor in a position where it basically doesn&#8217;t matter if it is obscured, Rosekind explained. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Fail-safe operational means it&#8217;s going to continue the ride, let you out, and then go take care of whatever the issue is, or pull over to a safe spot,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>Rider protection</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2168801" style="width: 2810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168801" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2168801 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png" alt="Zoox Seatbelt Notification" width="2800" height="1575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2800px) 100vw, 2800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2168801" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zoox</p></div></p>
<p>Zoox&#8217;s goal is for its vehicle to meet five-star crash protection for every seat in the vehicle. The vehicles are currently going through crash testing now, Rosekind said, adding that it is &#8220;going quite well and almost complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company also designed a new kind of airbag system that contains five different airbags. Curtain airbags are on each side of the vehicle, a frontal one is divided in two parts to protect the head, neck and chest. There are also rear and side seat airbags.</p>
</div>
<p>Within the system is an airbag control unit that can monitor where a collision is coming as well as the velocity and determine which airbags and in what order to deploy. Instead of every airbag deploying at once, they will inflate based on the collision location and the severity of the impact.</p>
<p>Finally, the vehicle has sensors in the seat, the buckle and even the coating on the webbing of the seatbelt to be able to tell if passengers are using the seatbelt. The vehicle will not start until everybody&#8217;s buckled up, Rosekind said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Addressing the skills gap and strengthening your own security team means bringing in different minds and perspectives — and that starts with embracing neurodiversity. To even have a chance at closing the cybersecurity skills gap, we need people with a variety of different abilities and thought processes. But did you know that there’s an untapped potential in individuals who are neurodivergent?</p>
<p><a href="https://ndpathways.org/neurodiversity-overview/">Neurodiversity</a> can mean different things to different people. It’s a concept that views the spectrum of neurological differences — like ADHD, autism, dyslexia, Tourette’s and other cognitive and developmental disorders — as natural variations of the human brain. In a nutshell, neurodiversity recognizes that brain differences are just that: differences.</p>
<p>I was always aware of the fact that I had a different operating system. It was like growing up on a Mac OS, but made specifically for Windows OS. It wasn’t until I was diagnosed as autistic that I understood why I am the way that I am. My diagnosis gave me a purpose. It’s a purpose I’ve taken with me into the working world, and it’s helped me realize how vital neurodiverse individuals can and will be to the cybersecurity industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			To even have a chance at closing the cybersecurity skills gap, we need people with a variety of different abilities and thought processes.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>There are many inherent traits in people with autism that are well suited for working in cybersecurity. For example, many people with autism are pattern thinkers and are highly detail-oriented. This allows someone in a threat-hunting position to find those subtle differences between malicious and nonmalicious code and catch the threats that automated tools might miss. We also have the ability to hyperfocus, which allows us to concentrate on problem-solving and stick with complex issues that other people may abandon.</p>
<p>Of course, we all have a different set of skills, interests, strengths and weaknesses. But there are some characteristics that — when given the right support and environment — can translate to cybersecurity positively.</p>
<p>This is especially true when autistic adults are interested in technology and cybersecurity. Their interest can complement their attention to detail, which can make for a successful blue team cyber professional. The number and types of cyber threats are constantly changing. Some are obvious to hunt down, and some are much more subtle. Some malware even has the ability to &#8220;live off the land&#8221; by using already created applications or executables that live natively on a computer. Knowing this information, and knowing what to look for and where to hone in, allows a neurodivergent person to consistently inspect, investigate and hunt down even the most persistent threats.</p>
<h2>Embrace the benefits</h2>
<p>Instead of focusing on what makes a neurodivergent person “different,” we should embrace the benefits that different minds and viewpoints bring to the field of cybersecurity. Let’s face it: The world is going to need more cybersecurity professionals. Ensuring diversity in these teams includes embracing neurodiversity. Having a blend of unique talents provided by these detail-oriented, rule-bound, logical and independent-thinking individuals is — and will be — a competitive edge in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Having a career in cybersecurity typically requires logic, discipline, curiosity and the ability to solve problems and find patterns. This is an industry that offers a wide spectrum of positions and career paths for people who are neurodivergent, particularly for roles in threat analysis, threat intelligence and threat hunting.</p>
<p>Neurodiverse minds are usually great at finding the needle in the haystack, the small red flags and minute details that are critical for hunting down and analyzing potential threats. Other strengths include pattern recognition, thinking outside the box, attention to detail, a keen sense of focus, methodical thinking and integrity.</p>
<p>The more diverse your teams are, the more productive, creative and successful they will be. And not only can neurodiverse talent help strengthen cybersecurity, employing different minds and perspectives can also solve communication problems and create a positive impact for both your team and your company.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/information-security-analysts.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, the demand for Information Security Analysts — one of the common career paths for cybersecurity professionals — is expected to grow 31% by 2029, much higher than the average growth rate of 4% for other occupations. While vital jobs in cybersecurity are going unfilled, millions of smart people who&#8217;d be ideally suited for the work remain unemployed.</p>
<h2>Taking the first step</h2>
<p>It’s time to challenge the assumption that qualified talent equals neurotypicality. There are many steps companies can take to ensure inclusivity and promote belonging in the workplace. Let’s start all the way at the beginning and focus on job postings.</p>
<p>Job postings should be black and white in terms of the information they are asking for and the job requirements. Start by making job postings more inclusive and less constrictive in what is being required. Include a contact email address where an applicant can ask for accommodations, and provide a less traditional approach by providing these accommodations.</p>
<p>Traditional interviews can be a challenge for neurodivergent individuals, and this is often the first hurdle to employment. For example, to ease some candidates’ nerves, you could provide a list of questions that will be asked as a guideline. More importantly, don’t judge someone based on their lack of eye contact.</p>
<p>To promote an inclusive and belonging culture of neurodiversity in the workplace, the workplace should be more supportive of different needs. It is vital to ensure employees at all levels have the knowledge and understanding on how to empower a diverse team and create an open and inclusive workplace. This starts with diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging training for all employees. Companies should also consider changing their communication style. Neurodiverse individuals communicate differently and not altering the way you communicate could lead to a disconnect in the workplace.</p>
<p>My advice to other neurodivergent and/or autistic adults looking to break into the cybersecurity field is to continue your learning, connect with cybersecurity professionals for networking purposes and never give up. The more we push for awareness and inclusion in all aspects of all companies — small and large — the more opportunities there will be for success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This Thursday, Apple will <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-tower-theatre-opens-thursday-in-downtown-los-angeles/">mark the opening of a new store in downtown Los Angeles</a>. The space occupies the newly renovated Tower Theatre, which opened in DTLA’s Broadway Theater District in 1927. Among other milestones, the 900-seat theater was the first in LA to be wired for the talkies, hosting a premier of &#8220;The Jazz Singer&#8221; that same year. Not for nothing, it was also the first theater in the city with air conditioning.</p>
<p>Apple Tower Theatre is actually the company’s 26<sup>th</sup> store in greater LA. Obviously, though, moving into a 94-year-old theater takes a fair bit more work than, say, a shopping mall. The store has been in the works for a number of years, owing in part to having to work with the city to restore a space that had been declared a landmark.</p>

<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-apple-downtown-20180802-story.html#">an LA Times article back in 2018</a> noted that the space, “may also serve as a declaration that Apple intends to compete as a major Hollywood content creator.” In hindsight, fair enough. Apple TV+ launched late the following year.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2168778,2168774,2168777,2168779,2168782,2168766"]</p>
<p>The theater has actually been largely unoccupied since 1988, which clearly meant even more work had to go into shining up the walls and making the grand old theater presentable for that modern retail vibe &#8212; not to mention a seismic upgrade to help make it more earthquake proof.</p>
<p>The company also notes that it took care to maintain some of the space’s more iconic elements.</p>

<p>“Apple Tower Theatre anchors the corner of Eighth Street and Broadway, where visitors will immediately recognize the fully restored clock tower, recreated Broadway marquee, clean terra cotta exterior, and renovated historic blade sign,” Apple writes. “After walking through the Broadway doors, guests enter the monumental lobby inspired by Charles Garnier’s Paris Opera House, featuring a grand arched stairway with bronze handrails flanked by marble Corinthian columns.”</p>
<p>The store’s opening also marks the launch of Apple’s new <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-launches-today-at-apple-creative-studios/">Creative Studios initiative</a>. The LA store and a location in Beijing will be the first to get the program. In its initial form, it will run between eight and 12 weeks, providing a group of mentors from the creative arts.</p>

<p>“Creativity and access to education are core values for Apple, so we are absolutely thrilled to kick off today at Apple Creative Studios in Los Angeles and Beijing and to bring this meaningful program to several more cities this year,” SVP Deirdre O’Brien said in a press release. “Building on our long history of using stores as a venue to host local artists to educate and inspire, Creative Studios is one more way we’re providing free arts education to those who need it most.”</p>
<p>Last week, Google launched its first retail store in Manhattan&#8217;s Chelsea district. The Apple Tower Theatre location opens at 10 a.m. local time on Thursday, June 24. The company says it&#8217;s employing nearly 100 to keep the store running.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/amazon-is-buying-mgm-studios-for-8-45b/">purchase of MGM</a> must pass the scrutiny of the FTC, newly chaired by prominent Amazon critic Lina Khan, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-planned-purchase-of-mgm-to-be-reviewed-by-ftc-11624379614">The Wall Street Journal has reported</a>. While the $8.45 million merger is not likely to be stopped, it may provide early indicators of how the agency is revising its approach to mega-corporations consolidating multiple industries with acquisitions like this one.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition was announced last month, and the addition of MGM&#8217;s 4,000 films and 17,000 shows to the Amazon library would be a potent shot in the arm for Prime Video, which like the Amazon storefront itself is meant to be its customers&#8217; default go-to for on-demand media.</p>

<p>As rights change hands and companies shift tactics, the landscape of streaming is ever-changing; while Netflix has focused on original content (and Amazon is not far behind) and Disney has its own stable of standbys, others have begun snapping up the disparate collections of shows and movies that make up the streaming industry&#8217;s lucrative long tail.</p>
<p>Yet there is a valid question among regulators of whether content companies like MGM should be owned by platforms like Amazon. As an independent producer of films and TV, a company can secure its own licensing deals and operate in direct competition with similar businesses. As a subsidiary of Amazon, it would likely be in large part reduced to an in-house production company for the retail and web giant, not competing on the merits of its products but as part of a multi-industry empire.</p>
<p>FTC Chair Lina Khan — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">appointed just last week</a> — has been among the foremost critics of the latter business model. Her now famous &#8220;Amazon&#8217;s Antitrust Paradox&#8221; paper asserted that Amazon uses dominance in one industry, like AWS in web hosting, to shore up other less successful arms, like its nascent delivery service. If the latter would fail without the support of the former, the argument (roughly) goes, the company is potentially engaging in anti-competitive behavior enabled by market power.</p>
<p>That the market power and the behavior are in different verticals excused it under the antitrust doctrine of the recent era (so long as consumers didn&#8217;t see price increases), but Khan aimed to challenge that doctrine with her paper — and now, as one of the most powerful regulators in the country, she has been given the chance to shape it firsthand.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Biden elevates tech antitrust crusader Lina Khan to FTC chair&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/embed/#?secret=2ccrSKF8c7" data-secret="2ccrSKF8c7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Such large deals are always reviewed by federal authorities, and in this case the FTC is reportedly in charge, probably because it has already taken on the role of antitrust investigation into Amazon in other circumstances. It&#8217;s also handling Facebook (which it has tangled with repeatedly over the years), while the agency&#8217;s enforcement partners at the Justice Department took charge of looking into Google and Apple. (The FTC declined to comment, saying it does not confirm the existence of investigations.)</p>
<p>In this case it seems unlikely that the Amazon purchase of MGM will be blocked, seeing as there is certainly real competition in the space and MGM has not been able to make its own way — a sale is almost inevitable. But the review will take place nonetheless, and it will likely elucidate how the FTC has changed its approach to this type of merger.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s entirely possible that even in a light-touch approval of this deal there will be opportunity to see new doctrine in play; for example, Amazon&#8217;s arguably monopolistic position in ostensibly unrelated markets is likely to take a greater role than under previous FTC leadership. It may even set the stage for more comprehensive and aggressive reviews to come, or perhaps even rewinding previously approved mergers, something Chair Khan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/lina-khans-timely-tech-skepticism-makes-for-a-refreshingly-friendly-ftc-confirmation-hearing/">has said is a distinct possibility</a>.</p>

<p>This week, China started staffing up its own space station, and Rocket Lab got the nod from NASA to develop small satellites for the purposes of exploring Mars. Meanwhile, space startups continue to raise money and it doesn&#8217;t look like the pace of that is going to slow much heading into summer.</p>
<h2>China delivers 3 astronauts to its space station</h2>

<p>China has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/china-launches-3-astronauts-to-its-new-space-station-core-module/">launched astronauts to its space station for the first time</a>, delivering three to the station&#8217;s core module, where they&#8217;ll remain for a mission that lasts until September. This is the first time China has flown a crewed mission since 2012, and it&#8217;s also going to set a record for the longest period of time a Chinese astronaut has remained in space continuously.</p>
<p>This will be a big step forward for China&#8217;s space program, and a key evolution of its ambitions to establish a continuous presence in low Earth orbit. China is not an International Space Station partner, and no Chinese nationals have ever set foot aboard that station. The European Space Agency had welcomed overtures for them to participate as a member nation in the ISS last decade, but the U.S. refused.</p>
<p>China has stated outright that it will welcome participation in its space station from foreign astronauts, though there hasn&#8217;t been any specific agreements put in place for who those might be, or from which countries.</p>

<p>Rocket Lab has landed a contract of a different sort from its usual business, tapped to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/rocket-lab-to-design-two-orbital-spacecraft-for-nasa-to-study-mars/">build small spacecraft that will go to Mars</a> and perform valuable science and exploration missions on behalf of NASA and its partners. These will make use of Rocket Lab&#8217;s Photon platform, which is a satellite platform that it originally developed as one of its value-add offerings for its launch customers.</p>
<p>This is unique for Rocket Lab because the spacecraft it&#8217;s developing won&#8217;t be launched aboard a Rocket Lab Electron spacecraft, but instead will fly on a commercial rocket to be selected by NASA in a separate contract process that will happen later.</p>
<p>The goal is to have these fly to the red planet by 2024, and it&#8217;ll help support NASA&#8217;s deep space exploration ambitions more broadly.</p>

<p>Some interesting funding rounds this week, including<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/hydrosat-raises-5m-seed-round-to-deliver-ground-temperature-data-to-customers/"> $5 million for Hydrosat,</a> a company that&#8217;s spotting ground temperature from space and providing that to customers for use in industries like agriculture, wildfire and drought risk, water table information and more.</p>
<p>This kind of data has been monitored by weather and environmental monitoring agencies in the past, but Hydrosat aims to collect it at a frequency that hasn&#8217;t been possible before.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another startup whose entire focus is making sure that companies and other users on the ground can make use of Earth observation data also raised a chunk of cash. SkyWatch picked up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/skywatch-raises-17-2m-for-its-earth-observation-data-platform/">$17.2 million to help expand its platform</a>, which not only provides access to the data for customers, but can actually provide the customers themselves, a useful feature for brand new satellite companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon commands a vast, dominating empire in the world of e-commerce. While its marketplace has proved a boon for businesses trying to get off the ground, many of the more successful companies are now looking beyond the e-commerce giant&#8217;s fences, spurred by a desire to compete on their own terms.</p>
<p>This trend has mushroomed as online shopping burgeoned over the past five years. Businesses such as mattress maker<a href="http://casper.com"> Casper</a>, men&#8217;s personal care brands<a href="https://www.harrys.com"> Harry&#8217;s</a> and<a href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/"> Dollar Shave Club</a>, footwear and apparel makers<a href="https://www.allbirds.com/"> Allbirds</a> and<a href="https://www.zaful.com/"> Zaful</a>, gadget store<a href="https://www.banggood.com/"> Banggood</a>, and power-bank maker<a href="https://us.anker.com/"> Anker</a> are just a few of the multitude of brands that choose to leverage their own web stores, social media presence and supply chains to build their business and identity without having a marketplace like Amazon get in the way.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Every investor and e-commerce exporter we spoke with noted the genius of Shein&#8217;s supply chain management.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><a href="https://us.shein.com/">Shein</a>, an online-only apparel store that sells the latest in fashion at very affordable prices, is a shining example of this trend. It&#8217;s a rage among budget-conscious young adults across Europe, Asia and the Americas: The app was downloaded 14 million times in the United States in March, according to Apptopia, and currently<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/shein-overtakes-amazon/?tpcc=ECTW2020"> dominates the shopping category in app stores</a> in over 50 countries.</p>
<p>Its success is proof of its belief in bringing the latest trends to the masses as quickly as it can. In the past couple of decades, brands like Zara, H&amp;M and Forever 21 earned themselves the &#8220;fast fashion&#8221; moniker when they turned the tables on global behemoths such as Gap and Calvin Klein by drastically shortening lead times — the time it takes for clothing to reach the store floor from the designer&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>Shein takes this fast fashion mindset one step further: While brands like Zara and H&amp;M take about three to four weeks to bring clothing from the ramp to the store, Shein uses a combination of real-time customer and predictive analytics, hyperaware fashion designers and an extremely quick and agile supply chain based in China to bring the latest fashion trends from Instagram, Facebook, Reddit and TikTok to its online store in just a week or two.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
