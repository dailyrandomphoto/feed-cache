										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Istanbul in Turkey continues to prove itself as very fertile ground for casual gaming startups, which appear to be growing from small seedlings into sizable trees. In the latest development, <a href="https://dreamgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dream Games</a> &#8212; a developer of mobile puzzle games &#8212; has raised $155 million in funding, a Series B that values the startup at $1 billion.</p>
<p>This is a massive leap for the company, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/28/istanbuls-dream-games-snaps-up-50m-and-launches-its-first-game-the-puzzle-based-royal-match/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $50 million</a> (the largest Series A in Turkey&#8217;s startup history) only 3.5 months ago. This latest round is being co-led by Index Ventures and Makers Fund, with Balderton Capital, IVP and Kora also participating. It also comes in the wake of a bigger set of deals in the world of gaming and developers in Turkey, the most prominent of which saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/zynga-acquires-turkeys-peak-games-for-1-8b-after-buying-its-card-games-studio-for-100m-in-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zynga acquire Peak Games for $1.8 billion</a>, amid other acquisitions. Dream is one of several startups in the region founded by alums from Peak.</p>
<p>The focus of the funding, and currently of Dream Games itself, is Royal Match, a puzzle game (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/royal-match/id1482155847" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dreamgames.royalmatch&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>) that launched globally in March.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The game has been a huge hit for Dream, with 6 million monthly active users and $20 million/month in revenues from in-game purchases (not ads), according to figures from AppAnnie. (A source close to the company confirmed the figures are accurate, but Dream did not disclose its revenue numbers or revenues directly.) This has catapulted it into the top-20 grossing games categories in the U.S., U.K., and Germany, the same echelon as much older and bigger titles like Candy Crush and Homescapes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The funding will be used for heavy user acquisition in every channel and every geography,&#8221; Soner Aydemir, co-founder and CEO, Dream Games, told me in an interview. He said Asia would be a focus in that, specifically Japan, South Korea and China. &#8220;Our main target is to scale the game so that it becomes one of the biggest games in the global market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The world of mobile gaming has in many respects been a very cyclical and fickle one: today&#8217;s hot title becomes tomorrow&#8217;s has-been, while for developers, they can go through dozens of development processes and launches (and related costs) before they find a hit, if they find a hit. The role of app-install ads and other marketing tools to juice numbers has also been a problematic lever for growth: take away the costs of running those and often the house of cards falls apart.</p>
<p>Aydemir agrees, and while the company <em>will</em> be investing in those aforementioned in-game ads to encourage more downloads of Royal Flush, he also said that this strategy can work, but only if the fundamentals of the game are solid, as is the case here.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don’t have good enough metrics, even with all the money in the world it’s impossible to scale,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But our LTV [lifetime value] is high, and so we think it can be scaled in a sustainable way because of the quality of the game. It always depends on the product.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to its huge growth, Dream has taken a very focused approach with Royal Flush, working on it for years before finally releasing it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We spent so much time on tiny details, so many tests over several years to create the dynamics of the game,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we also have a feel for it,&#8221; he added, referring to the team&#8217;s previous lives at Peak Games. &#8220;Our users really appreciate this approach.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For now, too, the focus will just one the one game, he said. Why not two, I asked?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We believe in Pixar’s approach,&#8221; Aydemir said. &#8220;When Pixar started, it was very low frequency, a movie every 2-3 years but eventually the rate increased. And it will be similar for us. This year we need to focus on Royal Match but if we can find a way to create other games, we will.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He added that the challenge &#8212; one that many startups know all too well &#8212; is that building a new product, in this case a new game, can take the focus away when you are a small team and also working on sustaining and maintaining a current game. &#8220;That is the most difficult and challenging part. If we can manage it we will be successful; otherwise we will fail because our business model is basically creating new IP.&#8221; He added that it&#8217;s likely that another game will be released out into the world at the beginning of next year.</span></p>
<p>The focus, in any case, was one of the selling points for its investors. “The Dream Games team’s deep genre insight, laser-focus on detail and team chemistry has helped create the early success of Royal Match,” said Michael Cheung, General Partner at Makers Fund, in a statement. “We&#8217;re excited to be on the journey with them as they grow Royal Match globally.”</p>
<p>In terms of monetization, Dream Games is pretty firmly in the camp of &#8220;no ads, just in-app purchases,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It’s really bad for user experience and we only care about user experience, so if you put ads in, it conflicts with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the struggles of building new while improving old product will of course get solved with this cash, and the subsequent hiring that Dream Games can do (and it&#8217;s doing a lot of that, judging by the careers section of its website). As more startups emerge out of the country &#8212; not just in gaming but also areas like e-commerce, where startups like Getir are for example making big waves in instant grocery delivery &#8212; it will be interesting to see how that bigger talent pool evolves.</p>
<p>“Since its launch in early March, Royal Match has become one of the top casual puzzle titles globally, driven by once in a decade retention metrics. It speaks to the sheer quality of the title that the Dream Games team has built and the flawless polish and execution across the board,” commented Stephane Kurgan, venture partner at Index Ventures and former COO of King. Index is also the backer of Roblox, Discord, King and Supercell, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise API security startup Noname Security has raised a $60 million Series B funding round, just six months after closing $37 million at Series A.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The round was led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/insight-partners/">Insight Partners</a> with Next47, Forgepoint, and The Syndicate Group (TSG) also participating, and brings Noname’s total funding to $85 million since emerging from stealth in December 2020.</p>
<p>The startup, which currently has a 70-strong workforce and offices in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv, says it raised rapidly due to the fact the pandemic has fueled a growing dependence on APIs. Naturally, this proliferation of APIs has led to an increase in the number of API security incidents. Earlier this year, for example, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/experian/">Experian</a> API exposed the credit scores of nearly every American with one, and just weeks later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">a leaky Peloton API allowed anyone to grab users’ private account data</a> directly from the company&#8217;s servers. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/facebook-phone-numbers-exposed/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/supreme-court-revives-linkedin-bid-to-protect-user-data-from-web-scrapers/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/echelon-leaky-api-riders-account-data/">Echelon</a>, and Clubhouse have also fallen victim to scraping attacks that abuse access to APIs to pull in data about users on their platforms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The need for API security was so strong and got super emphasized during the pandemic,&#8221; <span class="Apple-converted-space">Oz Golan, CEO of Noname, tells TechCrunch. &#8220;</span>We want to help organizations to leverage APIs securely, and we want to eliminate all of the API vulnerabilities out there. We don’t want another Experian incident.”</p>
<p>The Silicon Valley startup provides a holistic security platform that uses AI and machine learning to enable enterprises to see and secure managed and unmanaged APIs exposed by the organization, consumed by the organization, or used internally, thereby eliminating the API security blind spots. The majority of these flaws often go unnoticed for years, according to Noname, giving anyone who can find them unfettered access to an organization’s most sensitive operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even seasoned security professionals often have no idea how exposed their systems are,&#8221; Golan says.</p>
<p>In its six months since launch, the startup has amassed 40 technology, reseller, and channel partners, as well as &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of enterprise customers either in production or trialing the platform.</p>
<p>“Because of the huge traction that we have seen, we want to accelerate &#8211; expanding our sales team, marketing team, customer success, R&amp;D. Basically growth, growth, growth,” says Golan, who previously served as director of engineering at NSO Group.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Commenting on the funding round, Thomas Krane, principal at Insight Partners — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/13/cyber-security-training-platform-immersive-labs-closes-75m-series-c-led-by-insight-partners/">which recently led a $75m Series C funding round</a> in cybersecurity skills platform Immersive Labs — said: “The surging volume of APIs and the growing complexity of modern applications has led to an increase in cybersecurity obstacles. Noname came to market at just the right time with a fully realized, next-gen technology that’s making a big impact with global customers.”</p>
<p>API security is a hot ticket for investors right now. Last month, London-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/42crunch">42Crunch</a> raised a $17 million Series A, and just weeks later California-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/saltsecurity">Salt Security</a> closed a $70 million Series C — bringing the total amount of funding the company has raised in the last year to $120 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce marketplaces continue to play a major role in how consumers buy goods online and how retailers show off and sell goods to those consumers, accounting globally for <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/871/online-shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47% of all e-commerce sales</a>. But today, one of the startups that has built technology to help retailers build and run more direct relationships &#8212; by way of zippy websites of their own &#8212; is announcing a big round of growth funding, a sign that the marketplace model is not for everyone, and that those catering to those retailers are finding traction.</p>
<p><a href="https://getshogun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shogun</a> &#8212; a platform to help e-commerce businesses of all sizes built on platforms like Shopify, Magento and BigCommerce easily design and run their own responsive storefronts &#8212; has raised $67.5 million. This Series C values Shogun at $575 million, a &#8220;nice markup&#8221; on its previous valuation, said Finbarr Taylor, the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, in an interview.</p>
<p>He added that the capital will be used both to continue building out its two main products &#8212; <a href="https://getshogun.com/page-builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Page Builder</a>, a drag-and-drop page builder for Shopify merchants; and <a href="https://getshogun.com/frontend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shogun Frontend</a>, an end-to-end headless commerce solution &#8212; as well as business development, and to build out new tech, specifically in areas like first-party data and personalization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We want to help companies build a destination where they can control the experience,&#8221; he said, comparing it to the physical world and the difference between Nike shoes sold at the brand&#8217;s own store versus at a big retailer like Walmart. &#8220;In a Nike store you can design an experience. In Walmart you cannot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Led by Insight Partners &#8212; a new investor in the startup &#8212; it also included Initialized Capital, Accel and VMG Partners. Accel led Shogun&#8217;s previous round &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/shogun-raises-35m-to-help-brands-take-on-amazon-with-faster-and-better-sites-of-their-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$35 million Series B</a> &#8212; announced less than a year ago, in October 2020. The startup has now raised $114.5 million.</p>
<p>The hike in valuation, and the rapid succession of its fundraises, are two signs of how Shogun has been doing in the last eight months &#8212; a time when e-commerce has continued to perform strongly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Another is the company&#8217;s actual growth based on the idea of making front-end tools that used to be cost-prohibitive into something affordable for even the smallest merchant.</p>
<p>One of the selling points for Shogun up to now has been that pages and sites built on its platform run fast: a very key detail in the world of e-commerce where shopping cart abandonment is rife and often hinges on how long people have to wait for something to load.</p>
<p>Page Builder &#8212; the mass-market, drag-and-drop site builder for those creating sites on top of Shopify &#8212; is now used by around 20,000 business, Taylor said, ranging from small startups through to Fortune 500 companies, with customers including brands like K-Swiss, Leesa, Rumpl, BeardBrand, MVMT and Fila. He said that merchants collectively are seeing GMV (gross merchandise value, or total amount sold) in the &#8220;billions of dollars&#8221; through their sites.</p>
<p>(For a point of reference, Shogun told me it had 15,000 customers back in October; growing 5,000 in the last eight months is the same amount of growth as last year.)</p>
<p>Shogun&#8217;s newer product, Frontend, designed for mid-market to enterprise customers and positioned as a &#8220;headless&#8221; solution aimed more at web designers and others building more customized experiences, now has hundreds of customers and grew . &#8220;Apple&#8217;s site is beautiful, but it cost millions to make,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;We want anyone to be able to build those exceptional e-commerce experiences.&#8221; Frontend has grown 10x in the last year, Taylor said.</p>
<p>GMV across all of Shogun&#8217;s business grew by 255% in the last two years.</p>
<p>The rise of services like Shogun&#8217;s underscores a swing we have seen among e-commerce companies that are looking for a more autonomy and control in how they engage with customers. Sites like Amazon have long been seen as a way to tap into a large population of shoppers, as well as solid fulfillment and shipping infrastructure to store, package, distribute and deliver products.</p>
<p>There has even been a sharp rise in &#8220;roll-up&#8221; plays like Thrasio to help consolidate merchants on these platforms to leverage even better economies of scale on details like marketing, customer analytics and manufacturing, which marketplaces like Amazon do not (yet?) handle.</p>
<p>But none of that still replaces the ability to set your own destiny.</p>
<p>Now, the rise of services like Shopify, BigCommerce and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/spryker-raises-130m-at-a-500m-valuation-to-provide-b2bs-with-agile-e-commerce-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spryker</a> (also backed by Insight Partners) to help manage the backend; Stripe, PayPal and others to manage payments; and others like ShipBob to manage the logistics, have made it increasingly less difficult to build and run your own online experience. That takes on a stronger priority as your business grows, but even for smaller merchants, the idea of controlling your own customer experience is a compelling one.</p>
<p>Services like Shogun (and others like fit into that latter trend, such as Squarespace or Wix but also others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/duda-a-wordpress-rival-raises-50m-to-help-agencies-and-bigger-companies-build-better-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duda</a>), which give merchants the tools to build their own e-commerce experiences as they would like them to look, are the front ends for that strategy. Opting to take the &#8220;headless&#8221; commerce approach, apparently, is an <a href="https://www.yottaa.com/resources/2020-ecommerce-leaders-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing trend</a>.</p>
<p>And that individualism is also where Shogun plans to double down and build more tools for its users, Taylor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about direct relationships with customers,&#8221; he said, pointing out that newer changes in privacy regulation and cookies going away mean retailers can no longer rely on third-party platforms as they used to. &#8220;It&#8217;s about<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> first party relationships. The future is way more personalized shopping online.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>That vision is also what interested investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our investment in Shogun underscores the market’s desire to see headless commerce become merchant-focused,&#8221; said Matt Gatto, managing director at Insight Ventures, in a statement. “More brands want to be able to build headless progressive web apps in a low-code environment. Those on the forefront of e-commerce want to enable web teams to build truly unique, memorable shopping experiences. Shogun is well positioned to make flexible frontends accessible to brands in a whole new way, and we’re excited to be a partner in this journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When former Art Director Zac Duff started teaching a game development course online in 2015, he faced the same challenges that teachers around the globe have become all too familiar with after a pandemic-induced lockdown. So, he used his experience in 3D design to build a virtual reality classroom to make remote learning more engaging for his students. Instead of entering yet another Zoom lecture, the school gave students VR headsets to transport themselves to the Ancient Greek-inspired classroom that Duff built.</p>
<p>Still, Duff knew that this learning model couldn&#8217;t be easily scaled &#8212; most schools don&#8217;t have VR headsets to send out, and most teachers don&#8217;t have over a decade of game design experience to whip up a classroom with green fields and butterflies (yes, Duff made that). But he saw that there was potential for a user-friendly program that lets anyone create 3D presentations and share information in AR.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right at the center of it is knowledge transfer. It&#8217;s about one person giving knowledge to another person in a really effective way,&#8221; Duff told TechCrunch. He referenced products like Microsoft Powerpoint and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/canva-raises-60-million-on-a-6-billion-valuation/">Canva</a>, which make it easy for the average user to create presentations and graphics that communicate their ideas. &#8220;We have those systems in 2D, but in 3D, we just didn&#8217;t have it, and it was a really complex, expensive technical process that you had to go through to build anything, and that stuck with me.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2171554" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171554" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2171554" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/JigSpace-Product_Workshop_Harvester.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="397" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/JigSpace-Product_Workshop_Harvester.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/JigSpace-Product_Workshop_Harvester.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/JigSpace-Product_Workshop_Harvester.png?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/JigSpace-Product_Workshop_Harvester.png?resize=768,449 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/JigSpace-Product_Workshop_Harvester.png?resize=680,397 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/JigSpace-Product_Workshop_Harvester.png?resize=1536,897 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/JigSpace-Product_Workshop_Harvester.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171554" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> JigSpace</p></div></p>
<p>Soon after, Duff took a Friday off from work to outline the company that would become <a href="https://jig.space/">JigSpace</a>, which is poised to set the standard for knowledge-sharing in 3D. After launching in 2017, the JigSpace platform now has over 4 million users with a 4.8 average rating on the App Store. When you download the JigSpace app, you can interact in AR with 3D models that show how to fix a leaky sink, repair a dry wall, or even build a Lego Star Wars spacecraft. There are also educational models, or Jigs, that show how a piano works, the anatomy of the human eye, and even how the coronavirus spreads. The potential use cases for JigSpace are expansive &#8212; Duff says he hopes to work with manufacturing companies to have them make Jigs of their products. That way, let&#8217;s say you want to replace your AC filter, you can look at a 3D model in AR, rather than a black and white 2D drawing in an instruction booklet.</p>
<p>Today, JigSpace announced that it raised $4.7 million in Series A funding led by Rampersand, with Investible and new investors including Vulpes, and Roger Allen AM, also participating. The JigSpace app is free to use, and anyone can combine presets and templates of 3D modeled objects to create their own Jigs &#8212; the more tech savvy among us can upload up to 30 MB of files to make more customized Jigs on the free version. But the money-maker for Jigspace is its Jig Pro platform, which is designed for commercial businesses and manufacturers. <a href="https://jig.space/jigpro.html">Jig Pro</a>&#8216;s subscription for individuals is $49 per month, while the price of the enterprise offering isn&#8217;t listed online.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171556" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171556" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2171556" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Landscape_JigSpace-Founders_Numa-Bertron-L-Zac-Duff-R.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Landscape_JigSpace-Founders_Numa-Bertron-L-Zac-Duff-R.jpeg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Landscape_JigSpace-Founders_Numa-Bertron-L-Zac-Duff-R.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Landscape_JigSpace-Founders_Numa-Bertron-L-Zac-Duff-R.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Landscape_JigSpace-Founders_Numa-Bertron-L-Zac-Duff-R.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Landscape_JigSpace-Founders_Numa-Bertron-L-Zac-Duff-R.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Landscape_JigSpace-Founders_Numa-Bertron-L-Zac-Duff-R.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171556" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> JigSpace</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The best area for us has been in durable manufacturing, because almost all manufacturing products have CAD files, so the 3D already exists,&#8221; said Duff. &#8220;Then, we&#8217;re able to work with those companies to give them the tools to create knowledge material around their products.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right after JigSpace launched its Pro version, it was featured in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/snapchat-among-first-to-leverage-iphone-12-pros-lidar-scanner-for-ar/">Apple&#8217;s iPhone 12 Keynote</a>, demonstrating how the iPhone 12&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/iphones-can-now-tell-blind-users-where-and-how-far-away-people-are/">LiDAR scanner</a> and 5G capabilities could be used to save time and money in manufacturing. JigSpace also partnered with Snapchat to create a Lens that allows you to scan kitchen items to reveal 3D Jigs that show how stuff works, from your microwave to your coffee maker.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6RzVz88PsQk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Jig Pro&#8217;s customer base has grown 40% month-on-month since it launched in mid-2020, with the average user logging into the app at least once per day. Companies like Verizon, Volkswagen, Medtronic, and Thermo Fisher Scientific use JigSpace to develop 3D models to present to stakeholders, customers, and remote colleagues. Especially as products like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apples-realitykit-2-allows-developers-to-create-3d-models-for-ar-using-iphone-photos/">Apple&#8217;s Capture</a> emerge, it will become even easier for people to import their own 3D models into JigSpace.</p>
<p>Despite its commercial potential, it&#8217;s important to Duff that JigSpace always retains a free version that makes learning through AR easy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make sure that all of the people with information they want to share, those are the people we serve, not just the technical people at the top,&#8221; Duff says. &#8220;From the beginning, my co-founder Numa Bertron and I always wanted to have a free version. Knowledge should be accessible to people in the best way possible, and there&#8217;s no reason why it shouldn&#8217;t be.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turntide Technologies, a sustainable technology developer, has announced $225 million in convertible note financing that it says will help fund projects to reduce carbon emissions in the commercial buildings, agriculture and transportation industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board led the round, along with Monashee Capital Inc. and current investor JLL Spark. Other participating investors include Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Millennium Management and Suvretta Capital Management, bringing Turntide’s total funding to $400 million. Convertible note financing is short-term debt that will convert to equity in the form of shares of preferred stock which Turntide says will happen at a future determined valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The addition of a major national pension fund fortifies Turntide with permanent capital as we expand into new markets like electrified transport,” said Ryan Morris, Turntide’s chairman and CEO, in a statement.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Turntide announced the acquisition of Hyperdrive Innovation and BorgWarner Gateshead and </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/turntide-technologies-extends-its-smart-motor-system-to-transportation-sector-with-acquisition-of-electric-vehicle-technology-301307377.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the subsequent launch of Turntide Transport</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Using the drivetrain tech from those two U.K.-based companies, this division of Turntide is focused on modernizing legacy motor systems in the commercial transportation industry such as those found in construction equipment, high-speed rail, autonomous robots, freight trucking and shipping and air cargo. The fresh funds will also go towards Turntide Transport’s goal of creating a “one-stop powertrain platform that includes battery pack, power electronics, motor, and connected intelligence,” according to the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says its so-called “Smart Motor System” reduces energy consumption by nearly 64%, and will address the need for sustainably electrifying more challenging markets than passenger vehicles, where most of the progress has been made to date.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turntide says it is working with brands such as JCB, Hitachi Rail and Volkswagen’s MAN division to further develop a motor that doesn’t use environmentally damaging rare earth materials, and that can achieve net zero climate goals, which also makes it cheaper to produce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $225 million will also finance the development of a cloud-based software platform that the company expects to be released this year. The platform will integrate the Smart Motor System into different built environments and electric vehicles in a way that’s user friendly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Turntide’s technology combines a redesigned electric motor wrapped in intelligent automation with cloud connectivity to dramatically improve the efficiency of building controls, electric vehicles, and agriculture,” Morris told TechCrunch. “Today, half of the world’s energy is used by electric motors and nearly half of that energy consumption is being wasted due to inefficiency and lack of intelligent controls.” </span></p>

The Google Ads [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">more expansive, post-Brexit role</a> in digital regulation continues to be felt today via a <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/united-kingdom/further-measures-help-fight-financial-fraud-uk/">policy change</a> by Google which has announced that it will, in the near future, only run ads for financial products and services when the advertiser in question has been verified by the financial watchdog, the FCA.</p>
<p>The Google Ads Financial Products and Services policy will be updated from August 30, per Google, which specifies that it will start enforcing the new policy from September 6 &#8212; meaning that purveyors of online financial scams who&#8217;ve been relying on its ad network to net their next victim still have more than two months to harvest unsuspecting clicks before the party is over (well, in the UK, anyway).</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s decision to allow only regulator authorized financial entities to run ads for financial products &amp; services follows warnings from the Financial Conduct Authority that it may take legal action if Google continued to accept unscreened financial ads, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/14/uk-regulator-warns-google-about-accepting-scam-adverts">the Guardian</a> reported earlier.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The FCA told a parliamentary committee this month that it&#8217;s able to contemplate taking such action as a result of no longer being bound by European Union rules on financial adverts, which do not extend to online platforms, per the newspaper&#8217;s report.</p>
<p>Until gaining the power to go after Google itself, the FCA appears to have been trying to combat the scourge of online financial fraud by paying Google large amounts of UK taxpayer money to fight scams with anti-scam warnings.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/18/fca_google_ad_refund/">the Register</a>, the FCA paid Google more than £600,000 (~$830k) in 2020 and 2021 to run &#8216;anti-scam&#8217; ads &#8212; with the regulator essentially engaged in a bidding war with scammers to pour enough money into Google&#8217;s coffers so that regulator warnings about financial scams might appear higher than the scams themselves.</p>
<p>The full-facepalm situation was presumably highly lucrative for Google. But the threat of legal action appears to have triggered a policy rethink.</p>
<p>Writing in its <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/united-kingdom/further-measures-help-fight-financial-fraud-uk/">blog post</a>, Ronan Harris, a VP and MD for Google UK &amp; Ireland, said: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Financial services advertisers will be required to demonstrate that they are authorised by the UK Financial Conduct Authority or qualify for one of the limited exemptions described in the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/10770884" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/10770884&quot;}">UK Financial Services verification page</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;This new update builds on significant work in partnership with the FCA over the last 18 months to help tackle this issue,&#8221; he added. &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Today’s announcement reflects significant progress in delivering a safer experience for users, publishers and advertisers. While we understand that this policy update will impact a range of advertisers in the financial services space, our utmost priority is to keep users safe on our platforms &#8212; particularly in an area so disproportionately targeted by fraudsters.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s blog also claims that it has pledged $5M in advertising credits to support financial fraud public awareness campaigns in the UK. So not $5M in actual money then.</p>
<p>Per the Register, Google did offer to refund the FCA&#8217;s anti-scam ad spend &#8212; but, again, with advertising credits.</p>
<p>The UK parliament&#8217;s Treasury Committee was keen to know whether the tech giant would be refunding the spend in cash. But the FCA&#8217;s director of enforcement and market insight, Mark Steward, was unable to confirm what it would do, according to the Register&#8217;s report of the committee hearing.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the FCA for comment on Google&#8217;s policy change, and with questions about the refund situation, and will update this report with any response.</p>
<p>In recent years the financial watchdog has also been concerned about financial scam ads running on social media platforms.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/23/facebook-hit-with-defamation-lawsuit-over-fake-ads/">2018</a>, legal action by a well-known UK consumer advice personality, Martin Lewis &#8212; who filed a defamation suit against Facebook &#8212; led the social media giant to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/facebook-agrees-to-do-more-to-tackle-scam-ads-after-celebrity-defamation-lawsuit/">add a &#8216;report scam ad&#8217; button</a> in the market as of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/16/uk-facebook-users-now-have-a-tool-to-report-scam-ads/">July 2019</a>.</p>
<p>However research by consumer group, Which?, earlier this year, suggested that neither Facebook nor Google had entirely purged financial scam ads &#8212; even when they&#8217;d been reported.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56888693">BBC</a>, Which?&#8217;s survey found that Google had failed to remove around a third (34%) of the scam adverts reported to it vs Facebook failing to remove well over a fifth (26%).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost like the incentives for online ad giants to act against lucrative online scam ads simply aren&#8217;t pressing enough&#8230;</p>
<p>More recently, Lewis has been pushing for scam ads to be included in the scope of the UK&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">Online Safety Bill</a>.</p>
<p>The sweeping piece of digital regulation aims to tackle a plethora of so-called &#8216;online harms&#8217; by focusing on regulating user generated content. However Lewis makes the point that a scammer merely needs to pay an ad platform to promote their fraudulent content for it to escape the scope of the planned rules, telling the <em>Good Morning Britain </em>TV program today that the situation is &#8220;ludicrous&#8221; and &#8220;needs to change&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#39;It&#39;s ludicrous. It needs to change.&#39;<a href="https://twitter.com/MartinSLewis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MartinSLewis</a> calls for changes to be made to the Online Safety Bill to include the policing of scam adverts.</p>
<p>Dame Margaret Hodge agrees with Martin as she highlights that only 1% of police money and time is spent on tackling fraud. <a href="https://t.co/PKI9obagmw">pic.twitter.com/PKI9obagmw</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Good Morning Britain (@GMB) <a href="https://twitter.com/GMB/status/1410128951905767431?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly a confusing carve-out, as we reported at the time the bill was presented. Nor is it the only confusing component of the planned legislation. However on the financial fraud point the government may believe the FCA has the necessary powers to tackle the problem.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve contacted the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is no secret that healthcare in Nigeria and most parts of Africa is not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available and a lot of work needs to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be done in that regard</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are instances where accessibility is taken for granted. Take f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or instance Nigeria where a majority of the population with some form of healthcare access would rather treat diseases than prevent them in the first place</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, people get to find out about life-threatening diseases, especially non-communicable ones (NCDs), much later in their lives</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to diagnostics and preventive care is key to addressing this situation, and Nigerian-based diagnostic startup <a href="https://www.mdaas.io/">MDaaS Global</a> is keen on making these services readily accessible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the startup also announcing the launch of its product <a href="https://www.sentinelx.io/">SentinelX</a>, has closed a seed extension round of $2.3 million to scale across Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MDaaS, an abbreviation for medical devices-as-a-service, started back in 2016. It operates a network of tech-enabled diagnostic centers across Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago, it raised <a href="https://www.mdaas.io/blog/seedround">a million-dollar seed round</a>. And i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the other investments secured over the last five years, the healthtech startup has raised a total of $3.7 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investors in the round include lead</span><a href="https://www.newtownpartners.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Newtown Partners</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> who invested via its Imperial Venture Fund, </span><a href="https://crifoundation.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRI Foundation, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and return investors</span><a href="https://fincaventures.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> FINCA Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Techstars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span> <a href="https://future.africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future Africa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for MDaaS came when co-founder and CEO Oluwasoga Oni was tasked alongside his classmates at an MIT class </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to develop an idea that could impact a billion lives</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Coming from a medical background, he chose the one he could relate to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wanted to solve the problem close to me and my dad in my early years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had a 30-bed hospital and struggled so hard to find medical equipment that was good for him and also at a good rate,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oni started MDaaS with Opeyemi Ologun, Genevieve Barnard Oni, and Joseph McCord. With their connections in the U.S., the founders began connecting secondary medical equipment marketplace in the U.S. to Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They would import equipment, provide service support, and deploy to hospitals via rent, lease, or outright sale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders did this for a while until they realized that the core problem wasn&#8217;t providing equipment pieces; it was a matter of necessity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money doctors spent on the pieces of equipment was more than the earnings from patients. Therefore it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn&#8217;t make financial sense for doctors to own the equipment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MDaaS decided to revert to an aggregation model where they would look at a clinically underserved area</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, build a centralized diagnostic center, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> demand from small, medium-sized hospitals within that community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They launched the first center in the Nigerian southwestern city of Ibadan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> got into Techstars and has since added six other centers across other cities in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MDaaS diagnostic centers offer a wide range of services. First, there are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> imaging services such as digital x-ray and ultrasound, cardiac services such as ECG and echo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then the lab services ranging from chemistry analysis and immunoassay to hematology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how did SentinelX come about? Oni tells me that it was during the pandemic last year. As </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MDaaS helped out with testing for COVID in patients, it was also taking time to screen for underlying health conditions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We didn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> find a lot of people that had COVID, but what we found was that a lot of people had underlying conditions like high blood pressure and high cholesterol that they didn&#8217;t know about</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So we were really shocked about that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past two decades, NCDs have risen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dramatically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in sub-Saharan Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are driven by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a growing incidence of cardiovascular risk factors like unhealthy diets, reduced physical activity, hypertension, and diabetes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Statistics point out that by 2030, NCDs are set to become the leading cause of mortality on the continent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, MDaaS has done a reasonably good job with its diagnostic centers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, the healthcare startup has provided diagnostic services to over 40,000 patients in underserved communities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has also performed over 80,000 diagnostics tests across cardiology, radiology, neurology, laboratory, and general health checks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 750 clinicians use its referral network, and it has locked partnerships with more than 500 health facilities and 10 HMO networks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, building SentinelX on the infrastructure already put in place serves as an opportunity to provide more customer-centric products for its users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform acts as a personalized care program where patients pay a one-time fee of N35k (~$70) and access a doctor all year round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, users can run through a series of tests ranging from 60 or 70 biomarkers to assess individual risk for a wide range of diseases, including cancers, diabetes, kidney disease, and heart diseases</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clinical and family history and demographic data are also taken into consideration as part of the comprehensive analysis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, MDaaS creates a care plan unique to customers should they have health concerns after screening</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SentinelX is currently in private beta. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the plan is to go live in September 2021. One would argue that $70 for a year might be cheap for this kind of service, Oni concurs but says</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it&#8217;s all about the long game for MDaaS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to solve is non-consumption. Most</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people in Nigeria don&#8217;t go for annual screening, which is something meant to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">routinely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Instead, what</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we tend to have in Nigeria is that people wait till they get sick before going for checkups. By that time, it costs so much money to solve the problem,&#8221; Oni echoes on the lackadaisical effort some Nigerians place on their health</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through SentinelX, MDaaS is trying to get as many people as possible to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheaply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pre-screen themselves for one year then pay for full value the next year after seeing the benefits of regular checkups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The service is one of many MDaaS can deploy on top of its diagnostic infrastructure built over the years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But getting to this point meant the startup had to scale through the capital-intensive hurdle associated with infrastructural plays</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Moreover, defining</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what price to charge patients has even become more challenging due to the economic recession that has frequently plagued Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have had to get very creative in the way we build things because we target low to middle-income patients. As a result, we&#8217;ve</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needed to customize our diagnostic infrastructure, especially as it relates to costs for the people we serve,&#8221; Oni added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economic recession has also affected one of MDaaS&#8217; most priced assets: doctors. Brain drain is a major challenge facing the Nigerian health system right now. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of Nigerian doctors who leave for a better quality of life and pay, with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> some reports estimating <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2019/4/8/nigerias-medical-brain-drain-healthcare-woes-as-doctors-flee">that over 2,000 doctors leave annually</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When you hear about it in the news, it seems like a theoretical thing. But for us, it is real because we have staff leaving to go abroad,&#8221; the CEO remarked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MDaaS tries to approach the situation by training younger doctors and deploying them to its centers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Still, there&#8217;s some commitment play as both parties agree on a period of time the doctor would work with the company.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per application of funds, MDaaS wants to scale its physical footprint across Nigeria by adding six more diagnostic centers this year. A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ccording to Oni, the healthtech startup wants to become one of Nigeria&#8217;s three largest diagnostic centers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO also said MDaaS would consider a pan-African expansion to similar countries like Nigeria, although he gave no timeline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But by 2025, the company aims to operate 100 centers across the continent and serve a million patients per year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the news, the managing partner at Newtown Partners, Llew Claasen, said, “Most consumers in sub-Saharan Africa receive suboptimal medical care because of infrastructure gaps, low physician density, delays in diagnostics, and a lack of health data visibility</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the physical diagnostic infrastructure that MDaaS is building out, coupled with the means to collect data and deliver value-added software services, has the potential to completely change the way that physicians, clinicians, and pharmacists do their jobs and lead to better health outcomes for a huge number of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> underserved consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>, a German-based identity verification startup is acquiring <a href="https://www.ariadnext.com/">ARIADNEXT</a>, a French equivalent, specializing in remote identity verification and digital identity creation. A price was not released by either party but TechCrunch understands from sources that the deal was approximately $59 million / €50 million. Sources say IDnow is looking to do similar acquisitions.</p>
<p>IDnow says the combined entity will be able to provide a comprehensive identity verification platform, ranging from AI-driven to human-assisted technology and from online to point-of-sale verification options. IDnow offers its services into the UK, French and German, Spain, Poland, Romania, and other international markets, and says it expects to increase revenue 3x in 2021 versus 2019.</p>
<p>The startup also says the pandemic has meant usage of its products has gone up 200% more compared to last year as companies switch to digital processes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow said in a statement: “This combination with ARIADNEXT is an important step towards our vision of building the pan-European leader for identity verification-as-a-service solutions. With ARIADNEXT, in addition to our recent acquisition of identity Trust Management AG, IDnow can provide our customers with an even broader suite of products through a single platform with a seamless user experience.”</p>
<p>Guillaume Despagne, President of ARIADNEXT, said: “We are looking forward to joining a team of IDnow’s caliber, combining our experience and skills to work towards our shared vision of providing a pan-European secure and future-proof solution to customers.</p>
<p>IDnow will retain ARIADNEXT’s locations in Rennes, Paris, Madrid, Bucharest, Iasi, and Warsaw, as well as its over 125 employees. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>The acquisition means IDNow is now on a par with the other large player in Europe, OnFido. TechCrunch understands the company has done €50m+ revenue this year expect to over-perform its €100m revenue target for 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ably.com">Ably</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">Pub/Sub</a> messaging platform that companies can use to develop realtime features in their products. The company just raised a $70 million Series B funding round co-led by <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com">Insight Partners</a> and <a href="https://dawncapital.com">Dawn Capital</a>.</p>
<p>Every day, you use various apps that push and fetch data in realtime. When you send a message in your favorite chat app, when you edit a document collaboratively, when you start a video call or when you look at financial data, you expect to send and receive stuff in a fraction of a second. It should feel instantaneous otherwise it feels broken.</p>
<p>A popular system that lets you create realtime features is called Pub/Sub, as in publish-subscribe. As the name suggests, with that model, users publish and receive data through the same channel. Users who want to receive data in realtime establish a realtime connection saying that they want to receive new messages that are routed through that channel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whenever someone publishes a new message, the message is routed to subscribers as quickly as possible — ideally, the message arrives in a fraction of a second. Push notifications on your smartphone follow more or less the same logic, except that they eventually go through Google’s and Apple’s push notification services.</p>
<p>There are several realtime platform-as-a-service providers out there, including services developed by Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. And yet, Ably thinks it has the best technology platform out there and can build a large, standalone realtime API-based startup.</p>
<p>Existing investors Triple Point, Digital Horizon, Forward Partners and MMC also participated in today’s funding round.</p>
<p>“We thought realtime data would underpin experiences instead of enhance them,” co-founder and CEO Matthew O’Riordan told me. Ably customers currently contact the startup at different pain points. They may be using different services for their realtime features. Or maybe it doesn’t scale properly.</p>
<p>A good example of that is CRM, sales and marketing startup <a href="https://www.hubspot.com">HubSpot</a>. “They had realtime features across all their products and they were struggling specifically with the chat feature,” O’Riordan said. HubSpot looked at Ably to solve that problem in particular. And they’re now using Ably for all their products, from analytics to live chat and updates.</p>
<p>Ably has built a global network of data centers so that it can route messages as efficiently as possible. Just like content delivery network (CDN) companies try to minimize latency, Ably routes messages based on latency.</p>
<p>The startup also promises redundancy and reliability with a self-healing network. If a data center goes down, your realtime features still operate as usual. You can also store messages in a traditional message queue in case a user is offline and you want to deliver a batch of messages later when they come back online.</p>
<p>Clients include virtual event company Hopin, Bloomberg, Verizon and Tennis Australia (Verizon is also TechCrunch’s parent company). There are also some big customers in the social media space but Ably can’t disclose the names of all its customers. They pay depending on usage, such as the number&nbsp;messages, concurrent connections and channels.</p>
<p>Overall, Ably reaches 250 million devices per month. It currently has 65 employees. With today’s funding round, it expects to hire another 125 employees by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>The company’s vision is straightforward. It wants to build an infrastructure company that becomes an essential part of the services that you use every day. Ably could become the realtime network that delivers messages from point A to point B as quickly and as reliably as possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India-based technology startup Salesken.ai has secured an exposed server that was spilling private and sensitive data on one of its customers, Byju&#8217;s, an education technology giant and India&#8217;s most valuable startup.</p>
<p>The server was left unprotected since at least June 14, according to<a href="https://www.shodan.io/host/35.198.202.33/history"> historical data</a> provided by Shodan, a search engine for exposed devices and databases. Because the server was without a password, anyone could access the data inside. Security researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/hak1mlukha">Anurag Sen</a> found the exposed server, and asked TechCrunch for help in reporting it to the company.</p>
<p>The server was pulled offline a short time after we contacted Salesken.ai on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Salesken.ai provides customer relationship technology to companies like Byju&#8217;s to engage better with customers. The Bengaluru-based startup raised $8 million in Series A funding from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/sequoia-announces-1-35-billion-venture-and-growth-funds-for-india-and-southeast-asia/">Sequoia Capital India</a> in 2020, two years after the company was founded.</p>
<p>Much of the data contained on the exposed server pertained to WhiteHat Jr., an online coding school for students in India and the U.S., which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">Byju&#8217;s bought for $300 million</a> in 2020. Byju&#8217;s is currently valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/indian-edtech-giant-byjus-in-talks-to-raise-over-600-million-at-15-billion-valuation/">more than $16 billion</a> after raising $1.5 billion earlier this year.</p>
<p>The server contained the names and classes taken by students and email addresses and phone numbers of parents and teachers. The server also contained other data related to students, such as chat logs between parents — identified by their phone number — and WhiteHat Jr. staff, as well as comments recorded by teachers about their students.</p>
<p>The server also contained copies of emails containing codes to reset user accounts and other internal Salesken.ai data.</p>
<p>Surga Thilakan, co-founder and chief executive at Salesken.ai, told TechCrunch the startup was &#8220;evaluating&#8221; the security incident but did not dispute what kind of data was found on the exposed server..</p>
<p>&#8220;Our assessment suggests the exposed device appears to be a non-production, staging instance of one of our integration services having access to less than 1% of India based end-of-life sales logs for a fortnight,&#8221; said Thilakan. &#8220;Salesken.ai follows stringent data security norms and is certified under the highest standards of global security and safety. We have, in an abundance of caution, immediately severed access to the cloud device.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thilakan did not respond to a follow-up email from TechCrunch asking why real user data was stored in what the company claims is a &#8220;non-production, staging&#8221; server. The company also would not say if it has logs or any evidence to determine if data was accessed or downloaded as a result of the security lapse.</p>
<p>WhiteHat Jr. spokesperson Sameer Bajaj said the company is &#8220;currently communicating with Salesken.ai about the incident and will take appropriate action in accordance with our rigorous security policies.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sequoia Capital India has selected 23 early-stage startups for its fifth cohort of Surge, its accelerator program for India and Southeast Asia, at a time when dealflow activity is at its peak in the region.</p>
<p>The new cohort, Surge&#8217;s largest to date, have collectively raised $55 million, the storied investment firm said Wednesday. The group also includes 10 women founders, another record for the accelerator program which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/19/sequoia-surge-inaugural-cohort-india-southeast-asia/">started its journey in March 2019</a> and has backed 91 startups to-date.</p>
<p>The Surge program has enabled Sequoia Capital India &#8212; which has always backed early-stage startups but historically focused more on cutting checks in Series A and beyond rounds &#8212; to more aggressively identify promising startups while they are too young and increase the probability of broadening its portfolio with more winners, investors in the industry said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And those odds have gotten much better in recent months. As Tiger Global and Falcon Edge begin to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">chase early-stage deals in India</a>, both the firms have picked several Surge startups.</p>
<p>Sequoia India said nearly 50% of startups from its first three cohorts have grown to raise their Series A financing rounds.</p>
<p>The Surge program, for which Sequoia India <a href="https://www.surgeahead.com/sequoia-capital-india-announces-new-195m-seed-fund-to-double-down-on-surge/">raised an additional $195 million</a> earlier this year, is now “tried, tested and proven to support founders through strategic mentorship from some of the world’s best startups and business minds, hands-on company building support, and a community of founder-to-founder support,” said the investment firm, which employs over 30 people in advisory roles in the region.</p>
<p>Some investors also said Sequoia India, which offers very aggressive terms and a plethora of resources (App Annie subscription, for instance) to startups in Surge, that the accelerator program has diminished the significance of Y Combinator in India. (Rajan Anandan, who spearheads Surge, told me earlier this year that he doesn&#8217;t see Y Combinator and Surge as rivals.)</p>
<p>The new cohort, several names of which TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/">scooped early this month</a>, includes 13 startups that are building services in fintech, payments, communications, logistics, and SaaS sectors, Surge said.</p>
<p>“We are incredibly proud of all 23 companies who have joined Surge 05 and the founders who have forged their businesses in sectors that have seen tremendous tailwinds. These leaders have displayed grit, exceptional talent, and relentless purpose in shaping the world,” said Anandan, who prior to joining Sequoia Capital India as MD led Google&#8217;s business in India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>“At this inflection point of global regrowth, we are excited to be part of the journey of our founders and their companies, many of which we believe will grow into large, enduring businesses,” he added.</p>

<p>Tiger Global led the Series B financing round in the five-and-a-half-year-old startup. Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang and existing investors Eight Roads Ventures, GSV Ventures, Nexus Venture Partners also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>Quizizz, which concluded its previous financing round in March this year, has raised $47 million to-date. The new round values it at about $300 million, I heard earlier this month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When we were kids, it was so difficult to focus on studies. Our thesis has been that with kids now living in a world with so much distraction, there’s a need to make learning more interesting,” said Ankit Gupta, co-founder and chief executive of Quizizz, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Along with Deepak Cheenath, Quizizz’s other co-founder, Gupta started the startup’s journey in a non-profit school in Bangalore, where they built several prototypes. The same year &#8212; 2015 &#8212; the duo engaged closely with teachers and students in the U.S., and pivoted to Quizizz, said Gupta.</p>

<p>On Quizizz, teachers and the community develop gamified lessons for students. (Teachers don’t have to build these lessons. For the concepts that they want to explain to students, if lessons exist, many just use those instead. The platform has over 20 million quizzes today.)</p>
<p>These lessons have enabled students to find learning more engaging, said Gupta. The platform also enables teachers to identify in real-time students who are struggling with grasping any concept and then to address those gaps, he said.</p>
<p>The platform covers a range of subjects, including computer science, English, mathematics, science, social studies, world languages and creative arts.</p>
<p>Over the years, Quizizz has grown organically across the globe with many classrooms today using the platform, said Gupta. The platform is used by teachers in over 120 nations today with students answering more than 300 million questions on Quizizz each week. In the U.S., which is Quizizz’s largest market now, over 80% of K-12 schools use the platform, he said.</p>
<p>“During the pandemic, Quizziz made the transition to teaching online seamless. Now that we’re back in the building, I&#8217;ve used it almost exclusively. Making, finding, and altering lessons using Quizizz has become almost a hobby for me,” said Rory Roberts, a math teacher at Brigantine Community School, in a prepared statement.</p>

<p>“This week, we conducted user-testing with teachers in California, saw a video of students cheering on their classmates in an auditorium in Kenya, and got a thank you note from a group of teachers wearing Quizizz branded t-shirts in Indonesia. We’re incredibly proud of the role our growing team, and teacher community, have played in this movement,” said Quizizz&#8217;s Cheenath.</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand its team across both the U.S. and India to keep up with its growth. It is also looking to form partnerships to accelerate its international expansion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tocafootball.com/">Toca Football</a>, a nine-year-old, Costa Mesa, Ca.-based company that operates 14 sports centers across the U.S. that are focused on soccer training, has raised $40 million in Series E funding to roughly double the number of facilities that are now up and running in the U.S., as well as to open a site in the U.K. that CEO Yoshi Maruyama describes as a &#8220;highly themed game-experiences-based dining and entertainment facility focused on soccer training.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maruyama knows a thing or two about building destinations to which people gravitate. Before joining Toca &#8212; which was founded by the American former soccer player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Lewis_(American_soccer)">Eddie Lewis</a> (&#8220;toca&#8221; refers to the first touch of the ball in soccer) &#8212; Maruyama spent six years as the global head of location-based entertainment for Dreamworks. He spent 14 years before that as an SVP with Universal Parks &amp; Resorts.</p>
<p>Indeed, he was brought into Toca in 2019 to transform it from a manufacturing business that sells Major League Soccer teams a ball-tossing machine that Lewis had developed, to the services business it has become.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On its face, its new model seems like a pretty smart one, given soccer&#8217;s growing popularity in the U.S. According to Statista, the number of participants in U.S. high school soccer programs recorded an all-time high in the 2018/19 season, with more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/267963/participation-in-us-high-school-soccer/">850,000</a> playing the sport across the country.</p>
<p>But Toca isn&#8217;t built just for kids, even if kids &#8212; and their parents &#8212; are its primary customers. According to Maruyama, there are several populations that are coming to its various centers throughout the day. In the morning, the centers feature a curriculum for children up to age six to introduce them to soccer; the afternoons feature largely one-on-one soccer training programs where Toca is able to employ its touch trainer; and during the evenings, Toca operates a leagues business for both children and adults.</p>
<p>Some of the centers are huge, by the way. Among Toca&#8217;s newest sites, for example, in Naperville, Illinois, outside of Chicago, it has built a 95,000-square-foot facility that features four indoor, full-size soccer fields, as well as one-on-one individual training spaces. (Maruyama suggests the company has been able to take advantage of a depressed commercial real estate market over the last year or so.)</p>
<p>Little wonder that investors see a big opportunity potentially.</p>
<p>The newest round of funding for Toca comes from earlier investors WestRiver Group, RNS TOCA Partners, and D2 Futbol Investors; they were joined by new investors, including angel investor Jared Smith, the co-founder and former COO of Qualtrics.</p>
<p>The company &#8212; which plans to expand into Asia as quickly as possible (China has been mandated by the country’s leadership to become “<a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-can-china-become-a-soccer-superpower/">a first-class football superpower</a>” by 2050) &#8212;  has now raised $105 million in total funding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As I’ve taken to online grocery shopping over the pandemic, I’ve always wondered why supermarkets didn&#8217;t offer simple ‘recipe’ features that would have automatically collected items for a homemade meal. It seemed an opportunity missed. But it is missed no more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lollipopai.com/">Lollipop AI</a>, the new British online grocery marketplace, is launching its public beta today to do that, and it’s been created by a serial UK entrepreneur who was there at the start of successful UK startups Osper, Monzo and Curve.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Tom Foster-Carter has envisaged a platform allowing people to build meal plans from recipes, assembling the ingredients automatically into their shopping baskets, and suggesting remaining household essentials. He says the Lollipop could well help with health goals, improve culinary skills and minimize food waste. Built as a marketplace, it will be partnering with Sainsbury’s and BBC Good Food with more partners, and fulfillment will be completed by retail partners. The business model will be taking a small commission from retail partners, allowing selected advertising, e.g. from CPG brand owners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The site will be free to use, while a premium tier is planned. The first 10K beta testers to sign up to the waitlist will be offered access to premium features &#8220;for life,” says the startup, which will offer prices at the same rate as normal supermarkets.</p>
<p>Foster-Carter, who had the idea after having a baby and realizing he was spending hours trying to use a normal supermarket, says the approach will save several hours a week for the average household. (We will briefly note the fact that a man had to create a site like this after doing the weekly shop&#8230;). Lollipop claims 80% of households spend over an hour a week meal-planning and online grocery shopping.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171585" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171585" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2171585" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lollipop_UI_MealPlanner.png" alt="Lollipop MealPlanner" width="1024" height="711" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lollipop_UI_MealPlanner.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lollipop_UI_MealPlanner.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lollipop_UI_MealPlanner.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lollipop_UI_MealPlanner.png?resize=768,533 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lollipop_UI_MealPlanner.png?resize=680,472 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lollipop_UI_MealPlanner.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171585" class="wp-caption-text">Lollipop MealPlanner</p></div></p>
<p>The founding team includes former employees of Monzo, Farmdrop, Amazon, Sainsbury’s and HelloFresh, such as cofounders Chris Parsons and Ib Warnerbring.</p>
<p>Although Foster-Carter is coy about how much he has raised for this approach, he says he has raised a pre-seed round backed by JamJar Investments, Speedinvest, and a &#8220;raft of grocery/technology big hitters&#8221; including Ian Marsh (former UK GM of HelloFresh) and former leadership and founders of online grocers in the U.K. and abroad plus &#8216;super angels&#8217; Charles Songhurst and Ed Lando.</p>
<p>In particular, the site is likely to appeal to people looking to lose weight, as meal planning would be simpler and may even have an impact on recipe-box startups.</p>
<p>Lollipop is not alone in its ambitions. Jupiter.co in the U.S. bills itself as “groceries on autopilot”; Jow is recipe-led shopping, as is Side Chef; while Cooklist is a meal-planner + cooking support, also in the U.S.</p>
<p>Foster-Carter told me: &#8220;It’s a marketplace so we could partner with traditional supermarkets (Sainbury’s, Tescos, Waitrose etc) + online retailers (Ocado, Amazon), direct to farm / organic (Riverford, Farmdrop), mission-led single component (Oddbox, Milk &amp; More, etc); recipe boxes (Gousto, Hello Fresh, Mindful Chef etc); and rapid delivery (Gorillas, Getir, Weezy, etc).</p>
<p>“This is just the start… The plan is to be the single place you go to for all your food needs &#8211; we’ll enable you to order your Deliveroo or restaurant kit (e.g. Dishpatch) from us. Groceries are delivered by our partners, and then when it’s time to cook you’ll be able to use a cooking companion app (due out next month). In the future you’ll be able to improve your cooking skills through Lollipop.”</p>
<p>Few players have nailed the ability to buy a lot of items (50-100+) really fast, not even Amazon &#8211; this might be Lollipop’s USP, if it can crack it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Listen, it’s probably not the best sign when a show feels like it’s running out of steam on its first day. Mobile World Congress’ opening salvo was headlined by Samsung in an event that touched on some partnerships and spent equal time teasing an upcoming event where it will actually launch some hardware. It’s hard to get too down on the GSMA, and I really ought to preface all of these by reiterating that – even in a normal year – running an event is hard as hell. Canceling its flagship show last year had to be gut-wrenching, and deciding to go forward with this one must have also been – albeit for dramatically different reasons?</p>
<p>It’s not like the show didn’t come with some wins. What’s that? Elon Musk videoed in? That’s a pretty massive get by any measure, with all of the standard “whatever you think about the guy” preambles. Love him or hate, you’ve heard about him and probably have extremely strong feelings about the dude, one way or another.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171507" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171507" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2171507" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_5C685E71D930-1.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_5C685E71D930-1.jpeg 2208w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_5C685E71D930-1.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_5C685E71D930-1.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_5C685E71D930-1.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_5C685E71D930-1.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_5C685E71D930-1.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_5C685E71D930-1.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_5C685E71D930-1.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171507" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://mwcbarcelona.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobile World Congress </a><span class="screen-reader-text"><a href="https://mwcbarcelona.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(opens in a new window)</a></span></p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The High Priest of Dogeking beamed in to talk SpaceX StarLink. “To be totally frank, we are losing money on that terminal right now,” Musk said in the interview. “That terminal costs us more than $1,000, so obviously I’m subsidizing the cost of the terminal.” Good thing he’s got deep pockets.</p>
<p>He promised a new version of the company’s satellite next year, “which will be significantly more capable.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/news/2021/6/5g-industry-unique-all-band-all-scenario-2021">Huawei thus far has focused much more on networking than consumer</a> – it’s important to caveat this by adding that MWC is as much, if not more, a networking show, in spite of all of the press that tends to focus on consumer device launches. The company launched a bunch of 5G networking hardware, including several MIMO products.</p>
<p>Speaking of networks, I totally forgot to include this bit from TechCrunch parent co (you know, for now). Verizon trotted out a bunch of robots with 5G branding. The company was making a point about the importance of cellular for future robotics communication.</p>
<p>Here’s CSO Rima Qureshi, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/verizon-shows-off-5g-connected-robots-barcelona-conference-2021-06-28/">quoted by Reuter</a>s, &#8220;5G will make it possible for robots to connect with other robots and devices of all kinds in a way that simply wasn&#8217;t possible before.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171799" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171799" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2171799" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/210628-2.png" alt="" width="800" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/210628-2.png 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/210628-2.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/210628-2.png?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/210628-2.png?resize=768,420 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/210628-2.png?resize=680,372 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/210628-2.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171799" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Huawei</p></div></p>
<p>Let’s be honest, though, mostly robots make for cool stage fodder. From what I can tell, the Boston Dynamics-esque quadruped was this bot from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/the-vivacious-acrobatic-minitaur-robot-will-definitely-improve-your-day/">Ghost Robotics</a>, which Verizon also trotted out (well, it trotted itself out, I suppose) at CES in January:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/3icRite6RMk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Given the choice, would I have put on an in-person event in Barcelona in the summer of 2021? No. Nuh-uh. No way. Did the GSMA feel like they had a choice financially or otherwise? That’s a much more difficult question to answer. When you’re a company that runs on events and partnerships, even canceling a single big show is a shock to the system.</p>
<p>I’m going back and forth on whether I’ll be doing any more of these roundups as the show progresses through Thursday. Definitely if some more interesting stuff shows up, or if there’s like video of Elon hoverboarding through the sparsely populated convention center halls or something. But I’m not holding my breath.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 29, 2021. Have you ever wanted to ditch civilization and move to the woods, but still be able to work? We have good news if that’s you. Below you’ll find lots more, including Facebook’s latest product offering and how one startup wants to save bees. Enjoy! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/duolingo-s-1/"><strong>Duolingo is going public! </strong></a>Well-known edtech unicorn Duolingo is going public. TechCrunch has an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/duolingo-s-1/">overview of the IPO</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/duolingos-s-1-depicts-heady-growth-monetization-new-focus-on-english-certification/">deeper dive into the company’s business health</a>. Based on traffic to our coverage on the matter since last night, ya’ll are really into learning languages. Also make sure to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">check out the Duolingo EC-1</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">Facebook launches newsletters:</a> </strong>Say hello to Bulletin, Facebook’s new newsletter service. Competing with Substack, Twitter’s Revu and other services, Facebook signed up a Boomer-friendly list of initial authors including Malcolm Gladwell. The social giant has a history of testing in-house versions of products that are successful externally. We’ll have to wait and see if Bulletin manages to survive on its own merit.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/spacex-is-losing-money-on-its-starlink-terminals-but-sees-lower-costs-ahead/"><strong>SpaceX plans to spend billions on Starlink:</strong></a> According to Elon Musk, SpaceX is losing money on early Starlink connector kits. Starlink is the space company’s low-orbit satellite network that could bring about global internet connectivity. Per TechCrunch reporting of Musk’s comments, “SpaceX’s overall investment in the project could be between $5 billion-$10 billion initially and as much as $30 billion over time.” For the sake of freelancers everywhere, let’s hope the tech shakes out to match the investment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Up top today in our roundup of recent startup news is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/beeflow-raises-8-3-million-to-save-the-bees-and-put-them-to-work/">Beeflow</a>. We’re putting it at the top of the list because (1) It’s about bees and (2) It’s called Beeflow. What’s not to love? Per <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanrcrook">Jordan Crook</a>, the startup may have an answer to the decimation of the global bee population. And it might make money to boot.</p>
<p>Now, the rest of the news:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/late-stage-capital-is-having-a-cascading-effect-on-european-vc-activity/">Europe’s early-stage market is on fire:</a> </strong>That’s the takeaway from a recent TechCrunch dig into the continent’s venture capital trade. So <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/like-the-us-a-two-tier-venture-capital-market-is-emerging-in-latin-america/">is Latin America’s</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">the United States’</a>. In brief, the regional startup zones of the world are becoming increasingly blurred thanks to Zoom deal-making; what was once true in one place may now be the case in every hub.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/zomatos-100-million-investment-to-turn-grofers-into-a-unicorn/"><strong>Zomato to drop $100M on Grofer</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The Indian tech scene is busy these days, with <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc?lang=en">Manish Singh</a> reporting that IPO-headed food-delivery giant Zomato intends to invest $100 million in online grocer Grofer. Grofer would become a unicorn in the transaction.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/sources-sentinelone-expects-to-raise-over-1b-in-nyse-ipo-tomorrow-listing-with-a-10b-market-cap/">SentinelOne could be worth $10 billion in its IPO:</a></strong> That’s the latest on the SentinelOne public debut, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/investors-thirst-for-growth-could-bode-well-for-sentinelones-ipo/">which we’ve looked at here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/sentinelones-upgraded-ipo-pricing-is-good-news-for-tiger-public-markets-and-your-local-vc/">dug into the pricing of here</a>. The cybersecurity company’s IPO could help kick off a hot third quarter for IPOs more generally, especially at the prices at which it is set to debut.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/training-platform-virti-raises-10m-series-a-led-by-iq-capital-to-teach-soft-skills-in-vr/"><strong>$10M to teach soft skills with VR:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the latest on Virti, which wants to turn “a lot of subjectively assessed skills into more objective and measurable” outputs. VR is cool, and soft skills matter. Let’s see what their union can bring. Please, no &#8220;Black Mirror&#8221; jokes.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/digital-greeting-card-startup-givingli-wraps-3-million-seed-round/"><strong>Givingli raises $3M for greeting card tech:</strong></a> Not every venture capital round is large. Some are small enough to fit into an envelope. That’s the case with Givingli’s latest round, which should give the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/givingli/id1386635163?ls=1">digital card and gifting app</a> more room to build out its service.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I would be remiss to not mention that I covered venture capital rounds this morning from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/co-op-raises-5-8m-round-to-help-online-merchants-land-customers-for-less/">co-op</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/arrows-raises-2-75m-to-build-out-its-customer-onboarding-software/">Arrows</a>, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/saas-focused-acceleprise-rebrands-raises-30m-in-new-capital/">news regarding Acceleprise’s rebrand</a>.</p>
<h2>How VCs can get the most out of co-investing alongside LPs</h2>
<p>In a recent private equity survey, 80% of respondents said their co-investments with people outside traditional VC firms outperformed their PE fund investments.</p>
<p>Alternative investors are highly motivated, and because they&#8217;re seeking higher returns than are generally available in public markets, they are less daunted by risk. In return, they benefit from less expensive fee structures and develop close ties with VCs, enlarging the talent pool as they build investment skills.</p>
<p>These relationships have direct benefits for VCs as well, such as more flexibility with diversification and consolidated decision-making power.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the right deal structure, deal selection and deal investigation, co-investors can significantly increase their returns,&#8221; says C5 Capital Managing Partner William Kilmer, who wrote an Extra Crunch post for VCs considering an alternative path.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Turning from the smaller upstarts to the megagiants, it’s been a good week to be a Big Tech company. Facebook crossed the $1 trillion market cap threshold, though it dipped back under the magic number this afternoon. Here’s what else is going on from the Bigs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/shopify-drops-its-app-store-commissions-to-0-on-developers-first-million-in-revenue/"><strong>Shopify cuts its cut to 0%:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Shopify will charge zero for developers’ first million in revenue that they make on its application marketplace. The move fits into a larger trend of app stores lowering their cuts as Apple fights tooth and nail to avoid doing the same with its own application emporium. The Shopify news is probably more aimed at e-commerce rival Amazon than Apple, but the move still gently undercuts Cupertino’s argument that it deserves around a third of all commerce that happens on iOS.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/github-previews-new-ai-tool-that-makes-coding-suggestions/"><strong>AI developers are coming:</strong></a><strong> </strong>News out today from Microsoft’s GitHub product is notable, with the sub-org announcing an AI-powered tool that “suggests code as you type.” GitHub teamed up with OpenAI to build the tool. For beginners, the coding service could prove to be super freaking neat.</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA["They didn't want to touch Croatia, like 'Where the hell is that?' It was quite a ride."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mate Rimac&#8217;s founder story has the makings of automotive folklore. He started Rimac Automobili in his garage in 2009 as a literal one-person operation that has grown to a company with more than 1,000 employees, supply contracts with automakers like Porsche and a new electric hypercar moving into production.</p>
<p>What might not be known is how close the company came to failing. &#8220;It has been such a wild ride,&#8221; Mate Rimac said during an interview at at the virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> event. &#8220;The first seven years, we were like out of money and technically bankrupt all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The founder and CEO of Croatian electric hypercar and components developer Rimac Automobili joined TechCrunch on our virtual stage to talk about the company&#8217;s new Nevera vehicle, his interest in electric robotaxis and the prospect of an acquisition of Bugatti. Throughout the interview, he gave a candid account of some of the company&#8217;s lowest points, how he and the company survived and what other founders can learn from his experience.</p>
<h2>&#8220;It was quite a ride.&#8221;</h2>
<p>Today, Rimac Automobili is a household name in Croatia with plans to grow even larger. Rimac is currently building a headquarters and technology campus on a 49-acre site that is slated to be completed in 2023. It was a far more solitary experience the first few years of Rimac Automobili&#8217;s existence. Even when it gained recognition, the company came close to failing numerous times, Rimac said in the interview.</p>
<blockquote><p>It has been such a wild ride. And like the first seven years, we were like out of money and technically bankrupt all the time.</p>
<p>We had situations where I can&#8217;t even start to explain what we survived. I set out this company 12 years ago, I was alone for two years. The first employee joined me in 2011. So it was really built from a garage.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, the team behind the parody <a href="https://twitter.com/aniacopian/status/1224760570374524929">Amazon Dating</a> delivered us <a href="https://postdates.co/feed">Postdates</a>. It&#8217;s like Postmates, but for getting your stuff back from your ex.</p>
<p>Postdates looks like the actual Postmates website — you can select a type of relationship (&#8220;casually dated,&#8221; &#8220;lived together,&#8221; &#8220;one night stand,&#8221; etc.) like it&#8217;s a type of restaurant. Then, you can choose from preset items to retrieve (concert tickets if you were friend-zoned, family heirlooms if you were divorced) or add a custom item. Delivery starts at $25 in LA and $30 in NY, along with an additional emotional labor fee of $3.99. Yes, you can actually use this service if you&#8217;re in one of these two cities, but Postdates isn&#8217;t here to stay &#8212; it&#8217;s a pop-up business. Or, as Postdates &#8220;founder&#8221; Ani Acopian puts it, &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of like watching a &#8216;Black Mirror&#8217; episode, but it&#8217;s your real life.&#8221;</p>
<p>You might remember Elon Musk’s failed comedy startup/&#8221;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/14/elon-musks-media-empire-staffed-by-ex-onion-writers-might-be-called-thud/">intergalactic media empire</a>&#8221; Thud, which aimed to create immersive digital experiences that blurred the lines between what’s real and fake. Or, you might not remember Thud, since it <a href="https://www.mic.com/p/elon-musks-first-foray-into-comedy-was-a-strange-satirical-website-called-thud-77009671">failed spectacularly</a> and wasn’t very funny. Postdates struck the satire gold that Elon Musk dreamed of with Thud, only they did it without $2 million dollars in funding from one of the richest men in the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">TechCrunch talked to conceptual artist Ani Acopian, producer Suzy Shinn and product developer Brian Wagner to get the lowdown on just how legit Postdates is.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171732" style="width: 1066px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171732" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2171732 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-9.18.25-PM.png" alt="" width="1056" height="934" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-9.18.25-PM.png 1056w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-9.18.25-PM.png?resize=150,133 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-9.18.25-PM.png?resize=300,265 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-9.18.25-PM.png?resize=768,679 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-9.18.25-PM.png?resize=680,601 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-9.18.25-PM.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1056px) 100vw, 1056px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171732" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://postdates.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Postdates </a><span class="screen-reader-text"><a href="http://postdates.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(opens in a new window)</a></span></p></div></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch:</strong> <strong>Why Postdates? How did the idea come about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suzy Shinn:</strong> At the start of quarantine when everything was falling apart, Ani and I made <a href="https://aniacopian.com/SCRUBHUB">ScrubHub</a>, like PornHub for hand washing. We raised $50,000 for charity.</p>
<p><strong>Ani Acopian: </strong>I think we had this creative juice inside of us that we wanted to find an outlet for.</p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> Then, we had the Postdates idea, and we actually tried to get investors and artists to fund it, because we were like … This is going to cost something, we want to make it real and actually function. No one wanted anything to do with it, because they were like, &#8220;What&#8217;s the return?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> And we were like, &#8220;Well, the return is that it&#8217;s a vibe.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> No one wanted anything to do with us fundingwise, so we built it ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>So, you <em>can</em> actually use this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> Yeah, we partnered with two local courier companies, <a href="https://www.gourmetrunnerla.com/">Gourmet Runner</a> in LA and <a href="https://airpals.net/">Airpals</a> in New York. We wanted to make sure we work with people that treat their workers right.</p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> You can put in a request, and the ex has to consent obviously and be like, &#8220;Yeah, I have this stuff for you, I&#8217;ll put it outside,&#8221; and our couriers have Postdates bags that we give to them. But legitimately, you can use it in both of those cities as long as you&#8217;re not sending a cat, or a child, or alcohol, or drugs, or something that won&#8217;t fit in a bag.</p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> We spent a lot of time on the workflow to make sure no addresses are shared, that everyone&#8217;s consenting to be involved, and we&#8217;re trying to keep it no contact, so we&#8217;re asking people to put stuff on their door handle. You&#8217;re not charged until your ex accepts the order.</p>

<p><strong>You just launched yesterday, but have people actually been using the service so far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Wagner:</strong> We had some people who would post a screenshot in response to Ani&#8217;s tweet and be like, &#8220;Oh snap, I actually got Postdated by my ex!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> There&#8217;s about 30 to 40 pending requests, and we&#8217;ve gotten a handful that just as of this morning have been delivered successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think this could be a viable business?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> Not everything needs to be a viable business. I would actually be … not surprised, but upset if this actually became a thing, because I don&#8217;t think the world needs that level of stuff, but I think we&#8217;re pretty much already there. All you can do is hold the mirror up.</p>

<p><strong>As satire, what are you trying to say with Postdates?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> I think in the tech world, it seems like all of these tech startups get crazy amounts of funding, and they spend so much money, and they take themselves so seriously. The three of us, with the help of our friends, were able to do this, and we didn&#8217;t need $13 million in funding or five years. But we were staying up until like 5 a.m., and we were like, &#8220;Can we hire someone to help us?&#8221; but we were like, &#8220;No, we can&#8217;t pay.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Especially with the rise of the gig economy, we&#8217;ve seen some positives and some pretty serious negatives, especially during quarantine. It helps people get the things that they need, but also, a lot of workers aren&#8217;t being paid fairly and don&#8217;t have health insurance. So there&#8217;s a sentiment a lot more often now that a lot of tech is redistributing labor, and you&#8217;re just paying for people to be moved around. So in a way, we&#8217;re sort of like … We&#8217;ve redistributed emotional labor here.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s an emotional labor tax on the site, yeah.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> There&#8217;s a bit of poking fun of that, saying how far will we go in terms of actually moving labor along for money. Will people pay for someone else to deal with the emotional handling of a situation?</p>

<p><strong>How did Postdates build upon Amazon Dating?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> We&#8217;ve made two parody sites now, and we wanted to take that to the next level and make it experiential. It&#8217;s kind of like watching a &#8220;Black Mirror&#8221; episode, but it&#8217;s your real life.</p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> What is the literal price you will pay not to see someone? This is a real thing that happens all the time &#8212; my friends will be like, &#8220;I broke up with my girlfriend, I need you to go get my stuff,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go get your stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> I don&#8217;t think we should outsource it, though.</p>
<p><strong>So you don&#8217;t think we should outsource it, but also, you made Postdates.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> I think that&#8217;s the whole …</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s the joke.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>What does it say about startup culture to make a product that you don&#8217;t think should exist?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> Startups are so, so serious, there&#8217;s no humor in it, and they think it&#8217;s going to last forever. Well, we&#8217;re doing the opposite.  We&#8217;re going to make this last a couple of weeks for a limited time only, and then we&#8217;re gonna take it away. But we would love to keep doing these, making something where art meets tech meets entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Companies and experiences can just be fun. They don&#8217;t have to be a billion dollar idea, they don&#8217;t have to be something that&#8217;s going to go on &#8220;Shark Tank.&#8221; Imagine us entering &#8220;Shark Tank … .&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the next few years, you'll more likely see an electric delivery van dropping off your packages than an electric car in your neighbor's driveway.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford and GM&#8217;s century-old battle for market share is no longer restricted to gas- and diesel-powered passenger car, truck and SUV sales. The hottest market in the next decade is commercial and electric.</p>
<p>In this new race, the two companies are taking different strategies as they square off against each other &#8212; along with a growing list of EV startups &#8212; to win over as many delivery and fleet-vehicle customers as possible.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s weapon is BrightDrop, a new startup incubated and launched at CES 2021 by Chairman and CEO Mary Barra. The venture boasts an ecosystem of EV hardware and logistical software products aimed squarely at fleet and delivery companies. GM&#8217;s interest in the space is far from merely exploratory; it anticipates that the market for delivery, including food and parcels in the United States, will be <a href="https://plants.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jan/ces/0112-brightdrop.html">more than $850 billion by 2025</a>.</p>

			For fleet managers, it comes down to the numbers on a spreadsheet, and thanks to incentives and lower maintenance costs associated with EVs, vans that run on electrons instead of dead dinosaurs make financial sense.					</blockquote>

	</p>
<p>&#8220;Folks on the commercial side don&#8217;t really care about the technology &#8212; they care about the economics,&#8221; <a href="https://www.cargroup.org/person/brett-smith/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw5auGBhDEARIsAFyNm9Eb_lVYmOo6bbaCEx12-XSJlM7SDoRgo07aUo3jxSdkdWTpbeUKmpcaAlnHEALw_wcB">Brett Smith</a>, director of technology at research firm CAR, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Electric vehicles might be more ecologically sound than traditional gas- or diesel-powered vehicles, but for fleet managers, it comes down to the numbers on a spreadsheet, and thanks to incentives and lower maintenance costs associated with EVs, vans that run on electrons instead of dead dinosaurs make financial sense.</p>
