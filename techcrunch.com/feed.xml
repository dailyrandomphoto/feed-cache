										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> has seized control of a number of websites that were being used by a Chinese-government backed hacking group to target organizations in 29 countries, including the U.S.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (DCI) <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/12/06/cyberattacks-nickel-dcu-china/">said on Monday</a> that a federal court in Virginia had granted an order allowing the company to take control of the websites and redirect the traffic to Microsoft servers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>These malicious websites were being used by a state-sponsored hacking group known as Nickel, or APT15, to gather intelligence from government agencies, think tanks and human rights organizations, according to the company.</p>
<p>Microsoft didn’t name Nickel’s targets, but said the group was targeting organizations in the U.S. and 28 other countries. It added that &#8220;there is often a correlation between Nickel’s targets and China’s geopolitical interests.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243741" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Microsoft, which has been tracking Nickel since 2016 and <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWMFIi">previously described</a> it as one of the “most active” hacking groups targeting government agencies, said it observed “highly sophisticated” attacks that installed hard-to-detect malware that facilitates intrusion, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/surveillance/">surveillance</a> and data theft.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In some cases, Nickel’s attacks used compromised third-party virtual private network (VPN) suppliers and credentials obtained from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phone-spear-phishing/">spear-phishing</a> campaigns, according to Microsoft, and in others, vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s own Exchange Server and SharePoint system were used to infiltrate companies. However, Microsoft noted that it has “not observed any new vulnerabilities in Microsoft products as part of these attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“Obtaining control of the malicious websites and redirecting traffic from those sites to Microsoft’s secure servers will help us protect existing and future victims while learning more about Nickel’s activities,” </span>wrote Tom Burt<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for customer security and trust.</span> “Our disruption will not prevent Nickel from continuing other hacking activities, but we do believe we have removed a key piece of the infrastructure the group has been relying on for this latest wave of attacks.”</p>
<p class="">In addition to the U.S., Nickel also targeted organizations in Argentina, Barbados, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Italy, Jamaica, Mali, Mexico, Montenegro, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Microsoft said its Digital Crimes Unit, through 24 lawsuits, had taken down more than 10,000 malicious websites used by cybercriminals and almost 600 used by nation-state actors. Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/microsoft-domains-covid-19-attacks/">the team took control malicious web domains used in a large-scale cyberattack</a> that targeted victims in 62 countries with spoofed emails.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Arrival, the electric vehicle manufacturer that aims to break up the assembly line in favor of multiple microfactories, is investing $11.5 million to build a high-voltage battery module assembly plant in Charlotte, North Carolina. The plant will provide batteries for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/commercial-ev-company-arrival-to-build-electric-buses-for-anaheim/">electric buses</a> and vans produced at the company&#8217;s microfactories in Rock Hill, South Carolina and Charlotte, respectively.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Arrival also <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211129005108/en/%C2%A0Li-Cycle-Partners-with-Arrival-to-Advance-EV-Battery-Recycling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed to collaborate with Li-Cycle</a>, a lithium-ion battery recycler, to create a closed-loop EV battery supply chain. Like most other automakers, Arrival is recognizing the reality of supply chain delays and materials shortages and is working to vertically integrate as much of the process as possible, while also maintaining its commitment to sustainability.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was not always part of the plan,&#8221; Katie Blixt, Arrival&#8217;s head of PR and communications in North America, told TechCrunch. &#8220;As we&#8217;re figuring out the production plan and timeline and figuring out what makes sense to bring in-house and add to our vertical integration, we just decided that the best move was for us to be able to assemble these ourselves and have more control over the process.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243683" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over the next several months, Arrival will be refitting an existing warehouse in order to start production in the third quarter of 2022, according to Blixt, who noted that Arrival&#8217;s battery chemistry supplier is LG. The plant should have a production capacity of up to 350,000 battery modules per year, which can be used across Arrival&#8217;s different commercial vehicle platforms and can be tailored to suit the customer&#8217;s specific battery requirements, according to the company.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Automakers have battery anxiety, so they&#8217;re taking control of the supply&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/automakers-have-battery-anxiety-so-theyre-taking-control-of-the-supply/embed/#?secret=UkpUCdqpOs" data-secret="UkpUCdqpOs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Arrival has announced before that it hopes to build 31 microfactories by 2024. So far, it has three planned for 2022; Arrival aims to start production of its buses at Rock Hill in Q2 next year, vans in Bicester, England in Q3 and vans in Charlotte in Q4.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve withdrawn long-term forecasts on microfactory numbers beyond that because the advantage of the microfactory model is that we don&#8217;t have to plan several years in the future and the number will be determined by demand and access to capital,&#8221; said Blixt.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whenever Arrival does start scaling up its microfactories, it will also now scale battery assembly plants alongside them, so it&#8217;s almost an opposite approach to the Tesla gigafactory style of production, said Blixt, noting that Arrival might build multiple regional battery assembly facilities to supply local microfactories.</p>
<p>The battery modules will be software-based and have self-diagnostic capabilities, so if there&#8217;s an issue with one, the module itself can be replaced instead of the entire set of batteries in the vehicle, said Blixt. If the software detects an anomaly, it will send information up to the cloud for Arrival&#8217;s technicians to diagnose and then send instructions back down to Arrival&#8217;s network of outside service providers. The company recently announced partnerships with companies like <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/valvoline-named-a-network-service-provider-for-electric-vehicle-maker-arrival-301435131.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valvoline and Firestone to provide Arrival customers with vehicle maintenance.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) announced in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000119312521348598/d242442d425.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent filing</a> that it has received questions from the United States government regarding its anticipated combination with Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG). TechCrunch covered the SPAC&#8217;s planned combination with the company associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/">broadly skeptical of the deal</a>, product goals and general vibe. Since then, a few things have happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>In late October, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/business/trump-spac-digital-world.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times reported</a> that Trump was in conversation with DWAC CEO Patrick Orlando before the SPAC was put together. &#8220;In doing so, Mr. Orlando’s SPAC may have skirted securities laws and stock exchange rules, lawyers said,&#8221; per the Times.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/04/2346139/0/en/Trump-Media-Technology-Group-Corp-and-Digital-World-Acquisition-Corp-Announce-1-Billion-PIPE-Investment-in-Committed-Capital-to-Fund-Business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DWAC and TMTG picked up</a> &#8220;subscription agreements for $1 billion in committed capital to be received upon consummation of their business combination&#8221; on December 4, per a release.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising, given the two news items, that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are asking questions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243648" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to the new DWAC filing (emphasis added):</p>
<div align="left">
<blockquote><p><strong>DWAC has received certain preliminary, fact-finding inquiries from regulatory authorities, with which it is cooperating.</strong> Specifically, in late October and in early November 2021, DWAC received a request for information from FINRA, surrounding events (specifically, a review of trading) that preceded the public announcement of the October 20, 2021 Merger Agreement. According to FINRA’s request, the inquiry should not be construed as an indication that FINRA has determined that any violations of Nasdaq rules or federal securities laws have occurred, nor as a reflection upon the merits of the securities involved or upon any person who effected transactions in such securities. Additionally, <strong>in early November 2021, DWAC received a voluntary information and document request from the SEC which sought,<i> inter alia</i>, documents relating to meetings of DWAC’s Board of Directors, policies and procedures relating to trading, the identification of banking, telephone, and email addresses, the identities of certain investors, and certain documents and communications between DWAC and TMTG.</strong> According to the SEC’s request, the investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone violated the law or that the SEC has a negative opinion of DWAC or any person, event, or security.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>The company stresses, as you read, that it has not been accused of wrongdoing. Yet. But that&#8217;s a lot of scrutiny for a deal that was hard to parse, which has our heads tilting to one side at a rather sharp angle.</p>
<p>The TMTG/DWAC investor presentation was thin on details. And it quickly became apparent that some of the code being used to build TMTG product TRUTH Social <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/mastodon-issues-30-day-ultimatum-to-trumps-social-network-over-misuse-of-its-code/">was not properly sourced</a>. It&#8217;s all a bit whiffy, frankly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Why the SPAC would merge with what appeared to be more of a collection of ideas than a company was a question. How the valuation thereof was decided was also a mystery. As was the list of investors putting the $1 billion infusion together for the deal.</p>
<p>The entire affair is not a good look for SPACs, which already earn a goodish bit of side-eye given their somewhat befuddling mechanism that allows a pre-product company to go public via a less mature structure than is generally permitted. This is the sort of deal that gave SPACs &#8212; blank-check companies &#8212; the name that they had until recently, when they got a rebrand of sorts for a short window of time in the eyes of investors.</p>
<p>More to come on this one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toyota Motor will build its first battery factory in the U.S. in North Carolina, the company and state officials confirmed Monday, as more automakers seek to take control of the supply chain with in-house battery manufacturing plants.</p>
<p>Toyota will invest $1.29 billion in the plant, which will be called Toyota Battery Manufacturing, North Carolina (TBMNC), with production anticipated to commence in 2025. That investment is part of a wider pledge to invest $3.4 billion in automotive batteries in the U.S. through 2030.</p>
<p>Once operational, TBMNC will have four production lines, each capable of manufacturing batteries for around 200,000 electric and hybrid vehicles. Toyota’s aim is to expand the factory to at least six production lines, which would produce enough batteries for 1.2 million vehicles per year. The new factory will create around 1,750 new jobs and will use 100% renewable energy to make the batteries, Toyota said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243653" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The news comes as Congress mulls a revision to the consumer tax credit for electric vehicles, which currently stands at around $7,500 for OEMs that have sold fewer than 200,000 electric vehicles. A group of Democrats have proposed adding an additional $500 if the vehicle’s battery was made in the U.S., and another $4,500 on top of that for EVs produced in the U.S. by unionized plants.</p>
<p>Toyota has been squarely against the tax credit revision, calling it “blatantly biased” in a letter to legislators. The bill has received support from the big three automakers &#8212; Ford, General Motors and Stellantis &#8212; as well as the United Auto Workers.</p>
<p>Toyota is just the latest major automaker to announce a battery manufacturing plant, part of a push to stay ahead of potential supply chain squeezes from raw materials or key battery components. As Rebecca Bellan wrote for TechCrunch+, partnerships and joint ventures with battery suppliers &#8212; like GM’s joint venture with LG Chem, dubbed Ultium, or Ford Motor’s agreement with SK Innovation &#8212; show that OEMs are realizing they need to take control of the supply.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than a year ago, WildWorks, the makers of the kid&#8217;s virtual world game <a href="https://www.animaljam.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animal Jam</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/makers-of-kids-first-virtual-world-animal-jam-targets-gen-z-teens-with-fer-al-debut/">launched its next big effort</a> with a game aimed at Gen Z teens, called <a href="https://fer.al/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feral</a>. But in recent days, the company has angered many of its core users with <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/29/2342458/0/en/WildWorks-Announces-Entry-Into-Crypto-Gaming-With-Cinder-io.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a> that it&#8217;s reusing Feral&#8217;s technology platform and many of its assets to enter the crypto-gaming space with a metaverse game called <a href="https://cinder.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cinder</a>, powered by the Solana blockchain.</p>
<p>The response from WildWorks&#8217; core fans has been far less than enthusiastic to this news for a variety of reasons. Already concerned about Feral&#8217;s pace of development and unfinished nature, players are now worried about what it means for Feral&#8217;s future now that the company has moved on to build a crypto gaming experience using Feral&#8217;s assets. They&#8217;re also less than thrilled about the environmental impacts of crypto gaming and NFTs &#8212; an opinion which WildWorks CEO Clark Stacey, until recently, had shared.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://clarkstacey.medium.com/the-crypto-gaming-controversy-331bcf5fb519" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Medium post</a>, Stacey addresses this specific concern among others, noting that he himself had believed that technologies like NFTs were &#8220;were irreconcilable with environmental conservation,&#8221; and bereft of value to gamers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243496" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>However, he says his opinion has since changed as he&#8217;s learned more about blockchain developments beyond Ethereum. While Ethereum, like Bitcoin, depends on an energy-intensive &#8220;proof of work&#8221; system that requires what Stacey called a &#8220;ridiculous amount of computer power&#8221; to validate its transactions, alternatives have emerged that are iterating on the less energy-demanding &#8220;proof of stake&#8221; validation systems instead &#8212; like Wax, Cardano and Solana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transactions on these blockchains can be more efficient than the credit card networks we use to take payments in most of our games now,&#8221; wrote Stacey. &#8220;Coupled with WildWorks’ ongoing efforts to offset and reduce the carbon emissions of game development, we’re determined that our use of the Solana blockchain in our new game will not increase the company’s carbon footprint,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Cinder players will use the Solana blockchain to purchase their &#8220;playable NFTs&#8221; &#8212; the Cinder Fae which will include 11,111 exclusive avatars designed by the WildWorks team. The NFTs feature roughly 150 characteristics of varying rarity across nine categories so each will have a unique look that can&#8217;t be duplicated, the Cinder website explains. Players will be able to connect their NFT avatar to Cinder on the day it&#8217;s minted to join the free-form MMO&#8217;s community and explore the virtual world. The minting is planned for early January. Then, over the next year, players will be able to turn game content they design &#8212; like avatars, play spaces and party rooms &#8212; into NFTs stored on Solana that can be bought or sold through Cinder&#8217;s marketplace.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though Stacey addressed fans&#8217; concerns around the environmental concerns around crypto technologies, that wasn&#8217;t the only reason fans were frustrated with this shift in direction toward crypto.</p>
<p>Many also felt that today&#8217;s crypto ecosystems still have a lot to answer to in terms of their other downsides &#8212; including their use for money laundering purposes, or how NFTs too easily enable the theft of creators&#8217; art, and the security issues with &#8220;altcoins.&#8221; Stacey acknowledges there&#8217;s some truth to these accusations, but also notes it&#8217;s early days for blockchains in general, and that regulation and further development may address these concerns. He also said that there are creators who do want to involve themselves with these new technologies in order to help contribute to solutions that benefit the creator community, and they should have that opportunity.</p>
<p>One such area includes creator-designed avatars and other tradable content, which can be difficult to profit from on current platforms like Roblox, Stacey said.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-2243633 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-06-at-2.47.58-PM.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&#8220;[Roblox doesn&#8217;t] create gameplay experiences themselves; they aren’t the ones whose creative output is actually engaging players, but they get 75% of what creators earn because they control the platform and own their users’ output. If I make a really cool avatar in Roblox and someone wants to buy it from me, I can’t sell it to them without the platform’s intervention,&#8221; Stacey wrote. (The Roblox &#8220;cut&#8221; is actually <a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/developer-economics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bit more complicated than that</a>, in part because the mobile app stores take their own cut on top of Roblox&#8217;s share. But the general point that developers earn a small portion of the overall revenue is an accurate one.)</p>
<p>Cinder&#8217;s NFTs would instead allow users to tokenize then sell and trade their creations, retaining more of the total revenue. Stacey, in the Discord AMA, said Cinder&#8217;s marketplace will allow players to retain 96% of the transaction, with Cinder only taking 4%.</p>
<p>But Feral fans aren&#8217;t necessarily looking for explanations. They&#8217;re simply opposed to crypto and NFTs and are making their views known. This belief system may also have to do with how the fans still view WildWorks as a kid&#8217;s game maker &#8212; or at the least, a game maker aiming at the under-18 market. Having begun their journey on the kid&#8217;s game Animal Jam, they see the company&#8217;s move into the crypto-gaming space as an inappropriate one.</p>
<p>However, WildWorks had already signaled its interest in expanding beyond the kids&#8217; gaming market with Feral, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/makers-of-kids-first-virtual-world-animal-jam-targets-gen-z-teens-with-fer-al-debut/">which it aimed at teens</a>, not younger children. With Cinder, the market isn&#8217;t kids or teens &#8212; it&#8217;s adults. The company said the new game is meant to attract a similar demographic to those who would play other crypto games like <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>, <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/">The Sandbox</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/studio-behind-early-access-crypto-game-blankos-block-party-banks-monster-1-25b-valuation-from-a16z/">Blankos Block Party</a>.</p>
<p>More importantly, WildWorks needs revenue to continue its gaming ambitions &#8212; Feral or otherwise. Stacey told the Feral Discord community how WildWorks has invested over two years of development and $6 million into building Feral. While it aims to make that a self-sustaining business, that time hasn&#8217;t arrived yet.</p>
<p>Stacey admitted to TechCrunch that it became clear while Feral was in Early Access it wasn&#8217;t achieving the product-market fit WildWorks had hoped for.</p>
<p>&#8220;We reached the point where we couldn’t continue investing in it at the level we had been and stay financially healthy,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;We didn’t shut the game down, however, because there was a passionate community still playing, and we hoped to find either a new publishing home for it or other means to continue development.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cinder could provide that &#8220;other means,&#8221; if successful &#8212; but ironically, Feral may not survive to see that happen because of the fan backlash. Fans are threatening to quit the game and cancel their Animal Jam subscriptions in protest.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243629" style="width: 1546px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243629" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2243629 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Feral_Craft_Trade.png" alt="" width="1536" height="864" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Feral_Craft_Trade.png 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243629" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wildworks&#8217; Feral</p></div></p>
<p>For some, WildWorks&#8217; shift into crypto gaming was a nail in the coffin, as they took the opportunity to vent about other issues they had with the company. Fans veered into off-topic discussions over perceived failures in WildWorks&#8217; moderation systems, <a href="https://aj-item-worth.fandom.com/f/p/3756416095486237341/r/3757510750109980754" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hackers</a> and its use of headdresses in Animal Jam &#8212; which Stacey acknowledged had been an &#8220;ignorant&#8221; choice. (The company had discussed the issue with the Native American players who reached out, apologized and agreed that those virtual items would no longer be made or promoted. The company didn&#8217;t delete the items from players&#8217; inventory, if already acquired, however.)</p>
<p>The friction between WildWorks&#8217; business needs, coupled with its desire to explore what it sees as the future of gaming, and the real-world reaction from its longtime fans is an example of how difficult it can be for companies to embrace blockchain and crypto technologies. This problem is worsened as the blockchain&#8217;s potential can often be obscured by the negative aspects of the industry &#8212; or, <a href="https://clarkstacey.medium.com/the-crypto-gaming-controversy-331bcf5fb519" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as Stacey put</a> it the &#8220;thieves and grifters and bad art&#8221; and the lack of &#8220;regulatory guardrails&#8221; around crypto developments today.</p>
<p>As for Feral, fans&#8217; concerns over its future seem to be valid. Stacey says if the community continues to support the game, it will find a way to continue building it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they do not, we’ll announce plans to sunset it as soon as that decision is made. It has not been made to date,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;We understand that many in the Feral community are philosophically opposed to NFTs and blockchain technology in general, but while we’ve attempted to address their questions and concerns, Cinder is being designed for and marketed to a different player. They will lose nothing from the presence of assets we created for Feral also being present in Cinder.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to scaling online communities, <a href="https://platzi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platzi</a> CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnfreddyvega/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freddy Vega</a> thinks that edtech can take a few notes from the video game industry.</p>
<p>League of Legends, for example, doesn’t require players to come to its universe art at a certain time and certain place; instead it lets players naturally connect with others who are learning, and playing, the video game at the same time. Vega, alongside co-founder Christian Van Der Henst, is building Platzi, an online school for Latin American professionals, with a similar ethos, offering pre-recorded material, weekly live learning sessions, and the option to learn with other students who are online at the same time.</p>
<p>“We are creating a generation of people traumatized by online learning because they think it&#8217;s Zoom and cohort-based learning, where you have to be learning at the same time and same moment,” Vega said. “Cohort-based learning is based on nothing, and it’s just convenient for business models.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243642" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s a hot take, considering how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/edtech-leans-into-the-creator-economy-with-cohort-based-classes/">cohort-based learning models seem to be taking edtech by storm</a>. Still, Vega’s vision of a more flexible, basic education has resonated with a slew of investors. Platzi announced today the closing of a $62 million Series B, led by Prosus with participation from Foundation Capital, Y Combinator, 500 Startups, FJ Labs, FundersClub and others.</p>
<p>With the new capital, Platzi says it is going to invest more in fresh content and build out its enterprise offering, which helps other startups measure and analyze team member’s coursework on the platform. Perhaps most importantly, it plans to expand its educational offering to help more young professionals, including high schoolers, land jobs in Latin America’s most prominent tech startups.</p>
<p>The most popular classes on Platzi right now are web development, advertising and marketing. The startup also created a soft skills school, and while not mandatory, over 60% of students who take a technical course will blend it with a course on how to communicate effectively or handle deep teamwork.</p>
<p>“The idea is that Latin America in the next 10 years will lose its main source of income, which is oil and coal,” Vega said. “We have economies that are based on natural resources.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Demand within Latin America’s young professional work is one reason why Vega thinks he can address some concerns about a broader changing of tides in the bootcamp world; Lambda School recently rebranded and tweaked its business model in pursuit of sustainability, while Flockjay laid off a number of staff and pivoted to a B2B SaaS model. More than 2.5 million students have used Platzi to date.</p>
<p>As of now, about 60% of Platzi’s students spend $300 per year to access the coursework, which is the same amount of money (or less) that 50% of students make per month per graduation. While salaries will likely increase over time, the co-founder wants this metric to change.</p>
<p>“They had to sacrifice one month of salary to be able to afford Platzi,” he said. “I know I can make it cheaper in the next two years.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/12/apple-boys-and-girls-clubs-team-up-to-offer-coding-opportunities-to-kids-teens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered with Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America</a> to launch a new program that aims to bring coding opportunities to children and teens across the U.S. Using the tech giant&#8217;s &#8220;Everyone Can Code&#8221; curriculum, children and teens at local Boys &amp; Girls Clubs will integrate coding into their activities. Apple says the new collaboration will give students the chance to create and learn about the basics of app design and development. The program will focus on critical thinking and creative problem-solving.</p>
<p>The new program will initially launch in 10 new regions, including Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; metro D.C.; Miami-Dade County, Florida; Wake County, North Carolina and Silicon Valley, with the goal of expanding coding opportunities to clubs nationwide. It has already launched in Atlantic City, New Jersey; Chicago; Detroit; Nashville, Tennessee and Newark, New Jersey.</p>

<p>“Together with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, we’ve already introduced thousands of students to innovative technology experiences, and we are thrilled to expand our partnership to bring coding with Swift to even more communities across the country,&#8221; said Lisa Jackson, Apple&#8217;s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/12/apple-boys-and-girls-clubs-team-up-to-offer-coding-opportunities-to-kids-teens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> about the announcement.</p>
<p>This newest launch builds on Apple’s existing partnership with Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America through the company’s Community Education Initiative in support of its <a href="https://www.apple.com/racial-equity-justice-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Racial Equity and Justice Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s latest expansion of its &#8220;Everyone Can Code&#8221; curriculum comes two months after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/apple-launches-new-coding-guide-for-elementary-school-students/">rolled out</a> new resources for elementary school students, including a new “Everyone Can Code Early Learners” activity guide. The recently launched guide extends Apple’s curriculum resources from kindergarten to college. The Everyone Can Code Early Learners guide allows students in kindergarten through third grade to build a foundation in core coding concepts through several subjects including music, art, science and physical education.</p>
<p>The company has been expanding its Everyone Can Code program over the years and making it available for more ages. In 2019, Apple launched a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/apple-expands-and-updates-its-everyone-can-code-program/"> program called Everyone Can Code Puzzles</a>, which aims to help students experiment with concepts. Last year, the tech giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/apple-expands-its-free-coding-courses-and-materials-for-educators/">launched Everyone Can Code Adventures,</a> a program with more advanced coding activities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to saving the planet, <a href="https://twitter.com/rajil?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raj Kapoor,</a> Lyft’s former chief strategy officer and head of business, doesn’t think asking consumers (or the government) to change their ways is an effective strategy. Instead, he and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshfelser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Josh Felser</a>, the co-founder of Freestyle Capital and a serial entrepreneur, are betting that the future of climate tech begins in the enterprise.</p>
<p>“What we&#8217;re seeing is that the enterprise is totally changing its behavior,” said Kapoor. “By the end of 2021, the Fortune 500 will all have shared sustainability goals publicly and 65% of global GDP has committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.” Amazon, for example, is making efforts to have net zero carbon operations by 2040 &#8212; and recently dipped back into its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/amazon-2b-climate-fund-invest-three-startups/"> $2 billion climate fund</a> to back fast-charging technology upstart for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>To capitalize on the awareness, Kapoor and Felser have spent the last year working on <a href="https://www.climactic.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climactic</a>, an early-stage venture capital firm that wants to invest explicitly in startups working to fix the climate from an enterprise angle. The investors have backed 11 companies to date, cutting $50,000 to $100,000 checks using personal money. They declined to comment on any fundraising plans, but at this point, Climactic has not filed any paperwork with the SEC indicating plans to raise a formal investment vehicle.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243547" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Climactic’s primary thesis is helping enterprises hit their net zero emissions goals, followed by an interest to back new consumer products that will not sacrifice value in pursuit of being better for the planet. Felser said that they’re looking for startups that help enterprises, as they become a “captive base of customers that have all publicly raised their hands and asked for help with the innovative technologies they need to meet their publicly started goals.”</p>
<p>Clean tech 1.0 was more about scientific innovation, led by scientists and academia, while clean tech 2.0, happening right now, is about entrepreneurs creating vehicles or software that is ready to go to market sooner, Kapoor said. The shift means that Climactic is keeping busy, investing in everything from technology hoping to measure and analyze carbon emissions, software that leads to more efficient supply chain and mobility tech for both transportation and goods.</p>
<p>“Just because it&#8217;s hard to quantify the impact of software on the planet does not mean we shouldn&#8217;t be funding it,&#8221; he said. “We can solve that problem, and software is going to help in this battle.”</p>
<p>Kapoor, who was also a managing director at Mayfield, left Lyft in April 2021 after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/">ride-hailing giant sold off its autonomous vehicle unit</a> to Toyota’s Woven Planet Holdings subsidiary for $550 million. Felser, meanwhile, launched an app (#climate) that aggregates the climate change actions from leading nonprofits and matches them with social media Influencers before eventually co-founding Freestyle Capital. The entrepreneurs eventually teamed up thanks to two catalysts: the planet dying, and the realization that nonprofits were not going to change the planet so there had to be a for-profit, sustainable solution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Background in mind, Kapoor admitted that Climactic expertise-specific climate knowledge is “light” compared to the “OG climate investors.”</p>
<p>It’s good news, because Felser said that entrepreneurs are largely asking Climactic for enterprise sales, marketing and pricing help; not nitty-gritty explanations on the bounds of cellular meat commercialization. The firm has employed a number of consultants who have been former head of sales and marketing at other companies, leading to cross-pollination between scientists in charge of revolutionary technology, and people who are less in the weeds (and thus more equipped to help market it to the general public).</p>
<p>“We’re [bringing] a knowledge of sales, enterprise sales and marketing, product expertise and general CEO coaching,” said Kapoor. “And that’s what’s missing from the climate venture community.”</p>
<p>Climactic is breaking out in a time when many are launching climate tech-focused funds, including Chris Sacca’s Lowercarbon Capital which just landed an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/chris-saccas-lowercarbon-capital-has-raised-800-million-to-keep-unfcking-the-planet/">$800 million fund</a>, 2150’s new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/2150-vc-hits-312m-for-fund-to-build-and-run-cities-greener-and-emit-vastly-less-co2/">$312 million fund</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/wavemaker-impact-launches-to-help-entrepreneurs-build-climate-tech-startups/">Wavemaker Impact’s launch.</a> Kapoor is a limited partner in VSC Ventures, a firm that similarly wants to help climate tech startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/vsc-startup-fund-climate/">hone in on storytelling through public relations guidance. </a>On the other side of the table, recently public EV manufacturer Rivian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/rivian-raises-2-65-billion-in-new-capital-as-it-pushes-towards-production-of-its-electric-pickup/">raised $2.5 billion in one of the largest climate tech</a> deals of the quarter, and Redwood Materials, a battery startup launched by a Tesla co-founder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/">raised $700 million.</a></p>
<p>While a spotlight is positive for any nascent sector, climate tech investors must wade through greenwashing, deceptive marketing spin that says products are sustainable when they actually aren’t.</p>
<p>“The word sustainable is appearing in a lot of decks,” said Felser. The other day, he spoke to the CEO of a circular economy company that creates material for more durable clothing. “I looked at it and I’m like, ‘Wait, the source of the material is not sustainable, the manufacturing process is not sustainable…that feels like a sustainable marketing plan, not a sustainable company.” The offset world has similarly received a fair amount of criticism for startups that don’t have the right verification of offsets before selling to enterprises, another red flag that the co-founders are looking for.</p>
<p>The noise just means that Climactic’s first bets will face due diligence around impact, not claims. The bar hasn’t hurt the moonshots (literally): The Climactic portfolio to date includes Orca Mobility, a compact autonomous delivery robot company; Rubi Labs, a service that turns carbon emissions into sustainable textiles; and Muon Space, which is building multi-modal satellite remote sensing systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For now, we can still say that the number of people who&#8217;ve been to space is vanishingly small. But with the new pace at which Blue Origin is sending private citizens up, that might not be the case next decade. We&#8217;re excited to talk to one newly minted private space explorer at our upcoming online <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TechCrunch Sessions: Space event</a> next week.</p>
<p>Dr. Chris Boshuizen has been to space, and he&#8217;s been there very recently — he was one of four passengers on board Blue Origin&#8217;s second-ever human spaceflight, which took place on October 13, and which also carried TV&#8217;s Captain James T. Kirk, aka Canadian actor William Shatner.</p>
<p>Boshuizen is no stranger to the space business either, having co-founded Planet Labs before becoming a venture investor and now a partner at DCVC, where he invests in space companies and other frontier tech ventures. That&#8217;s why his perspective is super unique, given that he&#8217;ll be able to tell us not only about what it&#8217;s like to actually leave Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, but also tell us what he thinks about Blue Origin&#8217;s business and the space tourism industry in general.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243541" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">Tune in next week</a> to hear from one of only 574 people across all of human history who can talk about what it&#8217;s like to view Earth from space, and stay tuned for his unparalleled take on space startup and VC investing in this brave new era of space exploration.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lyft&#8217;s long-time CFO Brian Roberts, who took the company public, announced Monday that he was departing the rideshare company that he joined in 2014 to take the same role at NFT marketplace OpenSea. Roberts <a href="https://twitter.com/bkroberts/status/1467873287405514754?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> earlier reports in a Twitter post.</p>
<p>The departure is another signal of how executives and engineers are migrating from the &#8220;traditional&#8221; roster of big tech companies toward so-called web3 crypto startups. OpenSea is one of several fast-rising startups in the crypto space, which has seen renewed attention from venture capitalists who have minted dozens of crypto unicorns in the past two years.</p>
<p>OpenSea has been the poster-child startup of the booming NFT industry. The startup raised at a $1.5 billion valuation this summer. The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nft-marketplace-opensea-offered-10-billion-valuation#:~:text=OpenSea%2C%20the%20most%20popular%20marketplace,direct%20knowledge%20of%20the%20matter." target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> last month that OpenSea had received offers to raise at a $10 billion valuation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243519" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>NFTs have had a particularly hot 2021, and while many foresaw the boom earlier this year being followed by a chilly winter of inactivity, the alternative asset class has continued to enjoy builds and busts of enthusiasm while serving as a lightning rod of online conversation and speculation. After an extremely active fall, OpenSea&#8217;s business has cooled a bit, but the marketplace still saw almost $1.9 billion in transaction volume over the past 30 days across over 240,000 active crypto wallet addresses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook Gaming might not be a hot streaming destination like Twitch or YouTube Gaming, but the social network is steadily adding interactive features to build its appeal.</p>
<p>Facebook is trying out a new layer of interactivity the company is calling &#8220;play with streamer&#8221; that lets viewers hop into game streams with their favorite streaming personalities. The company is highlighting the feature with the launch of <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/pac-man-community-facebook-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pac-Man Community</a>, a version of the classic that adds modern touches like multiplayer, user-generated mazes and viewer interactivity aiming to capture a bit of the magic of something like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/11/twitch-turns-twitch-plays-pokemon-into-a-native-ad-format/">Twitch Plays Pokémon</a>.</p>
<p>For games with the feature enabled, viewers can click a button to open the game directly and join in multiplayer mode. The game selection is very small for now, limited to the new Pac-Man game and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/worldsfrvr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worlds FRVR</a>, a Minecraft clone that quietly introduced the functionality in August.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243404" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Streamers have control over who gets the privilege and can dole it out as a perk to their most dedicated supporters, a key tool for creators building and connecting with gaming-based communities.</p>
<p>To make itself attractive as a hub friendly to emerging streamers, Facebook Gaming currently gives 100% of revenue to creators, but if that deal sounds too good to be true, it is: the offer expires in 2022.</p>
<p>In October, Facebook added a co-streaming feature to let creators collaborate with one another and stream simultaneously. It&#8217;s a feature that Twitch has had since back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/twitch-launches-a-four-person-squad-stream-feature-to-help-creators-get-discovered/">2019 in the form of &#8220;Squad Stream&#8221;</a> and a necessary one for building a vibrant streaming ecosystem.</p>

<p>Since the dawn of FarmVille, Facebook has hosted a stable of casual games that share little in common with Twitch&#8217;s most popular titles. While Facebook Gaming highlights streams from games like Fortnite and Call of Duty too, the company&#8217;s emphasis on mobile-friendly HTML5 games could lend the platform unique appeal beyond hardcore gamers. As streaming becomes even more mainstream, that could attract first-time viewers who probably wouldn&#8217;t find themselves on Twitch.</p>
<p>Twitch still commands the lion&#8217;s share of streaming hours watched. By the<a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-and-stream-hatchet-q4-live-streaming-industry-report-a898c98e73f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> end of 2020</a>, the platform accounted for 66% of hours watched, with YouTube Gaming trailing with 23% and Facebook with 11%. But the latter two platforms are gaining ground — in 2020, Facebook Gaming tripled its number of streaming hours watched compared to the year prior while YouTube&#8217;s own numbers doubled.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Serve Robotics, the autonomous sidewalk delivery company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/uber-spins-out-delivery-robot-startup-as-serve-robotics/">spun out from Uber-owned Postmates in March</a>, has closed an expanded seed round at $13 million. The company will use the funds to accelerate its expansion plans into new customer segments and geographic areas, which will require them to build more sidewalk robots to fuel that growth.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal is to put robots in every major U.S. city in the next two to three years,&#8221; Ali Kashani, co-founder and CEO of Serve, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p>Uber participated in the round as a strategic investor, alongside Delivery Hero-backed DX Ventures, 7-Eleven&#8217;s corporate venture arm 7-Ventures and Wavemaker Partners&#8217; food automation-focused venture studio Wavemaker Labs. This round extends Serve&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/uber-spins-out-delivery-robot-startup-as-serve-robotics/">previous seed funding from March</a> and includes participation from existing investors like VC firms Neo and Western Technology Investment, as well as entrepreneur and angel investor Scott Banister.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242550" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Serve has been delivering to Postmates customers in multiple Los Angeles neighborhoods since 2018, when the startup was still &#8220;Postmates X&#8221;, the robotics division of the delivery platform. It started a commercial service in 2020 and its robots have completed tens of thousands of contactless deliveries from over 100 merchants in LA and San Francisco, according to the company. In November, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/serve-robotics-and-uber-expand-partnership-to-bring-robotic-delivery-to-uber-eats-301418245.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Serve said it would be offering its on-demand robotic delivery service to Uber Eats</a> customers in LA early next year.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kashani said it made sense to bring on new strategic investors in advance of its Series A round, and these investors provide a hint of what&#8217;s to come for the startup next year.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re expanding beyond Uber Eats customers and Postmates customers, and we are going to increase the number of neighborhoods that we&#8217;re operating in LA next year, as well as going to new cities,&#8221; said Kashani. &#8220;7-Eleven and Delivery Hero have now invested into the company so hopefully we will share more about any collaborations that develop. There are a number of other partners that we are in discussions with right now whenever we are ready to share.&#8221;</p>
<p>Convenience store giant 7-Eleven is no stranger to autonomous delivery. The company recently began a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/nuro-7-eleven-autonomous-delivery-service-california/">small commercial delivery pilot with Nuro</a> using the company&#8217;s autonomous vehicles. The operator of 7-Eleven stores in Korea also began testing sidewalk delivery robots developed by local startup Neubility, and in 2016, 7-Eleven tested autonomous delivery in Reno, Nevada with drone company Flirtey. Delivery Hero has also experimented with sidewalk robots in the past, enlisting <a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/blog/lessons-one-year-robot-food-delivery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starship Technologies in 2018 to serve delivery company Foodora&#8217;s customers</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Serve Robotics has brought self-driving delivery to major U.S. cities and is leading the field of robotics with its cutting-edge autonomous technology,” said Brendon Blacker, partner at DX Ventures, in a statement. “This game-changing technology has the potential to reshape the future of delivery and we are investing in Ali’s vision and the world-class team he has assembled.” </span></p>
<p>Kashani said aside from the closing of its seed round, Serve has some upcoming news about advancements in its autonomy, but wouldn&#8217;t go into specifics. While some companies, like competitor<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/segway-makes-its-first-foray-into-sidewalk-robot-delivery-with-coco-partnership/"> Coco, which just signed a deal with Segway</a> to use the manufacturer&#8217;s robotics platform for its future vehicles, often tout the importance of having a human in the loop for autonomy, Serve aims to remove remote pilots from the equation as much as possible.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our robots can operate independently in autonomous mode most of the time,&#8221; said Kashani. &#8220;This has very important implications for safety and economics of our operation, and is part of the reason we are able to commercially operate our fleet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have humans in the loop, the economics just won&#8217;t work, even if the remote operators are offshore, says Kashani. However, he admitted, relying on humans only doesn&#8217;t make sense if it&#8217;s a one-to-one relationship, as in, one person monitoring one robot at a time. As with Coco, the question with Serve then becomes, how can we improve our autonomy to the point that we can have multiple robots on the streets being supervised by one human at a time? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Robots need to have onboard capability to keep themselves safe when the network drops or when someone is about to make a mistake,&#8221; said Kashani. &#8220;We want people to watch the robots when they&#8217;re doing things like crossing the street, just because, from a safety point of view, this is when they&#8217;re interacting with cars. Sometimes the humans take over if the robot can&#8217;t figure it out, sometimes they don&#8217;t. Usually the robot makes an attempt to figure situations out by itself and then if it can&#8217;t, a person can step in, but part of it is because of the time it takes. You don&#8217;t want to wait if you&#8217;re on a timeline.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Sidewalk robot delivery is just starting to heat up as an industry, and with it will be a race among companies to come up with the most sophisticated technology and the best go-to-market strategy. With this round of funding, and its accompanying partners, Serve is already prepping for scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;7-Eleven represents convenience stores we could work with, Delivery Hero gives you a sense of delivery platforms we could work with,&#8221; Aduke Thelwell, head of communications at Serve, told TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;re certainly going to engage with restaurant chains and over time, there&#8217;s medical delivery, pharmacy, alcohol, cannabis, et cetera. So it is the gamut that you&#8217;d expect we&#8217;re going after in terms of partnerships.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. securities regulators have opened a probe into Tesla over allegations from a whistleblower that the company did not disclose to shareholders fire risks from its solar panel systems.</p>
<p>The allegations were made by Steven Henkes, a former Tesla employee, who filed his complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission back in 2019, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/exclusive-sec-probes-tesla-over-whistleblower-claims-solar-panel-defects-2021-12-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters reported</a>. The probe only came to light after Henkes filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the commission regarding the outcome of his original whistleblower allegations.</p>
<p>While the SEC did not provide any records to Henkes, it did confirm in a September 24 letter that “the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing.” The SEC told TechCrunch that it &#8220;does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243525" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In his complaint, Henkes alleges that Tesla and SolarCity &#8212; its subsidiary that it acquired in 2016 &#8212; did not let customers know about defective electrical connectors that could cause fire.</p>
<p>Henkes was fired from Tesla in August 2020 after working for the company for nearly four and a half years, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before his role was terminated, he was a field quality manager. He also previously worked as a manager focused on quality development and planning for Toyota North America.</p>
<p>Henkes later sued Tesla for wrongful termination, claiming that his dismissal was in retaliation for raising safety concerns. According to his complaint, he notified Tesla about the fire risk prior to expressing his concerns to the SEC.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that issues regarding the safety of Tesla’s solar panels have come to light. In 2019, the automaker was sued by Walmart over allegations of breach of contract and gross negligence after rooftop solar panel systems on seven of the retailer&#8217;s stores allegedly caught fire. Walmart dropped the lawsuit after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/walmart-reaches-settlement-with-tesla-over-solar-panel-fires-drops-lawsuit/">reaching a settlement</a> with Tesla.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was also revealed by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-project-titan-replace-bad-solar-panel-parts-2019-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Insider</a> that Tesla undertook a massive project, codenamed Project Titan, to replace faulty solar panel connectors.</p>
<p>Tesla is also facing a separate safety investigation from another federal regulator. The National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration is also investigating the automaker regarding incidents of crashes that took place when Tesla’s Autopilot advanced driver assistance system was engaged.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-hadley-8441397/">James Hadley</a> is the CEO and founder of <a href="https://www.immersivelabs.com/">Immersive Labs</a>, the company enabling organizations to continuously measure and optimize the human cyber capabilities of their entire workforce.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">There are plenty of barriers to entry for a career in cybersecurity &#8212; or so the workforce of today believes. At the (ISC)² Security Congress 2021 event,<a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/analysis/careers/cyber-careers-still-perceived-by-many-as-expensive-unattainable?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=SCUS_Newswire_%7B%7Bnow%7Cdate%3A%25Y%25m%25d%7D%7D&amp;hmSubId=%7B%7Bcontact.cms_id_encrypted%7D%7D&amp;email_hash=%7B%7Bcontact.email%7Cmd5%7D%7D&amp;mkt_tok=MTg4LVVOWi02NjAAAAGANvepq5q8nFWfYZKrsIMsSr802-_dTKBzCauG36fCU1lpNfFdYJj7DqX7kBcVs301UDH6bQgqBP6JIpm4oKCAhY3SiGT8fTMfmBjl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> panelists noted</a> that individuals are put off because they believe they need to have advanced technical abilities gained in further education.</p>
<p>Not only do such hurdles hinder equality, but they could also hamper an organization’s ability to defend against an attack.</p>
<p>There is a massive range of complex issues open to abuse by attackers. They don’t care how they gain access to an organization &#8212; just that they do. This ultra-pragmatic mindset liberates them and gives them purity of focus that transcends everything. Unbounded by factors such as group politics, gender, appearance, regulations, geographies and social standing, they don&#8217;t want a particular person for the job &#8212; they just want the best skills.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243290" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Take, for example, the dark markets where attackers scout for team members. Picking from an anonymized and globally dispersed talent pool, people are evaluated purely on capability. If someone with standing says you are the best malware distribution person, phisher or web app hacker, you get the job. No certificates required, no four-stage interviews to see if you have the same worldview as your colleagues &#8212; just a job.</p>
<p>This eliminates the subconscious hiring bias that counterparts on the defensive side of cyber are conditioned into. Education, certifications, years in the role, shared experiences: It is a puzzle made up of a vast number of pieces, many of which are largely irrelevant and limit the talent flowing into organizations to people who fit a certain “type.”</p>
<p>The way attackers work naturally breathes more diversity into their ranks. If the only qualification required is whether you can do the job, geography, economic background, gender, race and neurodiversity become non-issues.</p>
<p>This provides an edge. In cybersecurity, where success often relies on doing the unexpected, diversity of thought is a valuable weapon. If the defensive team is standardized, but the attack group is diverse, it has a larger pool of perspectives from which to draw.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Diversity as a defensive weapon</h2>
<p>For this reason, the need to attract new and different types of talent in cybersecurity is crucial. It surfaces new types of thinking, which, in turn, provides problem-solving skills that could help regain the competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Diversity in defense is about bringing together a wealth of different perspectives, solutions, experiences and ideas, all of which are absolutely vital to keeping ahead of threats. Ultimately, cybersecurity needs an approach to diversity that’s as pragmatic as the attackers &#8212; one that focuses on breadth of skills first and does away with long lists of expensive certifications and qualifications.</p>
<p>We all have different ways of looking at things, which has a significant impact on the way we react in times of crisis. Put simply, one person could fail to see a solution that’s glaringly obvious to another. Studies have shown that diversity has a huge<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/annapowers/2018/06/27/a-study-finds-that-diverse-companies-produce-19-more-revenue/?sh=1227d10b506f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> practical application</a> to problem-solving in the workplace, as it brings a wealth of different knowledge, skills and judgment to the table. When organizations have this breadth of knowledge and thinking in crisis scenarios, it gives them the upper hand to fend off the sophisticated attackers that make up today’s environment of threats.</p>
<h2>Prioritizing skills when hiring and retaining talent</h2>
<p>We need to remove the myth in cybersecurity that candidates must tick off a range of qualifications and certifications if they hope to enter the industry or advance their careers.</p>
<p>Aside from the fact that certifications are made obsolete very quickly by the pace of the threat landscape, they are also out of reach of many people. This introduces an artificial barrier to entry that undermines diversity in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Instead, why not copy the hackers? Hire based on the ability to do the job. Put candidates to the test to uncover unique problem-solving qualities and capabilities. Whether they have a piece of paper has no bearing on whether they can spot a vulnerable application at 50 paces.</p>
<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/research-how-companies-committed-to-diverse-hiring-still-fail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HBR research</a> suggests that unconscious biases underpin many hiring processes, pulling the wrong candidates into organizations’ recruiting funnels. This has to change because it holds defensive teams back by introducing the kind of flat approach to problem-solving that brings risk.</p>
<h2>Encouraging new and different talent to join — and stay in — the field</h2>
<p>As with many things in technology, new disruptive ways of thinking are required to address the problem. There is a need to instill platforms, funding, policies and processes that diversify the talent pool in cybersecurity, opening it up to as wide a range of backgrounds as possible.</p>
<p>Intelligence and law enforcement agencies are leading the way, keen to reclaim the edge from attackers. What started with the FBI grappling with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/d737mx/the-fbi-cant-find-hackers-that-dont-smoke-pot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether to hire hackers who smoke cannabis</a> in 2014 has turned into more formalized programs with open arms to diversity.</p>
<p>Organizations such as GCHQ, the U.K.’s signals intelligence agency, are leading the way by actively hiring neurodiverse individuals for their unique ability to spot patterns in data. As with anything in cyber, what starts in intelligence agencies has a knack of achieving mainstream adoption with those defending large corporations.</p>
<p>Those in cybersecurity need to recognize that diversity is about more than just equality. It is about optimizing defensive capabilities by having access to the widest possible range of problem-solving abilities. In a space defined by pragmatism, this means getting a head start on initiatives that measure and hire based on knowledge, skills and judgment &#8212; not pieces of paper.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">One of the toughest nuts to crack when it comes to developing carbon-free transportation is flying. Commercial electric planes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/we-wont-have-electric-airplanes-until-battery-tech-improves-160058357.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">won&#8217;t be feasible</a> until batteries become more powerful and lightweight. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hydrogen/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">Hydrogen-powered</a> flight is another possible way forward, and a research group has <a href="https://dft-newsroom.prgloo.com/news/government-backed-liquid-hydrogen-plane-paves-way-for-zero-emission-flight" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">revealed</a> what such a plane could look like.</p>
<p>The FlyZero project, which is led by the Aerospace Technology Institute and funded by the UK government, came up with a concept for a liquid hydrogen-powered midsize aircraft. It said the plane would be able to fly 279 passengers non-stop from London to San Francisco, or from London to Auckland, New Zealand with one stop for refueling. The aircraft, which has a 54-meter wingspan with two turbofan engines, would offer the &#8220;same speed and comfort as today’s aircraft&#8221; but with zero carbon emissions.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The ATI says its concept plane would have cryogenic fuel tanks in the rear fuselage, which would store hydrogen at -250 degrees Celsius (-418 degrees Farenheit). Two smaller &#8220;cheek&#8221; tanks along the forward fuselage would keep the plane balanced as fuel is used.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We&#8217;re years away from commercial hydrogen aircraft becoming a reality, though. The refueling infrastructure doesn&#8217;t exist yet and hydrogen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-06/u-k-showcases-hydrogen-powered-jetliner-concept?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=tech&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1">is more expensive</a> and difficult to store onboard than kerosene-based fuel. Those types of planes might not be too much of a pipe dream, however.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243507" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The ATI <a href="https://www.ati.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FlyZero-one-stop-global-connectivity-FINAL-3.12.21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1">expects</a> that, by the middle of the 2030s, efficient hydrogen planes might be a more economical option than current planes. That&#8217;s partly because other sectors are shifting toward hydrogen, which is likely to reduce supply costs.</p>
<p>The FlyZero project plans to publish more detailed findings early next year, including concepts for regional, narrowbody and midsize aircraft, economic and market reports, roadmaps for the required tech and a sustainability assessment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok has launched a new app for its seller community taking advantage of its suite of TikTok Shopping features, but the app is only available in Indonesia at present. TikTok Seller, as the app is called, allows TikTok&#8217;s seller community to run all aspects of their TikTok shop from their mobile device, from initially registering as a seller to managing inventory and orders to analyzing their online business, among other things.</p>
<p>The app also lets sellers register their campaigns and manage their promotions, engage in customer service, as well as access seller education materials, the app store listing explains.</p>
<p>The app was made available <a href="https://apps.apple.com/id/app/id1591003012" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on iOS devices</a> as of December 3, but launched on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=id&amp;id=com.tiktokshop.seller" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a> last month. According to data from Sensor Tower, the app is ranked No. 42 in Google Play&#8217;s Top Shopping category, and No. 5 in its Top New Shopping category. On iOS, the app is No. 52 in Shopping on the Indonesian App Store, per its app&#8217;s listing page.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243385" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>TikTok confirmed the app is launching in Indonesia where the company is running its TikTok Shopping pilot programs and continues to test a growing suite of commercial solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are always looking at ways to enhance our community&#8217;s experience and regularly test new features that inspire creativity, bring joy and innovate the TikTok experience,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson said. &#8220;Brands on TikTok have found a creative outlet to authentically connect with audiences, and we&#8217;re excited to experiment with new commerce opportunities that enable our community to discover and engage with what they love,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>Indonesia for some time has served as a test market for many of TikTok&#8217;s investments in its e-commerce business, thanks in part to the growing adoption of smartphones in the country and a hunger for online services catering to its mobile-first population. In 2020, around 64% of the country&#8217;s population was accessing the internet from their mobile phones, and that figure is expected to grow to 81% by 2026, per <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/558642/number-of-mobile-internet-user-in-indonesia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statista data</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this year, for example, TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/this-week-in-apps-sneak-peek-at-tiktok-shopping-new-ios-and-android-betas-kids-app-prodigy-hit-with-ftc-complaint/">launched</a> a &#8220;Seller University&#8221; <a href="https://seller-id.tiktok.com/university/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> aimed at its Indonesian audience, where it detailed how brands could advertise their products on videos and helped sellers get started on its app. The company confirmed at the time the site was one of many tests of its e-commerce solutions in Indonesia. Later in 2021, TikTok more formally introduced its suite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tiktok-expands-shopify-partnership-pilots-tiktok-shopping-in-us-uk-and-canada/">of TikTok Shopping tools</a>, allowing merchants to add a &#8220;Shopping&#8221; tab to their TikTok profiles and sync product catalogs to create mini-storefronts on the app. Shopify was a debut partner on this initiative in select markets, including the U.S., but TikTlok later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">expanded its range of partners</a> to include others like Square, Ecwid and PrestaShop, and more.</p>
<p>Today, sellers can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">highlight their products</a> in TikTok videos and direct users to product pages on their website. The newer LIVE shopping features allow brands and sellers to share dynamic links while streaming a live broadcast. And sellers have access to a handful of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">ad formats</a> for online shopping, which allow them to target users with personalized videos, generate leads and offer swipeable product catalogs.</p>
<p>It makes sense, then, that the company would see a dedicated app as the next step in addressing the needs of its mobile selling community, particularly in a smartphone-heavy market like Indonesia.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no word on if or when TikTok will make its new dedicated Seller app available to other markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based smartphone-as-a-service provider <a href="https://www.everphone.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everphone</a> has topped up with $65 million in a Series C equity raise in addition to taking $135 million in debt financing &#8212; for a total raise of $200 million.</p>
<p>The latest tranche of funding is led by German private equity investor Cadence Growth Capital (CGC), which is now Everphone&#8217;s biggest shareholder.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom, AlleyCorp and signals Venture Capital also participated as returning investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243427" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new financing follows Everphone&#8217;s $40 million Series B, closed in summer 2020, as the 2016-founded startup reported an uplift in interest driven by the COVID-19-triggered remote working boom.</p>
<p>Everphone&#8217;s business takes care of the supply, support, repair/replacement and recycling of mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) for enterprises customers &#8212; billed under a per-user monthly subscription.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s a device rental model the startup touts as being more sustainable than alternative routes for provisioning mobile devices (such as buying devices outright) &#8212; arguing it saves environmental resources by baking in circularity from the start.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As well as taking care of its customers&#8217; hardware procurement needs &#8212; and the refurbishment/recycling/reuse of used mobile devices &#8212; Everphone bakes in MDM (mobile device management), touting reduced IT support costs as another perk of paying it to take the device strain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Over the past year it&#8217;s been expanding internationally &#8212; and says the new capital will go toward further internationalization in Europe and the U.S. as it vies up to win more customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Series C funds will also go on increasing its headcount, spending on product development and growing its active device fleet &#8212; which it says now numbers over 100,000 devices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting in a statement, Leonard Clemens, co-founder and managing partner at CGC, added: “We have been accompanying <span class="il">Everphone</span> for years and see great potential for a successful positioning as a partner for customers from the enterprise and SME sectors in Germany, Europe, and the USA. <span class="il">Everphone</span>&#8216;s <span class="il">one</span>-stop solution fits perfectly into our time of change enabling flexible working hours and, lately, hybrid location models. This makes <span class="il">Everphone</span> an enabler of New Work and, at the same time, implements sustainability with a significant contribution to the Circular Economy.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The larger context for SenseTime's debut is that it is going public after the Chinese government cracked down on a number of tech sectors in the country. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Here in the United States, we&#8217;re <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">counting down to the Nubank</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/hashicorps-ipo-filing-reveals-a-growing-business-but-at-a-slower-pace/">HashiCorp IPOs</a> that should touch down in mere days. But those are not the only technology offerings to keep eyes on at the moment. SenseTime, a Chinese AI company, is also listing this week, providing a new window into the value of the country&#8217;s upstart tech companies under a changed regulatory regime.</p>
<p>As Didi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/chinas-ride-hailing-giant-is-delisting-from-new-york/">looks to delist from U.S. markets</a> amid <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4472259-alibaba-baba-stock-possible-delisting">hubbub that Alibaba could do the same</a>, it&#8217;s not a surprise that SenseTime will list in Hong Kong and not the Nasdaq or NYSE.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Despite listing close to home, however, SenseTime is not having the best time possible in its public-market debut. The company&#8217;s IPO, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3158603/sensetime-shrinks-hong-kong-ipo-size-62-cent-us768-million">according to the South China Morning Post</a>, &#8220;plans to raise as much as HK$5.99 billion (US$768 million) by selling 1.5 billion shares at HK$3.85 to HK$3.99 each.&#8221; Raising three-quarters of a billion dollars is nothing to sneeze at, but at the same time is a far cry from the $2 billion that SenseTime wanted to raise.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s offering is expected to begin tomorrow, so expect to hear more about its listing over the coming day.</p>
<p>SenseTime could command a valuation of as much as $17 billion in its IPO, depending on its final price. Is that figure strong? And what can we learn from comparing the company&#8217;s miniaturized IPO to its operating results? Let&#8217;s dive into the numbers and see what we can find out.</p>
<h2>Fast, expensive growth</h2>
<p>SenseTime builds AI products. Or as it puts it in its <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/app/sehk/2021/103756/documents/sehk21082702575.pdf">IPO prospectus</a>, it has &#8220;built a first-of-its-kind universal AI infrastructure to achieve mass production of a diverse and growing portfolio of AI models with rich functionality and superior accuracy.&#8221; Normally we wouldn&#8217;t quote something as self-serving as that particular riff, but the <em>breadth</em> implied by the comment was noteworthy.</p>
<p>Why? Because it undergirds SenseTime&#8217;s claims that it has &#8220;leading market positions&#8221; in AI areas as far afield as &#8220;smart&#8221; cities, manufacturing, apps and healthcare. The company, then, has a very wide market lens for its software products.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s business model isn&#8217;t hard to parse. SenseTime notes that it &#8220;primarily&#8221; generates revenues from selling software licenses, along with &#8220;AI software-embedded hardware and related services.&#8221; The company&#8217;s model includes the &#8220;license of software installed on customers’ devices or on-premise at customers’ servers,&#8221; along with hardware-software combinations including physical products made by SenseTime and other companies. SenseTime also provides an &#8220;AI-as-a-service offering to customers for customized model production.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lucid Group has been subpoenaed by securities regulators investigating the electric automaker&#8217;s merger that enabled it to become a publicly traded company.</p>
<p>Lucid <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001811210/000110465921146498/tm2134520d4_8k.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a regulatory filing</a> Monday morning that the Securities and Exchange Commission requested certain documents related to its investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although there is no assurance as to the scope or outcome of this matter, the investigation appears to concern the business combination between the Company (f/k/a Churchill Capital Corp. IV) and Atieva, Inc. and certain projections and statements,&#8221; Lucid&#8217;s regulatory filing says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243400" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lucid said it is cooperating fully with the SEC in its review.</p>
<p>Shares of Lucid fell more than 9.5% on the news.</p>
<p>In February, Lucid Motors announced that it had reached an agreement to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/lucid-motors-strikes-spac-deal-to-go-public-with-24-billion-valuation/">become a publicly traded company</a> through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV Corp. At the time, it was considered one of the largest deals between a blank-check company and an electric vehicle startup.</p>
<p>Shareholders approved the merger between Lucid Motors and Churchill Capital IV in late July, after the companies extended the deadline by one day because not enough retail investors showed up to cast their vote. The company is now called Lucid Group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since then, Lucid Group has started deliveries of its first all-electric luxury vehicle, the Lucid Air, and announced plans to expand its factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, by 2.7 million square feet. Some of that expansion will be used for Project Gravity, a luxury electric vehicle SUV that is supposed to go into production in 2023.</p>
<p>SPACs, a financial instrument that came back into vogue two years ago, has been framed as a better, faster way for companies to become public. A number of venture capitalists have also jumped into the SPAC game, which has helped propel the pace of deals. But that has also caused regulators to take a closer look at some of these mergers. At least three mobility-related SPAC mergers have come under scrutiny by the SEC. Regulators&#8217; probe into Nikola Motors led to the founder&#8217;s resignation and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-indicted-on-three-counts-of-fraud/"> three indictments on charges of fraud</a>. Lordstown Motors is under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/department-of-justice-opens-investigation-into-ev-startup-lordstown-motors/">investigation by the SEC and the Department of Justice</a>.</p>
