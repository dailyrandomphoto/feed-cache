										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In something of an about-face, Amblin Partners, Steven Spielberg&#8217;s long-running film production company, will produce several films per year for Netflix. The deal reflects Netflix&#8217;s rising star and arguably acceptance by the legendary director of a new order to the cinematic world where home viewing is a first-class citizen.</p>
<p>The deal was <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/steven-spielbergs-amblin-partners-forms-netflix-film-partnership">announced in a press release</a> with few details except glowing quotes from Amblin and Netflix executives. All that is certain is that Amblin will produce &#8220;multiple new feature films per year&#8221; for Netflix.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the minute Ted [Sarandos, Netflix co-CEO and chief content officer] and I started discussing a partnership, it was abundantly clear that we had an amazing opportunity to tell new stories together and reach audiences in new ways,&#8221; said Spielberg in the release.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those new ways didn&#8217;t sound so amazing to Spielberg a couple years ago when he was reportedly pushing to exclude Netflix films from the Academy Awards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you commit to a television format, you’re a TV movie,” Spielberg told ITV in March of 2019. “I don’t believe films that are just given token qualifications in a couple of theaters for less than a week should qualify for the Academy Award nomination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately no real push was made, though. Whether Spielberg was misrepresented, changed his mind or just read the room, he has since tempered his position. He has said rather that he simply wants to cherish and protect &#8220;the theatrical experience&#8221; — understandable from one of the pioneers of the modern blockbuster.</p>
<p>Naturally it&#8217;s a huge get for Netflix, which will get a steady stream of Amblin features, though there&#8217;s no guarantee of a Spielberg picture. Meanwhile Amblin will continue its longtime partnership with Universal, which fills the more traditional moviemaking and distribution side of things. The company has already broken bread with streaming companies, with shows and films made for and distributed by Netflix and others, but this is most significant partnership so far.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was COVID that suggested to Spielberg and Amblin that streaming platforms are, far from going away, simply the future of the industry in many ways. In a world where the &#8220;theatrical experience&#8221; is a potential superspreader event and people are perfectly happy to watch (and pay for) a &#8220;premiere&#8221; at home, it may be better to roll with the punches and hope that things bounce back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Collectibles boomed during the pandemic and while NFT outfits like NBA Top Shot exploded as consumers flirted with newer efforts, the sneaker world grew even more mature with enthusiasts digging deeper into communities dedicated to the hobby/passion/obsession/alternative asset class.</p>
<p>Vancouver&#8217;s <a href="https://solesavy.com/">SoleSavy</a>, a sneaker community dedicated to giving fans a curated place to navigate the world of shoes, with all of its drops, news and rumors, has raised a $12.5 million Series A just months after wrapping a $2 million seed round, showcasing investor enthusiasm behind vertical-specific premium social experiences. The round was led by Bedrock Capital with participation from Dapper Labs’ CEO Roham Gharegozlou, Diplo, Bessemer Ventures and Turner Novak&#8217;s Banana Capital, among others.</p>
<p>CEO Dejan Pralica says the company has tripled its user base since its seed raise late last year, while growing its team from 10 to 37 employees in the same period.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, SoleSavy&#8217;s community is based largely around a network of Slack groups where users can discuss just about everything. Though the platform&#8217;s chat communities are organized in Slack now, Pralica sees a future where the company could build its own chat hub for members, something to further tie-in the startup&#8217;s app, website and online conversations. The more near-term goal is to grow this community into a hub of trusted buyers and sellers where a peer-to-peer member marketplace can thrive. SoleSavy is at the forefront of a new generation of more social internet marketplaces where vertical-specific communities can gather and grow inside an all-encompassing platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do envision on end-to-end platform that’s very integrated,&#8221; Pralica tells TechCrunch.&#8221;I want to make sneakers fun again and enjoyable for the people that are passionate about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of that fun has been diminished by free-for-all chat groups that can quickly grow toxic or grow exploitative as moderators look to cash in on their networks, something SoleSavy hopes a more curated approach can bring back.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sneaker enthusiast group SoleSavy raises $2M, setting the stage for a community-driven commerce boom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sneaker-enthusiast-group-solesavy-raises-2m-setting-the-stage-for-a-community-driven-commerce-boom/embed/#?secret=Pzh6tqm9Yi" data-secret="Pzh6tqm9Yi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As my boss (and TC&#8217;s resident sneaker head) Matthew said in his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sneaker-enthusiast-group-solesavy-raises-2m-setting-the-stage-for-a-community-driven-commerce-boom/">write-up of SoleSavy&#8217;s seed raise</a> earlier this year:</p>
<blockquote><p>That positive community vibe is what Pralica says is SoleSavy’s long-term focus and differentiating factor that keeps the 4,000 members across the U.S. and Canada interacting with the group on a nearly daily basis … I’ve been in a dozen or so different groups focused on buying large quantities of each release to resell over the years and many of them are, at best, rowdy and at worst toxic. That’s an environment that SoleSavy wanted to stay away from, says Pralica. Instead, SoleSavy tries to court those who want to buy and wear the shoes, trade them and yes, maybe even resell personal pairs eventually to obtain and wear another grail.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company&#8217;s sizable Series A raise just months after a seed showcases that plenty of investors are intrigued by the idea of verticalized marketplaces built up around social communities, Pralica sees the funding as a chance to ignore fundraising for a while and focus on &#8220;building for the future&#8221; while identifying new opportunities in the sneakersphere.</p>
<p>SoleSavy has been pretty focused on North American sneaker heads so far, but Pralica see that hefty Series A check taking the platform into new markets, including Australia and New Zealand, United Kingdom, Singapore, Japan and broader Europe. The company also plans to use the new funding to build out its editorial network with podcasts, editorial features, original video and member events.</p>

Instead, Google search queries can bring up a whole range of results, and sometimes answer your questions without you ever having to click through to a page.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a search like this: &#8220;how many days until halloween.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167439" style="width: 2009px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167439" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2167439 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png" alt="Example of a featured snippet" width="1999" height="1321" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png 1999w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=768,508 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=680,449 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=1536,1015 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167439" class="wp-caption-text">A featured snippet counting down the days to Halloween.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Ryan Sammy</p></div></p>
<p>You can see that instead of displaying the top result right away, Google answers the question for you in a rich snippet. It also gives you related search queries featuring countdowns for other holidays. On the right is a knowledge panel from Wikipedia about Halloween, and below that, you’ll see the featured snippets section. These snippets will expand when clicked with answers for related questions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Featured snippets are collections of sentences or words that Google pulls directly from a webpage relevant to the search query.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Finally, after these answers to your queries and any related questions, you get to the first result. At this point, do you even need to visit the website?</p>
<p>Google search is not what it used to be. We all want to be No. 1 on the search results page, but these days, getting to that position isn’t enough. It might be worth your while to instead go after the top featured snippet position.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s a featured snippet?</h2>
<p>Featured snippets are collections of sentences or words that Google pulls directly from a webpage relevant to the search query. These snippets are displayed right below the search box and are meant to answer search queries quickly. The snippets can appear in the form of lists, how-to steps, tables, short paragraph boxes and other formats.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok announced today the launch of its <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-jump-enriching-the-tiktok-experience-with-new-integrations">Jump</a> program, which expands the app&#8217;s potential for third-party integrations. TikTok began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/tiktok-partners-with-whisk-to-pilot-a-recipe-saving-feature-on-food-videos/">beta-testing this feature</a> in February with Whisk, a recipe-sharing app, though only select creators could use the feature. Now, Jump will start rolling out to all users with an expanded slate of partners.</p>
<p>Jumps can only be built by third-party providers after being approved through <a href="http://www.tiktok.com/jump">an application process</a>. Platforms like <a href="https://www.breathwrk.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Breathwrk</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Quizlet</a>, <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">StatMuse</a> and <a href="https://tabelog.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Tabelog</a> participated in the beta test, and now, TikTok says providers like <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BuzzFeed</a>, <a href="https://www.jumprope.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jumprope</a>, <a href="https://www.irl.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IRL</a> and <a href="https://watcha.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WATCHA</a> will begin implementing their own Jumps in the coming weeks. So, an educational creator could link to Quizlet flashcards to review a concept they explained in a TikTok, or a yoga instructor could share breathing exercises on Breathwrk. For a platform that doesn&#8217;t even let all users include a link in their bio yet, this expands the existing tools creators have to engage their audience.</p>

<p>TikTok is positioning Jump as a feature that propels discovery. Sean Kim, Head of Product, TikTok U.S. <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-jump-enriching-the-tiktok-experience-with-new-integrations">writes</a>, &#8220;TikTok has become a destination both to be entertained and to learn; through TikTok Jump, we&#8217;re creating that &#8216;last mile&#8217; of our community&#8217;s discovery journey and helping to spark action and deeper interaction both on and off the platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>But on other apps like Snapchat and WeChat, these lightweight third-party integrations drive e-commerce. Jump is similar to competitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/snap-turns-on-minis-bite-sized-third-party-apps-in-snapchat/">Snapchat&#8217;s Minis feature</a>, which lets you buy movie tickets via Atom, for example. Both Minis and Jump integrations can be built using HTML5. Meanwhile, WeChat facilitates <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/wechat-2020/">over $250 billion dollars</a> in annual transactions through its own mini apps — there were over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/wechat-mini-apps-200-million-users/">a million mini apps</a> on WeChat as of 2018.</p>
<p>While Instagram has been ramping up its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/instagram-launches-a-new-section-for-shopping-product-drops/">e-commerce features</a> on Reels, its TikTok competitor, it&#8217;s possible that Jump could later be used to sell items featured in a video. In December, Walmart piloted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">video shopping</a> on TikTok, which performed well enough that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">they did it again</a> in March. But for now, it seems like Jump is being used to improve user experience and deepen the platform&#8217;s relationships with third-party partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India proposed on Monday banning flash sales on e-commerce platforms and preventing their affiliate entities from being listed as sellers as the South Asian market looks to further tighten rules that could hurt the future prospects of Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart in the world’s second largest market.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://consumeraffairs.nic.in/sites/default/files/file-uploads/latestnews/Comments_eCommerce_Rules2020.pdf">proposal</a> (PDF), unveiled by India’s Ministry of Consumer Affairs on Monday evening, comes at a time when brick-and-mortar retailers in India have ramped up their complaints to raise concerns about the what they allege as unfair practices employed by Amazon and Flipkart as they expand their operations in the country.</p>
<p>In its proposal, India’s Ministry of Consumer Affairs <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1729201">said</a> that e-commerce firms should not be allowed to hold flash sales in India. These flash sales, akin to Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in the U.S., are very popular during festive season in the country. During flash sales e-commerce firms have traditionally observed the biggest spikes in customer orders as brands offer heavy discounts on their products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Certain e-commerce entities are engaging in limiting consumer choice by indulging in ‘back to back’ or ‘flash’ sales wherein one seller selling on platform does not carry any inventory or order fulfilment capability but merely places a ‘flash or back to back’ order with another seller controlled by platform. This prevents a level playing field and ultimately limits customer choice and increases prices,” the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>As it has done with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">recent IT rules</a>, India is also proposing that e-commerce firms appoint a chief compliance officer, a nodal contact person for 24&#215;7 coordination with law enforcement agencies, and officers to ensure compliance to their orders and as well as a resident grievance officer for redressing of the grievances of the consumers on the e-commerce platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would ensure effective compliance with the provisions of the Act and Rules and also strengthen the grievance redressal mechanism on e-commerce entities,&#8221; the ministry said.</p>
<p>The new proposal may also prohibit Amazon, Flipkart and other e-commerce players from running their in-house / private labels. The new proposal asks e-commerce firms to ensure that none of their related and associated parties are listed on their platforms as sellers for selling to customers directly. &#8220;Ensure that nothing is done by related parties or associated enterprises which the e-commerce entity cannot do itself,&#8221; the proposal said.</p>
<p>India does not allow e-commerce firms to hold inventory or sell items directly to consumers. To bypass this, firms have operated through a maze of joint ventures with local companies that operate as inventory-holding firms.</p>
<p>Amazon, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">invested over $6.5 billion in its India business</a>, said it was reviewing the proposed policies while Flipkart, whose <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/20/walmart-flipkart-deal-done/">majority stake Walmart bought for $16 billion</a> in 2018, had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>In a court hearing on Monday, a Flipkart lawyer said the company sees nothing wrong in offering to cut charges for sellers on its platform if they lower product prices.</p>
<p>The ministry said it is making the proposal, for which it plans to seek industry feedback over the next 15 days, after receiving &#8220;several complaints against widespread cheating and unfair trade practices being observed in e-commerce ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, the new proposal asks e-commerce firms to introduce a mechanism to identify goods on their platforms based on their country of origin and suggest alternatives to &#8220;ensure fair opportunity to domestic goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement comes at a time when Flipkart is in talks to raise as much as $3 billion and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/flipkart-in-early-talks-to-raise-1-billion-ahead-of-ipo/">explore the public markets</a>. Both Amazon and Flipkart are also the subject of an ongoing antitrust probe in India.</p>
<p>This is the second major amendment the Indian government has proposed in recent years. In 2018, too, New Delhi had proposed tougher rules for e-commerce firms that, when enforced in early 2019, leaving Amazon and Flipkart scrambling to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/01/amazon-flipkart-india-law/">delist hundreds of thousands of items</a> from their stores and made their investments in affiliated firms way more indirect.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s proposal comes months after Reuters, citing company documents, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation/">reported</a> that Amazon had given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers in India, publicly misrepresented its ties with those sellers and used them to circumvent foreign investment rules in the country.</p>
<p>At the time, the Confederation of All India Traders, an influential India trader group that represents tens of millions of brick-and-mortar retailers, had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/indian-trader-group-calls-for-ban-on-amazon-following-dodging-regulations-claims/">called on New Delhi to ban Amazon in the country</a>. Around the same time, India&#8217;s commerce ministry had said it was reviewing the matter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following this morning’s announcement that Hyundai has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/hyundai-completes-deal-for-controlling-interest-in-boston-dynamics/">closed its acquisition of Boston Dynamics</a>, another automotive company has posted some robotics news. The Toyota Research Institute announcement is decidedly less earthshaking than that big deal &#8212; if anything, it’s more of a progress check on what the division has been working on.</p>
<p>Of course, incremental updates tend to be the name of the game when it comes to robotics of all sorts. This does, however, shed some interesting light on the work TRI has been doing in the home. Today the company announced some key advances to robotics it has designed to perform domestic tasks.</p>
<p>“TRI roboticists were able to train robots to understand and operate in complicated situations that confuse most other robots, including recognizing and responding to transparent and reflective surfaces in a variety of circumstances,” the Institute writes in a blog post.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2168116" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168116" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2168116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="586" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg 2264w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg?resize=768,440 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg?resize=680,389 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg?resize=1536,879 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1172 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Toyota Research Institute</p></div></p>
<p>With settings like kitchens, the robots come in contact with a variety of transparent and reflective surfaces &#8212; a hurdle for traditional vision systems. Specifically in the kitchen, things like a transparent glass or reflective appliance can create an issue.</p>
<p>“To overcome this, TRI roboticists developed a novel training method to perceive the 3D geometry of the scene while also detecting objects and surfaces,” TRI Robotics VP Max Bajracharya said in <a href="https://www.tri.global/news/toyota-research-institute-reaches-new-technical-milestones-in-robotics/">a post describing the research</a>. “This combination enables researchers to use large amounts of synthetic data to train the system.” Using synthetic data also alleviates the need for time-consuming, expensive or impractical data collection and labeling.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGCwhjw-NTo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>With an aging population in its native Japan, Toyota has made eldercare a key focus in its ongoing robotics research. So it makes a lot of sense that sort of robotics tasks form a core of much of its research in the category, as well as those elements that bleed into the work it&#8217;s doing on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/toyota-partners-with-eneos-to-explore-a-hydrogen-powered-woven-city/">Woven City</a>. And certainly the company gets credit for putting in some work here, before the orchestrated appearances we’ve seen of robotics offerings from companies like Samsung.</p>

<p>“It’s not only about keeping people in their homes longer and living independently,” Bajracharya  recently told me in an interview. “That’s one aspect of it — but in Japan, in 20-30 years, the number of people who are over 65 will roughly be the same as the number of people who are under 65. That’s going to have a really interesting socioeconomic impact, in terms of the workforce. It’s probably going to be much older and we at Toyota are looking at how these people can keep doing their jobs, so they can get the fulfillment from doing their jobs or staying at home longer. We don’t want to just replace the people. We really think about how we stay human-centered and amplify people.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber has reached a deal to become the sole owner of Latin American delivery startup Cornershop, just one year after acquiring a majority stake in the company. The ride-hailing giant said <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001543151/000155278121000531/e21442_uber-8k.htm">in a regulatory filing</a> Monday that it will purchase the remaining 47% interest in Cornershop in exchange for 29 million shares. The transaction is expected to close in July.</p>
<p>Uber announced in 2019 plans to take a majority ownership in Cornershop. That transaction wasn&#8217;t completed until the third quarter of 2020 other than in Mexico, which closed in January 2021. This latest agreement, which was reached June 18 and reported Monday, will make Cornershop a wholly owned subsidiary of Uber. The deal is a logical next-step in the Uber-Cornershop relationship, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The deal suggests Uber&#8217;s bullishness in delivery hasn&#8217;t waned. With Cornershop as wholly owned subsidiary, Uber can beef up its grocery delivery options, a service made popular during the pandemic. The company started offering grocery delivery <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/uber-grocery-delivery-launches-in-latin-america-and-canada-us-to-follow-later-this-month/">in select cities</a> across Latin America, Canada and the U.S. last summer after it acquired Postmates in a deal valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/uber-takes-out-postmates/">$2.65 billion</a>. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement that the company&#8217;s grocery and new verticals business has exceeded a $3 billion annual bookings run rate for this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That’s why we’re excited to deepen our commitment to the team at Cornershop and to support their vision as they scale globally,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Together, we will double down on the strategy of bringing same-day grocery delivery to the Uber platform worldwide.”</p>
<p>Cornershop, which is headquartered in Chile, was founded in 2015 by Oskar Hjertonsson, Daniel Undurraga and Juan Pablo Cuevas. The company expanded its operations to eight countries up and down the Americas, including Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, the U.S. and Canada. The company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/11/uber-to-acquire-grocery-delivery-startup-cornershop/">$31.7 million over four rounds of funding</a> from investors that include Accel and Jackson Square Ventures.</p>
<p>Uber wasn’t the only grocery service with its eyes on Cornershop; the startup was supposed to be acquired by Walmart in a $225 million deal, but it ultimately fell through after Mexican antitrust regulators blocked the deal from moving forward. It is unclear whether this deal will be subject to the same risks.</p>
<p>Uber faces stiff competition from grocery retailers themselves, many of whom offer delivery through partnering with startups like DoorDash or Favor Fleet.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Cornershop for comment. We will update the story if they respond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Soldier-entrepreneurs are unfortunately still a rare breed in Silicon Valley, despite the region’s origins in Cold War defense spending. While the courage and perseverance required to fight in an overseas battlefield (or the office bureaucracy on base) would seem a perfect fit for the travails of the founder, the reality is that the journey from solider to CEO is a long and arduous transition.</p>
<p>A couple of organizations have popped up over the years to make the leap easier. For instance, <a href="https://patriotbootcamp.org">Patriot Boot Camp</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/19/patriot-boot-camp-wants-to-turn-soldiers-into-entrepreneurs/">I profiled back in 2018</a>, works in the earliest days of the startup journey to help veteran founders learn the key skills of building a company and fundraising. Yet, there still remains a lack of networking and funding that particularly targeted this group of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>That’s the opportunity that Emily McMahan and Sherman Williams, the two managing partners of <a href="https://academyinvestor.com">Academy Investor Network</a>, saw when looking at their peers at the five U.S. service academies. The firm is targeting a final first fund of $50 million, and today announced the close of its anchor investor, insurance and financial services provider USAA, which will invest $2.5 million. Prior to USAA, the fund’s first investor was <a href="https://www.scoutventures.com/">Scout Ventures</a>, which focuses on frontier tech and <a href="https://www.scoutventures.com/people">where McMahan is a venture partner</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>McMahan graduated from West Point in 2001 right as the War on Terror began. I “went really straight into the action post 9/11,” she said. From there, she pivoted into a startup targeting the federal market, before founding Capitol Post, which taught entrepreneurial skills to veterans and their spouses and also had a co-working space in northern Virginia <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2019/05/01/why-a-local-veteran-entrepreneur-nonprofit-is.html">before folding into Bunker Labs in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>“My career has always been focused around community, working with entrepreneurs, and really kind of harnessing the energy of the veteran entrepreneur community,” she said. She is based in DC, and also sits on the board of Patriot Boot Camp.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Williams hails from the Naval Academy, graduating in 2003 before going on four deployments in the midst of the war in Iraq, which started just weeks before his graduation. He ultimately ended up at Chicago’s Booth School, where he studied finance and pivoted his career into investment banking focused on M&amp;A. “I knew I needed to learn a lot,” he said. I “started investing and advising startups while as a banker, and then made made the flip to work with Emily to start AIN Ventures.” He’s based in New York City.</p>
<p>The firm’s first foray into venture was building an investment syndicate composed of alums of the five service academies, which was launched in June 2020. “We&#8217;ve got astronauts, we&#8217;ve got Navy SEALs,” McMahan said. “We really think that we&#8217;re very well positioned as a group, because we&#8217;ve all lived it on active duty, and now we continue to see it and continue to serve.” The syndicate has invested in a handful of deals since launching, including into <a href="https://info.polco.us">Polco</a>, an online community engagement platform for local governments, and online identity service <a href="https://www.id.me">ID.Me</a>.</p>
<p>“This is also where a lot of our service academy grads are excited to have a seat at that table and help these companies scale, connect, hire, all of those things,” McMahan said. “So we&#8217;re really excited to be on par with some of these other institutions — the Harvards, the Stanfords — who also have these types of syndicates.“</p>
<p>Williams said the goal with the syndicate was to work out the investment processes for the firm before turning toward a more traditional VC fund model. They kicked off fundraising in January.</p>
<p>The new fund has a two-track thesis of investing in veterans across industries while also selecting startups building “dual-use” technologies that are useful to the private sector and governments. “Civic technology, disaster tech — think FEMA — defense tech, obviously the military, intelligence agencies, and space tech. Things in and around climate that will affect constituents and governments,” Williams said as examples where he sees the firm investing. “We want the company, when it achieves maturity, to achieve the majority of the revenue outside the government.”</p>
<p>The firm centers its investing around the stage right after product-market fit, although since the veterans pipeline can be a real gauntlet, Williams said the firm will selectively invest at the pre-seed stage there.</p>
<p>The firm is also seeking to diversify the ranks of both venture capitalists and founders. McMahan said, “I’m a female, Sherman&#8217;s an African American, you know, even in the military, we&#8217;re sort of a unique team, and so we think we are also able to reach out to a much broader audience of underrepresented minorities, women, and groups, and we feel like we&#8217;re pretty attractive in terms of that as a team.“</p>
<p>USAA’s anchor investment is perhaps not surprising given the financial services company’s focus on active service members and veterans. It has made other investments and sponsorships around veteran entrepreneurship, including into Patriot Boot Camp. The company has also invested directly in startups such as PrecisionHawk and Coinbase.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Neobanking has yet to show that it can generate positive, growing free cash flows over a multiyear period. But their results at least indicate that such incomes could occur in time.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Exchange is back after its brief hiatus. <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna</a> and I have some really neat stuff planned, so stick with us every morning this week. &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></em></p>
<p>Building a consumer-facing fintech company is expensive. And if you want to build one in a sector crowded by both incumbent companies and richly funded startups, it can be <em>super</em> expensive.</p>
<p>That was the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/building-a-fintech-giant-is-very-expensive/">lesson we learned in late 2020</a> by examining operating results from a number of neobanks.</p>
<p>Neobanks are essentially software layers atop banking infrastructure, offering consumers digital-first, mobile-friendly and often lower-fee banking services. The push to rethink consumer banking is a global effort, with neobanks cropping up in essentially every market you can think of. Private investors have shown up in droves to fund competing neobanks because they have the potential to secure users &#8212; customers &#8212; that generate revenues for long periods of time.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Investors have proven more than willing to fund huge investments in growth and product at many neobanks, leading to steeply negative operating results at the unicorns. In short, while American consumer fintech Chime has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/chime-adds-485m-at-a-14-5b-valuation-claims-ebitda-profitability/">disclosed positive EBITDA</a> &#8212; an adjusted profitability metric &#8212; many neobanks that we&#8217;ve seen numbers from have demonstrated a stark inability to paint a path to profitability.</p>

<p>Recent results from Revolut that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/revolut-revenue-grew-by-57-in-2020/">TechCrunch covered earlier this morning</a> show that the company had a deeply unprofitable 2020. But if we dig into its quarterly results, there&#8217;s good news to be found. Neobanks could be maturing into their cost structure at last.</p>
<p>So today we&#8217;ll parse the key Revolut financial results and look at what we can dig up from Starling and Monzo. Perhaps the somewhat good financial news from Revolut is not merely to be found at just one neobank?</p>
<h2>Revolut&#8217;s 2020</h2>
<p>Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/romaindillet">Romain Dillet</a> has a broad look at Revolut&#8217;s business <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/revolut-revenue-grew-by-57-in-2020/">here</a>, if you would like a wider lens. We only care about its raw financial results at the moment.</p>
<p>Here are the big numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>57% <strong>revenue </strong>growth from £166 million in 2019 to £261 million in 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Gross profit </strong>growth of £123 million in 2020, up 215% from 2019.</li>
<li><strong>Gross margin</strong> of 49% in 2020, what Revolut described as nearly a doubling.</li>
<li>2020 <strong>operating loss</strong> of £122 million from £98 million in 2019.</li>
<li><strong>Total loss</strong> of £168 million in 2020, up from £107 million in 2019.</li>
</ul>
<p>The gist of these figures is that the company&#8217;s revenue growth was solid, but improving gross margins allowed its gross profit to spike in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Luxury sports car manufacturer Porsche AG is going into the battery business. The automaker said Monday it plans to open a new factory that will produce high-performance cells through a joint venture with lithium-ion battery developer Customcells.</p>
<p>Porsche invested in “the high double-digit millions” in the new joint venture, dubbed Cellforce Group GmbH, executive board member Michael Steiner told reporters in a media briefing ahead of the announcement. The factory also benefited from a €60 million ($71.4 million) investment from the German government and the state of Baden-Württemberg, where it will be located. Chemical company BASF SE was selected to supply the cathode materials.</p>
<p>The batteries will use silicon as the anode material, which Porsche says will significantly boost the energy density and their capacity to withstand high temperatures &#8212; both important variables for racing cars, which must be recharged quickly, but challenging in battery production (batteries don’t tend to like getting very hot).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For that reason, the factory will be small-scale, at least compared to other automakers such as the 35 gigawatt-hour “gigafactory” capacity at the Tesla and Panasonic joint facility in Sparks, Nevada or even its parent company VW&#8217;s plan to bring<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/volkswagen-will-bring-240-gigawatt-hours-of-battery-production-capacity-to-europe-by-2030/"> 240 GwH of production to Europe by 2030</a>. Porsche and Customcells&#8217; aim is an annual capacity of 100 megawatt-hours, or around enough batteries for 1,000 vehicles, starting in 2024. The initial workforce is expected to grow from around 13 people to up to 80 by 2025.</p>

<p>The automaker has no plans to scale the technology for use in Porsche’s more mainstream lineup of vehicles, Steiner said, though he noted that there may be a chance for higher volume in the future if the company sees a potential to bring down production costs. “In this market, we are looking for special purpose cells for high-end cars and motorsports, and this is not available in the market today,” he said.</p>
<p>It may be a challenge to scale this technology to passenger vehicles. The silicon anode-based cell chemistry has not shown the capacity to function in very cold conditions or to remain stable over many charging cycles, Porsche said in a statement. But it wouldn’t be the first time that a Porsche vehicle benefited from technology developed for the race track: its leading electric model <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/porsche-taycan/">Taycan</a> borrowed many of its technical features from the Porsche 919 Hybrid racing car.</p>
<p>Although the first vehicles to use these batteries will be Porsche-made, Steiner said the technology will be made available to other brands in the Volkswagen Group, like Lamborghini or Bugatti.</p>
<p>“The battery cell is the combustion chamber of the future,” Porsche CEO Oliver Blume said in a statement Monday. “This joint venture allows us to position ourselves at the forefront of global competition in developing the most powerful battery cell and make it the link between the unmistakable Porsche driving experience and sustainability. This is how we shape the future of the sports car.”</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminhiggins/">Ben Higgins </a>is a distinguished software engineer at cybersecurity company <a href="https://www.extrahop.com/">ExtraHop</a> and has extensive experience in protocols, parsing, encryption, security, systems and performance engineering. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration this spring announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">an executive order</a> designed to strengthen government cybersecurity defenses in the wake of several major recent hacks, including the SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange Server and Pulse Secure incidents, which impacted numerous federal agencies and private companies. The order’s importance was underscored by the DarkSide ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline just a few weeks later.</p>
<p>One key element of the cyber executive order is a “software bill of materials” (SBOM) that vendors would be required to provide as part of the federal procurement process. The SBOM would detail the exact software components utilized in a given product, including any open-source components, making it much easier and faster for federal agencies to determine whether they are subject to a vulnerability uncovered in one of these components.</p>
<p>The SBOM is an important step in shoring up federal cybersecurity, but it’s not enough. Understanding the software components included in various products will help agency security teams react more quickly when vulnerabilities come to light, but in other scenarios, like SolarWinds-style supply-chain attacks that surreptitiously insert software components, its impact is limited.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Establishing standards at the federal level for disclosures about software products will benefit cybersecurity in the private sector, as well as improve the overall security of the software supply chain.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That’s why the Biden administration should extend the cyber executive order to include not only an SBOM, but also “behavior transparency.”</p>
<p>Transparency requirements are not a new concept in technology. Certificate transparency (CT) is a public ledger of all certificates issued by any public certificate authority (CA) that provides a framework for monitoring and auditing CA activity, while Apple’s recently announced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency">App Tracking Transparency</a> allows users to see what activity apps are tracking and opt out. Behavior transparency is a proposed application of this concept to known software behaviors.</p>
<p>The purpose of a behavior transparency framework is to enumerate the expected actions of interest that a given piece of software will take on a device or on the network. This helps security analysts distinguish between expected noise and indications of compromise. This, in turn, can give security teams an advantage in identifying the exploitation of unknown vulnerabilities in any proprietary or open-source software.</p>
<p>The good news is that the enumeration of common software behaviors is already a standard industry practice for external network activity. Most major software vendors, including <a href="https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Other_Topics/Upstream_Firewall_Rules_for_Cloud_Connectivity">Meraki</a>, <a href="https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&amp;id=KB93324">McAfee</a>, <a href="https://community.tenable.com/s/article/Why-do-I-see-connections-to-chk-l2">Tenable</a>, <a href="https://support.goto.com/webinar/help/optimal-firewall-configuration-g2w060025">LogMeIn/GoToMeeting</a>, and my own company, <a href="https://docs.extrahop.com/current/eh-cloud-services/#open-access-to-cloud-services">ExtraHop</a>, already publish lists of common product behaviors. Even <a href="https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/orionplatform/content/core-solarwinds-port-requirements.htm">SolarWinds has documentation</a> describing its network behaviors.</p>
<p>But the Biden administration can help effect critical changes that improve upon this industry practice and improve the overall security posture for public and private organizations alike.</p>
<h2>Establish standards for behavior transparency</h2>
<p>First, the cyber executive order should form a working group in partnership with representative software and security software vendors, as well as organizations such as <a href="https://www.mitre.org/">MITRE</a>, to create standards for the types of network activity that must be included for full behavior transparency.</p>
<p>At a minimum, this should include things like external network destinations, internal network connection behavior with other software components, and, where applicable, a list of associated network ports and the purposes for which those ports are used. The behavior transparency framework should also include other network behavior, especially (but not limited to) anything that looks like scanning or reconnaissance behavior.</p>
<h2>Make behavioral data available to common security tools</h2>
<p>Second, the cyber executive order should mandate that known software behaviors be published in a machine-readable format such as JSON or CSV that could be ingested into common security products like security information and event management (SIEM), firewalls, endpoint protection platforms, network detection and response, and change management tools.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RRizKLr0g9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/enterprise-security-attackers-are-one-password-away-from-your-worst-day/">Enterprise security attackers are one password away from your worst day</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Enterprise security attackers are one password away from your worst day&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/enterprise-security-attackers-are-one-password-away-from-your-worst-day/embed/#?secret=RRizKLr0g9" data-secret="RRizKLr0g9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This is a crucial distinction from the current model, in which most behaviors are listed on a webpage or in a PDF that isn’t machine-readable. With this change, common security tools could use that machine-readable behavioral data to help build baselines for activity within an organization to more quickly and accurately detect deviations that indicate compromise. Meraki is already doing this by providing its list in CSV format.</p>
<h2>Centralize access to behavioral information</h2>
<p>Third, the cyber executive order should establish a clearinghouse for behavior transparency data, administered by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency or another appropriate federal agency. The status quo is to hunt around on a vendor’s website, consult their in-product documentation or open a support case to find out about network behavior. If the information provided is incorrect, that’s also a support case.</p>
<p>The current decentralized approach is deeply problematic. Unfettered network access for enterprise software products introduces substantial security risk &#8212; Zero Trust frameworks have been established to prevent precisely this &#8212; but typical practitioners do not have the time or expertise to individually track down the expected behaviors of each piece of enterprise software they have in the environment. Without centralized access to behavior transparency data, even the best Zero Trust implementations will have major gaps surrounding enterprise software.</p>
<p>A clearinghouse would provide a centralized repository for behavior transparency data, organized by company, product and product version. A forum like GitHub is an ideal mechanism for such a clearinghouse, providing a widely used, centralized repository for this information.</p>
<h2>Streamline feedback between users and vendors</h2>
<p>Fourth, the clearinghouse should include a mechanism by which product users can easily provide feedback to software vendors. Feedback can be in the form of issues or even pull requests, though the companies should be involved in approving changes. This way, deficiencies in the behaviors can be pointed out in a public forum. Most deficiencies will be for reasons like a product update that wasn’t reflected in the behavior transparency data, though as time goes on, companies will ideally make it a practice to make sure these are kept up to date. But there will also be true positives found.</p>
<h2>Protecting the software supply chain with behavior transparency</h2>
<p>The SolarWinds software supply chain attack, first disclosed in December 2020, illustrates and underscores the importance of behavior transparency. Prior to December 11, when FireEye first identified the vulnerability in the SolarWinds Orion software, at least two other cybersecurity companies, <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/solarstorm-supply-chain-attack-timeline/">Palo Alto</a> and <a href="https://fidelissecurity.com/threatgeek/data-protection/ongoing-analysis-solarwinds-impact/">Fidelis</a>, identified that their SolarWinds installations communicating with the attacker-controlled “stage 1” avsvmcloud[.]com domain. Palo Alto observed and blocked additional malicious behavior, but at the time neither company determined that the communication with avsvmcloud[.]com itself was suspect. That’s due in large part to the notorious amount of “noise” involved in looking at network data.</p>
<p>But if more organizations had ready access to SolarWinds’ behavior transparency data, as well as a forum in which to compare deviations from the baseline, things might have played out differently.</p>
<p>SolarWinds Orion doesn’t reach out to a lot of external destinations, so when the first stage of the supply chain attack started hitting subdomains off of “appsync-api.eu-west-1.avsvmcloud[.]com,” an analyst on a threat hunt running a SIEM query, or a machine-learning-based EDR or NDR product armed with that information, might have more quickly determined that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Likewise, a low-friction public feedback mechanism could have tipped off SolarWinds and the industry that what seemed like noise in isolation (“appsync-api, seems legit?”) was actually something far more nefarious.</p>
<p>The cyber executive order, alongside the sanctions on Russia, are strong early indications that the Biden administration intends to take a far more proactive approach to cybersecurity. Critical to the success of these efforts will be the partnership the administration forges with private-sector technology providers. Establishing standards at the federal level for disclosures about software products will benefit cybersecurity in the private sector, as well as improve the overall security of the software supply chain.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The incredible success of the cloud business applications space in recent years has driven up valuations and fundraising across all stages of venture investment. That has in turn increased VC fund sizes, led to massive cloud IPOs and brought a new cadre of investors to further fuel the fire.</p>
<p>The median Series A raised by cloud companies these days is about $8 million and can often go well above $10 million, according to PitchBook data from the first quarter of 2021. Series Cs now routinely include secondary capital for founders, and many Series Ds are above $100 million with valuations in the billions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			There is a widening gap in the funding continuum between angel/seed funding at inception and the new-age $10 million Series A at $2 million in ARR.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Such an influx of capital and interest has upended many structures and long-held norms about how startups are funded. Venture funds continue to grow and must write larger checks, but ever-higher valuations force many firms to hunt for opportunities earlier. The VC alphabet soup has been spilled, making A rounds look like Bs used to, and the Bs seem like the Cs of old.</p>
<p>Which begs an interesting question: Is the seed round the new Series A?</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Seed rounds have certainly grown — averaging about $3 million nowadays from around $1 million to $2 million previously — but otherwise, seed investments are the same as before and remain very different from Series As.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our live show is this week! And we&#8217;re very excited about it! Details <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/register-to-watch-a-livestream-recording-of-equity/">here</a>, and you can register <a href="https://hopin.com/events/tc-equity-live">here</a>. It&#8217;s free, of course, so swing by and hang with us.</p>
<p>Back on theme, we had a lot to get through this morning, so inside the show you can find the following and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Chinese cryptocurrency clampdown is a big damn deal: With lots of the nation&#8217;s mining capacity heading offline, there&#8217;s a scramble to relocate rigs and generally figure out what a crypto market sans China might look like.</li>
<li>In the wake of the news, the value of cryptocurrencies fell. As did shares of Coinbase this morning in pre-market trading.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">Facebook&#8217;s Clubhouse rival is out</a>. The American social giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">follows Spotify</a> into the live-audio market. You have to give it to modern software companies, who thought that they could be both leading tech shops and Kinko&#8217;s clones at the same time?</li>
<li>Revolut is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/revolut-revenue-grew-by-57-in-2020/">unprofitable as hell</a> but increasingly less so. That could be good news for fintech as a whole.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/20/crypto-finance-startup-amber-group-raises-100m-at-1b-valuation/">Amber Group raised $100 million</a>; <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/forto-raises-240-million-in-funding-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2-at-1-2-billion-valuation-301316198.html">Forto raised $240 million</a>.</li>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The South Korean automotive giant now owns a controlling interest in Boston Dynamics, previously belonging to SoftBank. The Japanese investment company was effectively a transitional owner, purchasing Boston Dynamics from Google, which owned the company for just over three years.</span></p>
<p>While its time with Softbank wasn’t much longer than its stint under Google/Alphabet X, Boston Dynamics saw the commercialization of its first two products since launching nearly 30 years ago. The company brought its quadrupedal robot Spot to market and this year announced the (still upcoming) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/this-is-boston-dynamics-next-commercial-robot/">launch of Stretch</a>, an updated version of its warehouse robot, Handle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a recent appearance at TechCrunch’s Mobility event, Hyundai’s Ernestine Fu discussed the planned acquisition of an 80% controlling interest in the company. Fu noted that Hyundai&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/hyundai-shrinks-its-walking-car-robot-to-carry-cargo-get-rides-from-drones/">New Horizon Studios</a> has previewed multiple “walking” car concepts that look poised to build on decades of Boston Dynamics research.</p>

<p>“With New Horizon Studios, the mandate is reimagining what you can do when you combine robotics with traditional wheeled locomotion, like walking robots and walking vehicles,” Fu told TechCrunch. “Obviously the technology that [Boston Dynamics] has put together plays a key role in enabling those sorts of concepts to come to life.”</p>
<p>As it has changed hands over the years, Boston Dynamics has long insisted on maintaining its own research wing, which has given us less commercial technology, like the humanoid robot, Atlas. How this will function under the umbrella of Hyundai remains to be seen, though the company does seem to have a vested interest in maintaining a forward-looking approach.</p>
<p>“We and Hyundai share a view of the transformational power of mobility and look forward to working together to accelerate our plans to enable the world with cutting-edge automation, and to continue to solve the world’s hardest robotics challenges for our customers,&#8221; Boston Dynamics CEO Rob Playter said when the deal was announced.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Music licensing marketplace Songtradr this morning announced a $50 million Series D.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.kredivo.com/">Kredivo</a> announced today it has secured another $100 million debt facility from Victory Park Capital (VPC). This doubles the Indonesian digital lending and credit platform’s total warehouse financing facility from VPC to $200 million. The <a href="https://www.victoryparkcapital.com/news/2020/11/24/kredivo-secures-100m-debt-facility-from-victory-park-capital-to-boost-indonesian-expansion/">first round </a>was closed in July 2020.</p>
<p>Kredivo is operated by Singapore-based fintech FinAccel. This is the largest loan facility it has raised so far, and is VPC’s biggest debt commitment to a fintech company outside of the United States and Europe, as well as its only investment in Southeast Asia. Kredivo will use the debt facility to help achieve its goal of serving 10 million customers in Indonesia.</p>

<p>Other notable startups that have received debt financing from VPC include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/">Razor Group</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/factory14-raises-200m-to-jump-into-the-amazon-marketplace-roll-up-race/">factory 14</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/latin-america-roundup-softbank-bets-on-brazillian-unicorns-and-konfio-raises-250m-for-lending-plans/">Konfio</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/26/ipo-on-horizon-subprime-lending-startup-elevate-adds-545m-in-credit-from-victory-park-capital/">Elevate</a>.</p>
<p>Kredivo has more than three million customers and offers two main types of lending products: zero-interest 30-day &#8220;‘buy now, pay later&#8221; financing for e-commerce and offline purchases, and three-, six- and 12-month installment loans with an interest rate of 2.6% a month, or a maximum annual rate of 53.36%. Kredivo chief executive officer Akshay Garg told TechCrunch that its &#8220;buy now, pay later&#8221; services are typically used for small-value online purchases, while installment loans are used to finance bigger transactions, like laptops, home renovation or medical care.</p>
<p>While &#8220;buy now, pay later&#8221; services like Klarna, Afterpay or Affirm offer convenience to customers in the United States or Europe, in emerging markets it also serves as a tool to build credit, especially in countries that have low credit card penetration, Garg said.</p>

<p>“Credit is one of the largest and most complex areas of the financial services ecosystem and the fact is that Indonesia is deeply underserved on that equation,” he said. Most banks only provide secured lending, like home or car loans, and unsecured lending is rare. Garg said there are only eight million credit card holders in Indonesia, which has a population of 270.6 million, and that number has not changed in 13 years.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for Indonesia&#8217;s very low credit card penetration rate is because banks are reluctant to give unsecured loans, especially to younger customers.</p>
<p>“What we’re solving is less a convenience problem and more an access problem. We’re putting unsecured credit, or the ability to buy on credit, in the hands of urban millennials for the first time, simply because banks are just not providing them access to credit cards,&#8221; said Garg.</p>
<p>He added that Kredivo’s effective risk-scoring model allows to charge low interest rates, and its non-performing loan ratio is in the low single-digits, despite the economic impact of COVID-19, which Garg described as a “trial by fire.”</p>
<p>Like credit cards from banks, Kredivo also reports customers’ loan histories to Indonesia’s credit bureaus, so they can build credit scores. “What we’re doing is building Indonesia’s first real digital credit bureau from the ground up, and I think our risk metrics show that this is not just for the sake of some funky innovation, but something that is delivering real performance,” Garg said.</p>
<p>In a statement, VPC partner Gordon Watson said, “We have been impressed with the resilience and growth of the business and look forward to deepening our partnership with Kredivo. The company presents a unique combination of growth, scale, risk management and financial inclusion in one of the most exciting emerging markets in the world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As podcasting continues to gain ground among mainstream consumers as a digital media platform alongside music, video, and the printed word, a startup that made a name for itself through building content for the medium has closed a round of funding to help it explore what comes next.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.waitwhat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WaitWhat</a>, co-founded by two of the people who helped conceive of and build the TED digital media empire, has closed a round of $12 million, led by Raga Partners, with Laurene Powell Jobs&#8217; firm <span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerson Collective, Lupa Systems, Capital One Ventures, Maywic Select Investments, GingerBread Capital, Burda Principal Investments, Cue Ball Capital and Reid Hoffman</span> also participating.</p>
<p>WaitWhat says it plans to use the money to continue producing content in formats that have already proven very successful for it so far &#8212; to date, it has seen 70 million downloads of its work, which includes the podcasts &#8220;Masters of Scale&#8221; from Reid Hoffman, &#8220;Meditative Story,&#8221; &#8220;Spark &amp; Fire&#8221; and &#8220;Should this Exist?&#8221; &#8212; as well as invest in its tech and R&amp;D and efforts to break new ground for new kinds of formats.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company may be best known for its podcast production, but it describes itself as a &#8220;media invention company,&#8221; and co-founders June Cohen and Deron Triff want to double down on the invention part of that description, going past podcasting to explore other ways of interacting with users.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re working on an innovative content format for physical well-being that lives inside of workouts, but will come at the experience through storytelling,&#8221; the pair said in an email (which we had to move to after our phone conversation, while they were on the road in a car, broke up. Maybe in-car calls need to be disrupted soon, too). &#8220;After physical well-being, we see intergenerational experiences (parent/child) as another interesting white space that plays into habit and human potential, and are in the early stages of developing a television series to explore this arena.&#8221;</p>
<p>An existing iteration on the podcast theme &#8212; a entrepreneur training course that it has developed in connection with its <span style="font-weight: 400;">Masters of Scale podcast, has been downloaded 10,000 times in its first 8 weeks on the market. And Meditative Story, which focuses on mindfulness, is being downloaded 750,000 times each month. In this they have focused on an important aspect of any digital service: &#8220;As with the podcast format, it&#8217;s all about habit,&#8221; they said.</span></p>
<p>But it is more than that: At a time when podcasting may still be somewhat nascent as a business model, while at the same time at the risk of starting to be too formulaic, the company&#8217;s catching attention for exploring ways to address both of those issues.</p>
<p>Its solution, in part, may be based on creative ways of presenting content to users, but also keeping a focus on strong material to use in those channels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our aim is to build the most valuable independent portfolio of premium IP — one that&#8217;s designed around essential human needs and built with a contrarian strategy to scale,&#8221; the pair said in the email. &#8220;We see an outsized opportunity for alternative content that lives at the intersection of daily habit and fulfilling human potential. Our success is linked to how we build content ecosystems where habit and human potential come together.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is potentially a lot of money in making compelling podcasting content, of course, but for now a good chunk of that is coming in the form of M&amp;A, specifically from companies like Spotify looking to buy much bigger audiences that it can coalesce around its own advertising and paid subscription efforts, or by buying into new tech for creating and organizing this kind of content.</p>
<p>WaitWhat presents an interesting variation on that theme, by building a startup around the idea of innovating within and beyond the podcast medium, which could catch the eye again of the same players who are watching and snapping up content companies today.</p>
<p>Something interesting in how Cohen and Triff have approached fundraising is that they say they have done it in part to &#8220;secure diversity&#8221; at the startup. In part this is about hiring people from a mix of backgrounds but also about how it approaches management and how it endorses those with whom it works.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see our fundraising rounds as a tool for securing diversity,&#8221; they noted. &#8220;We know that’s not a typical viewpoint. But we have found ways to use our fundraising rounds to leap us forward on diversity — in a few different ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>They note that in the seed round, they raised half of the funds from investors who identify as women. &#8220;We did this by raising from women first. Most people thought we were crazy. (&#8216;Just take the money where you find it!&#8217; was the advice we got.) But it’s what we believed in, and it’s what we did,&#8221; they said.</p>

<p>Then in the Series A (we covered it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/21/podcasting-startup-waitwhat-raises-4-3m-as-interest-in-audio-content-explodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>), &#8220;our lead investors had diverse funds, but they weren’t women-led. So we created a carve-out to create balance. And raised additional funds from women-led funds to balance us out.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this latest Series B, &#8220;we shifted our focus from total dollars to representation on the board,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We actually wrote into our term sheet that WaitWhat will always maintain gender balance on the board. In this round, we shifted to a five-person board, so what that means is that we won’t have less than two people who identify as women — or less than two people who identify as men. Our investors haven’t seen a company request this before — but they welcomed it, and shared that they wished more companies would ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>Far from annoying the men in the room, it seems to have gotten them even more on board with the idea of purpose existing alongside business interests.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There have been further calls from EU institutions to outlaw biometric surveillance in public.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2021/edpb-edps-call-ban-use-ai-automated-recognition-human-features-publicly-accessible_en">joint opinion</a> published today, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) Wojciech Wiewiórowski have called for draft EU regulations on the use of artificial intelligence technologies to go further than the commission&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">proposal in April</a> &#8212; urging that the planned legislation should be beefed up to include a &#8220;general ban on any use of AI for automated recognition of human features in publicly accessible spaces, such as recognition of faces, gait, fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or behavioural signals, in any context&#8221;.</p>
<p>Such technologies are simply too harmful to EU citizens&#8217; fundamental rights and freedoms &#8212; like privacy and equal treatment under the law &#8212; to permit their use, is the argument.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The EDPB is responsible for ensuring a harmonization application of the EU&#8217;s privacy rules, while the EDPS oversees EU institutions&#8217; own compliance with data protection law and also provides legislative guidance to the commission.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers&#8217; draft proposal on regulating applications of AI contained restrictions on law enforcement’s use of biometric surveillance in public places &#8212; but with very wide-ranging exemptions, which quickly attracted major criticism from digital rights and civil society groups, as well as a number of MEPs.</p>
<p>The EDPS himself also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/eus-top-data-protection-supervisor-urges-ban-on-facial-recognition-in-public/">quickly urged a rethink</a>. Now he&#8217;s gone further, with the EDPB joining in with the criticism.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KofcQJYvh9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/meps-call-for-european-ai-rules-to-ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public/">MEPs call for European AI rules to ban biometric surveillance in public</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MEPs call for European AI rules to ban biometric surveillance in public&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/meps-call-for-european-ai-rules-to-ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public/embed/#?secret=KofcQJYvh9" data-secret="KofcQJYvh9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The EDPB and the EDPS have jointly fleshed out a number of concerns with the EU&#8217;s AI proposal &#8212; while welcoming the overall &#8220;risk-based approach&#8221; taken by EU lawmakers &#8212; saying, for example, that legislators must be careful to ensure alignment with the bloc&#8217;s existing data protection framework to avoid rights risks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPB and the EDPS strongly welcome the aim of addressing the use of AI systems within the European Union, including the use of AI systems by EU institutions, bodies or agencies. At the same time, the EDPB and EDPS are concerned by the exclusion of international law enforcement cooperation from the scope of the Proposal,&#8221; they write.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPB and EDPS also stress the need to explicitly clarify that existing EU data protection legislation (GDPR, the EUDPR and the LED) applies to any processing of personal data falling under the scope of the draft AI Regulation.&#8221;</p>
<p>As well as calling for the use of biometric surveillance to be banned in public, the pair have urged a total ban on AI systems using biometrics to categorize individuals into &#8220;clusters based on ethnicity, gender, political or sexual orientation, or other grounds on which discrimination is prohibited under Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an interesting concern in light of Google&#8217;s push, in the adtech realm, to replace behavioral micromarketing of individuals with ads that address cohorts (or groups) of users, based on their interests &#8212; with such clusters of web users set to be defined by Google&#8217;s AI algorithms.</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s interesting to speculate, therefore, whether<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/"> FLoCs</a> risks creating a legal discrimination risk &#8212; based on how individual mobile users are grouped together for ad targeting purposes. Certainly,<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea"> concerns</a> have been raised over the potential for FLoCs to scale bias and predatory advertising. And it&#8217;s also interesting that Google avoided running early tests in Europe, likely owning to the EU&#8217;s data protection regime.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SJl7WZOVUX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/">Google isn&#8217;t testing FLoCs in Europe yet</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google isn&#8217;t testing FLoCs in Europe yet&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/embed/#?secret=SJl7WZOVUX" data-secret="SJl7WZOVUX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In another recommendation today, the EDPB and the EDPS also express a view that the use of AI to infer emotions of a natural person is &#8220;highly undesirable and should be prohibited&#8221; &#8212; except for what they describe as &#8220;very specified cases, such as some health purposes, where the patient emotion recognition is important&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The use of AI for any type of social scoring should be prohibited,&#8221; they go on &#8212; touching on one use-case that the commission&#8217;s draft proposal does suggest should be entirely prohibited, with EU lawmakers evidently keen to avoid any China-style social credit system taking hold in the region.</p>
<p>However, by failing to include a prohibition on biometric surveillance in public in the proposed regulation the commission is arguably risking just such a system being developed on the sly &#8212; i.e. by not banning private actors from deploying technology that could be used to track and profile people&#8217;s behavior remotely and en masse.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, the EDPB&#8217;s chair Andrea Jelinek and the Wiewiórowski argue as much, writing [emphasis ours]:</p>
<blockquote><p>Deploying remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces means the end of anonymity in those places. Applications such as live facial recognition interfere with fundamental rights and freedoms to such an extent that they may call into question the essence of these rights and freedoms. This calls for an immediate application of the precautionary approach. <strong>A general ban on the use of facial recognition in publicly accessible areas is the necessary starting point if we want to preserve our freedoms and create a human-centric legal framework for AI.</strong> The proposed regulation should also prohibit any type of use of AI for social scoring, as it is against the EU fundamental values and can lead to discrimination.</p></blockquote>
<p>In their joint opinion they also express concerns about the commission&#8217;s proposed enforcement structure for the AI regulation, arguing that data protection authorities (within Member States) should be designated as national supervisory authorities (&#8220;pursuant to Article 59 of the [AI] Proposal&#8221;) &#8212; pointing out the EU DPAs are already enforcing the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and the LED (Law Enforcement Directive) on AI systems involving personal data; and arguing it would therefore be &#8220;a more harmonized regulatory approach, and contribute to the consistent interpretation of data processing provisions across the EU&#8221; if they were given competence for supervising the AI Regulation too.</p>
<p>They are also not happy with the commission&#8217;s plan to give itself a predominant role in the planned European Artificial Intelligence Board (EAIB) &#8212; arguing that this &#8220;would conflict with the need for an AI European body independent from any political influence&#8221;. To ensure the board&#8217;s independence the proposal should give it more autonomy and &#8220;ensure it can act on its own initiative&#8221;, they add.</p>
<p>The commission has been contacted for comment.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>A spokesperson for the commission pointed out that GDPR &#8212; in principle &#8212; already prohibits the use of remote biometric systems for identification purposes unless limited exceptions apply. (Such as taking place for reasons of substantial public interest.)</p>
<p>The official also noted that to be lawful any such exceptional use must be based on EU or national law; be duly justified, proportionate and subject to adequate safeguards; and would also have to comply with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the new regulation we want to create complementary rules to the data protection acquis, but not ban something that is a priori already prohibited (with certain narrow exceptions),&#8221; the spokesperson told us.</p>
<p>&#8220;For law enforcement purposes we propose to ban the use of real-time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces which are not strictly needed to protect exhaustively listed law enforcement purposes (regarding victims of crime such as missing children; specific and imminent threats to life and human safety such as an impending terrorist attack; or investigation/detection of a limited list of serious crimes).</p>
<p>&#8220;This leads to an overall comprehensive EU approach that provides sufficient protection and limits the use of those systems to the strict minimum necessary and proportionate for the protection of overriding public interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The GDPR lists several grounds, which could justify this kind of processing of &#8216;special categories&#8217; of personal data, including biometric data,&#8221; they added. &#8220;The one mainly relevant ground here is &#8216;substantial public interest on the basis of EU or national law&#8217;. The law has to be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable safeguards.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Law Enforcement Directive also lists several grounds, the most relevant one as an &#8216;authorisation by EU or national law&#8217;. Under the Law Enforcement Directive, &#8216;sensitive data&#8217; may only be processed when strictly necessary and subject to appropriate safeguards for the right and freedoms of the data subjects.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission official also pointed to &#8220;a number of beneficial applications outside the law enforcement field&#8221;, where they suggested biometric surveillance could provide for a public good, such as to help visually impaired people &#8212; saying that that was why it had opted for &#8220;a more differentiated approach&#8221;, and decided against an outright ban.</p>

<p>The AI Regulation is one of a number of digital proposals unveiled by EU lawmakers in recent months. Negotiations between the different EU institutions &#8212; and lobbying from industry and civil society &#8212; continues as the bloc works toward adopting new digital rules.</p>
<p>In another recent and related development, the U.K.&#8217;s information commissioner warned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/uks-ico-warns-over-big-data-surveillance-threat-of-live-facial-recognition-in-public/">last week</a> over the threat posed by big data surveillance systems that are able to make use of technologies like live facial recognition &#8212; although she claimed it&#8217;s not her place to endorse or ban a technology.</p>
<p>But her opinion makes it clear that many applications of biometric surveillance may be incompatible with the U.K.&#8217;s privacy and data protection framework.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>A few Extra Crunch items to highlight before we jump into things. This week, we published an interview with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/refraction-ais-matthew-johnson-roberson-on-finding-the-middle-path-to-robotic-delivery/">Refraction AI co-founder and CTO Matthew Johnson-Roberson</a> as part of an ongoing series focused on transportation founders. TechCrunch has been following the autonomous delivery startup since it came out of stealth on our stage in 2019. Refraction, which built its vehicle to travel in bike lanes up to 15 miles per hour, has been testing in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Now, it&#8217;s expanding to Austin. Our interview with Johnson-Roberson reveals the premise behind the company, what prompted him to step down as CEO and some of the challenges in the industry. The twist with this series? We plan to check in on every founder we interview a year after their Q&amp;A is published.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Later this month, we&#8217;ll feature an interview with Candice Xie, the CEO and co-founder of Veo.</p>
<p>Finally, we have a fresh round of recaps from the <strong>TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</strong> event held June 9. Each recap provides a rundown of the conversation as well as some key quotes from our panelists. The recaps also include the video of the session:</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Taking autonomous vehicle technology from the &#8220;lab,&#8221; — OK, from the closed track — to commercial scale is a pricey endeavor. Not every AV developer has success raising money or access to debt. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/waymo-alphabets-self-driving-arm-raises-2-5b-in-second-external-investment-round/"><strong>Waymo</strong> does</a>.</p>
<p>The company has raised another $2.5 billion in external funding about 15 months after its first external round brought in $2.25 billion. (That round was later expanded by $700 million a few months later.) The round appears to be mostly existing investors, including parent company Alphabet, Andreessen Horowitz, AutoNation, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Magna International, Mubadala Investment Company, Perry Creek Capital, Silver Lake, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and Temasek. Tiger Global was the investor newcomer.</p>
<p>The funding announcement comes a few months after CEO John Krafcik left the company after five years in the position. The CEO position is now being held jointly by Tekedra Mawakana, former COO, and Dmitri Dolgov, who joined the original self-driving project at Google and was CTO.</p>
<p>More than $2 billion is a hefty haul. Although numerous folks, some of whom are in the financial sector, reached out to me to share reactions of surprise that it wasn&#8217;t larger. I&#8217;m more interested in how that money is being put to work. Waymo has now brought in nearly $6 billion in outside investment since March 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that caught my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bringg</strong>, a software developer focused on helping retailers with last-mile logistics, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/bringg-nabs-100m-at-a-1b-valuation-for-a-last-mile-delivery-platform-for-retailers/">$100 million in a Series E round of funding</a> led by Insight Partners. Salesforce Ventures, Viola Growth, Next 47, Pereg Ventures, Harlap, GLP and Cambridge Capital &#8212; all previous backers &#8212; also invested. Bringg CEO Guy Bloch told TechCrunch that the funding will be used both to continue growing Bringg&#8217;s customer base, but also the company’s capabilities, and also likely for acquisitions to consolidate some of the links that go into the logistics and fulfillment chain.</p>
<p><strong>CAI International</strong>, the transportation finance and logistics company, agreed to a $1.1 billion takeover by Mitsubishi HC Capital. This is an all-stock deal that is comprised of $104 million worth of preferred stock and $986 million of common stock equity value, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cai-international-m-a-mitsubishi-hc-c/mitsubishi-hc-capital-to-buy-cai-international-for-1-1-billion-idUSKCN2DU001">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cambridge Mobile Telematics</strong>, a mobile telematics and analytics company, has acquired TrueMotion. The company didn&#8217;t disclose the terms. CMT will now provide telematics services to 21 out of the 25 largest auto insurers in the United States, and across more than 20 countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa, Japan and Australia.</p>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong>, the self-driving subsidiary of GM, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cruise-secures-5b-credit-line-to-buy-electric-autonomous-cruise-origin-vehicles-from-gm/">secured a $5 billion line of credit</a> from the automaker&#8217;s financial arm to pay for hundreds of purpose-built electric and autonomous Origin vehicles as they start to roll off the assembly line. The access to the credit provided by GM Financial will push Cruise&#8217;s &#8220;total war chest&#8221; to more than $10 billion as it prepares for commercialization, CEO Dan Ammann wrote in a blog post. In short: the credit will be used to buy these Cruise Origins from GM, which is assembling the autonomous vehicles at its renamed and renovated Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant. The factory is now called Factory ZERO.</p>
<p><strong>Electriphi</strong>, a battery management and fleet monitoring software startup based in San Francisco, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/ford-acquires-electriphi-as-it-prepares-to-woo-ev-fleet-customers/">acquired by Ford</a>. The acquisition, the terms of which neither party would disclose, aims to round out Ford&#8217;s future EV commercial business. The automaker already has two electric commercial vehicles in the pipeline, the E-transit cargo and F-150 Lighting Pro pickup truck. Ford is betting that the software developed by the three-year-old San Francisco startup will help it capture more than $1 billion in revenue just from charging by 2030.</p>

This acquisition comes just a few months after the Philadelphia-based startup announced a $1.15 billion funding round at an $8.9 billion valuation, up from $3.9 billion in October. Last fall, the company also raised $380 million and bought BevMo, a beverage retailer. Gopuff did not share its updated valuation with this new acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>KeepTruckin</strong>, a hardware and software developer that helps trucking fleets manage vehicle, cargo and driver safety, raised<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/keeptruckin-raises-190-million-to-invest-in-ai-products-double-rd-team-to-700/"> $190 million in a Series E funding round</a>, which puts the company&#8217;s valuation at over $2 billion, according to CEO Shoaib Makani. <strong>G2 Venture Partners</strong>, which just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/g2vp-vc-raises-500-million-to-fund-tech-that-make-industries-more-sustainable/">raised a $500 million fund</a> to help modernize existing industries, participated in the round, alongside existing backers Greenoaks Capital, Index Ventures, IVP and Scale Venture Partners and funds managed by BlackRock.</p>
<p><strong>Kodiak Robotics</strong>, the Silicon Valley-based startup developing autonomous trucks, has a new investor. Tire-making giant Bridgestone has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/self-driving-trucks-startup-kodiak-robotics-snags-investment-partnership-from-bridgestone/">taken a minority stake</a> in the AV startup as part of a broader partnership to test and develop smart tire technology. While the terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed, Kodiak Robotics co-founder and CEO Don Burnette told TechCrunch that this is a direct financial investment. Bridgestone CTO Nizar Trigui has also joined the Kodiak board as an observer. The two companies also formed a strategic partnership focused on advancing Bridgestone&#8217;s tire tech and fleet management system.</p>
<p><strong>MachineMetrics</strong>, a data startup focused on manufacturing, raised $20 million in a Series B round led by industrial automation and robotics Teradyne. Ridgeline Ventures also participated, along with existing investors Tola Capital and Hyperplane.</p>

<p><strong>Motorway</strong>, a U.K. startup that allows professional car dealers to bid in an auction for privately owned cars for sale,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/13/motorways-auction-platform-for-second-hand-cars-raises-67-7m-series-b-led-by-index-ventures/"> raised £48 million ($67.7 million)</a> in a Series B round led by Index Ventures, along with new investors BMW iVentures and Unbound. Existing investors Latitude and Marchmont Ventures also participated. The funding will be used to extend its platform and grow the current 160-strong team.</p>
<p><strong>PayCargo</strong>, the Freight payment platform company, <a href="https://paycargo.com/news/paycargo-secures-series-b/">raised $125 million</a> in a Series B round led by Insight Partners.</p>
<p><strong>Solid Power</strong>, a solid-state battery developer backed by Ford and BMW, locked in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/bmw-and-ford-backed-solid-power-will-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-1-2b-deal/">deal to merge</a> with special purpose acquisition company Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp III, at a post-deal implied market valuation of $1.2 billion.

<p>You might have noticed under &#8220;deal of the week&#8221; that <strong>Ford</strong> acquired a fleet management and charging monitor software company called Electriphi. When the deal was announced, I found myself wondering aloud if the software would be used by the company for its eventual commercial fleet of robotaxis? And that got me thinking about Argo AI, the startup developing the self-driving system for backers Ford and VW.</p>
<p>I was pointed to some comments made by Ford CEO Jim Farley, which suggests that maybe Argo will play a larger role in commercial operations than expected. Farley was asked during the Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Global Auto Industry Conference what he thought about the convergence between what Argo will be offering and I guess Ford in terms of business model?</p>
<p><strong>Farley&#8217;s response</strong>: &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a good question. I think Argo has proven to be very adaptive business, not just the technology. My personal opinion is that I think they deserve the opportunity to be a one-stop shop company and that they will take on more of the go-to-market responsibilities for our AV effort.&#8221;</p>

<p>Autonomous vehicle developers <strong>Nuro</strong> and <strong>Cruise</strong>, along with three other entities, have formed a new coalition to support a <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB500">California bill</a> that would require AVs to be zero emission by 2030. TechCrunch&#8217;s Rebecca Bellan was the first to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/california-bill-would-require-all-self-driving-vehicles-to-be-zero-emission-by-2025/">cover the bill</a> back in March. Notably absent from this coalition are Argo AI, which has Ford and VW has backers and customers, as well several other legacy automakers. John Davis, chief engineer at Ford Autonomous Vehicles, told Bellan back in March that the computing demands of an AV platform means that it may make more sense to transition first to a hybrid model before going full EV.</p>
<p>For Cruise&#8217;s part, it makes sense that they&#8217;d want to ratchet up their support of the bill, especially after news broke that earlier this week they&#8217;d taken out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cruise-secures-5b-credit-line-to-buy-electric-autonomous-cruise-origin-vehicles-from-gm/">$5 billion line of credit</a> to ramp up production of their electric Cruise Origin AV.</p>

<hr />
<p>EV proponents are fired up about the possibility of taxing EVs as one way to fund the massive infrastructure investments that are currently being debated in Washington. The proposal is being mulled by legislators as they continue to negotiate the infrastructure package. Joe Britton, the executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, called the tax proposal &#8220;the brainchild of those who want to unfairly punish EV drivers and hinder clean vehicle deployment.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems that an EV tax could be the sacrificial lamb that some legislators are looking for, but it is important to note &#8212; as ZETA does &#8212; that battery electric vehicles are still only around 1% of the cars on the road.</p>

<p>Here are a few more final items to wrap up The Station.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Pony.ai,</strong> the robotaxi startup that operates in China and the United States, has started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/chinese-startup-pony-ai-plans-to-launch-a-driverless-robotaxi-service-in-california-in-2022/">testing driverless vehicles</a> on public roads in California ahead of plans to launch a commercial service there in 2022. The company said the driverless vehicle testing, which means the autonomous vehicles operate without human safety drivers behind the wheel, is happening daily on public roads in Fremont and Milpitas, California. Pony.ai is also testing its driverless vehicles in Guangzhou, China. Pony.ai said it also plans to resume a rideshare service to the public in Irvine this summer using AVs with a human safety driver. Its goal is to roll out the fully driverless service to the public in 2022.</p>
<h3>EVs and hydrogen</h3>
<p><strong>Canoo</strong>, the electric vehicle startup that recently became a publicly traded company through a merger with a SPAC, made a number of announcements during its investor day event. First on the list was news that the company plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/canoo-to-build-its-first-electric-vehicle-factory-in-oklahoma/">build a factory in Oklahoma</a> that will employ up to 2,000 workers. The factory will be located on a 400-acre site in the MidAmerica Industrial Park in Pryor, Oklahoma about 45 minutes from Tulsa. The facility, which the company describes as a &#8220;mega microfactory&#8221; will include a paint shop, body shop and general assembly plant and is expected to open in 2023.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Canoo to build its first electric vehicle factory in Oklahoma&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/canoo-to-build-its-first-electric-vehicle-factory-in-oklahoma/embed/#?secret=XKr3hGe8M1" data-secret="XKr3hGe8M1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Canoo also laid out its plans for automated driving, which I haven&#8217;t heard much about until now. The details were thin, but Canoo is planning to have its vehicles equipped with a &#8220;Level 2&#8221; advanced driver assistance system, which means two primary functions &#8212; like adaptive cruise and lane keeping &#8212; are automated and still have a human driver in the loop at all times. From there, it seems the company is taking the Tesla approach and believes it can reach Level 4 autonomy through software improvements. To be clear, Tesla is nowhere near Level 4 autonomy, which means the vehicle can handle all driving without the driver in the loop in certain geographic areas or conditions. Here is the Canoo CTO&#8217;s comments about this.</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve got an ADAS system ready for launch at Level 2, with all of the basic features, but we&#8217;ve got an OTA system — over the air upgradability — so as we continue to refine and mature and validate additional features in ADAS, we&#8217;re going to be able to upgrade over time and with our ADAS compute platform, along with the sensor suite we believe will ultimately get us to around Level 4.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, the company also detailed some of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/canoo-wants-to-connect-owners-to-all-of-their-vehicles-not-just-canoos/">features that may be on its app</a>, including a one-stop shop functionality that customers could use for their Canoo vehicles &#8212; and all their other cars, as well. This unusual approach to its branded vehicle app could potentially pay off big-time for Canoo in terms of user data and revenue via sales on services like tire replacements and insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Lordstown Motors</strong> is digging itself deeper into a hole it seems. The company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/lordstown-motors-ceo-and-cfo-resign-amidst-production-woes/">CEO and CFO resigned</a> following less than stellar first quarter results in May, including news that production volumes would likely be half &#8212; from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000 &#8212; should the company not identify more funding. But wait. What is this?</p>
<p>The following day, hope was restored when interim CEO Angela Strand and President Rich Schmidt made a series of statements at an Automotive Press Association event that drove up shares in the company, including that it has enough &#8220;binding orders&#8221; from customers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lordstown-motors-execs-cite-binding-orders-to-restore-confidence-a-day-after-ceo-cfo-resignations/">fund limited production</a> of its electric pickup truck through May 2022. Ah, but hold tight, because the next day Lordstown issued a regulatory filing that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/lordstown-motors-reverses-claims-about-binding-orders-for-electric-pickup-truck/">reversed those claims</a>.</p>
<p>It appears those &#8220;binding orders&#8221; were more like agreements to <em>maybe</em> lease or buy.</p>

<h3>Other transportation stuff</h3>
<p><strong>Financial Times</strong> digs into the sticky issue of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/76fdac7c-7076-47a4-bcb0-7e75af0aadab">Chinese surveillance technology</a> that is used in &#8220;smart cities&#8221; all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong> upped the amount it says it will spend on electric and autonomous vehicle investments to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/">$35 billion through 2025</a> &#8212; an $8 billion increase from its previous plan announced in November 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Lux Research </strong>released a study showing that in 2020 <a href="https://www.luxresearchinc.com/hubfs/2021%20Files/2021%20Executive%20Summaries/2021%20Press%20Executive%20Summaries/Executive%20Summary%20-%20Automotive%20Battery%20Tracker%202020%20Update%20-%20Press.pdf?utm_campaign=2021.06.17%20Automotive%20Battery%20Tracker%20Press%20Release&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=134312398&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8YOW1Cnj4_pA3xyvgDdGIIjrYHK7GdjXCGxE17RLh0JjarrueIF5oLCkwzljhX9B6oEA2PWEEphVrkmguB1lsV16cYKw&amp;utm_content=134311174&amp;utm_source=hs_email">electric vehicles sales</a>, meaning battery and plug-ins, increased 37% compared to 2019. The sales growth was led by 140% growth in Europe as the BEV market took off in several countries. The report noted that Tesla remains the most popular BEV maker, but its choice of cells from LG Energy Solution in China means Panasonic lost the market share crown it had held since 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Redwood Materials</strong>, the battery recycling startup founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, has purchased 100 acres of land <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/redwood-materials-is-setting-up-shop-near-the-tesla-gigafactory-as-part-of-broader-expansion/">near the Gigafactory</a> that Panasonic operates with Tesla in Sparks, Nevada as part of an expansion plan that aligns with the Biden administration&#8217;s drive to increase adoption of electric vehicles and boost domestic battery recycling and supply chain efforts. The company said its existing 150,000-square-foot facility in Carson City, Nevada will also nearly triple in size. Redwood is adding another 400,000 square feet onto the Carson City recycling facility, which is expected to be operational by the end of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As enterprise startups continue to target interesting gaps in the market, we&#8217;re seeing increasingly sophisticated tools getting built for small and medium businesses &#8212; traditionally a tricky segment to sell to, too small for large enterprise tools, and too advanced in their needs for consumer products. In the latest development of that trend, an Israeli startup called <a href="https://www.datarails.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DataRails</a> has raised $25 million to continue building out a platform that lets SMBs use Excel to run financial planning and analytics like their larger counterparts.</p>
<p>The funding closes out the company&#8217;s Series A at $43.5 million, after the company <a href="https://www.accesswire.com/641342/DataRails-Secures-185-Million-Series-A-Led-by-Zeev-Ventures-to-Bring-Enterprise-Level-Financial-Planning-Solution-to-SMBs">initially raised $18.5 million in April</a> (some at the time reported this as its Series A, but it seems the round had yet to be completed). The full round includes Zeev Ventures, Vertex Ventures Israel and Innovation Endeavors, with <span class="s3">Vintage Investment Partners added in this most recent tranche. DataRails is not disclosing its valuation, except to note that it has doubled in the last four months, with hundreds of customers and on target to cross 1,000 this year, with a focus on the North American market. It has raised $55 million in total. </span></p>
<p>The challenge that DataRails has identified is that on one hand, SMBs have started to adopt a lot more apps, including software delivered as a service, to help them manage their businesses &#8212; a trend that has been accelerated in the last year with the pandemic and the knock-on effect that has had for remote working and bringing more virtual elements to replace face-to-face interactions. Those apps can include Salesforce, NetSuite, Sage, SAP, QuickBooks, Zuora, Xero, ADP and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But on the other hand, those in the business who manage finances and financial reporting are lacking the tools to look at the data from these different apps in a holistic way. While Excel is a default application for many of them, they are simply reading lots of individual spreadsheets rather than integrated data analytics based on the numbers.</p>
<p>DataRails has built a platform that can read the reported information, which typically already lives in Excel spreadsheets, and automatically translate it into a bigger picture view of the company.</p>
<p>For SMEs, Excel is such a central piece of software, yet such a pain point for its lack of extensibility and function, that this predicament was actually the germination of starting DataRails in the first place,</p>
<p class="p1">Didi Gurfinkel, the CEO who co-founded the company with Eyal Cohen (the CPO) said that DataRails initially set out to create a more general-purpose product that could help analyze and visualize anything from Excel.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168009" style="width: 2260px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168009" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2168009 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1416" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg 2250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg?resize=768,483 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg?resize=680,428 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg?resize=1536,967 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg?resize=2048,1289 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168009" class="wp-caption-text">Image: DataRails</p></div></p>
<p class="p4">&#8220;We started the company with a vision to save the world from Excel spreadsheets,&#8221; he said, by taking them and helping to connect the data contained within them to a structured database. &#8220;The core of our technology knows how to take unstructured data and map that to a central database.&#8221; Before 2020, DataRails (which was founded in 2015) applied this to a variety of areas with a focus on banks, insurance companies, compliance and data integrity.</p>
<p>Over time, it could see a very specific application emerging, specifically for SMEs: providing a platform for FP&amp;A (financial planning and analytics), which didn&#8217;t really have a solution to address it at the time. &#8220;So we enabled that to beat the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re already investing so much time and money in their software, but they still don’t have analytics and insight,&#8221; said Gurfinkel.</p>
<p>That turned out to be fortunate timing, since &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; and getting more out of one&#8217;s data was really starting to get traction in the world of business, <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/solutions/small-business/resource-center/small-business-digital-transformation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specifically in the world of SMEs</a>, and CFOs and other people who oversaw finances were already looking for something like this.</p>
<p>The typical DataRails customer might be as small as a business of 50 people, or as big as 1,000 employees, a size of business that is too small for enterprise solutions, &#8220;which can cost tens of thousands of dollars to implement and use,&#8221; added Cohen, among other challenges. But as with so many of the apps that are being built today to address those using Excel, the idea with DataRails is low-code or even more specifically no-code, which means &#8220;no IT in the loop,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s why we are so successful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are crossing the barrier and making our solution easy to use.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p4">The company doesn&#8217;t have a huge number of competitors today, either, although companies like <a href="https://www.cubesoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cube</a> (which also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/cube-raises-10m-more-to-help-companies-plan-their-financial-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently raised some money</a>) are among them. And others like Stripe, while currently not focusing on FP&amp;A, have most definitely been expanding the tools that it is providing to businesses as part of their bigger play to manage payments and subsequently other processes related to financial activity, so perhaps it, or others like it, might at some point become competitors in this space as well.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Gurfinkel said that other areas that DataRails is likely to expand to cover alongside FP&amp;A include HR, inventory and &#8220;planning for anything,&#8221; any process that you have running in Excel. Another interesting turn would be how and if DataRails decides to look beyond Excel at other spreadsheets, or bypass spreadsheets altogether.</p>
<p>The scope of the opportunity &#8212; in the U.S. alone there are more than 30 million small businesses &#8212; is what&#8217;s attracting the investment here.</p>
<p class="p5">“We’re thrilled to reinvest in DataRails and continue working with the team to help them navigate their recent explosive and rapid growth,” said Yanai Oron, general partner at <span class="s6">Vertex Ventures, in a statement</span>. “With innovative yet accessible technology and a tremendous untapped market opportunity, DataRails is primed to scale and become the leading FP&amp;A solution for SMEs everywhere.”</p>
<p class="p5">“Businesses are constantly about to start, in the midst of, or have just finished a round of financial reporting — it’s a never-ending cycle,&#8221; added Oren Zeev, founding partner at Zeev Ventures. &#8220;But with DataRails, FP&amp;A can be simple, streamlined, and effective, and that’s a vision we’ll back again and again.”<br />
