										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year of life under a global health pandemic has seen a massive surge of people working from home &#8212; a shift that has thrown a stark light on the iffy quality of our broadband networks. Today a startup called <a href="http://plume.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plume</a> &#8212; which has built a mesh-WiFi platform that helps optimize broadband connectivity and then uses it to deliver a range of smarter home services to some 22 million homes globally &#8212; is announcing a major funding round of $270 million that underscores the opportunity to fix that, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re the best at optimizing WiFi connectivity in the home, but that is not what we’re about,&#8221; said Fahri Diner, Plume&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;We see it as the foundation. We cut our teeth on it but have gone way beyond that to services like advanced parental controls, secure access controls, which devices can access networks and what passwords they use. We focus on sophisticated security, which we believe will be the next big area that consumers will start paying attention to.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ultimate product for Plume is a comprehensive, cloud-driven platform that enables consumers to curate, manage and deliver these services. That’s what the company is about.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The investment, a Series E, is coming from a single investor, Insight Partners, and values the company at $1.35 billion. This is a significant step up for the company, which almost exactly a year ago <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/plume-r-secures-85-million-in-financing-852091305.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $85 million</a> in a combination of equity and debt at a valuation of $510 million.</p>
<p>Unless you have been following the business of home broadband networking, you may not be familiar with the name Plume. But if you are not already be using it, chances are that you may be getting pitched a service using its technology, or will be soon.</p>
<p>The company, based out of Palo Alto, has deals in place with some 170 carriers around the globe that provide residential broadband services, reselling Plume&#8217;s mesh technology as a way to improve home WiFi connectivity &#8212; especially critical in older or bigger homes, and dwellings where you have many people connecting to and straining your broadband network &#8212; providing Plume-powered services like network security, parental access controls and motion awareness on top of that.</p>
<p>Plume brands those added services as HomePass, and on top of this it also provides a cloud-based operations tools to carriers, Haystack and Harvest, which help them with customer support, to manage their networks, glean better performance analytics and provide insights on customer usage and churn.</p>
<p>Plume also works with a number of big and less well-known hardware makers who design the routing devices and the processors and related software that power them.</p>
<p>Some of its customers, like Comcast, Charter, Qualcomm, Belkin, Cablevision, Liberty Global and Shaw Communications have become <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/08/comcast-invests-in-mesh-router-maker-plume-launches-xfinity-xfi-for-managing-your-homes-wireless-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategic investors</a> in the company over the years, which speaks to its traction with the big players in the market. (It has raised $397 million to date.)</p>
<p>There have been a number of efforts over the years to improve WiFi in the home, from faster networks through to better routers and WiFi extenders.</p>
<p>Plume&#8217;s technology is based on one of those alternatives, mesh architecture &#8212; also used by others like Google in its Nest WiFi system &#8212; which uses a single router and then a series of nodes that operate as if they are a single device on the network (extenders by contrast use different SSIDs and passwords). On top of the mesh architecture, Plume then runs a software-defined network to identify and better measure the traffic, using automation to, for example, then detect and fix when a device is on the network, may need more power to work properly, and so on.</p>
<p>In all, it appears that Plume has some <a href="https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Plume+Design+Inc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">170 patents and patent applications</a> in play to underpin what it has built.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that at one time Plume was compared to Eero, the mesh-based wifi router startup that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/amazon-is-buying-home-mesh-router-startup-eero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually acquired by Amazon</a>, which now resells its routers as part of its own mesh WiFi solution.</p>
<p>But the two have some critical differences, based mainly on the business premise behind the two. As Diner points out, Plume&#8217;s service stack is based not around a router (as Eero&#8217;s primarily was) but on mesh technology that plus an open source silicon-to-cloud framework platform for building services to run on the mesh network that it calls <a href="http://opensync.io">OpenSync</a>. This essentially allows service providers to build their own services on top of Plume&#8217;s mesh architecture.</p>
<p>In a telecoms world that has long fretted over the idea of being cannibalized and relegated to the role of a &#8220;dumb pipe&#8221;, it provides a way for them to build services &#8212; apps, as it were &#8212; on top of that WiFi connectivity.</p>
<p>Realistically, however, David points out that only the very biggest carriers (and not even all of them) might have the resources and appetite to do so. This is why it builds services that it white-labels and resells to them to sell on to consumers, and why these are taken up by those service providers. OpenSync, Plume says, now covers some 26 million access points and is seeing a sharp rise as more people fill out their homes with more equipment that they use throughout the day.</p>
<p>“Growth in the smart home category is exploding, but the quality of consumer experience has fallen short,” said Insight Partners Managing Director Ryan Hinkle, in a statement. “We are convinced that Plume, with its scalable cloud data platform approach, highly efficient go-to-market strategy, strong momentum, top-quartile financial performance across all SaaS KPIs – including revenue, growth rates, gross margin, efficiency and retention metrics – and world class team is transforming this category. We’re delighted to join and support this exciting journey.” Hinkle is joining Plume&#8217;s board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.anuviaplantnutrients.com/">Anuvia Plant Nutrients</a> has raised $103 million to commercialize its novel fertilizer technology.</p>
<p>The company, backed by investors like <a href="https://www.tpg.com/platforms/tpgart"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TPG ART,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <a href="https://www.pontifaxagtech.com/">Pontifax Global Food and Agriculture Technology Fund</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <a href="https://generatecapital.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate Capital</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><a href="http://www.piva.vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piva</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is now ready to roll out its tech, which is already used on roughly 1200 farms and is projected to be on 20 million acres of farmland by 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now led by longtime agriculture executive Amy Yoder, who represents the sixth generation of a Michigan farm family, Anuvia pitches its tech as a supplement for crops that can boost productivity by taking excrement, food waste and agricultural processing waste and converting that into useful fertilizer using a proprietary catalytic process. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By treating the waste with a specific blend of chemicals Yoder said Anuvia&#8217;s technology can control the release of nutrients as plants grow to make more productive crops and reduce leaching into soil, protecting groundwater and restoring carbon to the soil.</p>
<p>Anuvia is one of a growing number of agriculture technology companies trying to juice crop productivity and capture carbon to provide additional revenues from more abundant crops and carbon capture and storage. Other startups, including Pivot Bio, Indigo Agriculture, AgBiome, and Agrinos, are all developing other crop treatments that can purportedly boost agricultural production.</p>
<p>&#8220;M<span style="font-weight: 400;">ost of what I see would be very complimentary to us,&#8221; said Yoder. &#8220;Because we put the carbon back into the soil, because the nutrients are held in different way. You could utilize the pivot technology and the Anuvia technology. Those things when they could piggyback together could make really nice solutions in the longterm.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The Winter Garden, Fla.-based company has a 1.2 million ton facility for production, but the company wants to build out additional capacity and continue developing new fertilizers to take to market, Yoder said.</p>
<p>Farmers using the product see increased yields of around five times their previous production levels and the product can be used on all the main row crops, according to Yoder.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That claim has been verified by Environmental Resources Management (ERM), a leading global environmental consulting firm, versus traditional fertilizer on corn, rice, and cotton.</span></p>
<p>Anuvia&#8217;s treatment can also reduce greenhouse gases on production by up to 32% compared to commercial fertilizers. Anuvia estimates that its products could provide emissions reductions equivalent to removing 30,000 cars from roads. If the company can get farmers to apply its treatment to the 90 million acres of corn in the U.s. that would reduce the equivalent emissions of 1.8 million cars, according to a statement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the world’s population expected to hit 10 billion by 2050, we need technology-enabled, large-scale agriculture to meet this growing demand,” says Dr. Geoff Duyk, Founder and Managing Partner of Circularis and Anuvia Board Member. “Anuvia’s technology will help farms continue to feed the world, while also advancing the circular economy, increasing sustainability, and enhancing resource efficiency.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile advertising company <a href="http://ironsource.com">ironSource</a> is announcing its second acquisition of the year — <a href="https://lunalabs.io">Luna Labs</a>, a startup that that&#8217;s built a platform allowing app developers to create and manage video and playable ads.</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/luna-labs-creates-playable-ads-directly-from-unity/">first wrote about the startup in 2019</a>, its main selling point was the ability to create those ads directly from from the Unity game engine used by many developers. Since then, it has expanded its platform to support the creation of both playable and video ads (including unlimited variations of a gameplay video), manage their entire ad library, analyze their performance and even automatically optimize them based on install data. Its customers include Crazy Labs, Supersonic Studios, Lion Studios, Kwalee and Voodoo.</p>
<p>IronSource, meanwhile, has built a platform for mobile user growth and monetization. It was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/ironsource-a-mobile-adtech-startup-confirms-400m-raise-at-1-valuation/">valued at more than $1 billion</a> in its most recent funding round of more than $400 million, and in January it announced <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/11/ironsource-acquires-ad-measurement-firm-soomla/">the acquisition of ad measurement company Soomla</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, ironSource&#8217;s co-founder and chief revenue officer Omer Kaplan said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our vision at ironSource is to build the most comprehensive growth platform for app developers, allowing them to focus on content creation and on building a great user experience, while we provide the infrastructure for their business expansion. Creatives are a key part of that and have only become more important as competition for user attention grows. But ad creative development and testing at scale is incredibly difficult and costly. Luna Labs solves that by bringing high quality end-to-end ad creation management to app developers, and we’re excited to be able to add that capability into the ironSource platform.</p></blockquote>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. IronSource says that the Luna Labs team (currently based in the United Kingdom) will remain in its current offices, where it will continue developing its technology &#8220;under the ironSource umbrella.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://constellr.space/">ConstellR</a>, a SpaceTech startup with a technology that can monitors land surface temperatures from space, has raised a €1m pre-seed round led by FTTF, with the participation of strategic investor OHB Venture Capital, Baden-Württemberg’s state bank L-Bank and an undisclosed investor. The first system is due to go into orbit in December 2021. The company was a finalist for Hottest Ag/FoodTech Startup at the prestigious <a href="http://theeuropas.com">Europas Awards 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The Freiburg, Germany-based startup monitors the land via a constellation of 30 CubeSats with thermal infrared payloads. The data generated is used by farmers to reduce water and fertilizer usage, and could help them reduce existing monitoring costs by 97%, says the company. ConstellR has a patent-pending miniaturization architecture with ‘free-form optics’ and claims to be able to make it much cheaper to monitor the infrared part of the spectrum than traditional satellite systems.</p>
<p>Dr. Max Gulde, CEO, ConstellR, said: “Our mission is to monitor every single field on the planet every single day of the year and provide precision farming companies with highly accurate temperature data to safeguard the world’s food supply. With our strong financial and technology partners on board, I am looking forward to a time of quantum leaps in our constellation development to change agriculture on the global planetary scale.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tobias Schwind, Managing Partner at FTTF, Fraunhofer’s Technology Transfer Fund, said: “ConstellR’s unique technology and business case as well as its passionate team convinced us to make this exciting pre-seed investment.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://betterorigin.co.uk">Better Origin</a> is a startup that converts waste food into essential nutrients using insects fed to chickens inside a standard shipping container. It’s now raised a Seed Series $3 million funding round led by Fly Ventures and solar entrepreneur Nick Boyle, while previous investor Metavallon VC is also participating. Its competitors include Protix, Agriprotein, InnovaFeed, Enterra, Entocycle.</p>
<p>Better Origin’s product is an “autonomous insect mini-farm.” Its X1insect mini-farm is dropped on site. A farmer adds food waste &#8211; gathered from nearby factories or from the farm &#8211; into a hopper to feed the larvae of black soldier flies.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, the insects are fed directly to the chickens as an alternative to the soy feed they normally get. To add to the ease of use, everything inside the container is automated and remotely controlled by Better Origin’s engineers in Cambridge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This process has a double effect. Not only does it take care of the food waste product as a by-product of farming practices, but it also drives down the use of soy, the growth of which is contributing to deforestation and habitat loss in countries like Brazil.</p>
<p>Plus, given the pandemic has exposed the fragility of the global food supply chain, the company says its solution is way of decentralizing food and feed production, thus safeguarding the food supply chain and food security.</p>
<p>Better Origin says it is tackling a real problem, and it’s a fair assessment. Western economies waste around a third of all food produced annually, but, on average, the demands of a growing population means food production will need to increase by 70%. Food waste is also the third-largest emitter of Green House Gas (GHG) after the US and China.</p>
<p>Founder Fotis Fotiadis was working in the Oil &amp; Gas industry when he decided he’d rather work in a sustainable, non-polluting. After studying Sustainable Engineering at Cambridge University, and meeting cofounder Miha Pipan, the two set out to work on a sustainable startup.</p>
<p>The company was launched in May 2020, now has five commercial contracts, and plans to expand across the UK.</p>
<p>Better Origin says its differentiation with competitors is the nature of its ‘decentralized’ approach to insect farming, as a result of the way its units are, effectively, ‘Drag-and-drop’ into a farm. In some sense, it’s not dissimilar to adding a server to a server farm.</p>
<p>The business model will be to either lease or sell systems to farms, likely with a subscription model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When people ask me which robotics categories are poised for the biggest growth, I often point to agriculture. The technology already has a strong foothold in places like warehouse and logistics, but it’s impossible to look at the American – and global – farming community and not see a lot of potential for human-assisted automation.</p>
<p>The category still seems fairly wide open — but not for lack of interest. There are a number of companies both large and small carving out niches in the category. For now, at least, it seems there’s room for a number of different players. After all, needs vary greatly from farm to farm and crop to crop.</p>
<p>Santa Monica-based Future Acres is launching today, with plans to tackle grape picking. An outgrowth of Wavemaker Partners &#8212; the same firm that gave the world burger-flipping Miso Robotics — the startup is also announce its first robot, Carry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2116227" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116227" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116227" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Carry-side-view.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116227" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Future Acres</p></div></p>
<p>“We see Carry as a kind of harvesting sidekick for workers. It’s an autonomous harvesting companion,” CEO Suma Reddy tells TechCrunch. “What it can do in the real world is transport up to 500 lbs. of crops in all terrain and all weather. It can increase production efficiency by up to 80%, which means it pays for itself in only 80 days.”</p>
<p>Carry relies on AI to transport hand-picked crops, working alongside humans rather than attempting to replace the delicate picking process outright. The company is expecting that farms will purchase multiple machines that can work in tandem to speed up their process and help reduce the human strain of moving the crops around manually.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116228" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116228" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116228" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Birds-eye-view-of-Carry.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116228" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Future Acres</p></div></p>
<p>The company is still in early stages, having developed a prototype of Carry. It’s also exploring some partnerships for development. The systems would run $10,000-$15,000 up front, though the company says it’s looking at a RaaS (robotics as a service) model, as a way to defer that cost.</p>
<p>Interest in agricultural robotics has only increased during the pandemic, amid health concerns and labor issues. The company is building on that interest by launching a campaign on SeedInvest, in hopes of raising $3 million, in addition to funding already provided by Wavemaker.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The onset of the pandemic has led to increased demand across customer income groups around the world for digital banking options. We&#8217;ve seen how digital banks like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/zolve-raises-15-million-for-its-cross-border-neobank-aimed-at-global-citizens/">Zolve</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/fintech-darling-nubank-raises-blockbuster-400m-series-g-at-25b-valuation/">Nubank</a> have raised money in recent months to fill this need. This time, a startup from Africa has joined the party.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tymebank.co.za/">TymeBank</a>, a South African digital bank, announced today that it has secured an R1.6 billion (~$109 million) investment from new investors in the UK and Philippines. The company made this known via a statement. This investment will be used to bolster TymeBank&#8217;s growth and drive its commercial expansion across the country.</p>
<p>However, this investment will come in two tranches. According to the company, R500 million ($34 million) has already been invested in the business, while the rest &#8212; R1.1 billion ($75 million) &#8212; will be invested over the next 12 to 15 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TymeBank offers a transactional bank account with zero or low monthly fees and a savings product. Most of its customers are onboarded via physical kiosks, usually in Pick n Pay and Boxer stores around the country. Since launching in February 2019, TymeBank has grown rapidly and now has about 2.8 million customers. The company says that it&#8217;s on track to reach 3 million by the end of next month.</p>
<p>The investors for this unnamed round include Apis Growth Fund II, a private equity fund managed by Apis Partners, and Gokongwei-owned JG Summit Holdings, one of the largest conglomerates in the Philippines. Both these investors are experienced in financial services in emerging markets; Apis, for instance, is a private equity asset manager that supports growth-stage financial services and financial infrastructure businesses.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that this is one of the largest raises, if not the largest, for a digital bank on the continent. Tauriq Keraan, the CEO of TymeBank, considers this to be largely due to more investors buying into the importance of digital banking and also the company&#8217;s value propositions &#8212; the first which is improving access to underbanked and underserviced customers in South Africa, and the other, satisfying customer demand for low and transparent bank fees which is generally viewed as both costly and difficult to understand across the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The establishments of digital banks in South Africa is in its infancy. Growth in this particular segment of financial services is only possible with investments from partners who understand and support the growth trajectory of digital banks,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With already existing shareholders like African Rainbow Capital (founded by South African billionaire Patrice Motsepe), TymeBank says these new investors will grow the company into a top tier retail bank in South Africa. The investment will also help the company expand its range of banking products and grow its lending portfolio. Diversification of offerings is key as well as TymeBank seeks to enhance its propositions in insurance and credit cards to its customers.</p>
<p>“As the controlling shareholder in TymeBank, African Rainbow Capital is delighted to have our new co-investors onboard. Equally important, Apis and the Gokongwei family invest in TymeBank at a time when significant uncertainty reigns globally and in South Africa as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,&#8221; said Dr Patrice Motsepe, the majority owner of TymeBank and chairman of African Rainbow Capital. “The invested amount of R1.6 billion is no small feat both in terms of drawing investment into South Africa’s financial services sector as well as investing into a fledgling part of the sector in our country.”</p>

<p>TymeBank claims to onboard an average of 110,000 new customers per month. This makes it globally recognized for digital banking in emerging markets, and the plan is to reach 4 million customers next year. In terms of growth, TymeBank currently outpaces its competitors in Africa and can be argued to be one of the fastest-growing digital banks in the world at the moment. The company is the first bank in South Africa to be fully operated off a cloud-based infrastructure network and the first to be granted a commercial banking license in the country since 1999.</p>

<p>TymeBank isn&#8217;t indigenously South African though. It is a member of the Tyme group of companies headquartered in Singapore. The holding company, Tyme, focuses on designing, building, and operating digital banks for emerging markets. With its success in South Africa, Tyme is planning to launch operations in Asia and has entered into an agreement to launch a digital bank in the Philippines in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Based in Singapore, <a href="https://www.erudifi.com/">ErudiFi</a> wants to help more students in Southeast Asia stay in school by giving them affordable financing options. The startup announced today it has raised a $5 million Series A, co-led by Monk’s Hill Ventures and Qualgro.</p>
<p>ErudiFi currently works with more than 50 universities and vocational schools in Indonesia and the Philippines. Co-founder and chief executive officer Naga Tan told TechCrunch that students in those countries have limited financing options, and often rely on friends or family, or informal payday lenders that charge high interest rates.</p>
<p>To provide more accessible financing options, ErudiFi partners with accredited universities and schools to offer subsidized installment plans, using tech to scale up while keeping costs down. Interest rates and repayment terms vary between institutions, but can be as low as 0%, with loans payable in 12 to 24 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>By providing their students with affordable financing plans, ErudiFi can increase retention rates at schools, helping them keep students who would otherwise be forced to drop out because of financial issues.</p>
<p>Tan said ErudiFi’s value proposition for educational institutions is &#8220;being able to offer a data-driven financing solution that helps with student recruitment and retention. Students also greatly benefit because our product is one of the few, if not the only, affordable financing option they have access to.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a press statement, Peng T. Ong, co-founder and managing partner of Monk’s Hill Ventures, said, &#8220;Access to affordable tertiary education remains a huge pain point in Southeast Asia where the cost is nearly double then the average GDP per capita. ErudiFi is tackling an underserved market that is plagued with high-interest rates by traditional financial institutions and limited reach from peer-to-peer lending companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>ErudiFi’s Series A will be used on hiring for its product and engineering teams and to expand in Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new VC fund, &#8220;<a href="https://www.2150.vc/">2150</a>&#8220;, is launching with the first close of a €200m ($240m) fund which will back technologies aimed largely at reducing the carbon footprint of cities. For example, startups that inject carbon into concrete, or monitor the energy of buildings. The final close is anticipated by mid-2021.</p>
<p>The advisory board for 2150 comprises the former chief sustainability officer in the Obama administration and renowned urbanist and academic, Richard Florida. 2150 is based around the idea that <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/publications/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html">half of the world’s population lives in cities</a>, and this will increase to two-thirds by 2050, creating a growing environmental impact that the world can ill-afford, given the climate crisis.</p>
<p>Based across London, Copenhagen and Berlin, the fund’s Limited Partners include a mix of institutional capital and family offices including Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker, Denmark’s Green Future Fund and Novo Holdings. 2150 says it has other LP partners who are building or managing &#8220;over 16 million square meters of real estate&#8221;, who will come in handy, kicking the tires on the efficacy of 2150 investments.  The anchor funding has come from <a href="https://nrep.com/">NREP</a>, a sustainable real estate fund manager with a large Northern European footprint and platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The founding partners include Mikkel Bülow-Lehnsby, Chairman and co-founder of large real estate logistics company NREP; Jacob Bro, former Chief Product Officer at Rocket Internet; Christian Jølck, the founder and former Chairman of industry climate advocacy group SYNERGI; Christian Hernandez, former Facebook executive and VC; Nicole LeBlanc, formerly with Alphabet’s urban product incubator Sidewalk Labs; Rahul Parekh, founder of VC-backed foodtech startup EatFirst and former executive director at Goldman Sachs; and Alexandra Perez, who incubated and launched urban tech startups at Tech City Ventures.</p>
<p>2150 will focus on startups that can make cities more resilient, efficient and sustainable, investing in tech associated with the urban environment, materials, automation, and sensor-based monitoring to improve the health, safety, and productivity of building occupants. It says it will only invest where sustainability impact can be measured, aiming for a first portfolio of around 20 companies. Ticket sizes will be €4-5m series A for startups, but it will also invest in existing companies that want to expand.</p>
<p>Its first investment is in <a href="https://www.carboncure.com/">CarbonCure Technologies</a> &#8211; a Canadian company lowering the CO2 footprint of concrete &#8211; in which 2150 participated in a funding round for last year, investing alongside Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Bill Gates-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures, and Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund. At present, concrete accounts for 8% of all global CO2 emissions</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Hernandez said 2150 was particularly interested in what’s coming to be known as “ESG Analytics” or “Carbon Accounting”. In other words, platforms that can analyze the impact of developments for an ESG and CO2 perspective.</p>
<p>The other background data which inspired the creation of the fund includes the fact that <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/03/the-world-needs-to-build-more-than-two-billion-new-homes-over-the-next-80-years">two billion</a> new homes will need to be built over the next 80 years ; cities <a href="https://www.c40.org/why_cities">consume</a> over two-thirds of the world’s energy and account for more than 70% of global CO2 emissions; 13% of global GDP is <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Operations/Our%20Insights/Reinventing%20construction%20through%20a%20productivity%20revolution/MGI-Reinventing-Construction-In-Brief.pdf">spent</a> on construction, but the industry is slow to adopt new technology; and the UN has <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/05/1039461">said</a> ground-breaking innovation is needed in cities, where the battle for sustainable development will be &#8220;won or lost&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mikkel Bülow-Lehnsby, Partner at 2150 and Chairman and co-founder of NREP, said: “With NREP we have been on a 15-year mission of making real estate and cities more efficient, customer-centric and sustainable. With 2150 we are leveraging all of NREP&#8217;s learnings and ambitions and partnering with our industry peers to identify and accelerate technology that can help us support our purpose of making real estate better. I am convinced that 2150&#8217;s mission-aligned team will play an important role in designing a future in which the convergence of entrepreneurship, technology and sustainability will reverse the built environment’s negative impact on the planet.”</p>
<p>Christian Hernandez, Partner at 2150, said: “Cities are complex living systems that are constantly expanding, evolving and adapting, with half the world’s population now living in urban environments and rising. Cities, while vehicles for the betterment of humanity, currently emit 70% of the world’s greenhouse gases and generate the vast majority of the planet&#8217;s waste. We see a huge opportunity to make a serious impact on the way cities are developed and the way our citizens live, work and are cared for by completely reimagining and reshaping the urban environment for good.”</p>
<p>The advisory board for 2150 includes technologists, scientists and designers including well-known architect, Bjarke Ingels; the Director of Princeton’s Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, Dr. Lynn Loo; Unity’s head of AI, Danny Lange; the former Chief Sustainability Officer in the Obama Administration, Christine Harada and the founder of sustainable developer EDGE Technologies, Coen van Oostrom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spreadsheet software &#8212; led by products like Microsoft&#8217;s Excel, Google&#8217;s Sheets and Apple&#8217;s Numbers &#8212; continues to be one of the most-used categories of business apps, with Excel alone clocking up more than a billion users just on its <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.excel&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android version</a>. Now, a startup called <a href="http://rows.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rows</a> that&#8217;s built on that ubiquity, with a low-code platform that lets people populate and analyze web apps using just spreadsheet interfaces, is announcing funding and launching a freemium open beta of its expanded service.</p>
<p>The Berlin-based startup &#8212; which <a href="https://medium.com/armilar-venture-partners/dashdash-is-now-rows-and-other-news-8644e659dc72" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranded from dashdash</a> at the end of last year &#8212; closed a Series B round of $16 million, money that it is using to continue investing in its platform as well as in sales and marketing. The platform&#8217;s move into an open beta comes with some 50 new integrations with other platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram and more, as well as 200 new features (using known spreadsheet shortcuts) to use in them.</p>
<p>The round was led by Lakestar, with past investors Accel (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/dashdash-a-platform-to-create-web-apps-using-only-spreadsheet-skills-nabs-8m-led-by-accel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led its $8 million Series A in 2018</a>) and Cherry Ventures also participating. Christian Reber has also invested in this round. Reber knows a thing or two about software disrupting legacy productivity software &#8212; he is the co-founder and CEO of presentation software startup Pitch and the former CEO and founder of Microsoft-acquired Wunderlist &#8212; and notably he is joining Rows&#8217; Advisory Board along with the investment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A little detail about this Series B: CEO Humberto Ayres Pereira, who is based out of Porto, Portugal, where some of the staff is also based, tells us that this round actually was quietly closed over a year ago, in January 2020 &#8212; just ahead of the world shutting down amid the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The startup chose to announce that round today to coincide with adding more features to its product and moving it into an open beta, he said.</p>
<p>That open beta is free in its most basic form &#8212; the free tier is limited to 10 users or less and a minimal amount of integration usage. Paid tiers, which cover more team members and up to 100,000 integration tasks (which are measured by how many times a spreadsheet queries another service), start at $59 per month.</p>
<p>One strong sign of interest in this latest iteration of the software is the lasting popularity of spreadsheets. Another is Rows&#8217; traction to date: in invite-only mode, it picked up 10,000 users off its waitlist, and hundreds of companies, as customers. Currently most of those are free, Ayres Pereira said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to have 1,000 paying companies as customers in the 12 months,&#8221; he said. That process has only just started, he added, with paying numbers in the modest &#8220;dozens&#8221; for now. He emphasized though that the company is very cash efficient and has, even without raising more funding, two years of runway on the money it has in the bank now.</p>
<h2>The growing appeal of low-code</h2>
<p>No-code and low-code software, which let people create and work with apps and other digital content without delving deep into the lines of code that underpin them, have continued to pick up traction in the market in the last several years.</p>
<p>The reason for this is straightforward: non-technical employees may not code, but they are getting increasingly adept at understanding how services function and what can be achieved within an app.</p>
<p>No-code and low-code platforms let them get more hands-on when it comes to customizing and creating the services that they need to use everyday to get their work done, without the time and effort it might take to get an engineer involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;People want to create their own tools,&#8221; said Ayres Pereira. &#8220;They want to understand and test and iterate.&#8221; He said that the majority of Rows&#8217; users so far are based out of North America, and typical use cases include marketing and sales teams, as well as companies using Rows spreadsheets as a dynamic interface to manage logistics and other operations.</p>
<p>Stephen Nundy, the partner at Lakestar who led its investment, describes the army of users taking up no-code tools as &#8220;citizen developers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rows is precisely the kind of platform that plays into the low-code trend. For people who are already au fait with the kinds of tools that you find in spreadsheets &#8212; and something like Excel has hundreds of functions in it &#8212; it presents a way of leaning on those familiar functions to trigger integrations with other apps, and to subsequently use a spreadsheet created in Rows to both analyse data from other apps, as well as update them.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/rows-example.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="387" /></p>
<p>You might ask, why is it more useful, for example, to look at content from Twitter in Rows rather than Twitter itself? A Rows document might let a person search for a set of Tweets using a certain chain of keywords, and then organise those results based on parameters such as how many &#8220;likes&#8221; those Tweets received.</p>
<p>Or users responding to a call to action for a promotion on Instagram might then be cross referenced with a company&#8217;s existing database of customers, to analyze how those respondents overlap or present new leads.</p>
<p>You might also wonder why existing spreadsheet products may not have already build functionality like this.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Microsoft did dabble in building a way of linking up Excel with some rudimentary computing functions, in the form of Visual Basic for Applications. This however reached the dubious distinction of topping developers&#8217; &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most dreaded</a>&#8221; languages list for two years running, and so as you might imagine it has somewhat died a death.</p>
<p>However, it does point to an opportunity for incumbents to disrupt their disruptors.</p>
<p>Apart from those most obvious, entrenched competitors, there have been a number of other startups building tools that are providing similar no- and low-code approaches.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/london-based-gyana-raises-3-9m-for-a-no-code-approach-to-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gyana</a> is focusing more on data science, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/26/tray-io-brings-in-50m-more-at-a-600m-valuation-for-its-workflow-automation-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tray.io</a> provides a graphical interface to integrate how apps work together, Zapier and Notion also provide simple interfaces to integrate apps and APIs together, and Airtable has its own take on reinventing the spreadsheet interface. For now, Ayres Pereira sees these more as compatriots than competitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we overlap with services like Zapier and Notion,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I&#8217;d say we are friends. We&#8217;re all raising awareness about people being able to do more and not having to be stuck using old tools. It&#8217;s not a zero sum game for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we covered Rows&#8217;s Series A two years ago, the startup had built a platform to let people who are comfortable working with data in spreadsheets to use that interface to create and populate content in web apps. It had a lot of extensibility, but mainly geared at people still willing to do the work to create those links.</p>
<p>Two years on, while the spreadsheet has remained the anchor, the platform has grown. Ayres Pereira, who co-founded the company with Torben Schulz (both pictured above), said that there are some 50 new integrations now, including ways to analyse and update content on social media platforms like Instagram, YouTube, CrunchBase, Salesforce, Slack, LinkedIn and Twitter, as well as some 200 new features in the platform itself.</p>
<p>While people can import into Rows data from Google Sheets, he noted that the big daddy of them all, Excel, is not supported right now. The reason, he said, is because the vast majority of users of the product use the desktop version, which does not have APIs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rows also has a number of <a href="https://rows.com/templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">templates</a> available for people to guide them through simple tasks, such as looking up LinkedIn profiles or emails for a list of people; tracking social media counts and so on.</p>
<p>One of the most common aspects of spreadsheets, however, has yet to be built. The interface is still banked around rows and columns, but with no graphical tools to visualize data in different ways such as pie charts or graphs as you might have in a typical spreadsheet program.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for this reason that Rows has yet to exit beta. The feature is one that is requested a lot, Pereira admitted, describing it as &#8220;the final frontier.&#8221; When Rows is ready to ship with that functionality, likely by Q3 of this year, it will tick over to general &#8220;1.0&#8221; release, he added.</p>
<p>“Humberto and Torben have really impressed us with their ambition to disrupt the market with a new spreadsheet paradigm that tackles the significant shortcomings of today&#8217;s solutions,&#8221; said Nundy at Lakestar. &#8220;Data integrations are native, the collaboration experience is first class and the ability to share and publish your work as an application is unique and will create more &#8216;Citizen developers&#8217; to emerge. This is essential to the growing needs of today&#8217;s technology literate workforce. The level of interest they’ve received in their private beta is proof of the desirability of platforms like Rows, and we’re excited to be supporting them through their public beta launch and beyond with this investment.” Nundy is also joining Rows&#8217; board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://katanamrp.com/">Katana</a>, an Estonian startup that has built manufacturing-specific enterprise resource planning (ERP) software for SMBs, has raised $11 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is European venture capital firm Atomico, with participation from angel investors Ott Kaukver (Checkout.com CTO), Sten Tamkivi (CPO Topia, formerly Skype), Sergei Anikin (CTO, Pipedrive) and Kairi Pauskar (former TransferWise HR Architect). Previous backer 42Cap also followed on, bringing the total investment raised by the company to date to $16 million.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 by Kristjan Vilosius (CEO), Priit Kaasik (engineering lead) and Hannes Kert (CCO), Katana positions itself as the &#8220;entrepreneur manufacturer’s secret weapon&#8221; with a plug-and-play ERP for small to medium-sized manufacturers. The idea is to wean companies off existing antiquated tools such as spreadsheets and legacy software to manage inventory and production. The startup is also playing into macro trends, such as the advent of online marketplaces and D2C e-commerce, that are resulting in an explosion of independent makers, spanning cosmetics to home décor, electronics to apparel, and food and beverages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing a global renaissance of small manufacturing driven by the rise of e-commerce tools and consumer demand for bespoke products produced locally,&#8221; says Vilosius. &#8220;Just walk around any big city from London to San Francisco, and you’ll see workshops all around you. Someone’s making organic cosmetics here; over there, someone is making electric bikes. These companies are run by passionate entrepreneurs selling through traditional channels, but also selling through direct-to-consumer channels, e-commerce stores and marketplaces, etc. This is a massive boom of makers wanting to create products and sell them globally, and it is not a trend that will disappear tomorrow&#8221;.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that small and medium-sized manufacturers don’t have the right software to support workflows necessary to sell through multiple channels &#8212; and this is where Katana comes in. The plug-and-play software claims a superior UX designed specifically to power boutique manufacturing, including functionality supporting the workflows of modern manufacturers, i.e. inventory control and optimization, and purchasing materials, managing bill-of-materials, tracking costs and more. It also offers an API and integrations with popular e-commerce sales channels and accounting tools such as Shopify, Amazon, WooCommerce, QuickBooks, Xero and others.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Meet the makers of modular&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/28/meet-the-makers-of-modular/embed/#?secret=X0vZ7FWSos" data-secret="X0vZ7FWSos" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We have built the world’s most self on-board-able manufacturing ERP, and that’s a very important differentiation between us and competitors,&#8221; explains Vilosius. &#8220;Implementation is so simple that more than half of Katana’s users self-onboard. It takes less than a week on average to get Katana up and running, compared to months for competitors&#8221;.</p>
<p>As an example of how a company might use Katana, imagine a boutique manufacturer using Shopify as their main sales channel. Once configured, Katana pulls in orders from Shopify and knows whether or not the product is available so it can be shipped immediately. If it&#8217;s unavailable, Katana displays if the necessary raw materials needed to manufacture are in stock and by when the product could be finished. &#8220;We handle the entire process from getting the raw materials in the warehouse to planning manufacturing activities, executing and shipping when the product is done,&#8221; says Vilosius.</p>

<p>Cue statement from Atomico partner Ben Blume, who joins the Katana board: “Atomico has always believed in the strength of Estonian-built engineering and product, and as we got to know the team at Katana, we saw a familiar pattern: a relentlessly product-focussed team with the incredible ability to build and think from their customer’s point of view, and an unwavering belief that a new generation of manufacturers with big ideas shouldn’t have to settle for less than world-class technology to support them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook said it will begin restoring news sharing to Australian users&#8217; feeds in &#8220;the coming days&#8221; after reaching an agreement with the country&#8217;s government. The social media giant made the drastic move of restricting news content in Australia last Wednesday after a dispute over a <a href="https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;page=0;query=BillId:r6652%20Recstruct:billhome">proposed media bargaining code</a> that is expected to be voted into law soon. The code requires Facebook, and other major tech companies like Google, to make revenue-sharing agreements with publishers for content posted to their social media platforms.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg said changes have been made to the code to &#8220;provide further clarity to digital platforms and news media businesses about the way the Code is intended to operate and strengthen the framework for ensuring news media businesses are fairly remunerated,&#8221; <a href="https://7news.com.au/technology/facebook/australian-facebook-users-to-begin-seeing-news-content-on-their-feeds-in-the-coming-days-c-2223181">reported Seven News</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The amendments mean the code now includes a two-month mediation period to allow digital platforms like Facebook and publishers to agree on deals before they are forced to enter into arbitration. The Australian government will also consider commercial agreements tech platforms have already made with local publishers before deciding if the code applies to them, and give them one month’s notice before reaching a final decision.</p>
<p>William Easton, managing director of Facebook Australia and New Zealand, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/">said in a statement</a> that the company was &#8220;satisfied&#8221; with the changes, adding that they addressed Facebook’s &#8220;core concerns about allowing commercial deals that recognize the value our platform provides to publishers relative to the value we receive from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook’s restrictions last week meant Australian publishers were restricted from sharing or posting content from Facebook Pages, and users in Australia were unable to view or share Australian or international news content.</p>
<p>The Australian government announced in April 2020 it would adopt a mandatory code ordering Google, Facebook and other tech giants to pay local media for reusing their content, after an earlier attempt to create a voluntary code with the companies stalled.</p>
<p>As it lobbied against the proposed law, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/facebook-threatens-to-block-news-sharing-in-australia-as-it-lobbies-against-revenue-share-law/">first threatened to restrict</a> the public sharing of news content in Australia last September. Google also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/google-warns-users-in-australia-free-services-are-at-risk-if-its-forced-to-share-ad-revenue-with-big-media/">claimed that user experience in Australia would suffer</a> and suggested it may no longer be able to offer free services in the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lucid Motors reached an agreement to become a publicly traded company through a merger with<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> special-purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV Corp, in the largest deal yet between a blank-check company and electric vehicle startup. </span></p>
<p>The combined company, in which Saudi Arabia&#8217;s sovereign fund will continue to be the largest shareholder, will have a transaction equity value of $11.75 billion. Private investment in the public equity deal is priced at $15 a share, putting the implied the pro-forma equity value at $24 billion. The announcement comes more than a week after Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/lucid-motors-is-said-to-near-deal-to-go-public-via-klein-s-spac?sref=gni836kR">reported a deal</a> was close to being finalized.</p>
<p>Lucid follows a string of other, albeit smaller valued, SPAC mergers with electric vehicle startups that have been announced this year, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/arrival-becomes-latest-electric-vehicle-startup-to-test-the-public-markets-with-a-spac/">Arrival</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/electric-vehicle-startup-canoo-to-go-public-via-spac/">Canoo</a>, Fisker and Lordstown Motors. Several EV infrastructure companies including EVgo and ChargePoint have also<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/evgo-to-go-public-via-spac-in-bid-to-power-ev-charging-expansion/"> become public companies</a> via SPAC mergers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lucid might have been the most anticipated. The hype and speculation that has been rampant for weeks drove up the stock price of Churchill Capital IV Corp from its opening price of $10 a share more than 470% since January 2021. The skyrocketing share price, plummeted more than 30% after the details of the deal were announced.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The private investment and cash from Churchill will provide roughly $4.4 billion in total funding to Lucid. That capital will be put to work to speed up and expand Lucid&#8217;s plans. The company plans to begin production and deliveries of the Lucid Air in North America in the second half of this year. The Air will come to Europe in 2022, followed by China in 2023. The </span>Gravity performance luxury SUV is expected to come to market in North America in 2023. The vehicles will be produced at its new factory <span style="font-weight: 400;">in Casa Grande, Arizona. </span></p>
<p>The funding will be used to bring those two vehicles to market as well as to expand its factory in <span class="xn-location">Arizona</span>, Lucid CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson said Monday. The company plans to expand the factory over another three phases in the coming years to have the capacity to produce 365,000 units per year at scale. The initial phase of the $700 million factory was completed late last year and will have the capacity to produce 30,000 vehicles a year.</p>

<p>The deal will also help Lucid realize its vision to supply electric vehicle technologies to third parties such as other automotive manufacturers as well as offer energy storage solutions in the residential, commercial and utility segments, Rawlinson said.</p>
<p>Scaling an electric vehicle company is not cheap or easy. Lucid narrowly missed imploding several years ago as it struggled to find an investor that would provide the capital it needed to bring its ultra-luxe electric Air sedan into production. That investor ended up being Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, which agreed in September 2018 to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/lucid-motors-secures-1-billion-from-saudi-wealth-fund-to-launch-the-air/">invest $1 billion into Lucid Motors</a>.</p>
<p>Lucid began in 2007 as Atieva, a company founded by former Tesla VP and board member Bernard Tse and entrepreneur Sam Weng that focused on developing electric car battery technology. The early research, development and eventual progress in the components and overall electric architecture would lay the critical ground work for the future Lucid, which emerged at the end of 2016 with new publicly stated purpose to make electric vehicles (although the company had already been working quietly at this for a couple of years). Rawlinson, who left Tesla to join Lucid in 2013 as CTO, was one of the driving forces behind this new mission. He later took on the CEO title and responsibility as well.</p>
<p>While Lucid is often couched as a competitor to Tesla, Rawlinson has told TechCrunch the Air is meant to be a rival of the Mercedes S Class, the internal combustion engine flagship of the German automaker. The investor presentation released Monday echoes Rawlinson&#8217;s earlier comments, noting that &#8220;Tesla is innovative but not luxury.&#8221; Lucid describes itself as &#8220;post luxury&#8221; and in competition with &#8220;established luxury&#8221; brands Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.</p>
<p>Lucid is taking a page out of Tesla&#8217;s playbook and outlined plans to eventually offer more affordable EVs once it scales production.</p>
<p>Rawlinson will remain as CEO and CTO. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not everyone has Type 2 diabetes, the disease that causes chronically high blood sugar levels, but many do. Around 9% of Americans are afflicted, and another 30% are at risk of developing it.</p>
<p>Enter software by <a href="https://january.ai/">January AI</a>, a four-year-old, subscription-based startup that in November began providing personalized nutritional and activity-related suggestions to its customers based on a combination of food-related data the company has quietly amassed over three years, and each person&#8217;s unique profile, which is gleaned over that individuals&#8217;s first four days of using the software.</p>
<p>Why the need for personalization? Because believe it or not, people can react very differently to every single food, from rice to salad dressing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The tech may sound mundane but it&#8217;s eye-opening and potentially live-saving, promises cofounder and CEO Noosheen Hashemi and her cofounder, Michael Snyder, a genetics professor at Stanford who has focused on diabetes and pre-diabetes <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005143#sec010"> for years</a>.</p>
<p>Investors like the idea, too. Felicis Ventures just led an $8.8 million seed investment in the company, joined by HAND Capital and Salesforce founder Marc Benioff. (Earlier investors include Jerry Yang&#8217;s Ame Cloud Ventures, SignalFire, YouTube cofounder Steve Chen, and Sunshine cofounder Marissa Mayer, among others.)</p>
<p>To learn more, we talked this afternoon with Hashemi and Snyder, who have now raised $21 million altogether. Below is part of our chat, edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What have you built?</strong></p>
<p>NH: We&#8217;ve built a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics">multiomic</a> platform where we take data from different sources and predict people&#8217;s glycemic response, allowing them to consider their choices before they make them. We pull in data from heart rate monitors and continuous glucose monitors and a 1,000-person clinical study and an atlas of 16 million foods for which, using machine learning, we have derived nutritional values and created nutritional labeling [that didn&#8217;t exist previously].</p>
<p>[The idea is to] predict for [customers] what their glycemic response is going to be to any food in our database after just four days of training. They don&#8217;t actually have to eat the food to know whether they should eat it or not; our product tells them what their response is going to be.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So glucose monitoring existed previously, but this is predictive. Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>NH: We want to bring the joy back to eating and remove the guilt. We can predict, for example, how long you&#8217;d have to walk after eating any food in our database in order to keep your blood sugar at the right level. Knowing what &#8220;is&#8221; isn&#8217;t enough; we want to tell you what to do about it. If you&#8217;re thinking about fried chicken and a shake, we can tell you: you&#8217;re going to have to walk 46 minutes afterward to maintain a healthy [blood sugar] range. Would you like to do the uptime for that? No? Then maybe [eat the chicken and shake] on a Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This is subscription software that works with other wearables and that costs $488 for three months.</strong></p>
<p>NH: That&#8217;s retail price, but we have an introductory offer of $288.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you at all concerned that people will use the product, get a sense of what they could be doing differently, then end their subscription?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2116361 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>NH: No. Pregnancy changes [one&#8217;s profile], age changes it. People travel and they aren&#8217;t always eating the same things. . .</p>
<p>MS: I&#8217;ve been wearing [continuous glucose monitoring] wearables for seven years and I still learn stuff. You suddenly realize that every time you eat white rice, you spike through the roof, for example. That&#8217;s true for many people. But we are also offering a year-long subscription soon because we do know that people slip sometimes [only to be reminded] later that these boosters are very valuable.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How does it work practically? Say I&#8217;m at a restaurant and I&#8217;m in the mood for pizza but I don&#8217;t know which one to order.</strong></p>
<p>NH: You can compare curve over curve to see which is healthier. You can see how much you&#8217;ll have to walk [depending on the toppings].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do I need to speak all of these toppings into my smart phone?</strong></p>
<p>NH: January scans barcodes, it also understands photos. It also has manual entry, and it takes voice [commands].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you doing anything else with this massive food database that you&#8217;ve aggregated and that you&#8217;re enriching with your own data? </strong></p>
<p>NH: We will definitely not sell personal information.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Not even aggregated data? Because it does sound like a useful database . . .</strong></p>
<p>MS: We&#8217;re not 23andMe; that&#8217;s really not the goal.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You mentioned that rice can cause someone&#8217;s blood sugar to soar, which is surprising. What are some of the things that might surprise people about what your software can show them? </strong></p>
<p>NH: The way people&#8217;s glycemic response is so different, not just between by Connie and Mike, but also for Connie and Connie. If you eat nine days in a row, your glycemic response could be different each of those nine days because of how much you slept or how much thinking you did the day before or how much fiber was in your body and whether you ate before bedtime.</p>
<p>Activity before eating and activity after eating is important. Fiber is important. It&#8217;s the most under overlooked intervention in the American diet. Our ancestral diets featured 150 grams of fiber a day; the average American diet today includes 15 grams of fiber. A lot of health issues can be traced to a lack of fiber.</p>
<p><strong>TC: It seems like coaching would be helpful in concert with your app. Is there a coaching component?</strong></p>
<p>NH: We don&#8217;t offer a coaching component today, but we&#8217;re in talks with several coaching solutions as we speak, to be the AI partner to them.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who else are you partnering with? Healthcare companies? Employers that can offer this as a benefit?</strong></p>
<p>NH: We are selling to direct to consumers, but we&#8217;ve already had a pharma customer for two years. Pharma companies are very interested in working with us because we are able to use lifestyle as a biomarker. We essentially give them [anonymized] visibility into someone&#8217;s lifestyle for a period of two weeks or however long they want to run the program for so they can gain insights as to whether the therapeutic is working because of the person&#8217;s lifestyle or in spite of a person&#8217;s lifestyle. Pharma companies are very interested in working with us because they can potentially get answers in a trial phase faster and even reduce the number of subjects they need.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re excited about pharma. We are also very interested in working with employers, with coaching solutions, and ultimately, with payers [like insurance companies].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the face of rising homelessness, increasing crime and inadequate public transit in San Francisco, many tech influencers are pulling up stakes to geographies that offer a seemingly more welcome climate to conduct business and make investments. But the ongoing disaster in Texas makes one cold truth very clear: No place is safe from America&#8217;s failure to invest in infrastructure or take climate change seriously.</p>
<p>The shock of seeing the cradle of America&#8217;s energy industry crippled by its inability to prepare its own power grid for the &#8220;once in a century storms&#8221; that increasingly look to be coming every 10 years (<a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/04/climate-scientist-katharine-hayhoes-global-weirding-videos/">a phenomenon that Texas Tech climate scientist Katherine Hayhoe calls &#8220;global weirding&#8221;</a>) underscores a point that should have been plain years ago: By refusing to invest in adequate public infrastructure, the country&#8217;s leadership has failed to perform the basic duty of protecting the health and safety of its citizens.</p>
<p>And the shocks that result from these investment failures will affect anyone without the means or desire to leave the country entirely.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Decline</h2>
<p>This failure reaches from the woefully inept response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is on track to kill half a million people in the U.S., to the millions across the country who faced a week without adequate heat, water and sometimes even food or shelter from the bitter cold bearing down on the nation.</p>
<p>The catastrophe also crystallizes the inanity of many of the issues currently consuming the technology community that holds itself in such high esteem as a pillar of rational discourse and as the architects of America&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>The investors who decried California&#8217;s broken, over-regulated dystopia, are now trying to change their ZIP codes for broken, <em>under</em>-regulated dystopias.</p>
<p>The problem is that they&#8217;re moving without confronting the substantive issues that make these regions unlivable for large portions of the population. And that&#8217;s caused by a historic failure to engage in any politics that isn&#8217;t directly tied to the bottom line of the corporations these entrepreneurs have created or their investors have financed.</p>
<p>As Michael Solana, a vice president at Founders Fund, <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/extract-or-die">noted in a great piece on his Pirate Wires Substack</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is, had tech workers actually assumed a significant measure of political influence, and led in local politics, San Francisco would today be one of the greatest cities in the world. But not only was such political influence not achieved, it was never attempted. Throughout the most recent technology boom of the last fifteen years, there has been almost no meaningful engagement in local politics from the industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not that the deregulatory streak prized by many in the tech community would have solved Texas&#8217;s problem or Florida&#8217;s (California is a different kind of disaster).</p>
<p>In Texas, lack of regulations around construction and the state&#8217;s independent energy grid have made it more vulnerable to catastrophic climactic events &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/02/after-harvey-ignore-the-climate-debate-and-focus-on-building-better-more-efficient-cities/">whether that&#8217;s 2017&#8217;s Hurricane Harvey</a> or this year&#8217;s deadly winter storms, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/us/texas-deaths-winter-storm.html">which killed Texans in their homes, vehicles and backyards</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vBIa9Bh3Q7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/02/after-harvey-ignore-the-climate-debate-and-focus-on-building-better-more-efficient-cities/">After Harvey, ignore the climate debate and focus on building better, more efficient cities</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;After Harvey, ignore the climate debate and focus on building better, more efficient cities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/02/after-harvey-ignore-the-climate-debate-and-focus-on-building-better-more-efficient-cities/embed/#?secret=vBIa9Bh3Q7" data-secret="vBIa9Bh3Q7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>California can claim that its grid failed by fewer megawatts than Texas&#8217;s &#8212; but the overall result from the natural disasters, blackouts, billions of dollars lost and scores of deaths are much the same.</p>
<p>Surveying this broken world, many in the tech community have decided that the best result is to try the same thing somewhere else. But they&#8217;re going to face many of the same problems in Florida or Texas.</p>
<p>Homeowners concerned about construction lowering the value of their properties? <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bracing-for-sea-rise-miami-beach-fights-a-tide-of-angry-residents-11583526613">Check</a>. Rampant income inequality? <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/miami-is-the-second-most-unequal-large-metro-in-the-country-and-its-middle-class-is-shrinking-300834877.html">Check</a>. Reluctance to put in effective oversight that could ensure failures don&#8217;t occur? <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-freeze-power-grid-failure-electricity-market-incentives-11613777856">Check</a>.</p>
<p>The difference those states offer is lower taxes for the wealthy, which means more of an ability to pay privately for the services to ensure that the burdens of climate change don&#8217;t fall on these billionaires in their new waterfront homes.</p>
<p>The through-line in all of this is a cynicism and abdication of responsibility papered over by the thinnest lips paying the smallest amount of service to solving climate problems.</p>
<h2>One step forward, eleventy-seven back</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m merely being cynical about what some tech companies are doing when confronted with the rising catastrophe of climate change and decrepit American infrastructure.</p>
<p>Why else would Elon Musk commit $100 million to a carbon capture prize while his publicly traded energy company invests $1.5 billion in bitcoin? Some analysts estimate that the deal and the resulting skyrocketing price of the cryptocurrency will erase all of the gains in emissions offsets from the use of every Tesla ever made.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="H6hiRd9G7X"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/">Tesla buys $1.5B in bitcoin, may accept the cryptocurrency as payment in the future</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tesla buys $1.5B in bitcoin, may accept the cryptocurrency as payment in the future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/embed/#?secret=H6hiRd9G7X" data-secret="H6hiRd9G7X" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The immediate impact of Tesla’s buy is that the Bitcoin price went up by more than $5,000. We can estimate this will lead to the network consuming an additional 34 TWh of electrical energy per year. That’s about the size of a country like Denmark’s total annual electrical energy requirement. We can also estimate this will result in an additional 17 million metric tons of CO2 being put out by the network every year,&#8221; wrote Alex de Vries, <a href="https://digiconomist.net/">the founder of the cryptocurrency analysis site, Digiconomist</a>. &#8220;According to Tesla, <a href="https://www.tesla.com/carbonimpact">the amount of CO2 saved by Tesla vehicles adds up to 3.7 million tons</a>. The amount of additional CO2 produced by the Bitcoin network, as a result of Tesla’s buy, would thus amount to more than four times the amount of CO2 saved by all their vehicles to date.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some argue that bitcoin mining uses a disproportional amount of renewable energy to produce the cryptocurrency, but that argument is complicated by the seasonal sources of some renewables that miners (especially Chinese miners who produce the bulk of bitcoin) rely on for power.</p>
<p>Tesla could potentially make more money from that investment than it has from the sale of cars, and has definitely boosted the emissions-spewing mining processes that make Bitcoin&#8217;s digital printers go brrrrr.  All of which makes the company&#8217;s commitment to combating climate change look a bit specious.</p>

<h2>Some hope?</h2>
<p>The most frustrating thing about all of this is that entrepreneurs and investors are working on solutions to the climate crisis. Technologies exist that can help address some of the issues that confront these cities. And there&#8217;s billions to be made solving something that is very much an existential problem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unlocking those billions in a time frame that&#8217;s viable for society&#8217;s survival is going to require policy movement and the type of engagement that many tech investors would rather hand off to someone else as they move to more temperate, and tax advantaged, climates.</p>
<p>With the waters rising and the temperatures dropping, maybe those tax savings can buy a nice microgrid for power or a bigger boat. Given the projections that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/23/new-u-s-report-says-that-climate-change-could-cost-nearly-500-billion-per-year-by-2090/"> put the cost of climate change at nearly half a trillion dollars</a> annually by the end of the century, it&#8217;d have to be<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I91DJZKRxs"> a pretty big boat</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Huawei’s first foldable feels like a distant memory. Announced in 2019, the company went back to the drawing board prior to release, as Samsung ran into its own much publicized issues with the innovative form factor.</p>
<p>The Mate X was well-received among journalists &#8212; I had the opportunity to spend some time with it at the company’s HQ in China and was impressed with the build quality. But for various reasons, it never made its way outside of China. And there’s some reason to believe that the newly announced X2 will suffer a similar fate.</p>
<p>The new handset has already drawn its share of comparisons to Samsung’s early models &#8212; and rightfully so, to be honest. The X2’s form factor appears to share much more in common with the Galaxy Fold from a design standpoint than its own predecessor. And while Samsung’s model got off to a rocky start or two, the company was also the first to get things fairly right after a bit of public trial and error.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And like Samsung, Huawei is leading with improvements to the hinge mechanism as a big selling point here. It’s the sort of meat and potatoes thing that would be glossed over in most other devices, but the hinge has proven one of the major pain points for these devices &#8212; and as much as a company might test behind the scenes, there’s no replacing real-world usage.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Huawei set to debut a new, improved Mate X&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/huawei-set-to-debut-a-new-improved-mate-x/embed/#?secret=nmJOteGgt0" data-secret="nmJOteGgt0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The primary, foldable display is eight inches, with a 6.45-inch screen on the outside &#8212; a bit more than the Galaxy Fold 2, in both cases (at 7.6 and 6.2 inches, respectively). In the rendering, the front screen occupies most of the device, with a bit of a bezel and a camera cut out. There’s 5G on board, too, paired with Huawei’s proprietary Kirin 9000 chip and a 4,400mAh battery.</p>
<p>The system is, of course, missing a pretty significant feature, courtesy of all of those blacklists. The company is pushing the presence of the Android 10-based EMUI 11.0 (Based on Android 10). Likely the device will also feature Huawei’s own HarmonyOS, in lieu of Android. The company’s been building out its operating system in recent years with the understanding that it would likely become a flashpoint in U.S./China tensions.</p>
<p>We have yet to see a full version of the software, but it’s hard to imagine it being as complete or robust as Google’s 12-year-old mobile OS &#8212; not to mention Google’s various apps.</p>
<p>The Mate X2 arrives in China on February 25, starting at around $2,800.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zomato has raised $250 million, two months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/indian-food-delivery-giant-zomato-raises-660-million/">closing a $660 million Series J financing round</a>, as the Indian food delivery startup builds a war-chest ahead of its IPO later this year.</p>
<p>Kora (which contributed $115 million), Fidelity ($55 million), Tiger Global ($50 million), Bow Wave ($20 million) and Dragoneer ($10 million) pumped the new capital into the 12-year-old Gurgaon-headquartered startup, Info Edge, a publicly listed investor in Zomato, <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/2429b16a-c9e6-4fb7-b189-7206822195b8.pdf">disclosed in a filing</a> (PDF) to a local stock exchange. The new investment gives Zomato a post-money valuation of $5.4 billion, up from $3.9 billion in December last year, said Info Edge, which owns 18.4% stake in the Indian startup.</p>
<p>The new investment reinforces the strong confidence investors have in Zomato, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/indias-zomato-raises-62-million-from-temasek/">struggled to raise money</a> for much of last year. Zomato, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/20/uber-sells-food-delivery-business-in-india-to-zomato/">acquired the Indian food delivery business of Uber</a> early last year, competes with Prosus Ventures-backed <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/swiggy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="swiggy">Swiggy </a>(valued at about $3.6 billion) in India. Together they work with over 440,000 delivery partners, a larger workforce than that employed by Indian Department of Posts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>A third player, Amazon, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/amazon-launches-food-delivery-service-in-india/">entered the food delivery market</a> in India last year, though its operations are still limited to parts of Bangalore.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s food delivery market, which analysts at Bernstein expect to balloon to be worth $12 billion by 2022, they wrote in a report to clients. With about 50% of the market share, Zomato is the current leader among the three, Bernstein analysts wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;We find the food-tech industry in India to be well positioned to sustained growth with improving unit economics. Take-rates are one of the highest in India at 20-25% and consumer traction is increasing. Market is largely a duopoly between Zomato and Swiggy with 80%+ share,&#8221; wrote analysts at Bank of America in a recent report, reviewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Zomato and Swiggy have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/a-glint-of-hope-for-indias-food-delivery-market-as-zomato-projects-monthly-cash-burn-of-less-than-1m/">improved their finances in recent years</a>, which is especially impressive because making money with food delivery is very often more challenging in India. Unlike Western markets such as the U.S., where the value of each delivery item is about $33, in India, a similar item carries the price tag of $3 to $4, according to research firms.</p>
<p>Both the startups eliminated hundreds of jobs last year as the coronavirus pandemic hit their businesses. Zomato co-founder and chief executive Deepinder Goyal said in December that the food delivery market was &#8220;rapidly coming out of COVID-19 shadows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;December 2020 is expected to be the highest ever GMV month in our history. We are now clocking ~25% higher GMV than our previous peaks in February 2020. I am supremely excited about what lies ahead and the impact that we will create for our customers, delivery partners and restaurant partners,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In an email to employees in September last year, Goyal said Zomato was working on its IPO for &#8220;sometime in the first half&#8221; of 2021 and was raising money to build a war-chest for &#8220;future M&amp;A, and fighting off any mischief or price wars from our competition in various areas of our business.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The FCC has taken a major step toward offering financial support for people struggling to pay broadband bills during the pandemic. If approved, the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program could provide $50 per month to millions of households, and more in tribal lands.</p>
<p>The EBBP was created in the budget passed by Congress earlier this year, which earmarked $3.2 billion to offset the cost of broadband in households already struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<p>&#8220;From work to healthcare to education, this crisis has made it clear that without an internet connection too many households are locked out of modern life,&#8221; said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-fcc-has-its-first-chairwoman-in-jessica-rosenworcel/">acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel</a> in a statement. &#8220;It’s more apparent than ever that broadband is no longer nice-to-have. It’s need-to-have. But too many of us are struggling to afford this critical service.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The FCC has a new acting chairwoman in Jessica Rosenworcel&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-fcc-has-its-first-chairwoman-in-jessica-rosenworcel/embed/#?secret=q5oD1Z4fvI" data-secret="q5oD1Z4fvI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The general shape of the EBBP was already known, but since Congress first proposed it last year it has been up to the FCC to decide what it would actually look like. The rules for the program Rosenworcel<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/jessica-rosenworcel#link-0"> circulated at the agency today</a> are an important step in taking it from idea to reality.</p>
<p>The important bit is spelling out exactly who qualifies for the benefit — to wit, anyone who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualifies for the FCC&#8217;s existing Lifeline connectivity subsidy program</li>
<li>Receives free and reduce-price school lunch or breakfast benefits</li>
<li>Received a Pell Grant</li>
<li>Meets other eligibility requirements for internet providers&#8217; existing low-income or pandemic-related programs</li>
<li>&#8220;Experienced a substantial loss of income since February 29, 2020&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one is a bit vague, and I&#8217;ve asked the FCC for more details (the proposed rules are not yet public). It may involve something like qualifying for unemployment benefits or showing a given percentage reduction in income. Depending on exactly what is specified it could greatly increase the scope of the program. I&#8217;ve asked the FCC for more details.</p>
<p>Most qualifying households would get $50 per month, and those living on tribal lands would get $75 per month. There&#8217;s also the possibility of a one-time $100 to help cover the cost of a device purchased from certain providers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are plenty more steps before anyone is likely to get these discounts. The FCC will have to approve and vote on the rules, which even at the fastest pace may take a couple months. And then there is a period of considering requests from providers, which could take up further time. All told it could take as few as three months if everything goes at maximum speed, or much more than that if they get bogged down in red tape.</p>
<p>Now that the rules are at least set down, though, it is likely only a matter of time — a small comfort to those having trouble making ends meet, but it&#8217;s something to look forward to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During its livestreamed event today, Spotify officially <a href="https://blog.anchor.fm/streamon">confirmed</a> its plans to launch paid podcast subscriptions on its platform. As a first step, the company will this spring begin beta testing a new feature in its Anchor podcast creation tool that will allow U.S. creators to publish paid podcast content aimed at their &#8220;most dedicated fans.&#8221; It also <a href="https://blog.anchor.fm/streamon">opened up signups</a> for this and other new features, starting today.</p>
<p>Spotify had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/spotify-hints-toward-plans-for-podcast-subscriptions-a-la-carte-payments/">hinted at its plans for paid podcast content</a> during its fourth-quarter earnings call earlier this month, when it said it was exploring ideas like paid podcast subscriptions and à la carte payments. But it didn&#8217;t detail when these new options would go live or how they would work.</p>
<p>At its online event today, Spotify more formally announced its plans to enter the market of paid podcasts, initially with a new service that would allow Anchor creators the ability to offer paid podcast subscriptions supported by their listeners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This sort of idea is not new, to be clear. Already, some podcasters offer paid access to bonus material &#8212; for example, through a service like Stitcher Premium, which promises both an ad-free experience and bonus episodes. Some creators may even independently offer paid feeds through their own platforms.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spotify plans for podcast subscriptions, à la carte payments&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/spotify-hints-toward-plans-for-podcast-subscriptions-a-la-carte-payments/embed/#?secret=VGPOC89qLW" data-secret="VGPOC89qLW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But until now, a similar option was not available to Spotify creators.</p>
<p>Anchor co-founder Michael Mignano said the company believes paid bonus material can work well as a means of podcast monetization, in addition to ads.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116160" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116160" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116160" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="337" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg 2242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=300,149 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=768,381 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=680,337 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=1536,762 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1016 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116160" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We have found that, through our research, it seems to work especially well for creators who have really engaged and dedicated audiences &#8212; regardless of the audience size,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an interview following Spotify&#8217;s event. &#8220;We&#8217;ve also found that podcast listeners do tend to be open to financially supporting the shows they love,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The company was hesitant to detail some of the specifics of how paid subscriptions would work at launch, but did say that the model would involve a revenue share between creators and Anchor, where creators keep the majority of the earnings. Anchor will also allow creators to determine what price to charge their listeners for the paid experience and what that experience would include &#8212; like bonus episodes or interviews, or even ad-free content, if they prefer.</p>
<p>It will then use its understanding of what creators actually do with paid subscriptions to inform its product launch and its &#8220;best practices&#8221; recommendations in the future.</p>
<p>We also understand the offering will be limited to those who use Anchor to record and publish across podcast platforms. However, it will more immediately benefit creators with a strong Spotify presence and a loyal listenership.</p>
<p>But Mignano points out that creators may be able to grow their paid subscriber base thanks to Spotify&#8217;s tools for podcast discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is the system for doing this type of paid subscription so far in podcasts has been really disjointed,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been a really seamless experience for the listener, and it hasn&#8217;t really been a great experience for the creator. We feel like that&#8217;s really held this model back and hindered creators&#8217; reach and ability to gain paid subscribers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116148" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116148" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116148" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="354" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg 2842w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?resize=768,400 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?resize=680,354 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?resize=1536,800 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1067 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116148" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify/Anchor</p></div></p>
<p>In other words, users may be open to the idea of paid bonus material, but they don&#8217;t necessarily want to switch between apps to gain access, nor do they want to figure out how to get paid RSS feeds into some third-party podcast listening app.</p>
<p>Spotify, meanwhile, will try to make discovery easier. It will highlight the paid content alongside the free material on the podcast&#8217;s main page, for example. Plus, in the same way that Spotify today helps users discover new podcasts they may like to try, it will also point to paid subscription-based podcasts in the future as the new model rolls out further.</p>
<p>Anchor says it will initially <a href="https://blog.anchor.fm/streamon">open up the beta</a> test in the U.S. to a small number of creators, but aims to expand access to more creators as soon as reasonably possible. The test, for the time being, will only focus on paid subscriptions, but Mignano told us the company may explore the à la carte model in the future.</p>
<p>Paid podcasts were only one of several new features Anchor announced today at the Spotify event.</p>
<p>The company also announced the launch of a WordPress partnership that makes it easier for bloggers to turn their posts into podcasts, either by reading the blog posts themselves or leveraging third-party text-to-speech technology Anchor provides.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SJCVrqqqROw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Anchor will also expand beta testing of video podcasts, which so far have been tested by only a handful of creators, including Higher Learning from The Ringer.</p>
<p>And it will <a href="https://blog.anchor.fm/streamon">begin beta testing</a> new, interactive features, like polls and Q&amp;A, with a small number of creators in the months ahead.</p>
<p>These features could potentially overlap with paid subscriptions. For example, some podcast creators may choose to make their videos a paid feature, or perhaps other interactive features. It remains to be seen how they&#8217;re put to use.</p>
<p>But more broadly, features like polls and Q&amp;As could help Spotify better differentiate an interactive podcast from a live audio program, like those popularized by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/report-social-audio-app-clubhouse-has-topped-8-million-global-downloads/">buzzy new app Clubhouse</a>. The advantage of the latter is that it allows for audience participation in the &#8220;show,&#8221; rather than being a one-way street where hosts control the experience. But on the flip side, Clubhouse rooms can also have folks who drone on and on, or they can become boring, when not carefully managed.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGfM2TZgjMQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Anchor says it doesn&#8217;t intend to charge creators for access to its tools, beyond taking a rev share on subscriptions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think our vision with Anchor and Spotify has always been to really empower creators. In the Anchor suite of tools, we&#8217;ve never charged creators for any features because we believe that charging creators can often represent friction that stands in the way of them trying to actually make something and getting it out into the world,&#8221; Mignano said. &#8220;We want to enable creators to do whatever they want, as far as expressing themselves through these new tools,&#8221; he added.</p>
