										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Be it virtual, in-person, or some mix of the two, CES is a beast. How could you keep up with all of the news flooding out of the show? You can&#8217;t, really. The big outlets each put a small army on CES coverage and only really scratch the surface.</p>
<p>With that in mind, and with CES 2022 now wrapped, we figured it was worthwhile to bring it all together in one neat little box — a recap of our top stories of the week, the trends we noticed, and some of our favorite bits. It&#8217;s by no means exhaustive, but it&#8217;ll give you a good sense of the show if you were too busy to pay attention in realtime.</p>
<h2>The top stories:</h2>
<p>We wrote up many, many, <em>many</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">news items from CES</a>. Can&#8217;t read them all? Here&#8217;s some of the stuff that folks read and shared the most:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255786" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2253428" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253428" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2253428" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bmw_flow.gif?w=680" alt="BMW color changing car CES 2022" width="680" height="309" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253428" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/bmw-shows-off-a-color-changing-car/">BMW shows off a color-changing car</a></strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s like something out of a sci-fi flick: push a button, and your car changes color. Based on E Ink tech along the same lines as a Kindle screen, it&#8217;ll only flip between black/white/shades of grey&#8230; but still — wow. Don&#8217;t go looking for a pre-order page, though&#8230; for now, it&#8217;s just a tech demo.</p>

<p>Between crypto miners, resellers, and chip shortages, good graphics cards are hard to come by right now — especially if you don&#8217;t want to pay a huge markup. So it makes sense that a great card meant to ship at a budget-friendly price would grab a lot of eyes&#8230; but will resellers just gobble up all of these ones, too?</p>

<p>Nvidia had a good bit of news around its game streaming service, GeForce Now: new games, free subscriptions for select AT&amp;T customers, and plans to build it right into Samsung TVs.</p>
<p>Nvidia had quite the CES; while it didn&#8217;t break the top stories list, its announcement that it is opening up its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/nvidia-expands-its-omniverse/">Omniverse tech to more creators</a> also pulled a ton of eyes.</p>

<p>Want a dishwasher, but dont have space and/or don&#8217;t want to deal with ripping out cabinets or installing water lines? Bob lives on your counter and you add the water with a pitcher. Plus you can use its water-free UV-C mode to disinfect things like phones, or keys, or other things that can&#8217;t get wet. Plus it&#8217;s hella cute.</p>

<p>Are we close to having Rosie the robot roaming our homes? Or are we forever stuck with puck shaped robo-vacuums that eat our socks? In last weeks Actuator newsletter, Brian Heater gave us a look at where consumer robotics are today, and how it has moved forward over the years. Plus there&#8217;s a robot cat that nibbles on your finger for some reason?</p>

<p>Rather than any one headset or &#8220;killer app&#8221; making VR an overnight ubiquitous thing, its story so far has been one of incremental progression — and CES this year moved it a few more steps down the road.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/lets-talk-ces-gadgets/">Gadgets galore</a></strong></p>
<p>The organization behind CES might not want anyone to call it &#8220;Consumer Electronics Show&#8221; anymore (as it aims to broaden its scope to all of technology, not just the electronic bits) but there are still lots, and lots, and <em>lots</em> gizmos and gadgets to be found. Heater took a look at some of the most interesting ones.</p>

<p>As much as we&#8217;d love to pretend otherwise, we all get old. Before we know it, we&#8217;ll have a generation of seniors that grew up from day one with the Internet always within reach. How can tech evolve to help older people live more comfortably? From robot companions to lightbulbs that might help detect falls, Catherine Shu rounded up the latest advancements in elder tech.</p>
<h2>Our favorite bits:</h2>
<p>We spent the last week with our heads buried in CES news — and, for much of the CES team, it was our 7th or 8th or zillionth time doing so. What stood out to us? Here&#8217;s some of the stuff we&#8217;re still thinking about.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/john-deeres-self-driving-tractor-arrives-later-this-fall/">John Deere&#8217;s self driving tractor</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The average age of the American farmer is 57.5 years. Field work is backbreaking, intensive and increasingly difficult to staff. Farming is one of those roles that makes a lot of sense to automate, something John Deere has been working for several years to perfect. Available later this year in select U.S. Markets, the 8R finally brings full autonomy to the company’s popular tractor line, with a number of features currently in the works.</p>
<p>— Brian Heater</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/mercedes-benzs-vision-for-the-future-is-an-ultra-efficient-luxury-620-mile-range-ev/">Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s Vision</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>This isn&#8217;t just a concept car that will never see the light of day. Mercedes tapped the expertise of its R&amp;D department, Formula 1 and Formula E teams to develop advanced components for this concept that will show up in future models, starting in 2024.</p>
<p>Of note, they improved the energy density of the battery by making &#8220;significant progress&#8221; in the chemistry of the anodes, which has higher silicon content and advanced composition that allow it to hold considerably more energy than commonly used anodes. Translation: More range packed into a tinier package. Another item that will show up in 2024 includes ultra-thin roof panels that feed the battery system for some extra range.</p>
<p>— Kirsten Korosec</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/bmw-shows-off-a-color-changing-car/"><strong>BMW&#8217;s color changing concept car</strong></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Will you be able to buy BMW&#8217;s color-shifting car any time soon? Probably not. Is it super practical? Nope! Who knows how much it&#8217;ll cost to replace a door panel when someone bumps this thing with a full grocery cart. But one thing I dearly miss about in-person CES is the absurd, &#8220;we made this mostly just to flex&#8221; aspect of it all, and this one fits squarely in that category.</p>
<p>—Greg Kumparak</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/labrador-set-to-deliver-a-robotic-helping-hand-to-homes-in-2023/">The Labrador robot</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We hear a lot about the promise of robotics, but the most useful robots for people aren&#8217;t going to look like us.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re going to be things like Labrador, which is essentially a mobile table. It&#8217;s intended for elderly  folks and those who may have trouble with everyday tasks, for example, carrying a plate and a drink from the kitchen to the dining room, or bringing the laundry hamper to the washer. With built-in voice controls you should be able to tell it &#8220;wait in the bedroom&#8221; or &#8220;come to me.&#8221; It&#8217;s the kind of thing that could make a lot of people&#8217;s lives easier, and something I hope we see more of in robotics.</p>
<p>— Devin Coldewey</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/why-it-matters-having-matter-support-for-your-new-smart-home-device/">Mui Lab&#8217;s &#8220;calm&#8221; smart home device</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>One of the more interesting smart home devices at CES was the Mui Labs Matter-ready “muiPlatform” that turns smart home devices into “calmer ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>The more devices we add to our home, the more we have cluttering up our furniture. Mui Labs lets you embrace a minimalist lifestyle while also enabling your Amazon Alexa to function more like a piece of art on your wall with a visual interface.</p>
<p>— Christine Hall</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/bob-the-magic-dishwasher-dragon/">Bob</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>To me, some of the most interesting technologies at CES are about how we can use our limited resources better. With California being in perma-drought, Bob caught my eye.</p>
<p>Bob is a tiny dishwasher aimed at households of 1-2 people, and uses a lot less water than washing dishes by hand. It even has an UV mode to clean items without using any water at all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Call it the public service announcement to start off your year: If you&#8217;re working at a startup where IT is a little fuzzy, policies are evolving as the company is being built and the organization is evolving quickly, you&#8217;re at higher risk than usual that your employers are willing to move fast, do things and ask for permission later. It makes sense almost intuitively: Early-stage startups generally don&#8217;t have their crap together, and are moving at a breack-neck speed. Is it legal? Of course not, but in a lot of startup circles, it seems as if the attitude is that if the company is unsuccessful, it&#8217;s a moot point. And if it grows at the speed of a top-tier rapid-growth company, well, you will have enough money and lawyers to figure it out later.</p>
<p>This article was triggered by a conversation I had with a couple of startup employees that wished not to be named at a company you&#8217;ve almost certainly heard of. I wasn&#8217;t able to get enough corroborated information to name the company (don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll keep trying). For now, here&#8217;s a couple of annual reminders, as you&#8217;re leaping into 2022 all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.</p>
<p><strong>Be careful what you say in the company Slack</strong> &#8211; It may feel like DMs are private, but did you know that <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/1500001548241-Request-to-export-all-conversations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a company admin can export all the DMs that have ever been sent</a> on a Slack instance? Of course, there may be laws against exporting the data, but if you discussed something illegal or immoral in the DMs, you&#8217;re going to have as hard a time explaining that as your boss has explaining how they ended up with a copy of your DMs. Two wrongs don&#8217;t make a right, and you may have a case for suing your employer if your suspicious, over-eager head of IT decides to do some digging around, but that sort of thing is easily avoided by just keeping personal talk to personal channels, and work talk to work channels. Of course, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/22/elizabeth-holmes-private-text-messages-leak-during-theranos-fraud-trial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even your texts may not stay private</a>, but at least there&#8217;s a higher bar for getting access to those. And, y&#8217;know, if you are particularly paranoid, there&#8217;s always <a href="https://signal.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signal</a> or <a href="https://telegram.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telegram</a>, with expiring messages.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255667" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>Your bosses can monitor your company equipment</strong> &#8211; There&#8217;s often a clause in contracts about how you can and cannot use equipment provided by your company. Some of those things are obvious &#8212; don&#8217;t do illegal things &#8212; but others are more obscure. That&#8217;s all good and well, but read your contract carefully. There may be language that says that your company is allowed to monitor what you do on your computer. I don&#8217;t think that sounds particularly innocent, but it is worded obliquely in a lot of work contracts. In a world where AI tools are becoming more and more powerful, and where you sign a contract that says you&#8217;re completely cool with being tracked, there are a ton of companies (<a href="https://www.activtrak.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AktivTrak</a>, <a href="https://activeops.com/lp/workiq-packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActiveOps</a>, <a href="https://www.veriato.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veratio</a>, to just name a few) that make software that can keep an eye on you, and your employers can install these on your computer with various degrees of stealth and permission from you.</p>

<p><strong>HR is not on your side</strong> &#8211; The human resources department at your company might be friendly and helpful and lovely, and they may try their best to help resolve workplace issues, but they aren&#8217;t on your side: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/10/hr-has-lost-the-trust-of-employees-here-is-who-has-it-now/">HR works for the company</a>. They are there to protect the company&#8217;s interests. And when your interests and those of the company are at odds, remember that the people who work in HR &#8212; no matter how friendly they are &#8212; still need to pay their bills and have a good working relationship with <em>their</em> bosses after you&#8217;ve quit, been fired or otherwise get moved around within the company. And as James Altucher points out in his column, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/24/how-to-quit-your-job-the-right-way/">eventually, they will fire you</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t owe a company your loyalty</strong> &#8211; Especially in the U.S., where a lot of employment is &#8220;at will,&#8221; i.e. you can be laid off at any time for any reason, you remain employed for as long as the company can afford you, and you&#8217;re contributing to the bottom line. Especially in startups, this is a mercurial universe, because goals and targets can shift from board meeting to board meeting. One month, the engineering department is the be-all and end-all of a company&#8217;s life blood. But the amount of money in the bank account and the fundraising environment can change quickly, and the next month, it could all change. Especially when the going gets tough, it may become tempting for leadership to run the company to its KPIs, and focus only on growth and customer acquisition. In that universe, engineering is of low importance in the short term, and suddenly advertising spend and the sales operation becomes top priority. Even great leaders with solid long-term visions can be forced into making abrupt changes. Loyalty in the professional world is a myth that benefits only the employers; if they need to let you go, they will, so when a recruiter comes knocking, take the call to see how you are priced in the market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In what appears to be a politically and economically savvy move by General Motors, the automaker said Sunday it recognized California&#8217;s authority under the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/state-and-local-transportation/vehicle-emissions-california-waivers-and-authorizations">Clean Air Act</a> to set its own vehicle emissions standards. GM previously backed the Trump administration&#8217;s efforts to bar the state from enforcing its own rules for new vehicles, a position it reversed soon after President Joe Biden was elected.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s recognition of California&#8217;s much stricter carbon emissions standards, which other states can adopt, means the state will consider the company for fleet vehicle purchases. Other companies on the list include BMW, Ford, Honda, Tesla, Volkswagen and Volvo.</p>
<p>California is the most populous state in the nation,<a href="http://statista.com/chart/9358/us-gdp-by-state-and-region/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> contributing 14.8% of the country&#8217;s gross domestic product</a>; to be blacklisted from the state because of a cantankerous desire to continue producing cars with higher emissions would be economic suicide. TechCrunch reached out to GM to learn why the company decided to send the letter now and how it fit in with its broader strategy, but GM did not immediately respond.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255754" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Omar Vargas, VP and head of global public policy for GM, swore fealty to California&#8217;s emissions sovereignty in a letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2022/01/09/gm-recognizes-calif-emission-standards-opening-door-fleet-sales/9153355002/">shared with The Detroit News</a> on Sunday, just days after the company&#8217;s commercial electric vehicle unit, BrightDrop, shared considerable growth plans over the next few years. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/gms-brightdrop-brings-on-walmart-as-new-ev-customer-fedex-ups-existing-order/">At CES, the company announced Walmart as its newest customer</a> with a reservation of 5,000 e-delivery vans. In addition, existing customer FedEx upped its order from 500 EVs to 2,000, many of which will hit the streets of Los Angeles first.</p>
<p>The OEM also committed on Sunday to speeding out its rollout of zero-emission vehicles in a letter to Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board. Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/electric-chevrolet-equinox-chevrolet-blazer-suvs-are-coming-in-2023/">GM added two more electric SUV models under its Chevrolet brand</a> to be produced by 2023, which would join the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/the-chevy-silverado-finally-goes-electric/">two upcoming versions of the Silverado EV</a> pickup. The company has started to deliver the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/first-drive-the-electrifying-gmc-hummer-ev/">GMC Hummer EV pickup truck</a> and is also introducing the Hummer EV SUV in 2023. An electric GMC Sierra is coming to market, likely in 2023 as well.</p>
<p>The letter to Randolph, signed by GM’s vice president of global regulatory affairs and transportation technology policy, David Strickland, also committed to ensuring affordability of its EVs for low-income communities. This would involve improving access to charging infrastructure by providing pre-paid charging cards and creating partnerships to build infrastructure, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the mobile app ecosystem, according to an annual retrospective released today by app intelligence firm <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/q4-2021-data-digest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sensor Tower</a>. In the early days of the pandemic, a number of apps saw rapidly increased usage &#8212; like that focused on online shopping, entertainment, business and education, for example. Though much of the world has since opened back up, things aren&#8217;t quite back to normal on the app stores. Some app categories are still seeing download volume well above pre-pandemic levels, while others haven&#8217;t yet fully recovered, the new report found.</p>
<p>Travel apps, naturally, had been dealt a major blow by the pandemic, as countries closed their borders to visitors and tourists and in-person events were canceled. In addition, the rise of remote work led to less need for ride-sharing apps and others associated with a daily commute. Combined, the travel and navigation app categories were the hardest hit by the pandemic, with installs dropping around 40% in April 2020 compared with 2019 totals.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255775" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255775" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255775 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="540" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg 1656w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg?resize=150,119 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg?resize=300,238 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg?resize=768,610 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg?resize=680,540 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1221 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.08-PM.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255775" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255688" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s clear the travel category, as a whole, still lives and dies by COVID&#8217;s ebbs and surges. As things began looking up in the summer months, for example, travel apps started to see a return to growth. And by the peak of summer travel in July 2021, travel apps had nearly reached their 2019 average, Sensor Tower said. But as the Omicron variant emerged, travel apps saw those gains start to subside. As of December 2021, travel apps were again down by 14% compared with 2019 levels, while navigation apps were down by 22%.</p>
<p>Other app categories were less impacted by the day-to-day battles with COVID surges, and may instead represent trends that have shifted for the long term. Business apps are a key example. Installs in this category remain high as many companies embraced full-time remote work &#8212; or have at least have delayed their return-to-office plans amid the Omicron surge. Overall in 2021, business app download growth was still more than double pre-pandemic levels (+102%).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255774" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255774" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2255774" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="539" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg 1658w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg?resize=150,119 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg?resize=300,238 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg?resize=768,609 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg?resize=680,539 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1217 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-10-at-2.51.15-PM.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255774" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>Medical apps, obviously, also saw increased use during the pandemic. (And if they&#8217;re a proxy for how well the fight against COVID is going, then things are not looking good!) The category has climbed significantly from 2019 levels, with download growth up by 187% in December 2021, compared with the monthly average in 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other app categories continue to benefit from the pandemic-driven growth, but to a lesser degree. The Games, Health &amp; Fitness, and Education app categories, are still up by 39%, 31%, and 19%, respectively, over their 2019 levels. Sports apps quickly bounced back when leagues reopened in the second half of 2020, and were up a more modest 3% in 2021 over their 2019 levels.</p>
<p>The normalization of app downloads over the course of the pandemic has varied from country to country, the report also noted. North America saw the quickest return to 2019 totals compared with other regions. Meanwhile, the pandemic&#8217;s impacts lasted longer in Asian markets where games are still nearly 40% higher than pre-pandemic levels as of Q4 2021 and travel app installs are still down by 25%.</p>
<p>In addition, some top U.S. travel apps are above pre-pandemic levels, including those for airlines, vacation rentals, and travel agencies even as navigation and rideshare apps remained depressed. In European markets, growth is starting to return but the top apps in each travel subcategory were still lower than their pre-pandemic totals, as were navigation and ride-sharing apps. (See below.)</p>

<p>Sensor Tower notes that its figures don&#8217;t include Apple and Google&#8217;s own pre-installed apps or third-party Android app stores outside of Google Play.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s full report delves into other notable 2021 trends, including cryptocurrency&#8217;s move to mobile over the past year, driving 35% year-over-year growth for the finance category by Q4 2021. In gaming, Garena Fire finally came out on top in terms of downloads, beating out 2020&#8217;s top game Among Us, and 2019&#8217;s winner, PUBG Mobile.</p>
<p>Of course, install growth is only one way of examining the pandemic&#8217;s impacts on the app economy. The increased usage of apps overall has also helped drive consumer spending on apps to new levels. In the third quarter of 2021, apps stores saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/consumers-spent-record-28-billion-in-apps-in-q3-aided-by-pandemic/">record revenues</a> of $28 billion in consumer spending and were on track for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">$133 billion</a> for the full year.</p>

<p>We used to describe celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton as “famous for being famous.” But the TikTok megastars featured on the Netflix docu-soap “Hype House” are famous for being ordinary. Unlike the wealthy offspring of celebrities, this class of superstars shot to stardom virtually overnight, for seemingly arbitrary reasons, all dictated by a mysterious algorithm.</p>
<p>“I know it sounds so dumb. You’re a 20-year-old millionaire. What do you have to be depressed about?” says Alex Warren, a TikTok star with 14.7 million followers. “But that’s what I struggle with. I feel like I’m not allowed to be depressed.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255689" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>On “Hype House,” these ordinary-teens-turned-icons agonize over the nature of their chance celebrity status, worrying that their fame will vanish as quickly as it appeared. The eponymous Hype House is one of TikTok’s longest-running <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/09/style/what-is-a-collab-house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content houses</a>, where social media stars live together and film videos. This concept isn’t new &#8212; YouTube, Twitch and Vine stars have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/style/tiktok-collab-houses-quarantine-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimented</a> with these collaborative, live-in projects for years.</p>
<p>Thomas Petrou (8 million followers) is the de facto manager, though he says he doesn’t take a cut of profits &#8212; he calls himself the dad of the house, but in addition to making sure everyone does their dishes, he makes sure that the Hype House brand can net at least $80,000 per month to stay afloat. His influencer friends like Vinnie Hacker (12.9 million followers), Jack Wright (8.8 million followers), Alex Warren (14.7 million followers) and others live rent-free in the <a href="https://www.redfin.com/CA/Santa-Rosa-Valley/13248-Nightsky-Dr-93012/home/4572146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$5 million mansion</a> &#8212; all they have to do is post on the official Hype House TikTok once per month, which generates the venture revenue through ongoing branded content deals. Plus, TikTok now directly pays creators for the traffic they drive on the platform.</p>
<p>The Netflix series marks the end of an era for the Hype House, focusing more on the challenges that these influencers face than the antics of these young millionaires.</p>
<p>All things considered, the videos that these TikTokers post aren’t that different from what any average teenager would post (except that now they post from a mansion). With almost 20 million followers, the official Hype House TikTok features the stars experimenting with new filters, iterating on the latest trends and, of course, dancing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Throughout the eight-episode series, a cloud of anxiety hovers over the scenic Santa Rosa Valley home. Some Hype House members aren’t churning out content on behalf of the group as often as Petrou wants them to, because they feel uninspired and disillusioned. In one scene, some Hype House members try to come up with content ideas while lying on giant beanbags, but the best idea they can think of is to make up a “lit-ass handshake.” They might live rent-free in a beautiful mansion, but they don’t seem to be having fun.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alex Warren is grasping at straws, staging stunts that aren’t getting as much online engagement as he wants. Even as he grapples with troubling family situations and a foot injury, he’s terrified to take a mental health break.</p>
<p>“When you stop posting in this line of work, you lose engagement,” Warren explains in a confessional. “You don’t get sick days in this job. If you get a sick day, you lose followers, which is a loss of revenue, which is, you know, your job.”</p>
<h2><strong>The influencer gold rush</strong></h2>
<p>TikTok stardom is becoming comprehensible as a career on the internet, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/not-every-creator-economy-startup-is-built-for-creators/">dozens of startups </a>crop up aiming to help these suddenly famous kids navigate brand deals and partnerships (for a cut of their riches, of course). On YouTube, most early creators found profit through ad revenue, but at least in the platform’s beginning days, there wasn’t the same attention to monetization as there is now. Other platforms are also eager to capitalize on the success of TikTok and its biggest stars &#8212; Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube have spent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok/">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> to incentivize creators to post on their platforms, rather than TikTok.</p>
<p>“As an influencer, our whole lives are put on this weird pedestal more so than a traditional celebrity,” Nikita Dragun (14.2 million followers) explains on the show. “You have to become a spokesperson, an activist, a model, a publicist, a manager… You have to be so many things at once.”</p>
<p>In most ways, the growth of creator monetization is a good thing &#8212; there are more tools than ever to help creative people make a living by doing what they love. Even LinkedIn has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/linkedins-eic-talks-about-newsroom-growth-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a team of 40 staff</a> dedicated to working with creators. But at the same time, some creators feel pressure to monetize every aspect of their lives. Part of Warren’s following stems from his posts about his relationship with his girlfriend Kouvr Annon, also a TikTok star with 13.6 million followers &#8212; but Warren struggles to separate their private lives from the content they make, straining their (rarely) off-camera relationship.</p>
<p>In this era of the internet, accelerated by the growth of TikTok, it’s not just about posting videos. It’s about cobbling together as many different revenue streams as you can to make sure that if your platform died tomorrow (it’s happened before &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/twitter-is-shutting-down-vine/#:~:text=With%20Twitter's%20future%20still%20in,%2Dform%20video%20app%2C%20Vine.">R.I.P. Vine</a>), you’d still have a career. After all, TikTok stars don’t make the bulk of their income from TikTok itself. The fortune comes from brand deals, sponsorships, merch sales, podcasts, reality shows and unexpected forays into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKOptbo-QFw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">music</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellendurney/addison-rae-worked-harder-break-into-acting-from-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acting</a>.</p>
<p>“Hype House” emphasizes these creators’ self-awareness about their own mediocrity. They’re charismatic, funny and conventionally attractive enough to entertain the masses, but they know that their fame has more to do with luck than talent, so they worry that their good fortune can be snatched away at any second. They stress about what they would do if they had to return to their hometowns, where many of them have fractured families; they worry about being “canceled.”</p>
<p>“Social media is a numbers game. Your money depends on the numbers,” Warren explains. “If people stop watching as much as I’m putting out, it means I’m doing something wrong, so what am I doing wrong, and how can I get those people back?”</p>
<p>Warren’s anxiety isn’t unfounded &#8212; something as arbitrary as a change in TikTok’s algorithm could hamper his growth. When you’re used to explosive social media growth, how do you handle it when those numbers start to plateau, or worse, plummet?</p>
<p>In addition to worrying about TikTok&#8217;s algorithm, the business model of content houses is similarly unstable. Since starting the venture, the Hype House has faced a number of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/03/26/founders-feud-at-hype-house-gets-nasty-an-armed-guard-a-new-lawsuit-and-a-breakaway-group-of-tiktok-stars/?sh=1385132563f3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuits</a>, including a dispute with fellow influencer and former Hype House member Daisy Keech. In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5uiyv1EePo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube video</a>, Petrou says he&#8217;s spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on lawsuits. Though the legal issues aren&#8217;t broached on &#8220;Hype House,&#8221; Petrou describes waking up and vomiting due to the stress of running the collective. These content houses should, in theory, ease the burden on independent creators &#8212; by being part of a collective, they have a team surrounding them to workshop ideas, collaborate on videos and bring in an additional income stream from the shared accounts. But instead, &#8220;Hype House&#8221; makes it seem like relying on each other without clear financial agreements only made the stress worse.</p>
<h2><strong>“I don’t get the hype either”</strong></h2>
<p>Among the Hype House social circle is Charli D’Amelio, the most followed person on TikTok with 133 million followers &#8212; Forbes estimated that she was also the highest-paid creator on the platform, earning <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2022/01/07/top-earning-tiktokers-charli-dixie-damelio-addison-rae-bella-poarch-josh-richards/?sh=5c7dc6ef3afa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$17.5 million</a> last year.</p>
<p>“I just like, post, as any other teenager in the world,” D’Amelio said on the reality show that Hulu made about her suddenly famous family. “I was just posting on social media… I don’t know.” As D’Amelio once joked in her TikTok bio, “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/26/charli-damelio-tiktok-star/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don&#8217;t worry i don&#8217;t get the hype either</a>.”</p>
<p>But even the creator economy’s biggest star has doubts about whether her stardom is sustainable. In the pilot of “The D’Amelio Show,” she reveals that she’s thought about what she’ll do if she doesn’t keep making millions, or if the pressure of her lifestyle becomes too much.</p>
<p>“Being on calls with CEOs of companies… I’m like, that’s kind of fun?” D’Amelio says. “So no matter what really happens with social media, I could always go into marketing, because I know how it works. I know the back ends of everything, which is cool.”</p>
<p>It’s bizarre for D’Amelio to have a backup plan when she makes more money in a year than most people will make in their lifetime (plus their children’s lifetimes, plus their grandchildren’s lifetimes… unless one of the grandchildren makes it big on TikTok). But for viewers, the entire point of shows like “Hype House” and “The D’Amelio Show” is to humanize these social media stars. For the production teams, the point is to make Netflix and Hulu money and for the stars themselves, it’s to get an extra paycheck, and help them maintain and bolster their fame&#8230; it’s all terribly meta. They leverage this semi-manufactured vulnerability to make themselves into even bigger stars.</p>
<p>Maybe the biggest winner here is TikTok. This has been the app’s appeal all along: Like Alex Warren, you might go from living in your car to living in a mansion, all because people like your short video clips. But it’s lonely at the top, even when you’re living with 10 of the most famous people on the internet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With every year, more scientists and academics are very specifically trying to lengthen the lifespan of humans and ensure that those extra years are worth living. Some of these teams are focused on detecting cancer earlier as a means of extending longevity; some are working to improve people&#8217;s metabolism.</p>
<p>A small but growing group is also beginning to focus on menopause, which impacts half the population and whose onset is associated with a long list of health conditions, from higher blood pressure, “bad&#8221; cholesterol and triglycerides, which is a form of fat in the blood, to, even more frighteningly, a greater risk of breast cancer, heart disease and osteoporosis.</p>
<p>The newest outfit focused on the cause is <a href="https://gametogen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gameto</a>, which says it wants to solve the problem of &#8220;accelerated&#8221; ovarian aging to change the trajectory of women&#8217;s health and equality.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255421" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As explained by the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, Dina Radenkovic, who studied medicine at University College London and has spent most of her career in computational medicine, ovaries age up to five times faster than any organ in the sense that they stop working far earlier than, say, the liver, or brain, or even skin. While women are born with a certain number of ovocytes &#8212; an immature female sex cell that later gives rise to a fully mature ovum or egg cell &#8212; they eventually run out of these, at which point their ovaries stop functioning as an organ and stop producing the hormones that control women&#8217;s physiology.</p>
<p>One-year-old Gameto wants to help delay that process, or even push it off forever if a woman chooses, by developing a platform for ovarian therapeutics that will initially be used to improve the process of assisted fertility but hopefully, eventually, be used, too, to identify cell therapies that can prevent what Radenkovic describes as the &#8220;medical burden&#8221; of menopause.</p>
<p>How exactly? It&#8217;s still early days and Radenkovic is loath to dive into specifics, but she says that the young company has already begun testing whether ovarian supporting cells could help mature eggs and reduce the number of IVF cycles that women often endure currently.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have strong preclinical evidence to believe in our platform,&#8221; she says of the outfit, which is chaired by serial entrepreneur Martin Varsavsky, whose last company, <a href="https://www.preludefertility.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prelude Fertility</a>, has created a nationwide network of fertility centers across the U.S.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some notable investors are willing to bet on that early evidence, and on Radenkovic. New York-based Gameto just raised $20 million in funding led by Future Ventures, whose co-founder, Maryanna Saenko, says the firm is &#8220;deeply excited about the prospect of a better standard of care for women undergoing menopause. The suffering caused by menopause is not a biological imperative, and the many complications that come along with menopause, particularly early-onset menopause, can be entirely avoided&#8221; along with today&#8217;s hormone replacement therapies, which she describes as &#8220;blunt hammers, lacking personalization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other participants include Bold Capital Partners, Lux Capital, Plum Alley, TA Ventures, Overwater Ventures, Arch Venture Partners co-founder Robert Nelsen and 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki.</p>
<p>Gameto had previously raised $3 million in seed funding, including from Atomic founder Jack Abraham, SALT Fund, FJ Labs, Yes VC, Coatue Management founder Dan Rose and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.</p>
<p>Whatever happens with the startup, the market opportunity is huge, and the thesis &#8212; given that people are living longer &#8212; makes obvious sense. Indeed, look for other startups to begin focusing more squarely on delaying menopause as funding becomes available to them, especially given that researchers have been looking into the issue of treating menopause as a treatable disease for at least several years. (You can check an earlier paper from 2019 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6366956/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Gameto already has some competition, including from Celmatix, a 12-year-old company that&#8217;s <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/04/19/celmatix-delay-menopause-womens-ovarian-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating a drug program</a> to slow the depletion of a woman’s ovarian reserve and that similarly hopes to separate a woman’s endocrine function from reproduction.</p>
<p><a href="https://fortune.com/2021/04/19/celmatix-delay-menopause-womens-ovarian-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Fortune</a>, Celmatix company has already received some institutional support, including a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to work on nonhormonal contraceptives. Early last year, it separately announced a partnership with pharmaceutical giant Bayer and the drug development company Evotec.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startup accelerator Y Combinator <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/ycs-standard-deal/">announced</a> this morning that it has updated its terms, providing participating companies with more total cash. The group will now invest $500,000 in batch startups.</p>
<p>The money comes in two different forms. The first is the well-known Y Combinator equity deal, worth $125,000 for 7% of accelerated startups. The group will now also offer $375,000 in the form of an uncapped SAFE note &#8212; a simple agreement for future equity &#8212; with a &#8220;most favored nation&#8221; clause.</p>
<p>Uncapped means that there is no defined maximum price at which the $375,000 SAFE will convert to shares, while the &#8220;most favored nation&#8221; language ensures that Y Combinator gets as good a deal as anyone else in a later conversion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255659" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That Y Combinator is now offering more capital to startups is not surprising; indeed, that it took this long for the group to update its terms is the bigger surprise. Still, a half-million dollars is much more in keeping with where the pre-seed and seed-stage investing markets have headed in recent years, namely to larger dollar amounts at higher prices.</p>
<p>The updated terms do not mean that the accelerator itself will have any less preserved upside in portfolio companies. In fact, you could argue that Y Combinator&#8217;s updated terms are defensive in that it is offering more capital in addition, but not in place of, its traditional equity stake in companies that pass through its doors. So the accelerator may be better able to attract the best early-stage startups with larger checks, even as it puts its initial equity investment to work at a price point that has proven historically lucrative.</p>

<p>As an institution, Y Combinator has been updating itself as the startup market has evolved. From a focus on in-person work, YC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">went remote during the pandemic</a>. The result of that switch was more participating startups from other countries and markets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/this-yc-summer-batch-features-the-largest-group-of-african-startups-yet/">by TechCrunch reckoning</a>. The group has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/06/citing-concern-over-covid-19-y-combinator-moves-demo-day-online/">moved to remote demo days</a>, something that we&#8217;ve appreciated here at TechCrunch as we no longer have to drive down from San Francisco to a large room with too few chairs.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how rival accelerators react, if at all, to Y Combinator&#8217;s updated terms set.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Career Karma <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/career-karma-series-a/">raised its first millions off of a pitch</a> that resonates with anyone who has ever googled coding bootcamps: a navigation tool for aspiring students and working professionals. Instead of creating its own curriculum, Career Karma helps students find the best programs for their price point and career goals.</p>
<p>The startup, founded in 2018 by Ruben Harris, Artur Meyster and Timur Meyster, is now growing its ambition to serve more than the bogged-down bootcamp student: over the past few months, Career Karma has seeded partnerships with employers, making it the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/employers-are-consumer-edtechs-next-beta-test">latest consumer-focused edtech startup</a> to go the employer benefit route as it scales. Now, Harris describes, his vision is that Career Karma will match employees and contractors to job training programs in the marketplace it has built over the past few years.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="18K3Pi9Lv4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/employers-are-consumer-edtechs-next-beta-test/">Employers are consumer edtech&#8217;s next beta test</a></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255653" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Employers are consumer edtech&#8217;s next beta test&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/employers-are-consumer-edtechs-next-beta-test/embed/#?secret=18K3Pi9Lv4" data-secret="18K3Pi9Lv4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To execute on this stage of the business, Career Karma announced today that it has raised a $40 million Series B at an undisclosed valuation. The round was led by Top Tier Capital Partners, alongside GV (Google Ventures), Bronze Venture Fund, Stardust, Trousdale Ventures and Alumni Ventures Group. Existing investors also participated in the round, including SoftBank, Emerson Collective, Kapor Capital, Backstage, 4S Bay Partners and Y Combinator.</p>
<p>“Stage one was become the number one career advice service for the internet, stage two was become the world’s largest community of career transitioners and now phase three is to become the world’s largest staffing firm,” said Harris in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Similar to Handshake and Guild Education, both valued as multibillion-dollar businesses, Career Karma is playing the middleman. As an employee benefit, Career Karma will be able to get students employer-paid tuition, and then re-skill and up-skill them into ideally more advanced job skills.</p>
<p>Employers will serve as a zero-cost acquisition channel that helps Career Karma work with lots of employees at scale &#8212; a business its been in since launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“On the user side, we&#8217;re able to identify the job training programs that they&#8217;re interested in, the current skills that they have and the job that they want,” Harris said. “Eventually we’re going to have a really powerful database internally.”</p>
<p>Career Karma’s strategy shift means its business model will need a refresh as well. Previously, Career Karma charged a fee to bootcamps when it successfully placed a student in one of their programs. The fee was usually 10% of a placed-student’s tuition, which could range from $10,000 to $50,000, Harris says. While this strategy could appear to align incentives &#8212; Career Karma only makes money when it successfully places a student inside a boot camp &#8212; it could also pressure the platform to focus more on pace of placement than personalization of placement. The enterprise business won&#8217;t necessarily bring the same sorts of pressures, since it will be built to serve career services, not just program matching.</p>
<p>Now, with an enterprise side, Harris said the company is hiring folks to help figure out the best new pricing strategy. Beyond the aforementioned companies, there’s precedent in this sort of pivot: last year, Codecademy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/codecademy-series-d/)">raised the same sum in a Series D round to sell its services to the enterprise</a>. A few weeks ago, the same company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/23/codecademy-sends-it-with-skillsoft-in-a-525m-deal/">sold to Skillsoft in a $525 million deal.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japanese tech giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/panasonic/">Panasonic</a> has confirmed that hackers accessed personal information belonging to job candidates and interns during a November cyberattack.</p>
<p>At the time of the data breach, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/panasonic-data-breach/">which the company first confirmed on November 26</a>, the company was unable to say whether hackers had accessed any sensitive information. However, in <a href="https://news.panasonic.com/global/press/data/2022/01/en220107-3/en220107-3-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an update published on January 7</a>, Panasonic said some personal information relating to candidates who applied for employment or participated in internships at certain divisions of the company was accessed during the incident. Panasonic said it was notifying those affected.</p>
<p>When reached, Panasonic spokesperson Dannea DeLisser declined to say how many people were impacted and the nature of the information accessed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255618" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Panasonic’s update also confirmed that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-breach/">data breach</a> — which began June 22 and ended on November 3, before being detected on November 11 — saw the as-yet-unnamed hackers obtain files containing unspecified “business-related information” provided by business partners, as well as information about business partner personnel.</p>
<p>The findings of the company&#8217;s internal investigation, which was carried out with the help of an external security advisor, confirmed that a third party illegally accessed a file server in Japan via the server of an overseas subsidiary. Panasonic says that after detecting the unauthorized access, it “immediately implemented additional security countermeasures,” including strengthening access controls from overseas locations, resetting relevant passwords and strengthening server access monitoring.</p>
<p>Panasonic said it was strengthening its security measures to prevent a repeat attack.</p>
<p>The November data breach that hit Panasonic came just months after the company&#8217;s Indian subsidiary fell victim to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack that saw hackers leak 4 gigabytes of data, including financial information and email addresses.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cell-cultured meat is a hot topic, yet the process for producing meat in this manner remains slow and costly.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meat has been part of the human diet since before we found fire, but it&#8217;s becoming increasingly apparent that the production of meat at scale is more of a detriment to the environment and the world than a benefit.</p>
<p>Across cultures and geographies, animals have been such a vital part of the food chain that it&#8217;s hard to imagine a world where animals are not put to the knife to produce protein.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no stopping innovation, however, and alternative sources of protein are increasingly becoming a choice people would rather make.</p>
<p>Cell-cultured meat is one such source. Also known as cultivated or lab-grown meat, this process uses cells from animals to make meat without slaughter. While the nascent sector is a hot topic for the benefits it promises, the process remains slow and costly.</p>
<p>Investments in this sector are heating up, though. If 2021 was anything to go by, there is an abundance of both companies and investors hungry for ways to scale and speed up the process &#8212; and do it profitably.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s not yet clear when meat grown in labs will reach the kind of scale required to see it at your local grocery store.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			This is not a revolution, it is a transformation, and it is going to take time.							<cite>Friederike Grosse-Holz</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>High steaks</h2>
<p>Cell-cultured meat owes its growing popularity, at least in part, to some of the macro challenges the world faces with food production. Overcultivation, human-made climate change and diminishing sources of water are all contributing to a future where food insecurity will be a gigantic problem.</p>
<p>The outlook is bleak: The United Nations estimates <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2009/gaef3242.doc.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">food production will need to double</a> to feed the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/6/18/un-world-population-expected-to-rise-to-9-7-billion-in-2050" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 10 billion people expected to populate the planet by 2050</a>. As for protein, people around the world <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/274522/global-per-capita-consumption-of-meat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumed about 324 million metric tons of meat</a> in 2020, and that number is set to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/26/1023636/sustainable-meat-livestock-production-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rise even further</a>.</p>
<p>Changing how we cultivate and produce food is key to solving this problem, and we already have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-origin/">systems like vertical farming to address the problem of overcultivation</a>, as well as protein sources other than meat. Currently, alternative protein <a href="https://web-assets.bcg.com/a0/28/4295860343c6a2a5b9f4e3436114/bcg-food-for-thought-the-protein-transformation-mar-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes up just about 2%</a> of the animal protein market, but it is expected to increase more than 7x by 2025.</p>
<p>“We are trying to meet the <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paris Agreement</a>, but we can’t meet that without addressing the food system and the way we produce meat, eggs and dairy,” said Sharyn Murray, senior investor engagement specialist at Good Food Institute, a nonprofit advocating for reimagined meat production. “The conversion ratio for calories in versus calories out is seven to eight calories for a chicken for one calorie out, while plant-based is one calorie in and one out.”</p>
<p>Cultivated meat is just one of the approaches to meeting future demand for protein alongside plant-based and fermentation techniques. Murray and others I spoke to referred to the movement as “a massive transformation of the food system that will take time.” Meaning the shift will not happen overnight, Murray said.</p>
<p>There is also only one company with cell-cultured meat products available in the market currently: Eat Just, whose subsidiary GOOD Meat has received regulatory approval to produce and sell its cell-cultured meat in Singapore. Eat Just also recently received approval to sell chicken breasts made with cell cultures.</p>

<p>Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just, said the movement is here even if people are not buying a lot of lab-grown meat yet.</p>
<p>“It is still small-scale, and the most important thing we are doing that other companies should do is focus on the design, engineering and full-scale installations of vessels and the supporting systems to make a lot of it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You didn&#8217;t miss last night&#8217;s Golden Globes &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t on. But you may have seen the tweets. NBC announced in May 2021 it wouldn&#8217;t broadcast the awards show this year after an investigation by The L.A. Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021-who-are-the-members" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed the lack of diversity</a> within the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the organization that hosts the annual event, as well as evidence of some members receiving gifts that amounted to bribes. As the HFPA undergoes reforms, it hosted last night&#8217;s pared-down event privately &#8212; it was not aired on television, nor even livestreamed.</p>
<p>Instead, the event&#8217;s winners were live-tweeted in an often bizarre fashion.</p>
<p>It seems the HFPA could have benefitted from Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set/">paid subscription</a> offering, which lets you undo tweets with mistakes. Last night, the HFPA&#8217;s Golden Globes Twitter account regularly <a href="https://twitter.com/kylebuchanan/status/1480370936469544964" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forgot to note</a> which TV or movie projects Globe recipients were winning for &#8212; like how <a href="https://time.com/6138082/golden-globes-2022-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Garfield&#8217;s win</a> was for &#8220;tick, tick&#8230;BOOM!&#8221;, for example &#8212; when it was announcing the night&#8217;s winners on social media. The organization also oddly referred to &#8220;West Side Story&#8217;s&#8221; laughter (?) as being &#8220;the best medicine,&#8221; in a tweet it later deleted, only to be posted again to say that <em>music</em> was the best medicine &#8212; which is not how that saying goes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255562" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nowhere in these deeply chaotic Golden Globe tweets do they even mention the projects people are winning for <a href="https://t.co/4Tt5CHaojE">pic.twitter.com/4Tt5CHaojE</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Kyle Buchanan (@kylebuchanan) <a href="https://twitter.com/kylebuchanan/status/1480370936469544964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Nevertheless, the event went on.</p>
<p>In addition to being an overall quieter year as the HFPA tries to reform its organization following the controversies, the winning networks also aren&#8217;t touting their victories as they would normally, despite some seeing some notable firsts and upsets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In prior years, HBO would be happily promoting its sweep over rivals. The network led the night with six wins, including four for HBO and two for HBO Max. Several of these were for its TV series &#8220;Succession,&#8221; which won for best TV drama, TV drama actor (Jeremy Strong) and supporting actress (Sarah Snook.) HBO Max&#8217;s comedy &#8220;Hacks&#8221; also notably beat out Emmy winner &#8220;Ted Lasso&#8221; (Apple TV+) as best comedy, and saw its lead, Jean Smart, win for best actress in a comedy. And Kate Winslet won best TV actress in a limited series for HBO&#8217;s &#8220;Mare of Easttown&#8221;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, though Netflix <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/golden-globe-awards-attempt-a-comeback-after-year-of-scandals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led the year by nominations</a> &#8212; including for best dramatic film &#8220;The Power of the Dog&#8221; and drama series &#8220;Squid Game&#8221; &#8212; it had said it wouldn&#8217;t participate in the event until the HFPA institutes changes. That decision means it&#8217;s also now not bragging about a couple of notable firsts that resulted from last night&#8217;s awards.</p>
<p>Netflix&#8217;s big win of the night was for its original film, &#8220;The Power of the Dog,&#8221; which became the streamer&#8217;s first-ever movie to take home a Golden Globe for best motion picture (drama). The movie also won for best director (Jane Campion) and best supporting actor (Kodi Smit-McPhee).</p>
<p>In addition, Netflix&#8217;s runaway hit TV series &#8220;Squid Game&#8221; received three nominations this year, leading to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/hippy-granddad-o-yeong-su-wins-skoreas-first-golden-globe-squid-game-role-2022-01-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first-ever win for South Korea</a>, as South Korean actor O Yeong-su won for his role in the series, beating out &#8220;Succession&#8217;s&#8221; Kieran Culkin (HBO) and &#8220;The Morning Show&#8217;s&#8221; Billy Crudup (Apple TV+).</p>
<p>Netflix also won for &#8220;tick, tick&#8230;BOOM!&#8221; when Andrew Garfield took the trophy for best actor in a motion picture (musical or comedy), though the tweet had forgotten to credit the project by name.</p>
<p>Apple TV+ took home one win last night, as &#8220;Ted Lasso&#8217;s&#8221; Jason Sudeikis won best actor in a TV series (comedy). Hulu also got one Globe, as &#8220;Dopesick&#8217;s&#8221; Michael Keaton won best actor in a TV limited series or motion picture made for television, while Amazon Prime Video&#8217;s &#8220;The Underground Railroad&#8221; won the category. Amazon Prime Video&#8217;s &#8220;Being the Ricardos&#8221; was highlighted with Nicole Kidman&#8217;s win as best actress in a motion picture.</p>
<p>In another milestone, the first trans actress to win a Golden Globe, FX&#8217;s &#8220;Pose&#8221; star Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, took home the trophy for best actress in a drama.</p>
<p>20th Century Studio/Disney&#8217;s &#8220;West Side Story&#8221; won best picture (musical or comedy) and its stars, Rachel Zegler and Ariana DeBose, won best actress and supporting actress, respectively. Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Encanto,&#8221; which streamed on Disney+ just a month after hitting theaters, won best animated picture.</p>
<p>Warner Bros.&#8217; &#8220;Dune&#8221; got the trophy for best score (Hans Zimmer), and Will Smith was named best actor in a motion picture (drama) for &#8220;King Richard.&#8221; The best non-English language picture award went to the Japanese film “Drive My Car.&#8221;</p>
<p>The full list of winners <a href="https://www.goldenglobes.com/winners-nominees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is here.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Liz Young remembers when her family became homeowners, even at six years old she understood it was a big deal. That sparked a fascination with real estate and the home-owning experience. While working at Bloomberg, she discovered the importance of data-driven decisions in the housing market. She wanted to give the power of data to the average homeowner, so she founded Realm, which helps homeowners prioritize renovation projects to increase the value of the home and use their time and money wisely. Darrell, Jordan and Liz talk about the tricky housing market, how powerful localized data is for homeowners and how Darrell can renovate his basement dungeon gym for the greeted ROI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The value of bitcoin fell under the $40,000 mark in early morning trading today.</p>
<p>The popular cryptocurrency sold off sharply this morning, while rival tokens like ether also lost value. Currently worth $39,831 per coin, bitcoin is off 4.3% and ether 5.1%, <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price">according to Coinbase data</a>.</p>
<p>While it is always risky to cover price changes in the crypto world, the fall in the value of bitcoin has crossed the threshold from notable to material. <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com">Yahoo Finance</a> indicates that bitcoin&#8217;s recent all-time high saw the cryptocurrency trade as high as $68,789.62 per coin. Today&#8217;s price puts bitcoin&#8217;s current drawdown at just over 42%.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255560" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s twice the swing required for bitcoin to have entered a technical bear market, and four times what it would need to meet the requirements of a correction.</p>
<p>But price declines in the value of certain cryptocurrencies are not slowing the decentralized world. Crypto-focused publication <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/129693/nft-marketplace-opensea-kicks-off-the-new-year-with-strong-volumes">The Block noted this morning</a> that NFT trading volumes at the popular OpenSea marketplace are strong to start the year. So, web3 activity appears strong by some measures, despite recent price declines; whether today&#8217;s selloff will have an impact on NFT trading activity, to stick with that particular example, is not yet clear.</p>
<p>For other crypto market participants, the selloff could harm near-term results. There is a historical, positive connection between rising crypto prices and trading volumes. Companies like Coinbase and others make their daily bread off trading fees, meaning that falling crypto prices are generally bearish for their financial performance. Of course, the past is not a perfect predictor of the future, but today&#8217;s selloff is not precisely bullish.</p>
<p>Cryptos are not the only volatile asset that is trading lower this morning: Tech stocks as a whole are off 1.81% (Nasdaq Composite), while software stocks are off an even more painful 2.62% (WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The public and private markets have traded the Most Bullish baton back and forth in recent years, but today's situation feels riskier than ever.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/vcs-and-founders-are-max-bullish-as-public-markets-flash-warning-signs/">TechCrunch noted</a> a week ago that private markets appeared strongly bullish on future startup value creation, while public markets were drifting lower, repricing possible exit values for today&#8217;s upstart companies. The was, it seemed, a rising gap between the level of bullishness in the private and public markets.</p>
<p>That dissonance has only increased in volume in the intervening days. New data from China&#8217;s private market, sharper central banking forecasts, sliding tech shares and rampantly bullish funding rounds make today&#8217;s startup cocktail even more confusing than what we saw a week ago.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>In broad terms, the era of cheap money is coming to a close as startups continue to raise record sums, creating a possible collision course between private-market enthusiasm and a tightening stock market. And the discrepancy is only getting bigger.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s changed?</h2>
<p>This morning, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-10/goldman-now-expects-four-fed-hikes-sees-faster-runoff-in-2022">Goldman Sachs updated its expectation</a> regarding how quickly the U.S. Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy. Three hikes to the key overnight rate were anticipated this year; that figure has risen to four. The financial giant also expects the Fed to start to shrink its balance sheet in July. This is a full-on reversion of today&#8217;s policy that has kept rates at effectively zero and bond-buying afoot.</p>
<p>The macro environment is going to change mightily this year, meaning that we&#8217;ll close 2022 in a very different state than we began it. You might not know that, looking at the market today.</p>
<p>A few data points for flavor concerning startup fundraising:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Hello readers and Happy New Year (I was gone last week): Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Welp, CES 2022 came and went. And while other news did happen this week, we&#8217;re gonna give you the ultimate CES breakdown. Hang on for this galaxy brain adventure.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255570" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2255359" style="width: 506px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/giphy.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255359" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255359 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/giphy.gif" alt="galaxy brain ces information" width="496" height="419" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2255359" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Giphy</p></div></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And nope, I did not attend. This was the second year in a row — after years and years of walking the packed convention center and the rows of startups jammed in at Eureka Park — that I didn&#8217;t go in person. It was sad, as I do love to meet up with founders and test out new tech, but then again &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Perhaps, next year.</p>
<p>Before you jump in this CES 2022 wonderland. <strong>Sec. Pete Buttigieg</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/steering-innovation-toward-the-public-good/">wrote an op-ed</a> that TechCrunch ran last week — the same day he made prepared remarks (virtually) at CES 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What did he overlook? What did he get right? And what did he get wrong? Let me know!</p>
<p>Oh and one final note, <strong>Jim Motavalli</strong>, an author and EV expert, wrote a weekend feature for us that ties in perfectly with all of the tech shown off at CES. It&#8217;s all about what he describes as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/feature-bloat-cars-chip-shortage/">&#8220;feature bloat.&#8221;</a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s micro CES time. Whoop.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a snippet from a lengthy roundup that Rebecca Bellan and I put together. The upshot? Smarter, connected, more powerful e-bikes and scooters were the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/smarter-powerful-electric-scooters-bikes-ces-2022/">top micromobility trends of CES 2022</a>.</p>
<p>We also noticed that a lot of the products that were shown weren&#8217;t actually new. But even most of those EV products included more powerful onboard computers that are synced up to apps that can help riders do things like find their vehicle, track fitness goals and control bike functions like locks and lights.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the highlights</strong>:</p>
<p><b>Bosch </b>showed up with its connected smart e-bike system, which isn’t exactly new, but it was awarded honoree status at the CES Innovation Awards.</p>
<p><strong>Cake</strong> announced new updates to its Ridecake connectivity app, including features to allow professional fleet managers to monitor and manage their vehicles.</p>
<p><b>Delfast</b>, the American-Ukrainian startup, rolled out an upgraded model of its electric Top 3.0 bike, which the company claims can go up to 200 miles on a single charge.</p>
<p><strong>Moonbikes </strong>showed off its electric snow vehicle. And while it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/the-station-a-tesla-nhtsa-fight-brews-catching-up-with-kodiak-and-how-la-is-prepping-for-air-taxis/">not exactly new</a>, this was the first time people really got to check it out in person. It’s a single-track snowmobile that has a 3 kW (4hp) electric motor and reaches a 26 mile-per-hour top speed.</p>
<p><b>Niu</b> showed up this year with its new <a href="https://www.niu.com/en/ces2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BQi-C1 e-bike</a>, a vehicle the Chinese e-scooter company has already teased but finally shared pricing and tech specs at CES. The step-through bike is powered by a 500W continuous and 750W Bafang hub motor in the rear and can reach top speeds of 28 miles per hour in the U.S. The BQi, priced at $1,499, will also be app-connected and feature many smart security features.</p>
<p><b>Okai</b>, another Chinese manufacturer that supplies vehicles to many big-name shared operators, came to CES with five products, including a smart helmet and a smart backpack.</p>
<p><b>Segway</b>, the electric micromobility manufacturer that not only sells personal vehicles but also supplies a number of the world’s shared operators with vehicles, came to CES with a new kick scooter line, the P-Series, and a new moped-type e-scooter, the E11a.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">There was a lot of &#8220;vehicle tech&#8221; this year. I will provide a roundup below, but first some themes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">CES 2022 was not a showcase of autonomous vehicle technology — at least not compared to years past. I base this &#8220;observation&#8221; on feedback from industry experts who were on the ground as well as examining which companies attended and their announcements.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It wasn&#8217;t absent, mind you. But it was overshadowed by a lot of advanced driver assistance system technology, services and experiences that drivers and passengers can have inside vehicles and the compute power needed to deliver it all. When automated driving did pop up, it often came in the form of future promises, narrowly defined autonomous features like parking — or both.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We have a nice long <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/ces-2022-best-weirdest-car-tech/">3,000 word article</a> on all the weird and cool vehicle tech we took note of at CES 2022. Here are a few of those items.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The automotive chip game was on</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Intel</strong>, <strong>Nvidia</strong> and <strong>Qualcomm</strong> all showed up in force. There were two areas where &#8220;compute&#8221; was talked about the most. The first was to provide the power to deliver <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/qualcomm-ces-auto-snapdragon-digital-chassis/">digital services and content</a> like Qualcomm&#8217;s Spandragon Digital Chassis. The other area that compute showed up was in support of automated driving features and advanced driver assistance systems. Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm also made announcements, including Intel subsidiary Mobileye announcing plans to bring a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/intels-mobileye-autonomous-driving-chip-for-consumer-vehicles/">new supercomputer</a> to market designed to give passenger cars, trucks and SUVs autonomous driving powers.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Connected everything</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another big theme was connectivity. Sure, sure, that&#8217;s old news, right? This year it wasn&#8217;t just talking about what <em>might</em> come from an internet connected vehicle with the right underlying operating system and processing power; companies also showcased the products and services that will be in cars imminently.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Blackberry</strong>, <strong>Cerence</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Stellantis</strong> and <strong>Volvo</strong> were some of the companies that introduced new connected features or systems. Amazon kicked off its effort in the fourth quarter last year when it announced Stellantis would became the first automaker to integrate Fire TV for in-car entertainment with its new Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. At CES, Amazon said it will bring the entertainment experiences to Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chrysler Pacifica, as well. In addition, Fire TV will come built-in on Ford Explorer and Lincoln Navigator&#8217;s 2022 models.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Google and Volvo talked about how car owners would be able to download YouTube into the vehicle&#8217;s infotainment system via the Google Play Store and Cerence and Blackberry made announcements about their &#8220;digital co-pilots.&#8221;</p>
<h3>ADAS and AD</h3>
<p>I won&#8217;t get too deep into the weeds because you&#8217;d be here all day, but companies like <strong>GM</strong>, <strong>Volvo</strong>, <strong>TuSimple</strong> and <strong>Gentex</strong> made announcements about autonomous driving and ADAS.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh, and how can I forget, <strong>Mobileye</strong> is partnering with Chinese automaker <strong>Zeekr</strong> to develop an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/mobileye-and-zeekr-plan-to-build-an-autonomous-ev-for-chinese-consumers/">all-electric autonomous vehicle</a> for consumers. The vehicle will be sold in China starting in 2024 and eventually roll out to other markets.</p>
<h3>Other wacky stuff</h3>
<p>You probably saw <strong>BMW</strong> showed off a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/bmw-shows-off-a-color-changing-car/">color-changing car.</a> But did you hear that Vietnamese automaker VinFast will issue the first customers to preorder a vehicle a “VinFirst” certificate on the blockchain platform in NFT form, which the company says is a completely transparent way to prove ownership of an order number?</p>
<p>NFTs and the term digital twins popped up a few times in the automotive sector at CES 2022, including an announcement from <strong>Cerence</strong> and VinFast.</p>
<p>The gist is this: Cerence has cloud-based software that allows VinFast (or any other company intrigued by the product) to create a virtual representation of its entire car, including software, mechanics, electrics and physical behavior, along with driver data and environmental data.</p>
<h2>CES: It&#8217;s electric</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">CES has been used as a platform for automakers to launch new electric vehicles since at least the middle of the last decade. And this year was no different, although maybe even more than in the past. Even Sony came back with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/sony-mobility/">Vision S concept electric car</a>, and announced that the Sony Group is starting a new division &#8212; the Sony Mobility Inc. &#8212; which will start commercializing its electric vehicles.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>General Motors CEO and Chair Mary Barra</strong>, who introduced the  Chevy Bolt EV on the CES stage back in 2016, came back virtually again with a bevy of announcements related to its electric vehicle plans.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">First up was the reveal of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/the-chevy-silverado-finally-goes-electric/">Chevy Silverado EV</a>. GM introduced two trims, a basic work truck called at WT that has a range of 400 miles, up to 664 horsepower and a starting price of $39,900. Then there is the RST First Edition, a fully loaded, four-wheel-steering truck that will start at $105,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Silverado EV is the third electric truck announced by GM, following the Hummer EV and the Sierra Denali. Little is known about the Denali &#8212; GM teased it just last month &#8212; but it appears the Silverado shares the majority of its parts with the impressive Hummer EV. Don&#8217;t mistake the Silverado EV as an afterthought, editor Matt Burns noted in his report. The Silverado EV is the most important of the bunch.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Chevy Silverado has long been the main competitor with the top-selling Ford F-150 pickup. Side note: Last week Ford said it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/ford-double-production-lightning-pickup/">doubling production capacity</a> of the new all-electric F-150 Lightning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Barra also confirmed — and showed pictures of — an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/electric-chevrolet-equinox-chevrolet-blazer-suvs-are-coming-in-2023/">electric Chevy Equinox</a>, as well as a Chevy Blazer, which will both come in 2023.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What might have been missed during the splashy event (there were a number of announcements) was an image of a pontoon boat that flashed behind Barra as she spoke.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I got confirmation from GM that this is the newest boat from Pure Watercraft, which separately revealed the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pure-watercraft-unveils-new-electric-pontoon-boat-301454425.html">new product at CES 2022</a> and opened up preorders. If you recall, the automaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/gm-acquires-25-stake-in-electric-boat-company-pure-watercraft/">took a 25% stake</a> in the Seattle-based electric boat company last November.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the first product to come from GM&#8217;s investment in Pure Watercraft. The boat uses GM EV components. What makes this so interesting, beyond the EV boat, is that this illustrates GM&#8217;s broader push into EV component strategy, which the company thinks has an addressable market of $20 billion by 2030. This includes marine applications, along with EV crate motors for historic vehicles and converting equipment like airport ground support vehicles to electric propulsion.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I chatted with <strong>Travis Hester</strong>, GM&#8217;s VP of EV growth operations, so stay tuned this coming week for insights on this strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other major automakers that showed off electric vehicle concepts included <strong>Stellantis</strong> with its Airflow concept and <strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> with the EQXX.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Stellantis actually had a bunch of news, including that it will turn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/stellantis-airflow-chrysler-all-electric-brand-by-2028/">Chrysler into an all-electric brand</a>. The big overall announcement was the tip-to-tail agreement Stellantis now has with Amazon that covers a cloud computing contract, software development and supplying the e-commerce company with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/amazon-delivery-fleet-electric-ram-promaster-vans/">upcoming all-electric Ram Promaster vans</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I interviewed <strong>Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares</strong> and am saving the good stuff for this coming week.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And then there is Mercedes-Benz and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/mercedes-benzs-vision-for-the-future-is-an-ultra-efficient-luxury-620-mile-range-ev/">EQXX concept</a>. This isn&#8217;t meant to be your typical we&#8217;ll-never-see-this-again concept car.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The EQXX is meant to showcase what the automaker&#8217;s electric future will look like and includes a ton of tech and features, which <span class="il">Markus</span> <span class="il">Schäfer, a board member of Daimler AG and CTO of Mercedes-Benz AG, told me will show up in vehicles beginning in 2024. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There were lots of smaller players as well that I want to briefly mention.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>ElectraMeccanica</strong> showed off a few of its single-occupant EVs, including the SOLO &#8220;O2&#8221; Oxygen, which has a redesigned dashboard, and the SOLO Cargo, a modified version of the flagship vehicle, designed to accommodate a wide range of commercial applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then there was <strong>Triggo</strong>, a fun-looking single-occupant electric vehicle that can actually get slimmer if needed.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">OK folks, that&#8217;s it. Thanks for hanging in there for the CES information dump. This coming week I plan to feature interviews with Stellantis&#8217; Tavares, GM&#8217;s Hester and Toyota chief scientist Dr. Gill Pratt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London-based <a href="https://kodlandschool.webflow.io/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kodland</a>, which started out back in 2018 offering in-person courses for children to learn digital skills like computer programming before switching focus to online learning from early 2020, has closed a $9 million Series A funding round to scale into more markets.</p>
<p>The round is led by Redseed Ventures, with participation from Baring Vostok, Kismet, Flyer One Ventures and Alexander Nevinsky, a partner at New York-based I2BF.</p>
<p>Kodland&#8217;s remote courses for children aged 6-17 are currently available in the U.K., Ireland, the U.S., Canada, CIS Region, Malaysia, Indonesia and Argentina &#8212; with the startup offering proprietary localized content for each target region (although its users are spread across some 40 countries). So far, it says some 16,000 children have been signed up for its paid courses.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244802" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new funding will be used to further expand the reach of its online courses.</p>
<p>The courses focus on group- and project-based learning, teaching kids digital skills including coding, website building, games creation, animation and video editing in a way that&#8217;s structured to be more fun and interactive than traditional classroom-based lessons. Although the online learning offered by Kodland&#8217;s platform is guided by teachers rather than self-serve.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jUmu6KeVmw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/stem-toys-for-kids-and-teens/">Gift Guide: 20+ STEM toy gift ideas for aspiring young builders</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gift Guide: 20+ STEM toy gift ideas for aspiring young builders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/stem-toys-for-kids-and-teens/embed/#?secret=jUmu6KeVmw" data-secret="jUmu6KeVmw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Kodland says it has around 1,000 teachers on its platform (some are employed by it, some are gig workers, depending on the market); while the &#8220;typical&#8221; ratio is one teacher per 15 pupils. It notes its platform does also offer one-to-one teaching.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The edtech startup says it&#8217;s focused on extracurricular teaching of digital skills for kids versus selling tools and resources to schools as it&#8217;s easier to scale globally &#8212; meaning it skips the complexities of K12 procurement.</p>
<p>And with a nod towards the creator economy, it&#8217;s established its own &#8220;accelerator&#8221; &#8212; called Out of the Box &#8212; where it offers (extra) support to the most talented students to help them monetize their digital creations by turning them into &#8220;real-life&#8221; products.</p>
<p>Kodland&#8217;s latest tranche of funding &#8212; which brings its total raised to date to $11 million &#8212; will be used for market expansion, with courses in a further eight languages planned over the next two years. It says it will also be spending on product development.</p>
<p>&#8220;During 2022 we will expand further in English-speaking countries, in addition to U.K. and Ireland, enter Spanish-speaking countries and several countries in South-East Asia,&#8221; the startup tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>A smaller slice of the funding will be ploughed into its accelerator program.</p>
<p>The Series A funding comes off the back of what Kodland bills as &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">considerable traction&#8221; with students and &#8220;robust top-line growth&#8221; &#8212; noting that it grew its revenue 6.5x in the third quarter of 2021 versus the same period last year. </span></p>
<p>Edtech generally has had a booming pandemic, given all the extra screen time caused by lockdowns and restrictions on in-person mixing &#8212; not to mention the demand for support as homeworking parents have sought tools to keep their offspring gainfully employed while they try to work.</p>
<p>That does mean competition is pretty heated, though.</p>
<p>Funding giants like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/class-a-zoom-only-virtual-classroom-nears-unicorn-status-after-softbank-check/">SoftBank have been ploughing millions into the space</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/outschool-series-c-unicorn/">clutch of edtech unicorns</a> is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/softbank-backed-korean-edtech-startup-riiid-acquires-langoo-to-expand-further-to-japan/">driving plenty</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/booming-edtech-ma-activity-brings-consolidation-to-a-fragmented-sector/">M&amp;A activity</a>. A bunch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/edtech-leans-into-the-creator-economy-with-cohort-based-classes/">cohort-based learning platforms</a> has also been successful in attracting recent investment &#8212; by, similarly, seeking to bridge the gap between edtech and the creator economy.</p>
<p>Where kids are concerned, a giant of the category remains <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/roblox-follows-minecraft-into-the-education-market/">Roblox</a> &#8212; which leverages social gaming to get children interested in learning programming and potentially earning money off of their creations.</p>
<p>Still, Kodland&#8217;s structure and focus &#8212; STEM skills for kids delivered via teacher-led classes &#8212; may help it carve a niche in the growing sea of edtech plays.</p>
<p>Billing itself as an &#8220;international online digital skills school for kids and teens&#8221;, its marketing is geared toward pitching parents on the notion of quality educational screen time for their offspring &#8212; selling bundles of four classes (aka a &#8220;module&#8221;) for €110; or a &#8220;complete&#8221; course of 32 classes from €660.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Series A in a statement, Eugene Belov, managing partner at Redseed, said: &#8220;Traditional educational institutions have a hard time keeping up with the rapid pace of technological development in today&#8217;s world. This often leads to a disconnect between the supply (skills and abilities of young graduates) and demand for talent (the requirements of modern workplaces). [Co-founders] Alexander [Nosulich] and Oleg [Kheyfets], are working hard on filling this gap by teaching their students skills which are very often left out of classical school programs, but which are becoming essential in today&#8217;s digital universe. And the unique result-oriented way their programs are structured make them highly appealing to modern kids. We are very excited to support Kodland on their journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no monopoly in the educational segment now, which means that more and more players are entering the market to meet the growing demand for educational services,&#8221; added Vital Laptenok, general partner at Flyer One Ventures, in another supporting statement. &#8220;Those who understand the real needs of their customers will be able to become major players and set trends in the market. The Kodland team focuses precisely on the practical knowledge and opportunities for children to learn relevant professions in an interactive manner.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.doctolib.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doctolib</a> held a (virtual) press conference this morning to share some metrics, look back at the company’s recent product launches and give a hint about future investments. Doctolib started as a booking platform for doctors and has expanded to other services for doctors and medical workers in general.</p>
<p>With its software-as-a-service strategy, medical workers pay a monthly subscription to use Doctolib’s tools and use them with their patients. And it’s been working well, as 300,000 medical workers currently pay Doctolib every month — general practitioners, dentists, pharmacies, psychologists, etc. With a subscription price starting at €129 per month, the startup has a monthly recurring revenue ranging in the tens of millions of euros.</p>
<p>2021 has been a pivotal year for the company as the platform has reached a critical mass in France. For instance, when you want to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in France, many people visit Doctolib’s website to find the nearest vaccination center, pharmacy or doctor with free slots. Vaccination places can use <a href="https://vitemadose.covidtracker.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other platforms</a>, but in reality most of them use Doctolib to handle bookings.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255509" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Doctolib currently operates in France, Germany and Italy. France is still the company’s main market; 60 million people have used Doctolib so far — most of them have interacted with the service to book an appointment. In 2022, the company predicts that it’ll work with an additional 100,000 medical workers.</p>
<h2>Creating a suite of products</h2>
<p>Now that Doctolib has a commercial relationship with a ton of doctors, it can release new products and build its suite of services. In many ways, Doctolib is following Salesforce’s strategy. It has a very sticky main product that acts as a springboard for other products.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/doctolib-details-how-telemedicine-appointments-work/">launched</a> remote appointments with a telemedicine add-on. Doctors who choose to pay a bit more can start video calls and use Doctolib’s payment systems for remote appointments.</p>
<p>Last year, Doctolib launched <a href="https://info.doctolib.fr/doctolib-medecin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doctolib Médecin</a>, a back-office tool for administrative tasks. For instance, it lets you centralize documents for each patient, see a patient’s history, take notes and issue invoices.</p>
<p>“We started working on it three years ago. We thought we would start from scratch compared to what’s available,” Doctolib’s Managing Director of France Arthur Thirion said. “It is being used by a bit more than 2,000 doctors right now.”</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t the first product that helps you manage your work as a doctor. But it integrates nicely with the rest of the Doctolib ecosystem.</p>
<p>Similarly, Doctolib wants to increase the network effects of its platform with a new service called <a href="https://info.doctolib.fr/doctolib-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doctolib Team</a>. This time, the company doesn’t want to create a new revenue stream, it wants to make Doctolib essential.</p>
<p>Doctolib Team is an instant messaging service that lets you find specialists and chat with them. You can also securely send documents about your patients.</p>
<p>For health professionals already using Doctolib, it’s a nice-to-have feature. For health professionals who aren’t using Doctolib already, they can create a free Doctolib Team account and start using it — and maybe they might subscribe to Doctolib’s other products down the road.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255512" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255512" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2255512" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg 6970w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255512" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Doctolib</p></div></p>
<h2>Operating with a high level of scrutiny</h2>
<p>Doctolib isn’t your average startup, as the company handles sensitive medical data. There have been <a href="https://www.telerama.fr/medias/sur-doctolib-le-secret-medical-est-soigne-avec-beaucoup-de-legerete-6665635.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot</a> <a href="https://www.franceinter.fr/justice/doctolib-le-chiffrement-des-donnees-incomplet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of reports</a> on the company’s hosting stack and design decisions.</p>
<p>And the company is well aware that it can’t act like other startups. For instance, the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/doctolib-is-now-a-unicorn-with-new-170-million-round/">reached unicorn status</a>, but it has stopped sharing funding details since then. You don’t want to talk too much about money when you’re trying to improve everyone’s health.</p>
<p>“We have stopped communicating on funding rounds for the past several years,” co-founder and CEO Stanislas Niox-Chateau said. “Every quarter, every year, investors invest once again or invest for the first time based on our long-term project.”</p>
<p>Doctolib now wants to become a mission-driven company — it’s a special status that you can get if you comply with certain rules. And Stanislas Niox-Chateau founds multiple arguments to position his company as a company that improves society.</p>
<p>For instance, he said that Doctolib’s business model is quite clear — the company relies exclusively on subscriptions from health professionals. The company doesn&#8217;t monetize patient data.</p>
<p>According to him, the platform is also used widely and doesn’t create a digital divide. Many users don’t live in major cities for instance. And the product is supposedly easy enough that even elderly people can use it.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that the company plans to stand still. It has ambitious expansion plans for 2022. Doctolib will grow its team from 2,300 employees to 3,000 employees. And starting today, all employees will become Doctolib shareholders. Everyone will get at least €20,000 in stock grants.</p>
<p>In 2022, the company plans to invest €300 million to improve its products and grow its platforms in France, Germany and Italy — it mostly means new hires and new offices. There won’t be any new market launch in 2022, but that might come later down the road.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.asknicely.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AskNicely</a> is the latest company attracting capital for its app targeting shift or frontline worker success as more businesses rightly begin to see how valuable these employees are to their bottom line and how technology can ensure these key employees are empowered to help the company grow.</p>

<p>The Portland, Oregon-based company, which has its tech team in New Zealand, began developing its SaaS customer experience management tools in 2014 for businesses that rely on humans, co-founder and CEO Aaron Ward told TechCrunch. The tools pull in Net Promoter Score, workflow, recognition and feedback, coaching and insights so that businesses can lead from their frontline workers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255192" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Historically, we’ve been taught that businesses are top down, but what we know is that the signal often gets lost,” he added. “The ‘magic’ is to make those signals always on and for the practice of sharing feedback and delivering coaching are daily things, not just those that happen once a quarter or once a month.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, the company announced a $32 million Series B round of funding that was led by Five Elms Capital, with participation from existing investors Nexus Venture Partners and Blackbird. Five Elms’ Ryan Mandl is joining AskNicely’s board as part of the funding.</p>
<p>The new capital gives AskNicely a total of $47 million in fundraising. It previously raised its Series A in January 2019, and Ward said the driver for going after additional capital was in part the global pandemic. Many of its service business customers shut their doors as a result, and the company was contemplating if it was time to pivot. Instead, AskNicely doubled down on its mission and took the down time during the pandemic to invest in the product and its marketing, he added.</p>
<p>Those efforts paid off for the company, and Ward was able to take those early results to the capital markets, which recognized this as new technology for a class of workers largely ignored previously by technology, he said.</p>
<p>Ward believes that taking that time to focus on the company gives AskNicely a headstart on the rest of the market.</p>

<p>“We were the first to market with this and focusing on the changing technology for this class of workers,” he added. “The new capital will enable us to go deeper on product and invest in business out sales and marketing as we get ready to take our platform to market and announce ourselves.”</p>
<p>With <a href="https://1huddle.co/blog/2021-trends-digital-frontline-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80% of the global working population</a> considered frontline workers in industries like retail, food service and healthcare, Ward says the market opportunity is a massive one. Companies also taking in venture capital as they aim to reverse this underserved market include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/blink-a-productivity-app-aimed-at-frontline-workers-raises-20m-at-a-100m-valuation/">Blink</a>, an app for frontline workers to use and engage with the various IT services used by their organizations, as well as with each other. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/shiftsmart-a-marketplace-matching-shift-workers-to-employers-grabs-95m/">Shiftsmart</a>, a marketplace matching shift workers to employers, raised $95 million, while messaging app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/when-i-work-an-messaging-app-that-lets-shift-based-teams-schedule-work-and-more-raises-200m/">When I Work</a> closed on a huge round — $200 million.

Earlier this year, we saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/homebase-raises-71m-for-a-team-management-platform-aimed-at-smbs-and-their-hourly-workers/">Homebase</a>, which raised $71 million earlier this year, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/workiz-locks-in-13m-for-productivity-tools-aimed-at-home-services-professionals/">Workiz</a>, which focuses on home services pros, raised $13 million.</p>
<p>AskNicely has over 60 employees, and plans to double that over the next year. Ward wouldn’t get specific about company revenue other than to say the company is a “high-growth SaaS business.” He did reveal that AskNicely is working with 1,300 customers, mainly in North America, Australia and Europe, and that it has gotten to a point with its selling price that “every new customer today is worth 10 times more what we have been doing historically.”</p>
<p>“We are here to fix how frontline workers work, and in the past 24 months, companies have realized a new appreciation for what they have done,” Ward said. “They are underserved by technology and frankly underappreciated, underpaid and underestimated. We are helping them be successful, but we can’t do it alone. We need to build a movement to link arms with coalition partners and build partnerships with other players to make a difference.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Huge consolidation is afoot in the world of gaming. Today Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/news-releases/news-release-details/take-two-and-zynga-combine-bringing-together-best-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a plan to acquire mobile games giant Zynga, in a deal valued at $9.86 per share &#8212; $3.50 in cash and the remaining $6.36 in shares of Take-Two common stock. Zynga&#8217;s enterprise value in the deal works out to $12.7 billion.</p>
<p>The deal will bring together two gaming powerhouses, Take-Two in consoles and PC games (including such iconic titles as Grand Theft Auto) and Zynga in a massive swathe of mobile games, a genre that was arguably largely defined by the company (it&#8217;s behind FarmVille, Empires &amp; Puzzles, Words with Friends and more).</p>
<p>The deal, Take-Two said, will result in $6.1 billion in 12-month pro-forma net bookings (ending September 30, 2021), making it one of the largest gaming companies overall, regardless of platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255494" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The transaction is expected to close in Q1 of fiscal year 2023, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to announce our transformative transaction with Zynga, which significantly diversifies our business and establishes our leadership position in mobile, the fastest growing segment of the interactive entertainment industry,” said Strauss Zelnick, chairman and CEO of Take-Two, in a statement. “This strategic combination brings together our best-in-class console and PC franchises, with a market-leading, diversified mobile publishing platform that has a rich history of innovation and creativity. Zynga also has a highly talented and deeply experienced team, and we look forward to welcoming them into the Take-Two family in the coming months. As we combine our complementary businesses and operate at a much larger scale, we believe that we will deliver significant value to both sets of stockholders, including $100 million of annual cost synergies within the first two years post-closing and at least $500 million of annual Net Bookings opportunities over time.”</p>
<p>“Combining Zynga’s expertise in mobile and next-generation platforms with Take-Two’s best-in-class capabilities and intellectual property will enable us to further advance our mission to connect the world through games while achieving significant growth and synergies together,” added Frank Gibeau, CEO of Zynga. “I am proud of our team’s hard work to deliver a strong finish to 2021, with one of the best performances in Zynga’s history. We are incredibly excited to have found a partner in Take-Two that shares our commitment to investing in our players, amplifying our creative culture, and generating more value for stockholders. With this transformative transaction, we begin a new journey which will allow us to create even better games, reach larger audiences and achieve significant growth as a leader in the next era of gaming.”</p>
<p>Strauss Zelnick will lead the larger company, with Gibeau and Zynga&#8217;s president of Publishing, Bernard Kim, overseeing the larger mobile business (including integrating Zynga with Take-Two&#8217;s existing mobile operations).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As with a lot of other consolidation moves, this is about cost savings through synergies. Take-Two said the deal would help the larger business save about $100 million annually after two years (first will come integrations). Take-Two already has a number of mobile games titles and has expanded its franchises into mobile, but this will give the company a significantly larger holding in the space.</p>
<p>This is key, considering how Zynga has fared over the years. Since a huge boom in its share price when it first went public, the company has been on a bit of a roller coaster, and over the last year has seen its <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZNGA?p=ZNGA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share price drop</a>, making it an acquisition target.</p>
<p>The move also puts to an end an era of sorts. As a startup based out of San Francisco&#8217;s SOMA district just as the city was coming into its own as a tech hub separate from Silicon Valley, it was an early mover in spotting and scaling the mobile gaming opportunity.</p>
<p>Initially it found huge traction as a social gaming giant, leaning on growth by way of Facebook&#8217;s social graph, but as that became annoying and spammy, over time Facebook changed the rules and cut off Zynga&#8217;s audience supply. More generally, the mobile gaming market has proven to be a more precarious one when it comes to consumer tastes and usage, and so a lot of Zynga&#8217;s success has been banked around finding (and sometimes acquiring) the next hot new title and franchise to replace those that have waned in popularity. (One of its bigger recent acquisitions was acquiring, in 2020, Turkey&#8217;s Peak Games, which had already established traction with Toon Blast and Toy Blast, for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/zynga-acquires-turkeys-peak-games-for-1-8b-after-buying-its-card-games-studio-for-100m-in-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $1.8 billion</a>.)</p>
<p>Combining with Take-Two, which also publishes Red Dead Redemption, Midnight Club, NBA 2K, BioShock, Borderlands, Civilization, Mafia and Kerbal Space Program, will give it a large library of franchises and IP from which to build new mobile gaming experiences. Similarly, Zynga&#8217;s IP may now find new traction in different formats and different screens.</p>
<p>What is interesting is whether and how the larger company will use its expanded content IP to think about how it engages with the market at large. These days so much action in gaming happens more on the platforms where people meet to discuss games and be social with each other, whether that is over Twitch, Discord or somewhere else.</p>
<p>The gaming market has seen a huge surge of attention in the last couple of years, as one of the &#8220;winners&#8221; in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic with more people looking for diversions while staying put at home.Take-Two quoted figures that said overall the mobile gaming industry saw $136 billion in gross bookings in 2021 and is growing currently at 8%. Mobile will now account for half of Take-Two&#8217;s bookings, it said.</p>
<p>More to come&#8230;</p>
