										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://blackinnovationalliance.com/">Black Innovation Alliance </a>and <a href="http://www.vilcap.com/">Village Capital</a> today announced Resource, a national initiative aimed at boosting the efforts of entrepreneur support organizations (ESOs) led by, and focused on, founders of color.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The motivation behind the project is straightforward. ESOs “face record demand, declining resources and are chronically underestimated, underappreciated and underfunded,” the organizations say.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Resource aims to give local accelerators and incubators support in the form of training and community.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Resource’s &#8220;ESO Accelerator” will train startup ecosystem leaders on how to build a more financially sustainable organization, as well as help connect them to potential funders. It also will provide milestone-based financial support tied to organizational development.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Resource also plans to build a national community of practice among ESO leaders of color and their funders to share best practices and “develop stronger capital and mentorship pathways&#8221; for Black, Latinx and Indigenous founders across the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Village Capital, says CEO Allie Burns, supports and invest in entrepreneurs “who have been historically sitting in historical blind spots of investors, whether that&#8217;s by the problems they&#8217;re trying to solve, the geography they&#8217;re located in or demographic factors that we have seen lead to capital being concentrated in very few people, places and problems.” Village Capital has worked with more than 100 other ESOs to help grow companies with founders from all backgrounds over the past five years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The goal with Resource is to help ensure that incubators and accelerators focused on supporting people of color have the resources they need to flourish, she added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We want to make sure that those accelerators and other ESOs have the financial, social and human capital to keep their doors open and grow,” Burns said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Black Innovation Alliance Executive Director Kelly Burton points out that these Black-led organizations are often the first line of support for Black entrepreneurs yet reap few benefits from their success over time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They receive very little support and very little funding,” she said. “It&#8217;s almost like they do all the heavy lifting, they plant seeds and do all the cultivation but they don&#8217;t really get to benefit once that founder and that startup has really taken off. This is an opportunity for us to stabilize these organizations to help them build their own capacities and capabilities so that that organization can be sustainable.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Resource is supported by a national coalition of funders committed to supporting entrepreneurs of color. The initial coalition includes Moody’s, The Sorenson Impact Foundation, Travelers and UBS.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In related news, on Tuesday we covered New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/new-jersey-announces-10m-seed-fund-aimed-at-black-and-latinx-founders/">proposal</a> for a $10 million allocation in the state budget to create a seed fund for Black and Latinx startups.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In that piece, we noted that there are a number of organizations out there that are committed to funding diverse founders.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In February, several national and Chicago-based organizations banded together to support early-stage Black and Latinx tech entrepreneurs through a new program dubbed <a href="https://techrise.co/">TechRise</a>. The nonprofit P33 launched the program in partnership with Verizon and 1871, a private business incubator and technology hub, among others, with the goals “of narrowing the wealth gap in Chicago, generating thousands of tech-related jobs and giving $5 million in grant funding to Black and Latino entrepreneurs,” according to the <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/2/25/22301698/techrise-initiative-support-chicago-black-latinx-latino-tech-founders">Chicago Sun Times</a>. (Disclosure: Verizon is TechCrunch’s parent company).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also in Austin, <a href="https://divinc.org/">DivInc</a> is a nonprofit pre-accelerator that holds 12-week programs for underrepresented tech founders. Founded in 2016 by former Dell executive Preston James, the organization aims to “empower people of color and women entrepreneurs and help them build successful high-growth businesses by providing them with access to education, mentorship and vital networks.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fuel Capital General Partner Leah Solivan joined us at TechCrunch Early Stage 2021 to talk about how to avoid early mistakes in building your startup. Solivan has ample experience on both sides of the fence, as she founded TaskRabbit and led it to exit through an acquisition by Ikea in 2017. She shared a list of 10 things to avoid in total, but here are some highlights of what to watch out for.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Share your ideas freely</h3>
<p>Solivan urged founders to not be shy about sharing their ideas, as some people can tend to be secretive about their startup concept. The notion that giving up your idea somehow means you&#8217;ll end up with more competition is not a legitimate concern in the end, Solivan said. Instead, sharing that idea with as many people as you can is much more likely to generate positive results than negative.</p>
<blockquote><p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I would be giving a presentation. And someone after the presentation would come up to me and say, oh my goodness, I had this same idea for TaskRabbit, like 10 years ago. And I&#8217;d be like, great! What did you do with that idea? And I think the point is, is that the idea itself isn&#8217;t the magic — the magic is in the execution of your idea and actually turning that idea into a business. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 01:42)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Take everyone&#8217;s advice, but make the call</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok today is doubling down on its roots as a music-backed creation app with the launch of a half dozen new music effects for creators. The effects, which offer interactivity, visualizations, animations and more, will roll out over the next few weeks, starting with the launch of <a href="https://m.tiktok.com/share/stickers/detail/1020192/?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowfKLdM2nynkSyK7MJw7Qh2G6sw62baODxSxNS48Gmd3%2BLBGY%2FuV9Ve%2B65sOCI%2BmDOGgA%3D&amp;object_id=1020192&amp;schema_type=17&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAA2OmHkXmA2XE1HvFfLGsupck6AQrxBOC-wJ1xHnr75_TWmD0o2FgJWos6njYlF3Wi&amp;share_link_id=D870E76A-EDAF-476D-88C2-7BCE3BDAC251&amp;share_sticker_id=1020192&amp;tt_from=more&amp;u_code=d5jje868690fkj&amp;user_id=6680962180727129093&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=more">Music Visualizer</a>. This effect is now available to TikTok&#8217;s global user base and runs real-time beat tracking to animate a retro greenscreen landscape, the company says.</p>
<p>The effect was added to TikTok&#8217;s Creative Effects tray yesterday and there are already over 28,000 videos created using the new feature. The effect results in videos featuring a purple sky with multiple moons (or planets?) in the background, where the grid on the ground pulses up and down with the music.</p>
<p>Music Visualizer works with any sounds in TikTok&#8217;s music library and has also been adopted by the electronic dance music duo AREA21 who used Music Visualizer to tease their <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@area21/video/6948093659246005510?sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6941038004544079365&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;is_copy_url=0">new track &#8220;La La La</a>.&#8221; Unfortunately, their use of the effect hides the animation behind one of their own. But <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMe53Yb3c/">several</a> <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMe5HWV4H/">other</a> <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMe592SKG/">creators</a> showcase the effect better.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Other effects on the way include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Music Machine</strong>, which offers an interactive set of tools that will allow users to control the real-time rendering of MIDI loops for different music layers. There will also be a BPM slider for real-time adjustments; five, one-shot sound effects; and dynamic visual responses for the video of your recorded music.</li>
<li><strong>Delayed Beats</strong>, which recreates the freeze-frame effect that&#8217;s already popular on TikTok while aligning transitions to the beat of the music</li>
<li><strong>Text Beats,</strong> which allows creators to add animated text overlays to their video that transition in sync with the beat of any sound from TikTok&#8217;s library.</li>
<li><strong>Solid Beats</strong>, which add visual effects that sync to the beat of any song.</li>
<li><strong>Mirror Beats</strong>, which align display transitions with the beat of any song from TikTok&#8217;s library.</li>
</ul>
<p>The launch of the new features follow arrival of several new TikTok competitors from major social networks, including Instagram (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/">Reels</a>), Snapchat (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">Spotlight</a>), and YouTube (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">Shorts</a>). The additions of the features help to demonstrate how far behind these rivals are in terms of competing on on the product experience. While the newcomers to the short-form video space may have launched their own set of basic creation tools, they&#8217;re lacking the larger libraries of creative effects that make TikTok fun to use, as well as appealing to those who are more specifically interested in its music features.</p>
<p>All the new effects will be rolled out to the dedicated &#8220;Music&#8221; tab within TikTok&#8217;s Creative Effects tray, as they become globally available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As a company founded by data scientists, <a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> may be in a unique position to develop tooling to help companies build machine learning applications. For starters, it developed an open source project, but today the startup announced an expanded beta of a new commercial offering and $35 million Series B funding.</p>
<p>Sequoia led the investment with help from previous investors Gradient Ventures and GGV Capital. Today&#8217;s round brings the total raised to $62 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>Data scientists can download the open source project and build a machine learning application, but it requires a certain level of technical aptitude to make all the parts work. Company co-founder and CEO Adrien Treuille  says that so far the company has 20,000 monthly active developers using the open source tooling to develop streaming apps, which have been viewed millions of times.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As they have gained that traction, they have customers who would prefer to use a commercial service. &#8220;It&#8217;s great to have something free and that you can use instantly, but not every company is capable of bridging that into a commercial offering,&#8221; Treuille explained.</p>
<p>Company COO and co-founder Amanda Kelly says that the commercial offering called Streamlit for Teams is designed to remove some of the complexity around using the open source application. &#8220;The whole [process of] how do I actually deploy an app, put it in a container, make sure it scales, has the resources and is securely connected to data sources [&#8230;] &#8212; that&#8217;s a whole different skill set. That&#8217;s a DevOps and IT skill set,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>What Streamlit for Teams does is take care of all that in the background for end users, so they can concentrate on the app building part of the equation without help from the technical side of the company to deploy it.</p>

<p>Sonya Huang, a partner at Sequoia, who is leading the firm&#8217;s investment in Streamlit, says that she was impressed with the company&#8217;s developer focus and sees the new commercial offering as a way to expand usage of the applications that data scientists have been building in the open source project.</p>
<p>&#8220;Streamlit has a chance to define a better interface between data teams and business users by ushering in a new paradigm for interactive, data-rich applications,&#8221; Huang said.</p>
<p>They have data scientists at big-name companies like Uber, Delta Dental and John Deere using the open source product already. They have kept the company fairly lean with 27 employees up until now, but the plan is to double that number in the coming year with the new funding, Kelly says.</p>
<p>She says that the founding team recognizes that it&#8217;s important to build a diverse company. She admits that it&#8217;s not always easy to do in practice when as a young startup, you are just fighting to stay alive, but she says that the funding gives them the luxury to step back and begin to hire more deliberately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Literally right before this call, I was on with a consultant who is going to come in and work with the executive team, so that we&#8217;re all super clear about what we mean [when it comes to] diversity for us and how is this actually a really core part of our company, so that we can flow that into recruiting and people and engineering practices and and make that a lived value within our company,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Streamlit for Teams is available in beta starting today. The company plans to make it generally available some time later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the more tedious aspects of machine learning is providing a set of labels to teach the machine learning model what it needs to know. <a href="http://snorkel.ai">Snorkel AI</a> wants to make it easier for subject matter experts to apply those labels programmatically, and today the startup announced a $35 million Series B.</p>
<p>It also announced a new tool called Applications Studio that provides a way to build common machine learning applications using templates and predefined components.</p>
<p>Lightspeed Venture Partners led the round with participation from previous investors Greylock, GV, In-Q-Tel and Nepenthe Capital. New investors Walden and BlackRock also joined in. The startup reports that it has now raised $50 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Alex Ratner says that data labeling remains a huge challenge and roadblock to moving machine learning and artificial intelligence forward inside a lot of industries because it is costly, labor-intensive and hard for the subject experts to carve out the time to do it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The not so hidden secret about AI today is that in spite of all the technological and tooling advancements, roughly 80 to 90% of the cost and time for an average AI project goes into just manually labeling and collecting and relabeling this training data,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He says that his company has developed a solution to simplify this process to make it easier for subject experts to programmatically add the labels, a process he says decreases the time and effort required to apply labels in a pretty dramatic way from months to hours or days, depending on the complexity of the data.</p>
<p>As the company has developed this methodology, customers have been asking for help in the next step of the machine learning process, which is taking that training data and the model and building an application. That&#8217;s where the Application Studio comes in. It could be a contract classifier at a bank or a network anomaly detector at a telco and it helps companies take that next step after data labeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just about how you programmatically label the data, it&#8217;s also about the models, the preprocessors, the post processors, and so we&#8217;ve made this now accessible in a kind of templated and visual no-code interface,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s products are based on research that began at the Stanford AI Lab in 2015. The founders spent four years in the research phase before launching Snorkel in 2019. Today, the startup has 40 employees. Ratner recognizes the issues that the technology industry has had from a diversity perspective and says he has made a conscious effort to build a diverse and inclusive company.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I can say is that we tried to prioritize it at a company level, the full team level and at a board level from day one, and to also put action behind that. So we&#8217;ve been working with external firms for internal training and audits and strategy around DEI, and we&#8217;ve made pipeline diversity, a non-negotiable requirement of any of our contracts with recruiting firms,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ratner also recognizes that automation can hard code bias into machine learning models, and he&#8217;s hopeful that by simplifying the labeling process, it can make it much easier to detect bias when it happens.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you start with a dozen or two dozen of what we call labeling functions in Snorkel, you still need to be vigilant and proactive about trying to detect bias, but it&#8217;s easier to audit what taught your model to change it by just going back and looking at a couple of hundred lines of code.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hiro.capital/">Hiro Capital</a> has gradually been making a name for itself as an investor in the area know as ‘Digital Sports’ or DSports for short. It’s now led a $2.3m funding round in PlayerData. While the round might sound small, the area it&#8217;s going into is large and growing. Also investing in the round is Sir Terry Leahy, previously the CEO of Tesco, the largest British retailer.</p>
<p>Edinburgh, UK-based PlayerData uses wearable technology and software tracking to give grass-roots and professional sports teams feedback on their training. It can, for instance, allow coaches to replay key moments from a game, even modeling different outcomes based on player positioning.</p>
<p>This is Hiro Capital’s 4th DSports and &#8216;connected fitness&#8217; investment, and it joins Zwift, FitXR and NURVV. Hiro has also invested in eight games startups in the UK, USA and Europe, as befits the heritage of cofounder and partner Ian Livingstone, OBE,CBE, who is the former chairman of Tomb Raider publisher Eidos plc and all-round gaming pioneer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>PlayerData says it has captured more than 10,000 team sessions across UK soccer and rugby, and logged over 50 million meters of play. It also has strong network effects, it says. Every time a new team encounters one using Playerdata’s platform, it generates 5 more clubs as users.</p>
<p>Roy Hotrabhvanon is cofounder and CEO of PlayerData, and is a former international-level archer. He’s joined by Hayden Ball, cofounder and CTO, a firmware and cloud infrastructure expert.</p>

<p>In a statement Hotrabhvanon said: “Our mission is to bring fine-grained data and insight to clubs across team sports, helping them supercharge their game-making, improve player performance, and avoid injury… Our ultimate goal is to implement cutting-edge insights from pioneering wearables that are applicable to any team in any discipline at any level.”</p>
<p>Cherry Freeman, co-founding Partner at Hiro says: “PlayerData ticks all of our key boxes: a huge TAM with over 3m grass-roots clubs; a deep moat built on shared player data, machine learning and highly actionable predictive algorithms; compelling customer network effects; and a really impressive yet humble founding team.”</p>

<p>The PlayerData news forms part of a wider growth in digital sports, which includes such breakout names as Peloton, Tonal, Mirror, as well as Hiro’s portfolio investment, Zwift. With the pandemic putting an emphasison both home workouts and general health, the fascination with digital measurement of performance now has a growing grip on the sector.</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Freeman added: “We think there are something like 3 million teams that are potential customers for PlayerData. Obviously the number of runners is enormous, and they only need to get a small slice of that market to have a very, very large business. At the end of the day everyone, everyone works out, even if you just go for a walk, so the target market&#8217;s huge and they started with running but their technology is applicable to a whole raft of other sports.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With 17 startups participating, <a href="https://skydeck.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley SkyDeck’s Demo Day</a> isn’t the largest cohort <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/y-combinator/">we’ve seen by any stretch</a>. The collection of companies is, however, defined by a wide range of focuses, from pioneering diabetes treatments to retrofitting autonomous trucking, curated by the SkyDeck&#8217;s small team and a number of advisors.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, the accelerator is focused on developing early-stage companies tied to the University of California system. Applicants must be affiliated with either one of the 10 UC schools or their national laboratories in Berkeley, Livermore and Los Alamos. Notable alumni include micromobility unicorn, Lime, and delivery robotics firm, Kiwi.</p>
<p>In 2020, SkyDeck &#8212; along with much of the rest of the world &#8212; went virtual.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“While flight restrictions did cause some international founders to pull crazy hours from our home countries to participate in the sessions, virtual sessions allowed additional members of our teams to participate that would otherwise not have been able to do so,” the accelerator’s organizers said in a TechCrunch post last year. “We are also hearing chatter that Demo Day will be larger than ever before because virtual events are much more scalable.”</p>

<p>The 17 startups presenting today were whittled down from 1,850 applicants, according to the accelerator. Being a member of the cohort involves six months of launch  assistance from SkyDeck, coupled with up $105,000. “In six months, you’re going to pitch on stage at demo day, to an institutional investor in your industry,” Executive Director Caroline Winnett tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at six highlights from this Demo Day.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.endocrinebio.com/"><strong style="font-family: aktiv-grotesk, sans-serif; font-size: 1.625rem; letter-spacing: -0.06px;">EndoCrine</strong></a></h2>

<p>Building on technologies developed in the stem cell research labs of UCSF, EndoCrine is looking to commercialize a better way to discover and develop drugs. Specifically, the startup is hoping to improve diabetes treatment beyond standard insulin injections.</p>
<p>“EndoCrine’s proprietary human stem cell-derived islet platform revolutionizes the drug discovery and development process, saving years of time and millions of dollars usually spent by pharma companies,” CEO Gopika Nair said in a statement offered to TechCrunch. “Our innovative solution opens an exciting era of personalized medicine in diabetes.”</p>
<p>The company says SkyDeck helped it take the earliest steps out of the lab and into startup mode.</p>

<p>NuPort Robotics is among the most mature of the 17 startups included here. In fact, in mid-March, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canadian-tire-nuport-robotics-partner-120000898.html">the startup signed a partnership</a> with Canadian Tire and the Ontario government, as part of a $3 million investment in an autonomous middle-mile trucking solution.</p>
<p>Rather than building autonomous trucking from scratch, NuPort’s solution is designed to retrofit semis with autonomous technologies.</p>
<p>“This results in operational cost reduction by eliminating the need to replace their existing fleet and yields a safer, more efficient and sustainable transportation system,” CEO Raghavender Sahdev tells TechCrunch.</p>

<p>The Hurd Co.’s goal is simple: reduce the environmental impact of clothing companies by helping to remove trees from the process. Specifically, the company creates cellulosic fiber pulp from agricultural byproducts. This is designed to bypass tree-based agrilose, which is used in the production of a wide variety of fabrics, including rayon.</p>
<p>“Apparel brands are scrambling for new, low-impact fabric that will allow them to meet their ambitious sustainability goals,” CEO Taylor Heisley-Cook tells TechCrunch. “We completely eliminate trees from the supply chain with a hyper-efficient process that dramatically reduces brands’ impact on the environment.”</p>
<p>The company says its process uses half the water and significantly less energy than standard processes. The technology was developed by Hurd&#8217;s CTO, Charles Cai.</p>

<p>I won’t lie, this is the one in the batch I have the most questions about, having seen a number of companies claim their wearables can increase memory.</p>
<p>Here’s what CEO Iain McIntyre has to say: “It’s ideal for activities that depend on memory, like reading, problem solving or multi-tasking. The Humm patch uses tACS (transcranial alternating stimulation) and in clinical research studies, the Humm patch saw a measurable (+~20%) improvement against placebo.”</p>
<p>It’s an interesting underlying technology, and the advisors &#8212; which include a number of university professors in the sciences &#8212; certainly see commercial potential. There are some lingering questions around tACS.</p>
<p>Quoting <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/electrical-brain-stimulation-may-alleviate-obsessive-compulsive-behaviors1/">Scientific American from January</a>: “The potential therapeutic effects of tACS on memory, food craving and other neural processes have been tested in dozens of studies in the past. Questions have been raised about whether this method actually exerts any meaningful changes in the brain, however.”</p>
<p>Definitely interested in seeing more about this one and perhaps taking it for a spin when the product ships, later this year.</p>

<p>As far as elevator pitches go, Publica may have the best one of the show. “Publica is Shopify for Digital Content.” Essentially, the company wants to be a direct conduit between content creators and consumers.</p>
<p>“Publica is a service that enables authors and content creators to have their own custom storefront to share, market and sell e-books, audiobooks and any other types of digital content with no intermediaries,” CEO Pablo Laurino tells TechCrunch. “In the era of D2C and marketplaces, Publica helps authors and content to achieve that on their own storefront, offering authors complete control over their brand and ownership of the relationships.”</p>
<p>The system helps creators make their own own digital storefront to sell a wide variety of products, including audiobooks and e-books. The site is already up and running, with more than 1,200 stores created by 250 clients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://captivateiq.com">CaptivateIQ</a>, which has developed a no-code platform to help companies design customized sales commission plans, has raised $46 million in a Series B round led by Accel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Amity, S28 Capital, Sequoia, and Y Combinator also participated in the financing, which brings the San Francisco-based company’s total raised to $63 million since its 2017 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CaptivateIQ must be doing something right. While it is not yet profitable, the startup&#8217;s revenue has grown 600% year-over-year. To date, it has processed over $2 billion in commissions on its platform across hundreds of enterprise customers including Affirm, TripActions, Udemy, Intercom, Newfront Insurance and JMAC Lending.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A big part of our growth is that we can help any company that offers a performance-based compensation plan, so we don’t have any restrictions with the types of businesses we work with,” said co-CEO Mark Schopmeyer. “We typically see conversations start with teams that have a minimum of 25 sales people, though we easily serve enterprises and public companies as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of payees &#8212; defined as someone receiving a payout in CapitvateIQ’s system &#8212; was up four times in December 2020 from the year prior. Plus, the company had “back-to-back record months” from September through the end of the year in 2020, according to Schopmeyer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He, co-CEO Conway Teng and CTO Hubert Wong founded CaptivateIQ after coming out of Y Combinator’s Winter 2017 cohort. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135068" style="width: 571px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135068" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135068" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg?w=561" alt="Left to right: CaptivateIQ co-founders Hubert Wong, Mark Schopmeyer and Conway Teng" width="561" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg 1512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg?resize=124,150 124w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg?resize=248,300 248w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg?resize=768,931 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg?resize=561,680 561w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg?resize=1268,1536 1268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2135068" class="wp-caption-text">Left to right: CaptivateIQ co-founders Hubert Wong, Mark Schopmeyer and Conway Teng.</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company touts its SaaS platform as a combination of the familiarity of spreadsheets, with the scalability and performance of software, so that users can configure any commission plan “entirely on their own,” according to Teng. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Calculating commissions is really complicated and mission critical &#8211; think of it like a very complicated form of payroll &#8211; each company has a unique commission plan that involves a lot more calculations and data than your typical salary payroll math,” Teng said. “Also, in recent years, companies have access to more data than ever, giving them room to incentive employees on more performance metrics.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, CaptivateIQ has 90 employees, more than triple what it did one year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the startup saw a bump in the number of non-high technology companies buying its software, and as a result, CaptivateIQ is going to increase its efforts into those other verticals, according to Teng. So far, it has found success in particular in financial services, manufacturing, and business services, among other sectors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic served as a tailwind to its business. Sales teams generally rely on in-person interactions to stay productive, Schopmeyer points out. Without those activities over the past year, “having the right incentives in place became ever more critical as companies required new ways to motivate teams during the shift to remote work.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw our product usage skyrocket at the beginning of the pandemic as businesses quickly adjusted incentives, team quotas, SPIFs, and other components of their comp plans to stay competitive,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to improve upon the user experience. Specifically, Teng said, it plans to introduce “more powerful data transformations, a richer set of formulas, and off-the-shelf templates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another goal is to automate and streamline the commissions process from beginning to end, he added. The startup is expanding its data integrations to support “all major data systems” and introducing new dashboarding capabilities. It’s also enhancing existing collaboration workflows around approvals, inquiries and contracts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, CaptivateIQ is exploring the potential of applying its technology to solve for use cases outside the world of commissions &#8212; something that it says its customers are already doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s exciting to see what people have been building, and we’re looking forward to enabling new solutions as we continue to release more of our core technology platform,” Teng said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel Partner Ben Fletcher said the pain point of calculating and reporting sales commissions kept coming up among portfolio companies, with CaptivateIQ frequently referenced. Those </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies, he said, tried more enterprise-grade solutions &#8212; “spending hundreds of thousands on implementation to ultimately find that their products did not work.” They also tried other newer tools that also just didn’t work well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we dug in and talked with more and more customers, it was abundantly clear &#8212; CaptivateIQ was the best product in the space,” Fletcher said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides ease of use, the fact that CaptivateIQ is a no-code tool, is a big deal to Accel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Similar to UIPath, Webflow, and Ada, CaptivateIQ is able to bring the power of customer development and automation to an easy to use, drag-and-drop product,” Fletcher said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chris McGarry, who previously led music integration at Facebook&#8217;s Oculus, is taking a new approach to bringing music into the virtual world with his startup <a href="https://www.authentic-artists.ai">Authentic Artists</a>.</p>
<p>McGarry pointed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/14/more-investors-are-betting-on-virtual-influencers-like-lil-miquela/">virtual celebrities like Lil Miquela</a> and virtual concerts like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/fortnite-hosted-a-psychedelic-travis-scott-concert-and-12-3m-people-watched/">Travis Scott&#8217;s giant event in Fortnite</a> as setting the stage for Authentic Artists. In a sense, the startup represents a combination of those ideas, creating virtual musicians who perform their own concerts — initially in Twitch — and can respond to audience requests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very intentionally not trying to create a digital facsimile of what already exists,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to use new tools to create new art, new experiences, new culture. The appeal is that these artists can really be vehicles for collaboration with the audience, so that [audience members] can selectively shape the live show.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, Authentic Artists has already held some test concerts on Twitch, and McGarry said the team was &#8220;frankly, sort of blown away by the response,&#8221; with average watch time of 35 minutes.</p>
<p>It will be unveiling its next generation of virtual artists in Twitch concerts starting on April 14, co-hosted by (human) Twitch streamers, who will introduce the concept to audiences — though McGarry said there&#8217;s potential for more collaboration between virtual and human stars in the future.</p>
<p>There are a number of different pieces to the Authentic Artists platform, working together to animate a virtual musician, generate their music and allow them to respond to audience feedback, whether that&#8217;s increasing the intensity of a song, decreasing the tempo or fast forwarding to the next song.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/531980169" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Music is the lifeblood of our vision, and accordingly, we&#8217;ve invested significantly in the core audio engine,&#8221; McGarry said. He emphasized that the platform is not simply recombining music loops composed by humans, but rather generating music on its own: &#8220;We want [our virtual artists] to have autonomy, we want them to be real.&#8221;</p>
<p>It sounds like the team is still putting the final touches on the new artists, so I didn&#8217;t get to see a full concert experience. Instead, McGarry and his team presented renderings of these artists (including a half-human cyborg and a giant iguana) and their virtual venues, and they demonstrated the music engine, creating new compositions on-the-fly while adjusting different parameters. As McGarry put it, &#8220;These are all original compositions, generated and produced as we sit here, with no manual intervention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Authentic Artists is backed by investors including OVO Fund, James Murdoch’s Lupa Systems, Mixi Group and Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park. McGarry said he&#8217;s currently more focused on finding product-market fit than on the business model, but he sees opportunities to make money through avenues such as branded music and decentralized finance/NFTs in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thanks to major players like Amazon and Walmart, we&#8217;ve become accustomed to next- or same-day delivery. But the pandemic has also renewed our interest in buying from smaller businesses and retailers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.useswyft.com/">Swyft</a>, a company that has just raised $17.5 million in Series A, helps retailers of any size provide affordable same-day delivery. The round was co-led by Inovia Capital and Forerunner Ventures, with participation from Shopify and existing investors Golden Ventures and Trucks VC.</p>
<p>Swyft is a marketplace, connecting a network of shipping carriers with vendors. But the company also provides software to those carriers to make them more efficient, and turns them into a vast network that allows them to pick up more inventory without adding to their infrastructure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other words, several regional carriers may play a part in delivering a parcel shipped via Swyft without making any big changes to their original routes or adding new drivers, trucks, etc.</p>
<p>To date, major players in both shipping and retail have dominated this space, thanks in large part to their ability to deliver quickly. Swyft is looking to amass an army, for lack of a better term, comprised of all of the smaller players, including mom and pop retailers and vendors as well as smaller, regional carriers. Banded together through software, these carriers and retailers can match the scale and influence of the behemoths without spending a fortune.</p>
<p>Swyft was cofounded by Aadil Kazmi (CEO), Zeeshan Hamid (Head of Engineering), and Maraz Rahman (Head of Sales). Kazmi and Hamid both spent their careers at Amazon, working on data and last-mile operations for the behemoth. Rahman was an early employee at a YC-backed proptech startup.</p>
<p>The trio started asking themselves early last year why retailers weren&#8217;t able to offer same-day delivery and chose to tackle the gap they discovered.</p>
<p>The key ingredient to Swyft is not its aggregation of couriers, but the software it provides to them. Because Swyft is increasing demand for these carriers, it also needs to make them more efficient. The back-end software allows carriers to digitize or automate a good deal of what they&#8217;re traditionally doing by hand.</p>
<p>CEO Aadil Kazmi says that Swyft is able to come in anywhere between 25 and 30 percent cheaper than the incumbent option.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what percent of your purchases are from Amazon, but for me it&#8217;s like 150 percent,&#8221; said Eurie Kim. &#8220;I&#8217;d prefer to buy elsewhere with the pandemic, and support local and independent brands, but Amazon&#8217;s trained us all to have fast and free shipping. It feels like an opportunity where the consumer experience is really lacking and the burden on merchants and retailers is extremely heavy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swyft currently has 16 full-time employees. Twelve percent are female and 75 percent are people of color, according to the company.</p>
<p>Since April 2020, Swyft has facilitated the delivery of more than 180,000 packages, and expanded gross margin from 78 percent to 82 percent, thanks in large part to revenue from the software side of the business and a zero-asset model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The longer we continue to work with either all or part of our teams in remote, out-of-physical-office environments, the more imperative it becomes for those teams to have some tools in place to keep the channels of communication and management open, and for the individuals in those teams to have a sense of how well they are performing. Today, one of the startups that provides a team productivity app with that in mind is announcing a round of funding to fuel its growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pathlight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathlight</a>, which has built a performance management platform for customer-facing teams &#8212; sales, field service and support &#8212; to help managers and employees themselves to track and analyze how they are doing, to coach them when and where it&#8217;s needed, and to communicate updates and more, has picked up $25 million &#8212; money that it will be using to continue growing its customer base and the functionality across its app.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Insight Partners, with previous backers Kleiner Perkins and Quiet Capital also participating, alongside Uncorrelated Ventures; Jeremy Stoppelman, CEO of Yelp; David Glazer, CFO of Palantir; and Michael Ovitz, co-founder of CAA and Owner of Broad Beach Ventures. Pathlight has now raised $35 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pathlight today provides users with a range of tools to visualize team and individual performance across various parameters set by managers, using data that teams integrate from other platforms like Salesforce, Zendesk and Outreach, among others.</p>
<p>Using that data and specific metrics for the job in question, managers can then initiate conversations with individuals to focus in on specific areas where things need attention, and provide some coaching to help fix it. It can also be used to provide team-wide updates and encouragement, which sits alongside whatever other tools a person might use in their daily customer-facing work.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2135006,2135007,2135008,2135009,2135010"]</p>
<p>Since launching in March 2020, the startup has picked up good traction, with customers including Twilio, Earnin, Greenhouse, and CLEAR. But perhaps even more importantly, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the pandemic and resulting switch to remote work has underscored how necessary tools like Pathlight&#8217;s have become: the startup says that engagement on its platform has shot up 300% in the last 12 months.</span></p>
<p>Alexander Kvamme, the CEO of Pathlight, said that he first became aware of the challenges of communicating across customer-facing teams, and having transparency on how they are doing as individuals and as a group, when he was at Yelp. Yelp had acquired his startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/18/yelp-acquires-online-reservation-service-seatme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reservations service SeatMe</a>, and used the acquisition to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/13/yelp-bites-back-at-opentable-tripadvisor-and-google-with-free-yelp-reservations-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build and run Yelp Reservations</a>.</p>
<p>He was quick to realize that there weren&#8217;t really effective tools for him to see how individuals in the sales team were doing, how they were doing compared to goals the company wanted to achieve and based on the sales data they already had in other systems, how to work more effectively with people to communicate when something needed changing, and how to tailor all that in line with new variations in the formula &#8212; in their case, how to sell new products like a reservations service alongside advertising and other Yelp services for businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s five or 3,000 people, the problem doesn&#8217;t go away,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everyone uses their own systems, and it hurts front line employees when they don&#8217;t know how they are doing, or don&#8217;t get recognition when they are doing well, or don&#8217;t get coaching when they are not. Our thesis was that if software is eating the world, and you as a company are buying more software and analytics, over time managers will be more like data analysts. So we are providing a way for managers to be more data-driven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Five years down the line, Kvamme got the bug again to start a company and decided to return to that problem, teaming up with co-founder Trey Doig, the engineer who designed SeatMe and then turned it into Yelp Reservations and is now Pathlight&#8217;s CTO.</p>
<p>As they see it, the challenge has still not really been addressed. That&#8217;s not to say that there are not a number of companies &#8212; competitors to Pathlight &#8212; looking to fill that gap as well. Another people management platform called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/lattice-a-people-management-platform-picks-up-45m-at-a-400m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lattice last year picked up $45 million</a>  (I&#8217;m guessing it will be raising money again around about now); HubSpot, Zoho, SalesLoft and a number of others also are taking different approaches to the same challenge: front-line customer-facing people spend the majority of their time and attention on interacting with people, and so there need to be better tools in place to help them figure out how to make that communication more effective, figure out what is working and what is not.</p>
<p>And all of this, of course, is not at all new: it&#8217;s not like we all woke up one day and suddenly wanted to know how we are doing at work, or managers suddenly felt they needed to communicate with staff.</p>
<p>What has changed, however, is <em>how</em> we work: many of us have not seen the inside of our offices for more than a year at this point, and for a large proportion of us, we may never return again, or if we do it will be under different circumstances.</p>
<p>All of this means that some of the more traditional metrics and indicators of our performance, praising, management relationships, and learning from team mates simply is not there anymore.</p>
<p>In customer-facing areas like sales, support and field service, that lack of contact may be even more acute, since many of the teams working in these environments have long relied on huddles and communication throughout the day, week and month to continuously tweak work and improve it. So while tools like Pathlight&#8217;s will be useful as data analytics provision for teams regardless of how we work, it can be argued that they are even more important right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think people have started to realize that if you can empower front line to be more independent, your numbers will go up and do better,&#8221; Kvamme said.</p>
<p>This is part of what went into the investment decision made here.</p>
<p>“With the acceleration of digital transformation across the enterprise, it’s not enough to rethink the way we work—we must also rethink the way we manage,” said Jeff Lieberman, MD at Insight Partners. “Pathlight is ushering in a new age of data-driven management, an ethos that we believe every enterprise will need to embrace—quickly. We are excited to partner with the Pathlight team as they bring their powerful platform to companies across the world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Polestar, the Swedish electric vehicle brand spun out of Volvo Car Group, set on Wednesday a “moonshot goal” of creating the first climate neutral car by 2030. But instead of getting there through more widely-practiced offsetting measures, such as planting trees, the company said it’s going to fundamentally change the way the new EV is made.</p>
<p>That means rethinking every piece of the supply chain, from materials sourcing through to manufacturing, and even by making the vehicle more energy efficient.</p>
<p>“We’re going to do it by reducing emissions, eliminating emissions, rather than offsetting, like many are relying on today, because we see that offsetting is a worrying strategy,” Fredrika Klarén, Polestar’s Head of Sustainability, said in an interview with TechCrunch. “The science is not actually backing it up in terms of its capability of offsetting emissions from producing products.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the direct outcome will be a new car – what the company is calling Polestar 0 – it will require a total overhaul of the manufacturing process that could eventually extend to Polestar’s other models. Klarén said that although Polestar’s entire fleet will not be climate neutral by 2030, the company and its parent Volvo have already set targets of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/volvo-to-roll-out-a-new-electric-vehicle-every-year-through-2025/">being climate neutral across their operations, including Polestar, by 2040</a>.</p>
<p>Both of Polestar’s current models, Polestar 1 and 2, are manufactured in China. Klarén said while much about the Polestar 0 has yet to be determined, the company hopes that it, too will be Chinese-made. Although the country still has a strong reliance on coal, there’s massive development in sustainable technology and manufacturing, she pointed out.</p>
<p>“If I get to vote, we will continue producing in China, but that being said, the Polestar 0, the solutions we will use are not identified yet and we’re going to need to think in new ways we didn’t think was possible prior – where it will be produced, what materials will go in [it],” said Klarén.</p>
<p>Nor are any of the internal systems settled. Geely AG, the parent company of Volvo Cars and Polestar, has been developing its own internal computer-and-battery platform, but it hasn’t been decided whether the new Polestar model will use this system.</p>
<p>She said the most challenging parts of the EV manufacturing process to transition to climate neutral are the materials, specifically aluminum, steel, and battery components.</p>
<p>“We need to tackle the production-related emissions,” she explained. The environmental impact of producing steel, aluminum and the basic materials found in lithium-based batteries is still significant.</p>
<p>Along with the new vehicle, Polestar also launched a product sustainability declaration that clearly lists the carbon footprint of Polestar 2 and all coming models.</p>
<p>“Offsetting is a cop-out,” Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said in a statement. “By pushing ourselves to create a completely climate-neutral car, we are forced to reach beyond what is possible today.  We will have to question everything, innovate and look to exponential technologies as we design towards zero.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is sharing more details today about its upcoming App Tracking Transparency feature, which will allow users to control, on an app-by-app level, whether their data is shared for ad-targeting purposes.</p>
<p>In a sense, anyone using the current version of iOS can see App Tracking Transparency in action, since iOS already includes a Tracking menu in the Privacy settings, and some apps have already started asking users for permission to track them.</p>
<p>But when iOS 14.5 (currently in developer beta) is released to the general public sometime in early spring, Apple will actually start enforcing its new rules, meaning that iPhone users will probably start seeing a lot more requests. Those requests will appear at various points during the usage of an app, but they&#8217;ll all carry a standardized message asking whether the app can &#8220;track your activity across other companies&#8217; apps and websites,&#8221; followed by a customized explanation from the developer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once an app has asked for this permission, it will also show up in the Tracking menu, where users can toggle app tracking on and off at any time. They can also enable app tracking across all apps or opt out of these requests entirely with a single toggle.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency feature will be enabled by default and arrive in &#8216;early spring&#8217; on iOS&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/embed/#?secret=Zq8Hvb2VfA" data-secret="Zq8Hvb2VfA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One point worth emphasizing — something already stated <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">on Apple&#8217;s developer website</a> but not entirely clear in media reports (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">including our own</a>)— is that these rules aren&#8217;t limited to the IDFA identifier. Yes, IDFA is what Apple controls directly, but a company spokesperson said that when a user opts out of tracking, Apple will also expect developers to stop using any other identifiers (such as hashed email addresses) to track users for ad targeting purposes, and not to share that information with data brokers.</p>
<p>This does not, however, stop developers from tracking users across multiple apps if all those apps are operated by a single company.</p>
<p>The Apple spokesperson also said that Apple&#8217;s own apps will abide by these rules — you won&#8217;t see any requests from Apple, however, since it doesn&#8217;t track users across third-party apps for ad targeting purposes. (As previously noted, there&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">a separate Personalized Ads option </a>that determines whether Apple can use its own first-party data to target ads.)</p>
<p>Facebook has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">particularly vocal in criticizing the change</a>, arguing that this will hurt small businesses who use targeting to run effective ad campaigns, and that the change benefits Apple&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>Apple has pushed back against criticism in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in/">privacy-focused speeches</a>, as well as in a report called <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf">A Day in the Life of Your Data</a>, which lays out how users are actually tracked and targeted. In fact, the report has just been updated with more information about ad auctions, ad attribution and Apple&#8217;s own advertising products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular saving and investing app </span><a href="https://www.acorns.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acorns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has acquired Pillar, an AI-powered startup built to help manage student loan debt, in its second acquisition of 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based Pillar helps consumers optimize their debt payments by focusing first on student loans. It launched in May 2019 with </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/pillar-launches-with-5-5m-from-kleiner-perkins-and-others-to-tackle-your-student-loan-debt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$5.5 million in seed funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Kleiner Perkins. The companies declined to reveal the financial terms of the deal, only noting that within six months of launching, Pillar managed over $500 million worth of student loan debt of more than 15,000 borrowers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Bloch dropped out of Stanford Business School and co-founded Pillar after he and his wife had amassed more than $500,000 of student loan debt after she graduated from law school. Prior to that, he had led the New York and California regions for DoorDash, growing them to $100 million in revenue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem Pillar has aimed to tackle is massive. Student loan debt is the </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2021/02/20/student-loan-debt-statistics-in-2021-a-record-17-trillion/?sh=dffd94714310"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second-largest type of consumer debt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S., with 45 million borrowers collectively owing nearly $1.7 trillion in student loans.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Acorns was apparently one of several companies that had courted Pillar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were in a pretty lucky position to have a lot of interest from many of the top fintech companies that are out there,” Bloch told TechCrunch. “We had multiple offers on the table and Acorns was really our top choice just given how the business has been doing and the team, the culture and the mission.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal marks the second acquisition this year and third overall for Acorns, which says it notched its strongest quarter in its history the first three months of this year. In March, Acorns also acquired Harvest, a fintech that helped customers reduce more than $4 million in debt in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pillar and Harvest teams will help Acorns accelerate its product roadmap by helping customers pay down debt, “an essential part of the financial wellness system,” said CEO and founder Noah Kerner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, Pillar will become part of one of Acorns’ monthly subscription tiers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The IP and technology that the Pillar team created in debt management is really interesting to us when we think about how we scale our Smart Deposit feature,” Kerner said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Smart Deposit, when a customer’s paycheck hits the Acorns bank account, the app automatically allocates a percentage of that paycheck into an individual’s different investment accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From a behavioral perspective, the best way to get somebody to save and invest is to enable them to set aside a piece of their paycheck as soon as it hits the account so that they don&#8217;t spend it. That feature has been really well adopted by our direct deposit customers,” Kerner said. “And so Michael and his team are coming in to help manage that feature, and also our bank accounts product. I think their past experience is going to be really useful for us to take what we have and help the team catalyze it further.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its latest acquisition, Irvine, California-based Acorns now has more than 350 employees. In 2017, the company acquired Vault, now called “Acorns Later.” As a result of that acquisition, the company has seen its number of retirement accounts grow to 1.2 million from 500.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, Acorns has had a good year so far. In the first six weeks of 2021, the company added nearly 600,000 new accounts, reaching a total of more than 9 million users having saved and invested a total of $7.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first quarter was our biggest growth quarter on record,” Kerner told TechCrunch. “In particular we crossed the $4.3 billion in dollars in assets under management, which is a really exciting milestone when you think about the fact that these are customers that are saving small amounts of money in the relative scheme of money invested typically.”</span></p>

<p>COVID-19 forced many retailers and brands to adopt new technologies. Retail analytics unicorn <a href="https://traxretail.com/">Trax</a> expects that this openness to tech innovation will continue even after the pandemic. The Singapore-based company announced today that it has raised $640 million in Series E funding to expand its products, which combine computer vision and cloud-based software to help brick-and-mortar stores manage their inventory, merchandising and operations. The round included primary and secondary capital, and was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and returning investor BlackRock. Other participants included new investors OMERS and Sony Innovation Fund by IGV.</p>
<p>Before this round, Trax had raised $360 million in primary funds. J.P. Morgan acted as a placement agent to Trax on its Series E, which brings its total funding so far to $1.02 billion. Trax did not disclose a new valuation, but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trax-funding-idUSKCN1UH1W3">reportedly hit unicorn status in 2019</a>. Reports emerged last year that it is <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/DealStreetAsia/Singapore-startup-Trax-said-to-be-in-early-talks-for-US-listing">considering a public offering</a>, but chief executive officer Justin Behar had no comment when asked by TechCrunch if Trax is planning for an IPO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2010 and headquartered in Singapore, Trax <a href="https://traxretail.com/company/about-us/">also has offices</a> in Brazil, the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Israel, Mexico, Japan, Hungary, France, Russia and Australia. The company says it serves customers in more than 90 countries.</p>
<p>Behar told TechCrunch that the new funding will be used to “invest heavily in global [go-to-market] strategies and technology for our flagship Retail Watch solution, as we look for ways to make it easier for retailers and brands to continue their digitization journey. More specifically, we will use the capital to accelerate growth and triple-down on continued innovation across our core vision, machine learning, IoT and marketplace technologies.”</p>

<p>Launched last year, Retail Watch uses a combination of computer vision, machine learning and hardware like cameras and autonomous robots, to gather real-time data about the shelf availability of products. It sends alerts if stock is running low, corrects pricing errors and checks if planograms, or product display plans for visual merchandising, are being followed. Retail Watch currently focuses on center shelves, where packaged goods are usually stocked, but will expand into categories like fresh food and produce.</p>
<p>The funding will also be used to expand Trax’s Dynamic Merchandising, a partnership with on-demand work platform Flexforce, and Shopkick, the shopping rewards app <a href="https://traxretail.com/news/trax-acquires-shopkick-bridge-gap-mobile-physical-worlds-retail/">Trax acquired in 2019</a>, into new markets over the next one to two years.</p>
<p>“Finally, we see many opportunities to help retailers along their digitization journey and will be expanding into new use cases with products we develop internally and via potential acquisitions,” Behar said.</p>
<p>Early in the pandemic, retailers had to cope with surge buying, as customers emptied shelves of stock while preparing to stay at home. As the pandemic continued, buying patterns shifted dramatically and in April 2020,<a href="https://go.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-retail-will-see-a-2-1-trillion-loss-globally-in-2020-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic/"> Forrester forecast COVID-19</a> would cause global retail sales to decline by an average of 9.6% globally, resulting in a loss of $2.1 trillion, and that it would take about four years for retailers to overtake pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://go.forrester.com/press-newsroom/the-covid-19-pandemic-where-are-we-one-year-later-retail-and-ecommerce/">more recent report</a>, Forrester found despite spending cuts, nearly 40% of retailers and wholesalers immediately increased their tech investment, in some cases implementing projects in weeks that would have otherwise taken years.</p>
<p>Behar said “the pandemic made it clear the retail industry was not prepared for a sudden change in demand, as consumers faced empty shelves and out-of-stocks for extended periods in key categories. These extreme shifts in consumer behavior, coupled with global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, changing channel dynamics (such as e-commerce) and decrease in brand loyalty forced brands and retailers to develop new strategies to meet the evolving needs of their customers.”</p>
<p>He expects that willingness to adopt new technologies will continue after the pandemic. For example, to get shoppers back into brick-and-mortar stores, retailers might try things like in-store navigation, improved browsing, loyalty programs and new check out and payment systems.</p>
<p>Trax&#8217;s Retail Watch, Dynamic Merchandising and Dynamic Workforce Management solutions were in development before the pandemic, though “it has certainly expedited the need for innovative digital solutions to longstanding retail pain points,” Behar added.</p>
<p>For example, Retail Watch supports online ordering features, like showing what products are available to online shoppers and helping store associates fulfill orders, while Dynamic Merchandising lets brands find on-demand workers for in-store execution issues—for example, if new stock needs to be delivered to a location immediately.</p>

<p>Other tech companies focused on retail analytics include Quant Retail, Pensa Systems and Bossa Nova Robotics. Behar said Trax differentiates with a cloud-based platform that is “extensible, flexible and scalable and combines multiple integrated technologies and data-collection methods, optimized to fit each store, such as IoT-enabled shelf-edge cameras, dome cameras, autonomous robots and images taken from smartphones, to enable complete and accurate store coverage.”</p>
<p>Its proprietary computer vision technology was also designed specifically for use in retail stores, and identifies individual SKUs on shelves, regardless of category. For example, Behar said it can distinguish between near identical or multiple products, deal with visual obstructions like odd angles or products that are obscured by another item and recognize issues with price tags.</p>
<p>“Like many innovative solutions, our most meaningful competition comes from the legacy systems deeply entrenched in the world of retail and the fear of change,” he added. “While we do see an acceleration of interest and adoption of digital innovation as a result of the ‘COVID effect,’ this is by far our biggest challenge.”</p>
<p>In a press statement, SoftBank Investment Advisers director Chris Lee said, “Through its innovative AI platform and image recognition technologies, we believe Trax is optimizing retail stores by enabling [consumer packaged goods] brands and retailers to execute better inventory strategies using data and analytics. We are excited to partner with the Trax team to help expand their product offerings and enter new markets.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new UK public body that will be tasked with helping regulate the most powerful companies in the digital sector to ensure competition thrives online and consumers of digital services have more choice and control over their data has launched today.</p>
<p>The Digital Markets Unit (DMU), which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">announced in November last year</a> &#8212; following a number of market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/competition-policy-must-change-to-help-startups-fight-winner-takes-all-platforms-says-uk-report/">reviews</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/competition-policy-must-change-to-help-startups-fight-winner-takes-all-platforms-says-uk-report/">studies</a> examining concerns about the concentration of digital market power &#8212; does not yet have statutory powers itself but the government has said it will consult on the design of the new &#8220;pro-competition regime&#8221; this year and legislate to put the <span class="il">DMU</span> on a statutory footing as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>
<p>Concerns about the market power of adtech giants Facebook and Google are key drivers for the regulatory development.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4bb.png" alt="💻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Our new Digital Markets Unit, launched today, will help make sure tech giants can’t exploit their market dominance to crowd out competition and stifle innovation online. </p>

<p>&mdash; Competition &amp; Markets Authority (@CMAgovUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/CMAgovUK/status/1379690636513792001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>As a first job, the unit will look at how codes of conduct could work to govern the relationship between digital platforms and third parties such as small businesses which rely on them to advertise or use their services to reach customers &#8212; to feed into future digital legislation.</p>
<p>The role of powerful intermediary online gatekeepers is also being targeted by lawmakers in the European Union who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">proposed legislation at the end of last year</a> which similarly aims to create a regulatory framework that can ensure fair dealing between platform giants and the smaller entities which do business under their terms.</p>
<p>The UK government said today that the DMU will take a sector neutral approach in examining the role of platforms across a range of digital markets, with a view to promoting competition.</p>
<p>The unit has been asked to work with the comms watchdog Ofcom, which the government named<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/uk-names-its-pick-for-social-media-harms-watchdog/"> last year</a> as its pick for regulating social media platforms under planned legislation due to be introduced this year (aka, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">Online Safety Bill</a> as it&#8217;s now called).</p>
<p>While that forthcoming legislation is intended to regulate a very wide range of online harms which may affect consumers &#8212; from bullying and hate speech to child sexual exploitation and other speech-related issues (raising plenty of controversy, and specific concerns about associated <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/endgame-for-end-to-end-encryption/">implications</a> for privacy and security) &#8212; the focus for the DMU is on business impacts and consumer controls which may also have implications for competition in digital markets.</p>
<p>As part of its first work program, the government said the secretary of state for digital has asked the DMU to work with Ofcom to look specifically at how a code would govern the relationships between platforms and content providers such as news publishers &#8212; &#8220;including to ensure they are as fair and reasonable as possible&#8221;, as its press release puts it.</p>
<p>This suggests the DMU will be taking a considered look at recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">legislation passed in Australia</a> &#8212; which makes it mandatory for platforms to negotiate with news publishers to pay for reuse of their content.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the head of the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which the DMU will sit within, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p097vbtc">told the BBC </a>that Australia’s approach of having a backstop of mandatory arbitration if commercial negotiations between tech giants and publishers fail is a &#8220;sensible&#8221; approach.</p>
<p>The DMU will also work closely with the CMA&#8217;s enforcement division &#8212; which currently has a number of open investigations into tech giants, including considering complaints against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">Apple</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">Google</a>; and an in-depth probe of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/">Facebook&#8217;s Giphy acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>Other UK regulators the government says the DMU will work closely with include the data protection watchdog (the ICO) and the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>
<p>It also said the unit will also coordinate with international partners, given digital competition is an issue that&#8217;s naturally globally in nature &#8212; adding that it&#8217;s already discussing its approach through bilateral engagement and as part of its G7 presidency.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Digital Secretary will host a meeting of digital and tech ministers in April as he seeks to build consensus for coordination on better information sharing and joining up regulatory and policy approaches,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>The DMU will be led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-hayter-649576/?originalSubdomain=uk">Will Hayter</a>, who takes up an interim head post in early May following a stint at the Cabinet Office working on Brexit transition policy. Prior to that he worked for several years at the CMU and also Ofcom, among other roles in regulatory policy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.avant.com/">Avant</a>, an online lender that has raised over $600 million in equity, announced today that it has acquired Zero Financial and its neobank brand, Level, to further its mission of becoming a digital bank for the masses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2012, Chicago-based Avant started out primarily as an online lender targeting “underserved consumers,” but is evolving into digital banking with this acquisition. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company notched gross revenue of $265 million in 2020 and has raised capital over the years from backers such as General Atlantic and Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our path has always been to become the premier digital bank for the everyday American,” Avant CEO James Paris told TechCrunch. “The massive transition to digital over the last 12 months made the timing right to expand our offerings.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acquisition of Zero Financial and its neobank, Level (plus its banking app assets), will give Avant the ability to offer “a full ecosystem of banking and credit product offerings&#8221; through one fully digital platform, according to Paris. Those offerings include deposits, personal loans, credit cards and auto loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed other than the fact that the acquisition was completed with a combination of cash and stock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2016, San Francisco-based Zero Financial has raised $147 million in </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zero-financial/company_financials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debt and equity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to Crunchbase. New Enterprise Associates (NEA) led its $20 million Series A in May of 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level was unveiled to the public in February of 2020, c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reated by the same California-based team that founded the “debit-style” credit card offering Zero, according to this FintechFutures </span><a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/02/us-gets-new-challenger-level-bank-by-zero-creators/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The challenger bank was created to target millennials dissatisfied with the incumbent banking options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero Financial co-founder and CEO Bryce Galen said that Avant shared his company&#8217;s mission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenge the status quo by bringing innovative financial services products to consumers who might otherwise be unable to access them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avant, notes Paris, uses thousands of AI-driven data points to determine credit risk. With this acquisition, that lens will be expanded with data, such as a deposit customer’s cash flow, how they manage their finances and whether they pay their bills on time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will allow us to make credit decisions faster and deliver personalized options to help underbanked consumers gain financial freedom, at any and every stage of their financial journey,” Paris told TechCrunch. “It will also build long-term engagement and loyalty and help grow our reach beyond the 1.5 million customers we’ve served to date.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a growing number of fintechs, Avant operates under the premise that a person’s ability to get credit shouldn’t be dictated by a credit score alone.</span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pramyEMoON"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/">Which neobanks will rise or fall?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Which neobanks will rise or fall?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/embed/#?secret=pramyEMoON" data-secret="pramyEMoON" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A significant amount of Americans have poor, bad or no credit at all. For these people, accessing credit isn’t exactly easy and often comes with extra fees,” Paris said. That’s why, he added, Avant has focused on providing options for such consumers with “transparent, rewards-driven products.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level’s branchless, all-digital platform offers things such as cashback rewards on debit card purchases, a “competitive APY” on deposits, early access to paychecks and no hidden fees, all of which are especially beneficial for consumers on the path to financial freedom, according to Paris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception in 2012, Avant has connected more than 1.5 million consumers to $7.5 billion in loans and 400,000 credit cards. The company launched its credit card in 2017 and over the past two years alone, it has grown its number of credit card users by 170%.</span></p>
