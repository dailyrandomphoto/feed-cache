										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">RedHat today announced that it&#8217;s acquiring container security startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stackrox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stackrox">StackRox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. The companies did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>RedHat, which is perhaps best known for its enterprise Linux products has been making the shift to the cloud in recent years. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/with-the-acquisition-closed-ibm-goes-all-in-on-red-hat/">IBM purchased the company in 2018</a> for a hefty $34 billion and has been leveraging that acquisition as part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">a shift to a hybrid cloud strategy</a> under CEO Arvind Krishna.</p>
<p>The acquisition fits nicely with RedHat OpenShift, its container platform, but the company says it will continue to support StackRox usage on other platforms including AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform. This approach is consistent with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ibm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ibm">IBM&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> strategy of supporting multi-cloud, hybrid environments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/red-hat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="red-hat">Red Hat <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> president and CEO Paul Cormier sees the two companies working together well. &#8220;Red Hat adds StackRox&#8217;s Kubernetes-native capabilities to OpenShift&#8217;s layered security approach, furthering our mission to bring product-ready open innovation to every organization across the open hybrid cloud across IT footprints,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>

<p>CEO Kamal Shah, <a href="https://www.stackrox.com/post/2021/01/red-hat-to-acquire-stackrox/">writing in a company blog post</a> announcing the acquisition, explained that the company made a bet a couple of years ago on Kubernetes and it has paid off. &#8220;Over two and half years ago, we made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kubernetes" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kubernetes">Kubernetes <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and pivoted our entire product to be Kubernetes-native. While this seems obvious today; it wasn’t so then. Fast forward to 2020 and Kubernetes has emerged as the de facto operating system for cloud-native applications and hybrid cloud environments,&#8221; Shah wrote.</p>
<p>Shah sees the purchase as a way to expand the company and the road map more quickly using the resources of Red Hat (and IBM), a typical argument from CEOs of smaller acquired companies. But the trick is always finding a way to stay relevant inside such a large organization.</p>
<p>StackRox&#8217;s acquisition is part of some consolidation we have been seeing in the Kubernetes space in general and the security space more specifically. That includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/palo-alto-networks-to-acquire-container-security-startup-twistlock-for-410m/">Palo Alto Networks acquiring competitor TwistLock</a> for $410 million in 2019. Another competitor, Aqua Security, which has raised $130 million, remains independent.</p>
<p>StackRox was founded in 2014 and raised over $65 million, according to Crunchbase data. Investors included Menlo Ventures, Redpoint and Sequoia Capital. The deal is expected to close this quarter subject to normal regulatory scrutiny.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a new statement issued by former First Lady <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/michelle-obama" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="michelle-obama">Michelle Obama, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> she calls on Silicon Valley specifically to address its role in the violent insurrection attempt by pro-Trump rioters at the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday. Obama&#8217;s statement also calls out the obviously biased treatment that the primarily white pro-Trump fanatics faced by law enforcement relative to that received by mostly peaceful BLM supporters during their lawful demonstrations (as opposed to Wednesday&#8217;s criminal activity), but it includes a specific redress for the tech industry&#8217;s leaders and platform operators.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now is the time for companies to stop enabling this monstrous behavior — and go even further than they have already by permanently banning this man from their platforms and putting in place policies to prevent their technology from being used by the nation&#8217;s leaders to fuel insurrection,&#8221; Obama wrote in her statement, which she shared on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and on<a href="https://www.facebook.com/michelleobama/"> Facebook</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Like all of you, I’ve been feeling so many emotions since yesterday. I tried to put my thoughts down here: <a href="https://t.co/9xzRvrpk7y">pic.twitter.com/9xzRvrpk7y</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Michelle Obama (@MichelleObama) <a href="https://twitter.com/MichelleObama/status/1347284244763127810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The call for action goes beyond what most social platforms have done already. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">Facebook has banned Trump</a>, though it describes the term of the suspension as &#8220;indefinite&#8221; and left open the possibility for a restoration of his accounts in as little as two weeks&#8217; time once Joe Biden has officially assumed the presidency. Twitter, meanwhile, initially removed three tweets it found offended its rules by inciting violence and then locked Trump&#8217;s account pending his deletion of the same. Earlier on Thursday, Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitter-will-reinstate-trumps-account-following-his-deletion-of-tweets/">confirmed that Trump had removed these and that his account would subsequently be restored</a> 12 hours after their deletion.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric/"> Twitch has also disabled Trump&#8217;s channel</a> at least until the end of his term, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/shopify-pulls-donald-trump-stores-off-its-website/">Shopify has removed Trump&#8217;s official merchandise stores</a> from its platform.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitch disables Trump&#8217;s channel until the end of his term to &#8216;minimize harm&#8217; during transition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric/embed/#?secret=ELI2FJCaDs" data-secret="ELI2FJCaDs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>No social platform thus far has permanently banned Trump, so far as TechCrunch is aware, which is what Obama is calling for in her statement. While both Twitter and Facebook have discussed how Trump&#8217;s recent behavior has violated their policies regarding use of their platform, neither have yet provided any detailed information regarding how they&#8217;ll address any potential similar behavior from other world leaders going forward. In other words, we don&#8217;t yet know what would be different (if anything) should another Trump-styled megalomaniac take office and use available social channels in a similar manner.</p>
<p>Obama is hardly the only political figure to call for action from social media platforms around &#8220;sustained misuse of their platforms to sow discord and violence,&#8221; as Senator <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/mark-warner-3" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="mark-warner-3">Mark Warner <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> put it in a <a href="https://twitter.com/tayhatmaker/status/1347227697903140870">statement on Wednesday</a>. Likely once the dust clears from this week&#8217;s events, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, et al. will face renewed scrutiny from lawmakers and public interest groups around any corrective action they&#8217;re taking.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six years after launching its service linking employer-sponsored insurance plans with surgical centers of excellence, the </span><a href="https://www.carrumhealth.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrum Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised $40 million in a new round of financing to capitalize on tailwinds propelling its business forward. </span></p>
<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic exposes cracks in the U.S. healthcare system, one of the ways that employers have tried to manage the significant costs of insuring employees is by taking on the management of care themselves.</p>
<p>As they shoulder more of the burden, companies like Carrum, which offer servies that manage some of the necessary points of care for businesses, at lower costs, are becoming increasingly attractive targets for investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s why Carrum was able to attract investors led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiger-global" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tiger-global">Tiger Global Management, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/greatpoint-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="greatpoint-ventures">GreatPoint Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Cross Creek, all firms that joined returning investors Wildcat Venture Partners and SpringRock Ventures in backing the company&#8217;s Series A round.</p>
<p>Carrum said the money will go towards sales and marketing to more customers, adding more services and improving its existing technology stack.</p>
<p>Carrum uses machine learning to collect and analyze data on surgical outcomes and care to identify what it considers to be surgical centers of excellence across the U.S.</p>
<p>The company offers self-insured employers the opportunity to buy services directly from surgical centers for a bundled price. That can mean savings of up to 50% on surgical expenses.</p>
<p>Using Carrum, there are no co-pays, deductibles, and co-insurance. Instead, Carrum Health&#8217;s customers pay a fee and in return receive a 30-day warranty on procedures, meaning that the healthcare provider will cover any costs associated with care from botched operations or complications.</p>
<p>Employees have access to a mobile applications that gives them access to virtual care before, during, and after surgeries.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For years, the industry has talked about redesigning healthcare to benefit patients, but the only way to really do that is to tackle the underlying economics of care, a truly difficult task,&#8221; said Sach Jain, CEO and founder of Carrum Health, in a statement. &#8220;Employers now have a modern, technology-driven solution to help patients get better care without financial headache and we’re not stopping at surgery. In 2021 we’ll be expanding our reach and impact with additional services. It’s such an honor to pave the way for a better healthcare future and we’re so excited for what’s to come.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Carrum Health&#8217;s customers include Quest Diagnostics, US Foods, and other, undisclosed organizations in retail, manufacturing, communications and insurance, the company said.</p>
<p>Centers of excellence on the platform include Johns Hopkins HealthCare, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mayoclinic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mayoclinic">Mayo Clinic, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Tenet <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/healthcare-1c4f" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="healthcare-1c4f">Healthcare <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. Happy 2021, or as our own Danny Crichton aptly names it, December 38, 2020.</p>
<p>Equity crew is back to start the new year in full force, with<a href="https://twitter.com/alex"> Alex</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_"> Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> on the mics and<a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123"> Chris</a> behind the scenes. The reunion led to extreme Dad joke energy from all of us, which helped get through the mountain of tech news that we had in front of us.</p>
<p>In fact, there was so much to talk about that we have a <em>bonus</em> episode coming out Saturday dealing with Roblox and the gaming environment. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>For now, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s in today&#8217;s episode:</p>
<ul>
<li>The remote work space is rushing to cure your Zoom fatigue, or at least give you new ways to handle it. This week, we saw GitHub alumni raise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/rewatch-seed/">millions for a video repository tool</a>, and Teamflow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/teamflow-lands-3-9-million-for-a-productive-virtual-hq-platform/">raise more for a virtual platform</a> meant to mimic the serendipity (and productivity) of your currently shuttered office.</li>
<li>WeLink raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/welink-raises-185m-to-deliver-high-bandwidth-wireless-internet-to-the-home-using-5g/">a $185 million Series A round</a> and, while we could have made financial nomenclature jokes, there was much to unpack on the opportunity of 5G and wireless.</li>
<li>Divvy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/divvy-raises-165m-as-the-spend-management-space-stays-red-hot/">locked down $165 million</a>, making itself a unicorn in the process. Consider this one another win for Utah, and a big moment for the company itself, which is working in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">very competitive space</a>.</li>
<li>We also noted a series of new VC funds that closed in the final days of 2020, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/one-way-ventures-a-firm-focused-on-immigrant-founders-closes-second-fund/">One Way</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/union-square-ventures-and-learn-capital-file-paperwork-indicating-new-funds/">USV</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/union-square-ventures-and-learn-capital-file-paperwork-indicating-new-funds/">Learn Capital</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/seattle-based-madrona-raises-320m-for-its-eighth-fund/">Madrona</a>.</li>

Please forgive our attempt at poetry. Regardless, Hopin spent $250 million for StreamYard, a livestreaming technology platform that it intends to operate independently. The combined company has around $65 million in annual recurring revenue, with the purchased entity bringing $30 million of that on its own. A big deal.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following a slate of temporary and permanent bans from a number of the top online platforms, popular video streaming service <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitch" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitch">Twitch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today confirmed that it has disabled the President of the United States&#8217; account. A spokesperson for the site told TechCrunch,</p>
<blockquote><p>In light of yesterday’s shocking attack on the Capitol, we have disabled President Trump’s Twitch channel. Given the current extraordinary circumstances and the President&#8217;s incendiary rhetoric, we believe this is a necessary step to protect our community and prevent Twitch from being used to incite further violence.</p></blockquote>

<div class="p-rich_text_section">Twitch also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/trump-suspended-from-twitch-as-reddit-bans-the-the_donald-and-additional-subreddits/">temporarily suspended</a> the President’s channel in June. At the time, it told TechCrunch, “Hateful conduct is not allowed on Twitch. In line with our policies, President Trump’s channel has been issued a temporary suspension from Twitch for comments made on stream, and the offending content has been removed.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>On Wednesday, the company removed <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/6/22218059/pogchamp-twitch-removed-emote-ryan-gootecks-gutierrez-trump-capitol-hill">the “PogChamp” emote</a> featuring the face of gaming figure Ryan Gutierrez after he expressed support for pro-Trump rioters.</div>
</div>
<p>Twitch’s actions follow similar measures taken by Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, which over the course of the last day all placed new restrictions on the president’s account. Facebook also took the unprecedented step of suspending the president’s account for the remainder of his term, which ends on January 20.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The social platforms took action against the president&#8217;s accounts after he incited a group of his supporters in a riot at the Capitol. Trump encouraged a crowd to march toward Congress after a rally Wednesday in which the president again pushed false claims about a &#8220;stolen&#8221; election.</p>
<p>At the Capitol, the crowd swelled and easily overcame barriers in place by police, flooding into the building and looting lawmakers&#8217; offices, resulting in a number of injuries and four deaths. Lawmakers were inside the building at the time and were forced to evacuate, later reconvening to certify the election results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s the image that&#8217;s been seen around the world. One of hundreds of pro-Trump supporters in the private office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after storming the Capitol and breaching security in protest of the certification of the election results for President-elect Joe Biden. Police were overrun (when they <a href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/video/police-selfies-protesters-amid-break-220300321.html">weren&#8217;t posing for selfies</a>) and some lawmakers&#8217; offices <a href="https://twitter.com/TonyaJoRiley/status/1347162120203493376">were trashed and looted</a>.</p>
<p>As politicians and their staffs were told to evacuate or shelter in place, one photo of a congressional computer <a href="https://twitter.com/AriCohn/status/1346920070937776132">left unlocked</a> still with an evacuation notice on the screen spread quickly around the internet. At least one computer was stolen from Sen. Jeff Merkley&#8217;s office, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/07/cybersecurity-202-riot-capitol-is-nightmare-scenario-cybersecurity-professionals/">reports say</a>.</p>

<p>Most lawmakers don&#8217;t have ready access to classified materials, unless it&#8217;s for their work sitting on sensitive committees, such as Judiciary or Intelligence. The classified computers are separate from the rest of the unclassified congressional network and in a designated sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIFs, in locked-down areas of the Capitol building.</p>
<p>&#8220;No indication those [classified systems] were breached,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/MiekeEoyang/status/1347000537208803328">tweeted</a> Mieke Eoyang, a former House Intelligence Committee staffer.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>But the breach will likely present a major task for Congress&#8217; IT departments, which will have to figure out what&#8217;s been stolen and what security risks could still pose a threat to the Capitol&#8217;s network. Kimber Dowsett, a former government security architect, said there was no plan in place to respond to a storming of the building.</p>

<p>The threat to Congress&#8217; IT network is probably not as significant as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">the ongoing espionage campaign</a> against U.S. federal networks.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some consolidation is underway in the world of challenger banking apps. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bbva" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bbva">BBVA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today told users of Simple &#8212; the pioneering mobile and online banking app that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/20/simple-acquired-for-117m-will-continue-to-operate-separately-under-its-own-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired for $117 million in 2014</a> &#8212; that it is planning to shut down the service, moving accounts to BBVA&#8217;s USA business in the process.</p>
<p>The move is part of an ongoing effort at BBVA &#8212; which had been an active investor and acquirer of startups &#8212; to streamline its business as it works on closing a merger with PNC. The latter bank <a href="https://www.pnc.com/en/about-pnc/topics/acquisition-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> in November last year that it would acquire the U.S. business of BBVA for $11.6 billion.</p>
<p>In a note <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/banksimple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="banksimple">Simple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sent out earlier today to users &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=bbva%20simple&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being shared on Twitter by a number of them</a> &#8212; the bank said that it will be transitioning their accounts to be serviced by BBVA USA, which already housed the accounts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>BBVA USA has made the strategic decision to close Simple,&#8221; the note reads. &#8220;There is no immediate impact to your accounts at Simple and nothing you need to do at this time. Since your deposits are already housed at BBVA USA, they will remain in FDIC-insured accounts there, up to the applicable limits. In the future, your Simple account will become exclusively serviced by BBVA USA, but until then you can continue to access your account and your money through the Simple app or online at Simple.com.</p></blockquote>
<p>Users will receive more details in the future about the transition to BBVA, the note continued.</p>
<p>The response from Simple customers has been predictably downbeat. Users migrated to the service specifically to have a faster and more modern experience compared to what they were getting through previous, incumbent providers.</p>
<p>Even though Simple ultimately ended up getting acquired by one of those incumbents &#8212; BBVA, headquartered in Spain, is one of the largest banks in the world &#8212; it was run <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/20/simple-acquired-for-117m-will-continue-to-operate-separately-under-its-own-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely independently of its owner</a>, as part of BBVA&#8217;s attempt to bring on more modern services to attract a younger class of users.</p>
<p>We have contacted both BBVA and Simple for further comment, and BBVA&#8217;s statement confirming the shutdown is now at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>So far, it looks like the emailed notification is the only announcement of the changes for customers directly; there are no alerts within the bank&#8217;s mobile app, nor any announcements on the Simple website.</p>
<p>It is unclear how many users Simple has currently. It had around 100,000 users when it was acquired back in 2014, and some might say that the startup was ahead of its time.</p>
<p>In the years between it launching and now, we&#8217;ve seen an explosion in the number and popularity of so-called neobanks or challenger banks around the world, including Nubank, Chime, Current, N26, Revolut, Monzo and many more turning what seemed like a radical concept into one that is now fairly commonplace.</p>
<p>Tapping into using a set of APIs to bundle services, and sitting on top of other banks&#8217; infrastructure, these neobanks are more fleet of foot and provide more modern interfaces on more modern platforms (such as mobile apps), foregoing some of the traditional trappings of banking like visiting physical locations and transacting with tellers, and replacing them with algorithms that, for example, help people manage their finances through the month by analyzing their spend and suggesting ways to save money or organize their finances in a better way.</p>
<p>The turn in events for Simple plays into some of the precariousness of using newer &#8220;challenger&#8221; banking services: There is always a risk with smaller services that they might not stick around as solidly as their incumbent counterparts &#8212; although recent years and bigger banking crises have definitely overturned some of those concepts.</p>
<p>For its part, Simple has not always been perfect. The company has at times turned off certain features &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/online-bank-simple-makes-things-harder-by-removing-bill-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">such as Bill Pay</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/14/simple-account-closures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">types of customer accounts</a> &#8212; without warning, leaving users scrambling to replace them with alternatives.</p>
<p>The question will now be whether users decide to stick with BBVA or turn to exploring another challenger. There are, after all, many options to consider these days.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll update this post as we learn more.</p>
<p>Update: Here is BBVA&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p><em>BBVA USA continually evaluates strategic priorities and resources, including existing and potential partnerships with outside organizations. We have taken the opportunity of the pending merger with PNC to reassess our goals for BBVA USA, so that we’re focused on the things that make the most sense for the company’s future whether on a standalone basis or a potentially combined basis with PNC. As a result, today we’re accelerating some changes and stopping work on others, including the closing of Simple. These reviews are part of our normal processes, and have resulted in other ventures being closed in the past year or so based on performance and the economic environment, including Covault (2020) and Denizen (2019).</em></p>
<p><em>Simple customers already have a dual relationship with BBVA USA and Simple. We will be migrating these customers to the award-winning BBVA USA mobile app. Those same customers will become PNC customers upon the close of acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">This year, Americans grappled with fear of infection, incredible loss of loved ones, financial stress, isolation and fatigue from constant uncertainty to name a few. Even though we are getting closer to returning to normality as vaccines start to roll out, we can’t write COVID-19 off just yet. We are only now beginning to see the long-lasting effects of the pandemic, specifically its dramatic impact on the mental health crisis in the United States and unfortunately, mental illness has no vaccine.</p>
<p>Nearly <a href="https://www.mhanational.org/issues/mental-health-america-prevalence-data#:~:text=Adult%20Prevalence%20of%20Mental%20Illness,Any%20Mental%20Illness%20(AMI)%202020&amp;text=18.57%25%20of%20adults%20are%20experiencing,a%20severe%20mental%20health%20illness.">45 million</a> American adults live with mental illness, which has only been exacerbated this year as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm">more than two in five U.S. residents</a> reported struggling with mental health issues as a result of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Even more concerning, according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/05-10-2020-covid-19-disrupting-mental-health-services-in-most-countries-who-survey">World Health Organization</a>, prior to the pandemic, countries around the world were spending less than 2% of national health budgets on mental health, while struggling to meet their populations’ needs. It’s evident that there is not only a lack of focus on mental healthcare, but a lack of access as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We’ve seen a recent influx in telemedicine and telehealth services, and provided these solutions are evidence-based and effective, this is the only way for us to scale the widespread demand for support. Put simply, we don’t have enough clinical staff to go around.</p>
<p>When I practiced psychiatry in the U.K.’s National Health Services (NHS), I quickly realized that we were seeing patients too late, sometimes years too late, such that they had far more serious needs than if they had been able to access good quality care earlier. Back then it was clear to me this level of supply-demand gap could only be resolved by deploying technology at scale, and the events of the last year have only reinforced that.</p>
<p>Investors have taken note as well, with many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/mental-health-startups-are-raising-spirits-and-venture-capital/">mental health startups raising capital</a>. It’s clear that business leaders have begun to prioritize innovation as a way to pull ourselves out of crisis, with a renewed focus on products adapted to a changed world. We’ve already seen a massive uptick in digital mental health solutions with about <a href="https://www.apaservices.org/practice/legal/technology/psychologists-embrace-telehealth">76% of clinicians</a> solely treating patients via telemedicine. The clearest path for managing mental health at scale will be evidence-based, ethical and personalized digital solutions.</p>
<p>Not only will this influx help those who desire flexible care options, but telehealth has also increased the access to care for people who may have limited options in their local communities.</p>
<p>While increasing in popularity, digital mental health solutions have some important challenges to overcome. For one, they must win consumer trust and prove that they can handle personal data ethically and responsibly. With <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">81% of Americans</a> feeling that the risks of sharing personal data outweigh the benefits, providers must show that they can responsibly secure users’ personal health data due to the sensitive nature of the information and ultimately gain that trust.</p>
<p>This must go beyond compliance with HIPAA and, in Europe, GDPR, and require the development and implementation of an ethical framework to underpin a provider’s digital mental health solutions. However, such efforts must be genuine and avoid falling into the trap of &#8220;ethics washing,&#8221; so I encourage providers to have the ethics frameworks audited by external experts and to commit to publishing the results.</p>
<p>Digital solutions must also be able to meet the needs of users on an individualized and personalized basis. Many apps meant to help manage mental health take a one-size-fits-all approach and don’t take enough advantage of the technology’s ability to adapt to peoples’ unique symptoms and personal preferences. This is not simply about offering more than one type of intervention, although that is important, it’s the recognition that people engage in technology in different ways.</p>
<p>For instance, at Koa Health we know that some users love going through a program in a step-by-step fashion, whereas others prefer to dip into activities as they need them, and it’s important that we cater equally well for both of these preferences. Generic approaches simply won’t work well for everyone.</p>
<p>Not only do digital solutions need to be responsible with data and be tailored to users, they must work harder to prove their efficacy. <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/mental-health-apps-plentiful-few-provide-clinical-research">Recent research</a> has shown that 64% of mental health apps claimed efficacy yet only 14% included any evidence. The growth in the adoption of technology is encouraging, but positive impact will only result from products designed for efficacy — and able to demonstrate it in high-quality trials. The stronger the evidence base for effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, the more likely healthcare providers and insurers will be to distribute the solutions.</p>
<p>While vaccines are on their way, the mental health impacts of the pandemic may soon overshadow the direct impacts of the pandemic. While health tech has made promising progress, it’s imperative that digital mental healthcare places a stronger emphasis on effective, ethical and personalized care to avert an even larger mental health crisis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile advertising company Tapjoy has <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/ftc-requires-mobile-advertising-company-stop-misleading-users">settled with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over allegations</a> that it was misleading consumers about the in-app rewards they could earn in mobile games. According to the FTC, Tapjoy deceived consumers who participated in various activities &#8212; like purchasing a product, signing up for a free trial, providing their personal information like an email address or completing a survey &#8212; in exchange for in-game virtual currency. But when it was time to pay up, Tapjoy&#8217;s partners didn&#8217;t deliver.</p>
<p>As a result of the ruling, Tapjoy will have to clean up its business by monitoring the offers from advertisers presented to consumers and conspicuously display the terms that explain how rewards are earned. It will also be required to follow through to ensure the offers are delivered and investigate consumer complaints if they are not. Failure to follow the terms of the settlement will result in further fines of up to $43,280 per each violation, the FTC says.</p>
<p>Tapjoy&#8217;s business model has been to serve as an intermediary between advertisers, gamers and game developers. The mobile game developers integrate its technology to display the ads &#8212; aka &#8220;offers&#8221; &#8212; to their own customers, in order to earn payments for their users&#8217; activity. When the consumer completes the offer by taking whatever action was required, they&#8217;re supposed to earn in-game coins or other virtual currency. The app developers then earn a percentage of that ad revenue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But that often wasn&#8217;t happening, the FTC said. Players would jump through hoops, even sometimes spending money and turning over their sensitive data, only to get nothing in return.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, it said Tapjoy was aware its partners were cheating these consumers and did take action, even when &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of consumers filed complaints. This also harmed the game developers, who were cheated out of the promised ad revenues they would have otherwise earned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tapjoy promised gamers in-app rewards for completing advertising offers made by its partners, but then often didn’t deliver,&#8221; said Frank Gorman, acting deputy director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement. &#8220;When companies like Tapjoy make promises that depend on their partners’ performance, they’re on the hook to make sure those promises are kept.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FTC said Tapjoy&#8217;s conduct violated both the FTC Act&#8217;s prohibition on unfair business practices as well as the prohibition on deceptive practices. It will now have to actively work to weed out the fraud in its industry, otherwise Tapjoy itself will be held accountable.</p>
<p>App platforms like Apple and Google have struggled with shady ad businesses for years, which target their own customers.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">Apple implemented a policy</a> that requires developers to disclose on its app store listing what sort of information the app collects from customers and how that data is used to track users. This policy also wraps in whatever third-party ad technology may be integrated into the app.</p>
<p>The move is a not-so-subtle push to get developers to stop working with bad actors (like Tapjoy, allegedly) in order monetize their apps and games, and instead turn to a business model where Apple profits: subscriptions. Apple, brilliantly, has positioned this as a fight for consumer privacy and not for consumer dollars.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about this FTC ruling is that it lays the fault for Tapjoy and others like it directly at the platforms&#8217; feet.</p>
<p>Commissioners Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, in a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1585802/20210107_final_rchopra_tapjoy_statement.pdf">joint statement</a>, described Tapjoy as &#8220;a minnow next to the gatekeeping giants of the mobile gaming industry, Apple and Google.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By controlling the dominant app stores, these firms enjoy vast power to impose taxes and regulations on the mobile gaming industry, which was generating nearly $70 billion annually even before the pandemic. We should all be concerned that gatekeepers can harm developers and squelch innovation,&#8221; the statement reads. &#8220;The clearest example is rent extraction: Apple and Google charge mobile app developers on their platforms up to 30% of sales, and even bar developers from trying to avoid this tax through offering alternative payment systems,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>The Commissioners noted, too, that &#8220;larger gaming companies&#8221; are pursuing legal action against these practices &#8212; a reference to Epic Games&#8217; Fortnite lawsuit against Apple over the App Store commissions. But it said smaller developers fear retaliation for speaking up, as it could end up destroying their business if they were to be banned from the app stores.</p>
<p>In other words, the FTC blames the app store business model itself for leading developers to turn to companies like Tapjoy to sustain themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;This market structure also has cascading effects on gamers and consumers. Under heavy taxation by Apple and Google, developers have been forced to adopt alternative monetization models that rely on surveillance, manipulation, and other harmful practices,&#8221; the statement reads.</p>
<p>This is not the first FTC action that has resulted from the fallout of the modern app store business model. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/ftc-fines-kids-app-developer-hyperbeard-150k-for-use-of-third-party-ad-trackers/">the FTC went after kids&#8217; app developer HyperBeard</a> for its use of third-party ad trackers that were used to serve behavioral advertising, in violation of the Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>
<p>Apple is being given a lot of credit in recent weeks for its privacy push, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">the launch of its so-called app store &#8220;nutrition labels&#8221;</a> that help to better highlight the bad actors in the mobile app market. But some of the recent reporting has lacked balance.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2B6KGNXPKH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">Apple launches its new app privacy labels across all its App Stores</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple launches its new app privacy labels across all its App Stores&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/embed/#?secret=2B6KGNXPKH" data-secret="2B6KGNXPKH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Many reports neglect to explain why these alternative business models rose in the first place. They also often don&#8217;t detail how Apple will financially benefit from the shift to subscriptions that will result from this mobile ad clampdown. Plus, it&#8217;s rarely noted that Apple itself serves behavioral advertising within its own apps that is based on the user data it collects from across its catalog of first-party apps and services. That&#8217;s not to say that Apple isn&#8217;t doing a service with its privacy push, but it&#8217;s a complex matter. This isn&#8217;t sports; you don&#8217;t have to pick one side or the other.</p>
<p>The commissioners in their joint statement also hinted that regulation will soon come to the app platform providers, Apple and Google as well, not just mobile ad middlemen like Tapjoy.</p>
<p>&#8221; … when it comes to addressing the deeper structural problems in this marketplace that threaten both gamers and developers, the Commission will need to use all of its tools — competition, consumer protection, and data protection — to combat middlemen mischief, including by the largest gaming gatekeepers,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Tapjoy CEO Jeff Drobick said the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;At Tapjoy, we provide world-class advertising and monetization solutions for our partners, while creating the best experience for consumers. This includes a global platform for consumers to engage with advertiser offers to earn rewards in their favorite apps. We are committed to facilitating a marketplace for consumers, advertising partners, and publishers to transact with each other in a fair and clear way, while ensuring timely access to customer service.&#8221;</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why it took this long, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/youtube-declares-war-on-us-election-misinformation-a-month-late/">YouTube announced last month</a> (a full month after the presidential election, but right after the &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; deadline for audits and recounts) that it would remove videos alleging widespread fraud or errors in the election. However, there was a grace period during which videos would be removed without additional penalty to the account.</p>
<p>YouTube says that grace period was supposed to expire on January 21, after Inauguration Day. But since the election results were certified early this morning, after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-owned video platform says it&#8217;s ending the grace period now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>YouTube also says it has already removed &#8220;thousands of videos that spread misinformation claiming widespread voter fraud changed the result of the 2020 election, including several videos President Trump posted to his channel.&#8221; That includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-and-youtube-remove-trump-video-calling-extremists-special/">taking down a video Trump posted yesterday</a> in which he told rioters, &#8220;Go home, we love you.

					<description><![CDATA[Some of the biggest decision-makers in edtech are taking a scalpel to the way tutoring used to work.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While starting a tutoring marketplace is easy, scaling is often where the troubles begin. Tutoring marketplaces require a base of tutors that have the bandwidth and empathy to work with students across different learning styles, goals and comprehension levels. The nuance means that fast scale isn&#8217;t foolproof and can lead edtech startups into a classic marketplace downfall: the inability to grow consistently while also providing definite outcomes.</p>
<p>But, as 2020 showed edtech, the demand for quick and convenient help is high. To win post-pandemic, the sector needs to think bigger about the way <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/to-win-post-pandemic-edtech-needs-to-start-thinking-big/">it can reach more students in an effective and savvy way</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			In 2021, tutoring platforms can&#8217;t simply be middlemen that take a cut; they have to be extensive, smart and responsive.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Innovation from Quizlet, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/chegg" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="chegg">Chegg, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Course Hero and Brainly shows that the future of tutoring might not look like a 30-minute video on Zoom or Google Hangouts. Instead, modern-day extra help might take the form of an AI-powered chatbot, a live calculator or tech more subtle than either.</p>
<p>Regardless, the rise of tutoring bots over marketplaces illustrates that some of the biggest decision-makers in edtech are taking a scalpel to the way that tutoring used to work and hope to scale faster by doing so.</p>
<h2><strong>The businesses driving the change</strong></h2>
<p>On January 31, <a href="https://www.chegg.com/">Chegg</a> will close its standalone tutoring service, which matched vetted tutors with students, relaunching it into a live chatbot that answers students&#8217; questions. The move from a tutoring marketplace to chat interface, according to a spokesperson, will help Chegg &#8220;dramatically differentiate our offerings from our competitors and better service students.”</p>
<p>“Ever since Chegg Tutors was launched in 2014 we have seen what a powerful tool synchronous tutoring is for learners,” the company said in a statement. “What we have also learned is that the real need for learners is contextualized help directly in the experience of their actual learning environment.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The closure of a marketplace isn&#8217;t necessarily a failure; the company says that live tutoring was never a big part of its business. Still, it&#8217;s clear that Chegg didn’t see enough opportunity to match students and tutors live and saw more promise in a chatbot approach. Plus, it goes well with Chegg’s theme of self-directed learning. CEO Dan Rosensweig was unavailable for comment. <div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

Based on recent events, we have determined that the actions by President Donald J.

<p>News of the move was first reported by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/shopify-takes-trumpstore-com-offline-in-response-to-riot-11610035673">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a reversal of policy for the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/09/shopify-ceo-attempts-to-defend-continued-hosting-of-breitbarts-online-store/">which had previously defended the rights of any customer to use the platform</a> and a refusal to engage in what chief executive Tobias Lütke termed censorship.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Drawing a parallel between individual purchases made by consumers and votes, Lütke had said that it was not Shopify’s place to interrupt that free expression, even if personally and as an organization, they disagree with the positions of those on the platform.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer financial services startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/social-finance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="social-finance">SoFi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is going public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp V, one of a series of blank-check companies formed by venture capital investor Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>The deal, confirmed by SoFi, would value the fintech at $8.65 billion according to the company&#8217;s statement. It includes $2.4 billion in cash, encompassing $1.2 billion from a confirmed private placement (a PIPE instrument being led by Palihapitiya himself with participation from Altimeter, Baron Capital Group, BlackRock, Coatue and others), $805 million in funding from the SPAC&#8217;s balance sheet, and additional funds from a prior investment into SoFi closed last month led by T. Rowe Price.</p>
<p>An agreement to take SoFi public via a SPAC has been rumored for weeks. This latest advancement, which reveals Palihapitiya as the possible SPAC connection, was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sofi-m-a-social-cap-exclusive/exclusive-sofi-nears-deal-to-go-public-with-spac-backed-by-venture-capital-investor-palihapitiya-sources-idUSKBN29C25K?il=0&amp;source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link">first reported by Reuters</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SoFi, which is now led by ex-Twitter COO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/anthony-noto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="person" data-entity="anthony-noto">Anthony Noto</a>, was founded more than a decade ago to offer ways to secure better financial terms for student loans. The company has expanded those offerings for consumers such as loan, investment and insurance products as well as cash and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/sofi-wealth-management/">wealth management tools</a>. It made a move into the B2B realm with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/another-major-fintech-exit-as-sofi-acquires-banking-and-payments-platform-galileo-for-1-2b/">its acquisition</a> last April of Galileo.</p>
<p>SoFi has raised millions in capital since its founding, the most recent a $500 million round in 2019 that was led by Qatar Investment Authority, a Doha, Qatar-based private equity and sovereign wealth fund. The company was most recently valued at $4.3 billion.</p>
<p>Palihapitiya has been credited for kicking off the SPAC craze. SPACs, also known as blank check companies, are formed for the purpose of merging or acquiring other companies. The shell company raises money in an initial public offering with the intent of merging with a privately held company that then becomes publicly traded. A slew of SPACs have occurred in the past 18 months.</p>
<p>In 2017, he raised $600 million for his first SPAC called Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings, which was ultimately used to take a 49% stake in the British spaceflight company Virgin Galactic. Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp V is Palihapitiya&#8217;s third SPAC. His second merged with Opendoor in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What a week. Democracy is still standing and the nation is getting back to work, so let&#8217;s press forward, even if it does feel surreal to cover business news after witnessing a live-streamed coup attempt.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Setting aside the tectonic political moment, there&#8217;s plenty of activity inside the world of startups we need to discuss. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The pace at which new unicorns are being announced feels <em>incredibly</em> rapid, possibly implying that private-market investors anticipate exit valuations will remain high, and that a venture market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/fintech-vc-keeps-getting-later-larger-and-more-expensive/">that tilted late-stage</a> will continue its bias in this new year.</span></p>

<hr />
<p>Regular readers will recall that as 2020 wrapped up, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/how-unicorns-helped-venture-capital-get-later-and-bigger/">we noted</a> that &#8220;new unicorn formation continue[d] to impress.&#8221; That late-2020 trend is becoming a 2021 narrative.</p>
<p>For context, 17 unicorns <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/how-unicorns-helped-venture-capital-get-later-and-bigger/">were minted in the United States during Q3 2020</a>. We don&#8217;t have Q4 numbers yet, but should inside the next week or so. There were more than 200 unexited unicorns in the United States as the fourth quarter kicked off last year.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re at four new domestic unicorns in the first week of Q1 2020, along with at least one more from other shores.</p>

<p>Which startups reached the $1 billion threshold required to earn the unicorn tag? The list is long, but <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/divvy-7ad9" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="divvy-7ad9">Divvy, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Hinge Health, Salesloft, Starburst Data and Mambu seem to fit the bill. Lacework and iboss are possibles, along with Ikena Oncology and Senti Biosciences.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the rounds to see if we can spot any correlations amidst the data.</p>
<h2>New-nicorns</h2>
<p>Divvy raised earlier this week, putting together <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/divvy-raises-165m-as-the-spend-management-space-stays-red-hot/">a $165 million round</a> that valued the Utah-based company at $1.6 billion. That was up more than twice its preceding private valuation of around $700 million.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new startup has officially emerged from stealth with the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005296/en/Endeavor-BioMedicines-Launches-with-62-Million-Series-A-Financing-and-Mission-to-Reverse-the-Course-of-Devastating-Pulmonary-Disease">raise of its $62 million Series A funding round</a>. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/endeavor" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="endeavor">Endeavor <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> BioMedicines is led by co-founder and CEO John Hood, who previously led Impact Biomedicines, and its new funding comes from Omega Funds and Longitude Capital, as well as the company&#8217;s own management team. Endeavor is also co-founded by Miguel de los Rios, who serves as its chief science officer and who was previously CEO of Rift Biotherapeutics.</p>
<p>Endeavor&#8217;s goal is to develop treatments specifically to address pulmonary disease, and the startup is putting its funding toward two phase 2 clinical trials that will seek to determine whether their therapeutic candidate can reverse or slow the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a very common type of pulmonary fibrosis that results in long tissue scarring that causes difficulty in breathing for affected patients.</p>
<p>IPF has a significant and worrying fatality rate — the condition comes with &#8220;an estimated mean survival of 2-5 years from time of diagnosis,&#8221; according to Hood in a press release. Endeavor&#8217;s new treatment candidate, called &#8220;taladegib,&#8221; is an inhibitor that addresses what&#8217;s known as the &#8220;hedgehog&#8221; pathway for IPF. This pathway, which is primarily responsible for cell differentiation during embryonic development, can also play a role in development of harmful conditions in adults when they malfunction while regulating the regeneration of mature tissues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hood&#8217;s last company Impact Biomedicines exited in a sale to Celgene Corp worth up to $7 billion, depending on performance milestones set in the terms of the acquisition for passing certain regulatory and sales conditions. That company focused on treatment development specifically for myelofibrosis, a type of blood cancer, using an inhibitor for a specific type of protein kinase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Former Disney and Discovery execs are teaming up to launch a new streaming service called <a href="https://www.struum.com/">Struum</a>, arriving in the spring, that aims to take the ClassPass model and apply it to the streaming landscape. That is, Struum&#8217;s plan is to aggregate content from smaller video-on-demand services, then provide that under its own subscription.</p>
<p>The idea for Struum comes from founders Lauren DeVillier, the former head of Product for Discovery Ventures; Eugene Liew, former vice president of Product and Technology at Disney+; Paul Pastor, former executive vice president of Strategy, Revenue and Operations at Discovery Networks; and Thomas Wadsworth, the former lead of Advanced Product Development for Walt Disney Imagineering.</p>
<p>The service is backed by former Disney CEO Michael Eisner through his investment firm, Tornante Company. Firstlight Media, a company that provides technology to power video services, is also an investor and collaborator on the new effort. A third investor, Gaingels, focuses on backing LGBTQ+ founders and allies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>It argues that there is still a long tail of over 250 niche and speciality services it can work with to grow its content library, while also helping those partners connect with potential customers.</p>
<p>The model it&#8217;s using to go about this, however, is unique for streaming businesses &#8212; and very much inspired by the ClassPass service for sampling fitness classes from local gyms and studios.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a huge user of ClassPass and I love that model,&#8221; explains DeVillier. &#8220;And we just started noodling on this idea of offering this aggregated service using that model.&#8221; The founders would talk about ways they could help address the underserved market of streamers, who were &#8220;trying to find space and voice,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Struum will work by charging customers a single monthly subscription to provide a range of services, accessed through the Struum app. However, instead of getting a full buffet of content within the app, the consumer is given a number of &#8220;credits&#8221; they can use to sample and consume content, just like ClassPass did with gym classes.</p>
<p>Then, if Struum sees the customer is routinely accessing content from one service, it will suggest they may be better managed by that service. The customer can choose to subscribe to the service from within the Struum app directly.</p>
<p>In other words, Strumm acts as a customer acquisition engine for its partners, in addition to hosting their content.</p>
<p>For consumers, this means they don&#8217;t have to keep subscribing and unsubscribing to various services just to watch particular shows or movies. And for content providers, it allows them to find an audience without having to spin up their own standalone subscription app.</p>
<p>Struum generates revenue from its subscriptions, which it shares with its content partners. These may include what Pastor describes as &#8220;aspirational tier one&#8221; brands, that may be those from the traditional pay TV world that are now looking for a new, streaming audience. They may also include vertical media brands and others who are currently operating an ad-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) service but want to enter the subscription video-on-demand market.</p>

<p>The company has already completed deals with nearly three dozen yet-to-be-named streaming partners, and now has over 20,000 TV series, movies and shorts as a result. It will serve up this content on a platform built in collaboration with Firstlight Media, which runs on Microsoft Azure architecture.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s co-founders have not been working on Struum that long, having only come together around the beginning of 2020, just ahead of the pandemic&#8217;s outbreak in the U.S. The pandemic, of course, accelerated the streaming market as consumers stuck at home tapped into video services to stay entertained. But for Struum, it helped the startup speed its time to launch, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ability to be introduced to people &#8212; financiers and content partners and talent &#8212; within a matter of 24 to 48 hours by getting on the phone through Zoom, not having to fly across the country to do the pitches, not having to drive across town in Los Angeles to do pitches &#8212; we were able to more quickly accelerate our business from that aspect,&#8221; notes Pastor.</p>
<p>Struum also tapped into the ability to hire outside of its base in L.A., as remote work became more of the norm. On its team of 10, it has staff from elsewhere in the U.S. and even the U.K., and it aims to continue as a remotely distributed operation for the near future, even when the pandemic is over.</p>
<p>Struum has correctly identified a problem in the modern streaming landscape, in terms of large amount of untapped content now distributed across hundreds of smaller services, much of which lingers in obscurity. However, the approach it&#8217;s taking to address the problem &#8212; by aggregating the content under its ClassPass-like subscription/credit model &#8212; will still force the  service into competition with AVOD players, as this is where consumers turn when they can&#8217;t find anything else to watch on Netflix and elsewhere.</p>
<p>That means the challenge Struum faces will be convincing those consumers to essentially change their TV habits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, those habits and rituals are built around first going to a Netflix … and the next thing is to go to Amazon,&#8221; explains Pastor. Consumers might then turn to Disney+ or HBO Max as a third option, he says, depending on whether they&#8217;re looking for family fare or more adult content.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re hoping to be able to do, by aggregating these pieces together, is to say, listen: your third or fourth choice should be Struum. It&#8217;s a place where you can manage one subscription and explore all these [other} services,&#8221; Pastor adds.</p>
<p>After launching, Struum plans to quickly iterate on the customer data it has &#8212; another advantage of the aggregational model &#8212; to optimize its content library and help guide its future partnerships.</p>
<p>&#8220;We come from a very strategic background approach. And we come from a discipline of listening to consumers &#8212; that&#8217;s so much the history of the Discovery and the Disney brand. That&#8217;s very much the near-term focus,&#8221; Pastor says.</p>
<p>The company plans to launch in the spring with support for web, mobile and TV platforms. An international expansion is also on the roadmap farther down the road.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> spokesperson has confirmed with TechCrunch this morning that Trump has deleted three tweets that led to the temporarily suspension of this account last night.</p>
<p>Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-locks-trump-out-of-his-account-for-at-least-12-hours/">locked the account pending deletion of the offending tweets on Wednesday</a> following the riot and siege of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., and said that the suspension would remain in place so long as the tweets were not removed, and that any further violation of its rules could result in an actual <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1346970432017031178?s=20">permanent account suspension for Trump</a>.</p>
<p>The President&#8217;s account is to remain locked 12 hours after his deletion of the tweets (seen below). While we don&#8217;t have exact timing on when the countdown started, he has yet to tweet from the account. The account also still bears the warning that, &#8220;this Tweet is no longer available because it violated the Twitter Rules.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2092972" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png" alt="" width="1024" height="581" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png 1453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png?resize=768,436 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png?resize=680,386 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>While Trump has previously enjoyed the benefit of a rule Twitter put in place that allowed a special exemption for content that would normally violate its terms of service. The exempted content would be allowed to remain in the interest of public access in cases where it comes from accounts with a significant public interest component, like Trump&#8217;s while he&#8217;s occupying the office of U.S. president.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter locks Trump out of his account for at least 12 hours&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-locks-trump-out-of-his-account-for-at-least-12-hours/embed/#?secret=0bYz4cpLPT" data-secret="0bYz4cpLPT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The three tweets that finally proved a bridge too far for Twitter included a video posted by Trump that called for an end to the violence on Capitol Hill, but that also said &#8220;We love you, you&#8217;re very special&#8221; to the terrorists taking part in the action. The other two included statements that falsely suggested the legitimate results of the most recent U.S. presidential election were somehow fraudulent, including one that suggested the terrorist actions in Washington that resulted were somehow justified.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Twitter didn&#8217;t actually delete the offending tweets; the company generally has a policy of removing tweets that violate its terms from public view and notifying the offending account that they must be deleted by the account holder themselves in order to reinstate the ability to actively use the account.</p>
<p>While Trump does not have access to his own official Twitter account, his deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino posted a statement early Thursday morning about the electoral vote certification process, which was completed in the early hours. The statement again included inciting language falsely disputing the election results, but remains available and untouched by any of Twitter&#8217;s flagging measures.</p>
<p>Until this week, most anticipated that Trump would continue to enjoy protections that come with his political status. Yesterday&#8217;s move marked a shift for Twitter, but there remains a major question around his status in the remaining two weeks of his presidential term. Facebook, meanwhile, has taken the opposite action, altogether banning Trump from its platform, for &#8220;at least the next two weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s ability to maintain his favorite platform will hinge on whether Twitter determines that he has crossed the line one final time.</p>

<p>Both Facebook and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-stormthecapitol-hashtag-dangerous-organizations-policy/">removed Trump&#8217;s video post yesterday</a>, in which the President called for rioters who laid siege to the Capitol building in Washington to go home – but in which he also said &#8220;we love you&#8221; to the same violent terrorists. They followed that action with a 24-hour account lock, preventing Trump from posting via his Facebook and Instagram accounts during that period.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg acknowledges that Trump content has in the past been labeled or removed when found to violate its policies, but that he had been allowed up until now to &#8220;use our platform consistent with our own rules.&#8221; He says that has now changed, due to &#8220;use of our platform to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of careful, heavily PR&#8217;d language doing heavy lifting here – Zuck is careful to say that use until now has lined up with the platform&#8217;s rules in place, and not instead been an exception to them, and he&#8217;s also careful not to say Trump has directly incited violent insurrection in leaving an actor out of that particular sentence. Still, this is the strongest action by far from the platform to date to limit Trump&#8217;s access.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s decision to suspend the president&#8217;s account, even temporarily, is a shocking reversal from its longstanding attitude toward the world leader. Of course, that leader only remains in power for a few more days. With Trump out on January 20, Facebook will be dealing with President-elect Joe Biden and a Congress and administration very interested in imposing regulations on its business.</p>
<p>Historically, Facebook has been very permissive of Trump&#8217;s bad behavior on the platform, perhaps most famously when it did nothing to the president&#8217;s account after he called for state violence against racial justice protesters. Trump&#8217;s phrasing, &#8220;when the looting starts, the shooting starts,&#8221; <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/29/864818368/the-history-behind-when-the-looting-starts-the-shooting-starts">echoed</a> the same statement famously made by a racist Miami police chief in the 1960s.</p>
<p>That situation alone <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/facebook-employees-stage-virtual-walkout-in-protest-of-companys-stance-on-trump-posts/">plunged Facebook into internal turmoil</a>, as employees pushed back against the company&#8217;s attitude toward Trump. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-trump-coup">BuzzFeed News</a> reported that Facebook shut down internal conversations about the Trump supporters who staged an insurrection at the Capitol, freezing comment threads calling for Trump to be removed from the platform.</p>
<p>Throughout his administration, Facebook has gone out of its way to accommodate Trump&#8217;s use of the platform. In 2019, facing pressure to take a more principled stance, Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/before-showdown-with-congress-mark-zuckerberg-frames-the-conversations-facebook-would-rather-have">struck a defiant pose in a grand speech at Georgetown</a>, doubling down on the idea that Facebook had no responsibility to remove dangerous political content.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can either stand for free expression&#8230; or we can decide the cost is simply too great,&#8221; Zuckerberg said. &#8220;We must continue to stand for free expression.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the full post from Zuckerberg:</p>
<blockquote><p>The shocking events of the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden.</p>
<p>His decision to use his platform to condone rather than condemn the actions of his supporters at the Capitol building has rightly disturbed people in the US and around the world. We removed these statements yesterday because we judged that their effect &#8212; and likely their intent &#8212; would be to provoke further violence.</p>
<p>Following the certification of the election results by Congress, the priority for the whole country must now be to ensure that the remaining 13 days and the days after inauguration pass peacefully and in accordance with established democratic norms.</p>
<p>Over the last several years, we have allowed President Trump to use our platform consistent with our own rules, at times removing content or labeling his posts when they violate our policies. We did this because we believe that the public has a right to the broadest possible access to political speech, even controversial speech. But the current context is now fundamentally different, involving use of our platform to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.</p>
<p>We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great. Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.</p></blockquote>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Twitter on Thursday revealed that Trump has complied with its requirement to delete three offending tweets before reinstating access to his locked account on that platform – meaning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitter-will-reinstate-trumps-account-following-his-deletion-of-tweets/">Trump will regain access to his account 12 hours from the time of deletion</a>, or later on Thursday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk, the controversial and enigmatic entrepreneur who heads up SpaceX and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has reached a status that only three others have held in the past two decades: world&#8217;s richest person.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On his way to the top spot, Musk has surpassed a bevy of billionaires this year, including Warren Buffet and Bill Gates. He reached the pinnacle Thursday thanks to Tesla’s share price that has skyrocketed nearly 830% since March 2020 along with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/elon-musk-is-one-board-approval-away-from-another-2-1-billion-in-stock-options/">substantive pay package</a> that was triggered after achieving certain market capitalization and profitability milestones. In the process, Musk unseated rival Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon who held the world&#8217;s richest person position since 2017. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk is now worth more than $188 billion, per Bloomberg&#8217;s Billionaire Index. Tesla shares continued their seemingly unabated climb on Thursday, trading up more than 5% to $795.75.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In true Musk fashion, he acknowledged the milestone in a tweet, noting &#8220;how strange&#8221; and &#8220;well, now back to work.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well, back to work …</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347204606414131200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world’s richest person title isn’t what makes Musk’s position so intriguing. It’s the speed at which he reached it. Just a year ago, Musk was in the dregs of the world’s wealthiest list. This year, Musk was propelled forward by some $150 billion thanks to Tesla&#8217;s popping share price. Musk holds about 20% equity in Tesla. He also has some $42 billion in vested stock options, according to SEC filings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a stock that has historically suffered from volatility, with huge swings occurring after a tweet or financial update. Take 2018, for example. Tesla&#8217;s share price ended the year with about 3.8% gain. In between the those</span> two bookends of the stock market calendar — January 2 and December 31 — and the 3.8 percent gain they produced obfuscated a year of tumult and whipsaw-like swings in the stock price.</p>
<p>While Tesla shares have been on an upwards trend in 2020. This year, and after only one decade as a publicly traded company, Tesla became the most valuable automaker in the world by market value, passing the valuations of Ford, GM, VW Group and Toyota. Tesla&#8217;s market cap is now $757 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roblox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roblox">Roblox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is now one of the world&#8217;s most valuable private companies in the world after a monster Series H raise brings the social gaming platform a stratospheric $29.5 billion valuation. The company won&#8217;t be private for long, though.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/01/roblox-raises-520m-led-altimeter-capital-dragoneer-investment-group/">$520 million raise</a> led by Altimeter Capital and Dragoneer Investment Group is a significant cash influx for Roblox, which had previously raised just over $335 million from investors according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/roblox/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>. The Investment Group of Santa Barbara, Warner Music Group, and a number of current investors, also participated in this round.</p>
<p>In February of 2020, the company closed a $150 million Series G led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="andreessen-horowitz">Andreessen Horowitz <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which valued the company at $4 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The gaming startup has initially planned an IPO in 2020, but after the major first day pops of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="doordash">DoorDash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Airbnb, the company leadership reconsidered their timeline, according to a report in <a href="https://www.axios.com/roblox-ipo-affirm-delay-032685fe-3816-46fb-a50d-85979edf317c.html">Axios</a>. Those major say-one share price pops left significant money on the table for the companies selling those shares, an outcome Roblox is likely looking to avoid. Today, the company also <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/01/roblox-announces-anticipated-direct-listing/">announced</a> that it plans to enter the public markets via a direct listing.</p>
<p>Roblox&#8217;s 7x valuation multiple signals just how feverish public and private markets are for tech stocks. The valuation also highlights how investors foresee the company benefiting from pandemic trends which pushed more users online and towards social gaming platforms. In a 2019 prospectus, the company shared that it had 17.6 million users, now Roblox claims to have 31 million daily active users on its platform.</p>
