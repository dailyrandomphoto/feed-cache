										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Six years ago, I sat in the Google self-driving project&#8217;s Firefly vehicle — which I described, at the time, as a &#8220;little gumdrop on wheels&#8221; — and let it ferry me around a closed course in Mountain View, California.</p>
<p>Little did I know that two of the people behind Firefly&#8217;s ability to see and perceive the world around it and react to that information would soon leave to start and steer an autonomous vehicle company of their very own.</p>
<p>Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu aren&#8217;t the only Google self-driving project employees to launch an AV startup, but they might be the most underrated. Their company, <strong>Nuro</strong>, is valued at $5 billion and has high-profile partnerships with leaders in retail, logistics and food including FedEx, Domino&#8217;s and Walmart. And, they seem to have navigated the regulatory obstacle course with success — at least so far.</p>
<p>Yet, Nuro has remained largely in the shadows of other autonomous vehicle companies. Perhaps it&#8217;s because Nuro&#8217;s focus on autonomous delivery hasn&#8217;t captured the imagination of a general public that envisions themselves being whisked away in a robotaxi. Or it might be that they&#8217;re quieter.</p>
<p>Those quiet days might be coming to an end soon.</p>
<p>This series aims to look under Nuro&#8217;s hood, so to speak, from its earliest days as a startup to where it might be headed next — and with whom.</p>
<p>The lead writer of this EC-1 is <strong>Mark Harris</strong>, a freelance reporter known for investigative and long-form articles on science and technology. Our resident scoop machine, Harris is based in Seattle and also writes for Wired, The Guardian, The Economist, MIT Technology Review and Scientific American. He has broken stories about self-driving vehicles, giant airships, AI body scanners, faulty defibrillators and monkey-powered robots. In 2014, he was a Knight Science Journalism Fellow at MIT, and in 2015 he won the AAAS Kavli Science Journalism Gold Award.</p>
<p>The lead editor of this EC-1 was <strong>Kirsten Korosec</strong>, transportation editor at TechCrunch (that&#8217;s me), who has been writing about autonomous vehicles and the people behind them since 2014; OK maybe earlier. The assistant editor for this series was <strong>Ram Iyer</strong>, the copy editor was<strong> Richard Dal Porto</strong>, and illustrations were drawn by <strong>Nigel Sussman</strong>. The EC-1 series editor is <strong>Danny Crichton</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Nuro had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Harris nor Korosec have any financial ties to Nuro.</em></p>
<p>The Nuro EC-1 comprises four articles numbering 10,600 words and a reading time of 43 minutes. Here are the topics we&#8217;ll be dialing into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 1: Origin story</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-origin/">How Google&#8217;s self-driving car project accidentally spawned its robotic delivery rival</a>&#8221; (3,200 words/13 minutes) — explores the early days of Nuro and its founders and how they realized that the most useful robot they could ever build would be an autonomous delivery vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Part 2: Regulations</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-regulations/">Why regulators love Nuro&#8217;s self-driving delivery vehicles</a>&#8221; (2,400 words/10 minutes) — analyzes how Nuro won over federal regulators and navigated a patchwork of policies to be able to test and deploy its autonomous delivery vehicles in several states.</li>
<li><strong>Part 3: Partnerships</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-partnerships/">How Nuro became the robotic face of Domino&#8217;s</a>&#8221; (2,500 words/10 minutes) — digs into Nuro&#8217;s relationship with Domino&#8217;s as well its trials with other companies including fast casual restaurant chain Chipotle, Kroger grocery stores and CVS pharmacies and how those relationships have affected the design and functions of the R2 bot.</li>
<li><strong>Part 4: Operations</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-operations/">Here&#8217;s what the inevitable friendly neighborhood robot invasion looks like</a>&#8221; (2,500 words/10 minutes) — examines where Nuro has set up shop, and more importantly, how it goes about picking locations and learning from its experiences.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nuro doesn&#8217;t have a typical Silicon Valley origin story. It didn&#8217;t emerge after a long, slow slog from a suburban garage or through a flash of insight in a university laboratory. Nor was it founded at the behest of an eccentric billionaire with money to burn.</p>
<p>Nuro was born — and ramped up quickly — thanks to a cash windfall from what is now one of its biggest rivals.</p>

			Nuro was born — and ramped up quickly — thanks to a cash windfall from what is now one of its biggest rivals.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In the spring of 2016, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu were teammates on Google&#8217;s self-driving car effort. Ferguson was directing the project&#8217;s computer vision, machine learning and behavior prediction teams, while Zhu (widely JZ) was in charge of the car&#8217;s perception technologies and cutting-edge simulators.</p>
<p>&#8220;We both were leading pretty large teams and were responsible for a pretty large portion of the Google car&#8217;s software system,&#8221; Zhu recalls.</p>
<p>As Google prepared to spin out its autonomous car tech into the company that would become Waymo, it first needed to settle a bonus program devised in the earliest days of its so-called Chauffeur project. Under the scheme, early team members could choose staggered payouts over a period of eight years — or leave Google and get a lump sum all at once.</p>
<p>Ferguson and Zhu would not confirm the amount they received, but court filings released as part of Waymo&#8217;s trade secrets case against Uber suggest they each received payouts in the neighborhood of $40 million by choosing to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we were fortunate enough to receive as part of the self-driving car project enabled us to take riskier opportunities, to go and try to build something that had a significant chance of not working out at all,&#8221; Ferguson says.</p>
<p>Within weeks of their departure, the two had incorporated Nuro Inc, a company with the non-ironic mission to &#8220;better everyday life through robotics.&#8221; Its first product aimed to take a unique approach to self-driving cars: Road vehicles with all of the technical sophistication and software smarts of Google&#8217;s robotaxis, but none of the passengers.</p>
<p>In the five years since, Nuro&#8217;s home delivery robots have proven themselves smart, safe and nimble, outpacing Google&#8217;s vehicles to secure the first commercial deployment permit for autonomous vehicles in California, as well as groundbreaking concessions from the U.S. government.</p>
<p>While robotaxi companies struggle with technical hitches and regulatory red tape, Nuro has already made thousands of robotic pizza and grocery deliveries across the U.S., and Ferguson (as president) and Zhu (as CEO) are now heading a company that as of its last funding round in November 2020 valued it at $5 billion with more than 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>But how did they get there so fast, and where are they headed next?</p>
<h2>Turning money into robots</h2>
<p>&#8220;Neither JZ nor I think of ourselves as classic entrepreneurs or that starting a company is something we had to do in our lives,&#8221; Ferguson says. &#8220;It was much more the result of soul searching and trying to figure out what is the biggest possible impact that we could have.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Nuro's autonomous vehicles (AVs) don't have a human driver on board. There's no room in the narrow chassis for a driver's seat, no need for a steering wheel, accelerator or brake pedals.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nuro&#8217;s delivery autonomous vehicles (AVs) don&#8217;t have a human driver on board. The company&#8217;s founders Dave Ferguson (president) and Jiajun Zhu&#8217;s (CEO) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-origin/">vision of a driverless delivery vehicle</a> sought to do away with a lot of the stuff that is essential for a normal car to have, like doors and airbags and even a steering wheel. They built an AV that spared no room in the narrow chassis for a driver&#8217;s seat, and had no need for an accelerator, windshield or brake pedals.</p>
<p>So when the company <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/NHTSA-2019-0017-0001">petitioned the U.S. government</a> in 2018 for a minor exemption from rules requiring a rearview mirror, backup camera and a windshield, Nuro might have assumed the process wouldn&#8217;t be very arduous.</p>
<p>They were wrong.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If Nuro is to become the generation-defining company its founders desire, it will be due as much to innovation in regulation as advances in the technology it develops.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.aamva.org/AAMVA-Comments-on-Nuro-AV-Exemption-Petition/">2019 letter</a> to the U.S. Department of Transportation, The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) &#8220;[wondered] about the description of pedestrian &#8216;crumple zones,&#8217; and whether this may impact the vehicle&#8217;s crash-worthiness in the event of a vehicle-to-vehicle crash. Even in the absence of passengers, AAMVA has concerns about cargo ejection from the vehicle and how Nuro envisions protections from loose loads affecting the driving public.&#8221;</p>
<p>The National Society of Professional Engineers similarly complained that Nuro&#8217;s request lacked information about the detection of moving objects. &#8220;How would the R2X function if a small child darts onto the road from the passenger side of the vehicle as a school bus is approaching from the driver&#8217;s side?&#8221; it asked. It also recommended the petition be denied until Nuro could provide a more detailed cybersecurity plan against its bots being hacked or hijacked. (R2X is now referred to as R2)</p>
<p>The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (now the Alliance Automotive Innovation), which represents most U.S. carmakers, wrote that the National Highway Transportation Safety Agency (NHTSA) should not use Nuro&#8217;s kind of petition to &#8220;introduce new safety requirements for [AVs] that have not gone through the rigorous rule-making process.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you can see is that many comments came from entrenched interests,&#8221; said David Estrada, Nuro&#8217;s chief legal and policy officer. &#8220;And that&#8217;s understandable. There are multibillion dollar industries that can be disrupted if autonomous vehicles become successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be fair, critical comments also came from nonprofit organizations genuinely concerned about unleashing robots on city streets. The Center for Auto Safety, an independent consumer group, thought that Nuro did not provide enough information on its development and testing, nor any meaningful comparison with the safety of similar, human-driven vehicles. &#8220;Indeed, the planned reliance on &#8216;early on-road tests … with human-manned professional safety drivers&#8217; suggests that Nuro has limited confidence in R2X&#8217;s safe operation,&#8221; it wrote.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189997" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189997" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2189997 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg" alt="Nuro-R2-specs-infographic" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/R2-specs-infographic.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2189997" class="wp-caption-text">Nuro&#8217;s R2 delivery autonomous vehicle. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nuro</p></div></p>
<p>Despite such concerns, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/documents/nuro_grant_notice_final-unofficial.pdf">granted</a> Nuro the exemptions it sought in February last year. Up to 5,000 R2 vehicles could be produced for a limited period of two years and subject to Nuro reporting any incidents, without a windshield, rearview mirror or backup camera. Although only a small concession, it was the first — and so far, only — time the U.S. government had relaxed vehicle safety requirements for an AV.</p>
<p>Now Estrada and Nuro hope to use that momentum to chip away at a mountain of regulations that never envisaged vehicles controlled by on-board robots or distant humans, extending from the foothills of local and state government to the peaks of federal and international safety rules.</p>
<p>If Nuro is to become the generation-defining company its founders desire, it will be due as much to innovation in regulation as advances in the technology it develops.</p>
<h2>Regulate for success</h2>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think any of the credible, big AV players want this to be a free-for-all,&#8221; said Dave Ferguson, Nuro&#8217;s co-founder and president. &#8220;We need the confidence of a clear regulatory framework to invest the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars necessary to manufacture vehicles at scale. Otherwise, it&#8217;s really going to limit our ability to deploy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pandemic pizza was definitely a thing.</p>
<p>U.S. consumers forked out a record-breaking $14 billion to have pizza delivered to their doors in 2020, and nearly half of that total was spent with just one brand: Domino&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Domino&#8217;s is the home of pizza delivery,&#8221; said Dennis Maloney, Domino&#8217;s chief innovation officer. &#8220;Delivery is at the core of who we are, so it&#8217;s very important for us to lead when it comes to the consumer experience of delivery.&#8221;</p>

<p>In its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYM1flimFa4">latest TV ad</a>, an order of Domino&#8217;s pizza speeds to its destination inside a Nuro R2X delivery autonomous vehicle (AV). The R2X (now known as R2) deftly avoids potholes, falling trees and traffic jams caused by The Noid — a character created by Domino&#8217;s in the 1980s to symbolize the difficulties of delivering a pizza in 30 minutes or less.</p>
<p>The reality is much more sedate. Domino&#8217;s currently has just one R2X that operates from a single Domino&#8217;s store on the generally calm streets of Woodland Heights in Houston, Texas. And since the AV&#8217;s introduction in April, The Noid has yet to put in an appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The R2X adds a bunch of efficiencies while not taking away from any existing capabilities,&#8221; Maloney said. &#8220;As we start getting the bot into regular operation, we&#8217;ll see if it plays out the way we expect it to. So far, all the indications are good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Partnerships are key for Nuro. The company&#8217;s business model is to sign contracts with established brands that either have their own branded vehicles or use traditional delivery companies like UPS or the U.S. Postal Service.</p>
<p>Nuro is carrying out trials and pilot deliveries with a number of companies, including fast casual restaurant chain Chipotle, Kroger grocery stores, CVS pharmacies, bricks-and-mortar retail behemoth Walmart, and, most recently, global parcel courier FedEx. While it is a dizzyingly impressive list for a company less than five years old, their interest was driven as much by global trends as by Nuro&#8217;s technology, admits Cosimo Leipold, head of partnerships at Nuro.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody today wants what they want and they want it faster than ever, but frankly they&#8217;re not willing to pay for it,&#8221; Leipold said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve reached a point where almost every company is going to have to offer delivery services, and now it&#8217;s just the question of how they&#8217;ll do it in the best possible way and with the most possible control.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nuro&#8217;s delivery AVs — aka bots — offer the tantalizing promise of safe, reliable and efficient delivery without sacrificing revenue and customer data to third-party platforms like Grubhub, DoorDash or Instacart. Alongside Nuro&#8217;s stated aim of driving the <a href="https://medium.com/nuro/serving-americas-food-deserts-a7442e922053">cost of delivery</a> down to zero, it is little surprise that Nuro now finds itself in the enviable position of being able to pick and choose the partners it wants — and the less enviable position of having to choose which partner to prioritize.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the story of how one of Nuro&#8217;s biggest partnerships came to be, and the lessons and companies that will drive its future growth.</p>
<h2>Deliveries with extra cheese</h2>
<p>Domino&#8217;s has a long history of innovating in delivery, usually accompanied by a strong marketing campaign. In the 1980s, the company bought 10 customized Tritan Aerocar 2s, a <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/25651/a-slice-of-history-buy-this-rare-tritan-a2-dominos-delivery-car">Jetsons-styled three-wheeler</a>, for use as delivery vehicles. In 2015, the company unveiled the <a href="https://www.hagerty.com/media/car-profiles/why-dominos-dxp-delivery-cars-were-anything-but-half-baked/">DXP</a>, a Chevrolet Spark modified with a single seat and a built-in warming oven, designed specifically for transporting pizza.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The first sign that your town is about to welcome a horde of Nuro robots will be the appearance of a fleet of human-driven Toyota Priuses modified with cameras, lidars and radars.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In early 2021, a Nuro autonomous delivery vehicle pulled to a halt at a four-way stop in its hometown of Mountain View, California to let a user cross. This seemingly humdrum moment quickly looked like a decidedly science fiction storyline — the user was a small sidewalk robot from another startup on its own mission.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, we yielded to it, but it was, wow, we have entered a different world,&#8221; said Amy Jones Satrom, head of Operations at Nuro.</p>
<p>Mountain View is home to competitor Waymo and other autonomous vehicle testing activity. But for those who want to take part in that science fiction scene, Houston provides the full experience.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Nuro&#8217;s operations team has to delicately balance speed, safety, convenience and congestion, even as the company embarks on a growth spurt that will see robots spreading to other cities, states and partners in the months ahead.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Waymo is testing self-driving trucks in Houston, and a fully driverless shuttle service is due to start public service there early next year. Nuro&#8217;s Texas effort started in April, when an R2 robot began its commercial pizza delivery service in partnership with Domino&#8217;s. Some customers ordering pizzas from the Domino&#8217;s Woodland Heights store will see the option to have their pies delivered by robot.</p>
<p>Customers can trace the progress of the self-driving vehicle on the Domino&#8217;s app and, when it pulls up outside their home, tap in a unique PIN on its touchscreen to access their order. Nuro is also operating in Houston with Kroger supermarkets and FedEx.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the things we laugh about is how customers constantly talk to the bot,&#8221; Dennis Maloney, Domino&#8217;s chief innovation pfficer said. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost like they think it&#8217;s &#8216;Knight Rider.&#8217; It&#8217;s very common for customers to thank it or say goodbye, which is great because that indicates we&#8217;re creating an engaging experience that they&#8217;re not frustrated by.&#8221;</p>
<p>Creating an experience, where people want to chat with their new robot neighbors instead of chasing them down the street with pitchforks, falls to Jones Satrom&#8217;s operations team. It has to delicately balance speed, safety, convenience and congestion, even as Nuro embarks on a growth spurt that will see robots spreading to other cities, states and partners in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it manages that, and what the future holds for Nuro&#8217;s ever-so-gentle robot invasion.</p>
<h2>Mapping the territory</h2>
<p>Few people are as well suited to overseeing Nuro&#8217;s high-stakes robot rollout as Jones Satrom, who started her career as a nuclear engineer on an aircraft carrier and previously managed the integration of Kiva Systems&#8217; robots into Amazon&#8217;s warehouses.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Understanding why investors are so willing to buy small stakes in dozens of private companies worth billions of dollars is key to grokking the crush of investment we see among younger tech startups.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As last week came to a close, funding news involving three major U.S. technology startups lit up on Twitter.</p>
<p>Carta <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/carta-says-it-just-used-its-own-product-to-establish-a-new-and-far-higher-valuation-for-itself/">closed a $500 million Series G</a> at a $7.4 billion price tag. Chime put together <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chime-financial-raises-750-million-in-latest-funding-round-11628872069">a $750 million round</a> at a $25 billion valuation. And Discord <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/sources-discord-raising-at-roughly">was reported</a> to be hunting up new cash that would value it at around $15 billion.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Each funding round has something special about it that we need to discuss. Why? Because while it&#8217;s well-known that the unicorn market is crowded &#8212; reaching a $1 billion valuation in today&#8217;s capital-flush markets is no longer particularly rare for startups &#8212; the number of startups worth a multiple of that valuation threshold is growing rapidly. And understanding why investors are so willing to buy minute stakes in dozens of private companies worth billions of dollars is key to grokking the crush of investment we see among younger technology startups.</p>

That&#8217;s nearly five dozen companies worth more than Carta after its most recent round. According to the list, 38 of today&#8217;s unicorns are worth $10 billion or more.</p>
<p>The 55 startups valued at $7.5 billion and more are worth more than $1 trillion in aggregate, while the 38 decacorns are worth more than $900 billion when counted as a group.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve become too accustomed to simply reading the latest nine-figure round invested at an 11-figure price and shrugging. So, this morning, let&#8217;s talk about Carta and Chime and Discord and why each of them may have managed their latest, or anticipated, valuation gain.</p>
<p>When we talk about unicorns, we&#8217;re simply discussing a generally growth-oriented cohort of technology upstarts. But once a startup reaches closer to the $10 billion valuation threshold, we&#8217;re really talking about ducks increasingly too big for their pond. They are the next set of IPOs both domestically and abroad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://cisco.com">Cisco</a> announced <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/news/12082021">on Friday</a> that it&#8217;s acquiring Israeli applications monitoring startup Epsagon at a price pegged at $500 million. The purchase gives Cisco a more modern microservices-focused component for its growing applications monitoring portfolio.</p>
<p>The Israeli business publication <a class="c-link" href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-cisco-confirms-acquisition-of-israeli-startup-epsagon-1001381718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Globes reported</a> it had gotten confirmation from Cisco that the deal was for $500 million, but Cisco would not confirm that price with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The acquisition comes on top of a couple other high profile app monitoring deals including AppDynamics, which the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/cisco-snaps-up-appdynamics-for-3-7b-right-before-its-ipo/">bought in 2018</a> for $3.7 billion and ThousandEyes, which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/cisco-to-acquire-internet-monitoring-solution-thousandeyes/">nabbed last year for $1 billion</a>.</p>
<p>With Epsagon, the company is getting a way to monitor more modern applications built with containers and Kubernetes. Epsagon&#8217;s value proposition is a solution built from the ground up to monitor these kinds of workloads, giving users tracing and metrics, something that&#8217;s not always easy to do given the ephemeral nature of containers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rPt0eyEesK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/cisco-to-acquire-internet-monitoring-solution-thousandeyes/">Cisco to acquire internet monitoring solution ThousandEyes</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cisco to acquire internet monitoring solution ThousandEyes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/cisco-to-acquire-internet-monitoring-solution-thousandeyes/embed/#?secret=rPt0eyEesK" data-secret="rPt0eyEesK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As Cisco&#8217;s Liz Centoni wrote <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/news/12082021">in a blog post</a> announcing the deal, Epsagon adds to the company&#8217;s concept of a full-stack offering in their applications monitoring portfolio. Instead of having a bunch of different applications monitoring tools for different tasks, the company envisions one that works together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cisco’s approach to full-stack observability gives our customers the ability to move beyond just monitoring to a paradigm that delivers shared context across teams and enables our customers to deliver exceptional digital experiences, optimize for cost, security and performance and maximize digital business revenue,&#8221; Centoni wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That experience point is particularly important because when an application isn&#8217;t working, it isn&#8217;t happening in a vacuum. It has a cascading impact across the company, possibly affecting the core business itself and certainly causing customer distress, which could put pressure on customer service to field complaints, and the site reliability team to fix it. In the worst case, it could result in customer loss and an injured reputation.</p>
<p>If the application monitoring system can act as an early warning system, it could help prevent the site or application from going down in the first place, and when it does go down, help track the root cause to get it up and running more quickly.</p>
<p>The challenge here for Cisco is incorporating Epsagon into the existing components of the application monitoring portfolio and delivering that unified monitoring experience without making it feel like a Frankenstein&#8217;s monster of a solution globbed together from the various pieces.</p>
<p>Epsagon launched in 2018 and has raised $30 million. According to a report in <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3915194,00.html">the Israeli publication, Calcalist</a>, the company was on the verge of a big Series B round with a valuation in the range of $200 million when it accepted this offer. It certainly seems to have given its early investors a good return. The deal is expected to close later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amanda DoAmaral was an educator herself before she decided to found a tech company aimed at improving the education system. That&#8217;s a surprisingly rare credential for a startup founder in this area to possess — despite the obvious benefits of real, first-hand experience. Her company, Fiveable, focuses on modernizing (including a remote-first approach) a key and often overlooked part of education for students: Building an active community of peers to share knowledge with. Hear how she took her dissatisfaction with an inadequate system and turned that into the motivation to build a venture-scale business outside of it on this week&#8217;s episode of <a href="https://pod.link/found">Found</a>.</p>
<p>We talked to Amanda about her path to entrepreneurship, which is not your typical founder story, despite her experience living and teaching in the Bay Area. Amanda shares how her considerable experience in education, both in terms of her own education, as well as her job as a teacher, led her to the frustrating realization that while tech had a lot to offer kids in school, the system just wasn&#8217;t set up to support that or make it happen. Building a company that focused on a particularly underserved aspect of remote learning ended up being the best path forward — and it just so happened that the market Fiveable entered would accelerate dramatically shortly after the company&#8217;s founding due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook today announced that it would extend the “most comprehensive” subsea cable to serve the African continent and Middle East region to four more branches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook will do this in collaboration with the 2Africa consortium that includes China Mobile International, MTN GlobalConnect, Orange, STC, Telecom Egypt, Vodafone, and WIOCC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new branches are Seychelles, the Comoros Islands, Angola, and the south-eastern part of Nigeria. They join the recently announced extension to the Canary Islands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/2africa-africa-middle-east-facebook-subsea-cable/">announced the 2Africa project</a> to lay 37,000 km (22,990 miles) of cables. These cables interconnect Europe, via Egypt, and the Middle East, via Saudi Arabia, and 21 landings in 16 African countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, the involved parties said the 2Africa project would be completed either by 2023 or early 2024. And once live, 2Africa should be able to serve more than the total combined capacity of all subsea cables serving Africa at the moment. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189985" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189985" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2189985" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2Africa-Web_Color-Print-2021.png?w=680" alt="2Africa" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2Africa-Web_Color-Print-2021.png 1999w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2Africa-Web_Color-Print-2021.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2Africa-Web_Color-Print-2021.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2Africa-Web_Color-Print-2021.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2Africa-Web_Color-Print-2021.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2Africa-Web_Color-Print-2021.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2Africa-Web_Color-Print-2021.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189985" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> 2Africa</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company&#8217;s new statement released by the consortium, the plan is still to go live in late 2023. The consortium says 2Africa has made some progress as a big part of the subsea route survey activity is complete. The Egypt and Mediterranean Seas connections are almost complete as well, the statement read. In addition, the marine surveys for the new sections are scheduled to be completed by the end of this year.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consortium selected Nokia’s Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN) to build the new branches, bringing 2Africa landings to 35 in 26 countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The significant investment by Facebook in 2Africa builds on several other investments we have made in the continent, including infrastructure investments in South Africa, Uganda, Nigeria, and DRC.  The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of connectivity as billions of people around the world rely on the internet to work, attend school, and stay connected to the people they care about,&#8221; a Facebook spokesperson said regarding the company&#8217;s continued investment in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;2Africa will not only be an important element for advancing connectivity infrastructure across the African continent, but it will also be a major investment that comes at a critical time for economic recovery. With more and more people relying on the internet, subsea cables are a vital ingredient to ensure they always are connected to what matters. While Facebook invests in submarine cables to provide better experiences for people using our products, our investments drive a more cost-effective internet for all.&#8221; </span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a>. I <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">also tweet</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a surreal day to talk about technology, but here we are. If you can pull your eyes away from the greater geopolitical tragedy that is our world today, here&#8217;s what we talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>T Mobile may have suffered a material breach. If this bears out, it could be a leading tech story for the week. Vice has confirmed that at least some of the data in the leak <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million">appears genuine</a>.</li>
<li>Indian travel service ixigo <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/travel-platform-ixigo-files-for-rs-1600-crore-ipo/articleshow/85285737.cms">is going public</a>. The company&#8217;s IPO follows Zomato&#8217;s own domestic debut.</li>
<li>And speaking of IPOs, the Tencent Music offering in Hong Kong <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Media-Entertainment/Tencent-Music-s-plan-stalls-for-5bn-Hong-Kong-listing-in-2021">could be on hold until next year</a>.</li>
<li>And a trio of American tech companies raised a raft of capital as last week concluded. Carta <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/carta-says-it-just-used-its-own-product-to-establish-a-new-and-far-higher-valuation-for-itself/">put together $500 million</a> in a huge deal, as <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/chime-raises-24750-million-earns-big-jump-in-valuation-as-another-fintech-moves-closer-to-ipo/ar-AANi7Du">Chime raised $750 million</a>. And as the week closed, Discord <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/sources-discord-raising-at-roughly">was reported</a> to be hunting up a new round at a $15 billion price tag.</li>
</ul>
<p>And stocks are set to open lower this morning. That&#8217;s the morning report. Equity is back on Wednesday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. auto regulators have opened a preliminary investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot advanced driver assistance system, citing 11 incidents in which vehicles crashed into parked first responder vehicles while the system was engaged.</p>
<p>The Tesla vehicles involved in the collisions were confirmed to have either have had Autopilot or a feature called Traffic Aware Cruise Control engaged, according to <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOA-PE21020-1893.PDF">investigation documents</a> posted on the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration’s website. Most of the incidents took place after dark and occurred despite “scene control measures” such as emergency vehicle lights, road cones, and an illuminated arrow board signaling drivers to change lanes.</p>
<p>“The investigation will assess the technologies and methods used to monitor, assist, and enforce the driver&#8217;s engagement with the dynamic driving task during Autopilot operation,” the document says.</p>
<p>The investigation covers around 765,000 Tesla vehicles that span all currently available models: Tesla Model Y, Model X, Model S, and Model 3. The 11 incidents or fires resulted in 17 injuries and one fatality. They occurred between January 2018 and July 2021.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Tesla’s Autopilot has fallen under the scrutiny of NHTSA, the country’s top vehicle safety regulator. In 2017, the agency investigated an incident that resulted in a fatal crash in 2016, though the EV maker was found to be at no-fault in the accident. NHSTA has investigated a further 25 crashes involving Tesla’s ADAS since, the Associated Press reported when it broke the story Monday.</p>
<p>In June, NHTSA issued an order requiring automakers to report crashes involving vehicles equipped with ADAS or Levels 3-5 of automated driving systems.</p>
<p>“NHTSA reminds the public that no commercially available motor vehicles today are capable of driving themselves,” an agency spokesperson told TechCrunch on Monday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Tesla, which has dissolved its media relations division, for comment and will update the story if the company responds.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">We’re quick to celebrate the extraordinary victories of Israel’s multiplying cybersecurity unicorns, but every success story must start somewhere. The early days of any young startup decide how successful it can be, which is why we’ve developed a focused, value-add program to support cybersecurity founders during this most critical stage and maximize their potential in building market-leading companies.</p>
<p>However, the early stages of cybersecurity company-building are often shrouded in mystery, only coming into the light for fundraising and feature announcements. This leaves many entrepreneurs we speak with asking what exactly cybersecurity companies are achieving behind the curtain to earn these huge victories.</p>
<p>Though every company&#8217;s journey is unique, we can tease out trends and patterns to establish performance benchmarks for the cybersecurity ecosystem as a whole. To most entrepreneurs, however, the sensitive data required to understand the early success of a company is often unavailable or obscured. Moreover, the industry has yet to formally define proxies for growth and momentum beyond fundraising — leaving cybersecurity founders aiming for landmarks without guideposts.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs require guideposts to aspire to when building large companies, and critical customer and revenue expectations can be best established by looking at what already successful cybersecurity companies have accomplished. Such metrics have been previously established for wider areas of technology, such as SaaS.</p>
<p>Leveraging our experience and resources, we collect this knowledge to keep our founders informed with the most up-to-date cybersecurity-specific metrics for long-term and large-scale growth. We hope that sharing these unique insights into early-stage cybersecurity companies — based on our own portfolio companies’ average performance — will help entrepreneurs in the wider Israeli ecosystem more confidently build their budgets and roadmaps with industry evidence.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189576" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189576" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189576" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_0889.jpg" alt="Benchmarks for early-stage cybersecurity companies" width="1024" height="630" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_0889.jpg 1310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_0889.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_0889.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_0889.jpg?resize=768,473 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_0889.jpg?resize=680,418 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_0889.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189576" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YL Ventures</p></div></p>
<h2>What should revenue look like over the first few years?</h2>
<p>Though today’s investors are growing more aggressive, $500,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a traditional baseline requirement for a successful Series A from strong investors, and hitting that mark quickly should remain every entrepreneur&#8217;s goal. Hitting this target indicates product-market fit and customer willingness to commit to your solution.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			When it comes to contracts, timing can provide important insight into the quality and performance of the sales pipeline. On average, successful companies will have closed their first paying customers in the U.S. within 12 months of their seed round.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Discounting variances in pricing, the best companies we&#8217;ve seen are able to reach the $500,000 benchmark in less than 18 months. From there, top-performing companies can expect to gain momentum and reach $1 million in ARR in 18 to 24 months. Such momentum is contingent on a number of factors for Israeli cybersecurity entrepreneurs, but growth is mainly reliant on how well founders connect with relevant customers outside the Israeli market.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Shopistry enables customers to create personalized commerce experiences accessible to all.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canada-based <a href="https://www.shopistry.com/">Shopistry</a> wants to turn the concept of headless commerce, well, on its head. On Monday, the e-commerce startup announced $2 million in seed funding to continue developing its toolkit of products, integrations, services and managed infrastructure for brands to scale online.</p>
<p>Jaafer Haidar and Tariq Zabian started Shopistry in 2019. Haidar’s background is as a serial technology founder with exits and ventures in e-commerce and cloud software. He was working as a venture capitalist when he got the idea for Shopistry. Zabian is a former general manager at OLX, an online classified marketplace.</p>
<p>Shopistry enables customers to create personalized commerce experiences accessible to all. Haidar expects headless will become the dominant architecture over the next five years, though he isn’t too keen on calling it “headless.” He much prefers the term “modular.”</p>
<p>“It’s a modular system, we call it ‘headless without the headaches,’ where you grab the framework to manage APIs,” Haidar told TechCrunch. “After a company goes live, they can spend 50% of their budget just to keep the lights on. They use marketplaces like Shopify to do the tech, and we are doing the same thing, but providing way more optionality. We are not a monolithic system.”</p>
<p>Currently, the company offers five products:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Shopistry Console: Brands turn on their optimal stack and change anytime without re-platforming. There is support for multiple e-commerce administrative tools like Shopify or Square, payment providers, analytics and marketing capabilities.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Shopistry Cloud is a managed infrastructure spearheading performance, data management and orchestration across services.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Shopistry Storefront and Mobile to manage web storefronts and mobile apps.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Shopistry CMS, a data-driven, headless customer management system to create once and publish across channels.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Shopistry Services, an offering to brands that need design and engineering help.</li>
</ul>
<p>Investors in the seed round include Shoptalk founder Jonathan Weiner, Hatch Labs’ Amar Varma, Garage Capital, Mantella Venture Partners and Raiven Capital.</p>
<p>“At MVP we love companies that can simplify complexity to bring the proven innovations of large, technically sophisticated retailers to the masses of small to midsize retailers trying to compete with them,” said Duncan Hill, co-founder and general partner at Mantella Venture Partners, in a written statement. “Shopistry has the team and tech to be a major player in this next phase of the e-commerce evolution. This was easy to get excited about.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shopistry is already working with retailers like Honed and Oura Ring to manage their e-commerce presences without the cost, complexity or need for a big technology team.</p>
<p>Prior to going after the seed funding, Haidar and Zabian spent two years working with high growth brands to build out its infrastructure. Haidar intends to use the new capital to future that development as well as bring on sales and marketing staff.</p>
<p>Haidar was not able to provide growth metrics just yet. He did say the company was growing its customer base and expects to be able to share that growth next year. He is planning to add more flexibility and integrations to the back end of Shopistry’s platform and add support for other platforms.</p>
<p>“We are focusing next on the go-to-market perspective while we gear up for our big launch coming in the fourth quarter,” he added. “There is also a big component to ‘after the sale,’ and we want to create some amazing experiences and focus on back office operations. We want to be the easiest way to control and manage data while maintaining a storefront.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The $10 million Swiftarc Beauty Fund supports female founders leading the next wave of beauty and wellness brands. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.swiftarcventures.com/">Swiftarc Ventures</a> announced its $10 million Swiftarc Beauty Fund to support female founders leading the next wave of beauty and wellness brands.</p>
<p>Swiftarc started in 2019 and this is its fourth fund, Sid Jawahar, founder and managing partner told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We are being socially conscious and deliberate in solving the funding issue for female founders and diverse founders,” he said. “We took a hard look around Black Lives Matter and other awakenings and made the decision to be deliberate in trying to right an industry wrong.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Swiftarc itself is matching this by aiming for its firm’s employee base to be 50% diverse by 2022, Jawahar added.</p>
<p>He feels the beauty industry is stuck in time, where 75% to 80% of sales are still made from wholesale. E-commerce and digitally native brands are just the tip of the iceberg, he said. What has changed is the emphasis on inclusive beauty, with buyers of diverse backgrounds becoming majority purchasers. In addition, it is now not just about the brand, but building a community in order to be successful, Jawahar said.</p>
<p>That’s why Swiftarc brought in Fabian Urquijo, president, whose background is in P&amp;G and Revlon, to lead the firm’s beauty efforts.</p>
<p>“While at Revlon, we saw that independent brands that were digitally native could address unmet needs with personalization that the legacy brands can’t address,” Urquijo said. “Most of their growth is driven by that, and they end up being acquired by the big brands and continue to lead that growth.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The fund will target categories including clean and sustainable beauty, science-backed beauty products, technology-enabled and community-driven beauty and gender-neutral and inclusive brands.</p>
<p>Jawahar anticipates funding five to seven companies so that Swiftarc can provide the right kind of expertise to the companies, but could increase that to 10. The firm already invested in Alleyoop, a makeup and skincare line for busy women.</p>
<p>The fund combines financing with mentorship, peer-to-peer networking opportunities and targeted training facilitated by an all-female Beauty Council that includes industry, investment and beauty startup executives providing unique and relevant perspectives to the women-led startups. The council committed to helping 100 to 200 female founders in their journey from key introductions to foundational expertise.</p>
<p>Swiftarc’s engagement director Leslie Wolfson is building the Beauty Council and said she “wanted to curate a group of strong women with diverse backgrounds, career experiences and willingness to mentor and share their experiences and knowledge with founders.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">California-based Baffle, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startups/">startup</a> that aims to prevent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-breach/">data breaches</a> by keeping data encrypted from production through processing, has raised $20 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/baffle">Baffle</a> was founded in 2015 to help thwart the increasing threats to enterprise assets in public and private clouds. Unlike many solutions that only encrypt data in-transit and at-rest, Baffle’s solution keeps data encrypted while it&#8217;s being processed by databases and applications through a &#8220;security mesh&#8221; that de-identifies sensitive data that it claims offers no performance impact to customers.</p>
<p>The startup says its goal is to make data breaches &#8220;irrelevant&#8221; by efficiently encrypting data wherever it may be, so that even if there is a security breach, the data will be unavailable and unusable by hackers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/encryption/">encryption</a> is misapplied, and quite frankly, doesn&#8217;t do anything to protect your data,&#8221; the startup claims. &#8220;The protection measures that are most commonly used do nothing to protect you against modern hacks and breaches.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baffle supports all major cloud platforms, including AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, and it’s currently used to protect more than 100 billion records in financial services, healthcare, retail, industrial IoT, and government, according to the startup. The company claims it stores records belonging to the top 5 global financial services companies and five of the top 25 global companies.</p>
<p>“Securing IT infrastructure—networks, devices, databases, lakes and warehouses—is never complete. Constant change makes it impossible to adopt a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/zero-trust/">zero trust</a> security posture without protecting the data itself,” said Ameesh Divatia, co-founder and CEO of Baffle.</p>
<p>The startup’s Series B funding round, which comes more than three years after it secured closed $6M in Series A financing, was led by new investor Celesta Capital with contributions from National Grid Partners, Lytical Ventures and Nepenthe Capital, and brings the startup’s total funding to date to $36.5 million.</p>
<p>Baffle, which says it has seen threefold revenue growth over the past year, tells TechCrunch that the funds will be used to help it grow to meet market demand and to invest further in product development. It also plans to double its headcount from 25 to 50 employees over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>“With this investment, we can meet market demand for data-centric cloud data protection that enables responsible digital information sharing and breaks the cycle of continuous data and privacy breaches,” Divatia added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you injure your elbow, surgery can help. If you lose a leg, prostheses are available. But problems within the brain are more difficult to treat, and for stroke victims rehabilitation is largely left to the body&#8217;s own repair mechanisms. BrainQ aims to change that with a device that stimulates the damaged part of the brain and promotes self-repair, showing enough improvement in studies to warrant a Breakthrough Device certification from the FDA — and the company has just raised $40M to take it to market.</p>
<p>It should be said at the outset that doubting the efficacy of some brainwave-emitting miracle device is natural. And in fact when I spoke with BrainQ&#8217;s founder Yotam Drechsler, he reminded me of the last time we&#8217;d talked — back in 2017, at which time I &#8220;expressed strong skepticism.&#8221;</p>
<p>No hard feelings — the tech was largely notional then, he admitted — but since that time the team has continued its work, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/15/brainq-raises-5-3m-to-treat-neurological-disorders-with-the-help-of-ai/">raised some money</a>, and what was a promising if not well supported thesis then has turned into one backed by firsthand data and clinical outcomes. The resulting system could be the biggest improvement to stroke therapy in decades or more.</p>
<p>Strokes can result in various obvious impairments, such as grip strength or coordination, but of course the injury is not to the hand or leg itself, it is to the networks in the brain that govern those parts. But medical science has no method for directly rebuilding those networks — the brain must do so on its own, in its own time.</p>
<p>To aid this, regular physical therapy and brain health checkups, sometimes for years on end, are used to in essence make sure the brain is still working on it and that the parts of the body don&#8217;t themselves fall into disrepair.</p>
<p>The most interesting improvements to this process in recent years have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/neofect-gamifies-stroke-rehabilitation/">added tech into the loop</a> to provide immediate feedback, such as that one&#8217;s balance is skewed to one side, and providing stimuli that aim to counteract that. But ultimately it&#8217;s still targeted physical therapy.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MedRhythms raises $25M to get patients back in tune after a stroke&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/medrhythms-raises-25m-to-get-patients-back-in-tune-after-a-stroke/embed/#?secret=KKCCJbQOdh" data-secret="KKCCJbQOdh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Drechsler and BrainQ see the problem a little differently. It&#8217;s not simply an injury but a disturbance to the brain&#8217;s carefully cultivated homeostasis, one which it has no means to counteract. He compared a stroke not to an analogous injury but to a baby born prematurely and whose body is not up to the task of heating itself. What do you do in such a case? You don&#8217;t attempt to &#8220;fix&#8221; the body so it can operate at lower temperatures, or supercharge the heat output — you just put the kid in an incubator, and everything proceeds as it should.</p>
<p>BrainQ&#8217;s device does something similar, making the brain operate better by changing its local environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We map the channels of healthy brains and non-healthy brains and compare them. Once we find these, we use a low-intensity magnetic field therapy to resonate in the brain and facilitate its endogenous recovery mechanisms,&#8221; explained Drechsler.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s been shown in other contexts that this type of stimulation can produce improved neuroplasticity — the capability of the central nervous system to reprogram itself. By narrowly targeting stroke-affected areas, BrainQ&#8217;s device promotes neuroplasticity in them, leading to expedited recovery.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not simply a matter of saying &#8220;the stroke affected the ventral half of the right occipital lobe, aim the magnets there.&#8221; The brain is a complicated system, and strokes affect networks, not just a given cubic centimeter. BrainQ has deployed machine learning and a large collection of data to better understand how to target those networks.</p>
<p>Without diving too deeply into how the brain operates, let it suffice to say that certain networks operate locally at very specific spectral signatures or frequencies as detected by EEG readings. The left hand and left foot may occupy the same region of the motor cortex, but the hand might operate at 22 Hz, while the foot operates at 24 Hz, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question is, how do you find these signatures?&#8221; asked Drechsler. As it&#8217;s somewhat difficult to explain, I asked him to put it in his own words after we spoke:</p>
<blockquote><p>The novelty of BrainQ’s investigational treatment lies in the data-driven method we have deployed in order to inform the ELF-EMF frequency parameters. In choosing these parameters, our aim is to select frequencies that characterize motor-related neural networks in the CNS, and are related to the disability a person experiences following a stroke or other neurological trauma. To achieve this, we have analyzed a large-scale amount of healthy and non-healthy individuals’ brainwaves (electrophysiology data). Our technology uses explanatory machine learning algorithms to observe the natural spectral characteristics and derive unique therapeutic insights. These are used by BrainQ’s technology to target the recovery of impaired networks.</p></blockquote>
<p>The device they&#8217;ve created to administer the treatment is unusual. Because it&#8217;s a whole-brain magnetic field generator, it has a rather bulky cylindrical headpiece , but the rest of it fits into a sort of back brace and hip pack. That&#8217;s because, unlike the more common magnetic brain imaging tech, MRI, the fields and currents involved are extremely small.</p>

<p>&#8220;We use very, very low intensity, about the same level as normal brain activity,&#8221; said Drechsler. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about creating an action potential or a jump in activity, it&#8217;s about creating the right conditions for the recovery mechanisms.&#8221;</p>
<p>The results of this stimulation were borne out in a small (25 patients) but decisive study due to be reviewed and published soon (<a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/str.52.suppl_1.P194">preprint abstract here</a>). Patients given the BrainQ treatment in addition to normal therapy saw hugely improved recovery evaluations, which look at metrics like improvements to balance and strength. 92 percent saw major improvements over just therapy and 80 percent achieved what could be called recovery (though this term is inexact).</p>
<p>Generally speaking the therapy would last for about an hour at a time, during which the patient would do various physical exercises while wearing the device, and they would need to be repeated five days a week for two months or so. The headset feeds the patient&#8217;s own patterns into BrainQ&#8217;s cloud-based service, which does the crunching and matching necessary to produce a tailored treatment pattern. It&#8217;s all run via tablet app, which can be operated by a caregiver (such as an outpatient nurse) or by using a built-in telemedicine platform.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cognixion&#8217;s brain-monitoring headset enables fluid communication for people with severe disabilities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/cognixions-brain-monitoring-headset-enables-fluid-communication-for-people-with-severe-disabilities/embed/#?secret=pfzf8J8W1h" data-secret="pfzf8J8W1h" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Drechsler said that this approach was poorly received early on, and not just by this reporter.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2017, we started to set the ground for a cloud-connected therapeutic device that can treat the patient wherever she or he is,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Back then no one was willing to even talk about treating patients outside the controlled environment of the hospital. Then in 2020 COVID came and everything changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that during the pandemic, many of those recovering from a stroke who would normally visit the hospital for regular care were (and some remain) unable to do so. A home-based therapy with low risk and potentially great outcomes would be of enormous benefit for thousands and thousands of people currently recovering from a stroke. And importantly, he notes, it doesn&#8217;t shift resources away from existing treatment plans, just improves their outcomes. (&#8220;We don&#8217;t move anybody&#8217;s cheese.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Here is where you would normally read something along the lines of &#8220;but it maybe five years before the FDA approves it for insurance and use.&#8221; But BrainQ recently received Breakthrough Device certification, an expedited approval process that, since just the beginning of this year, also confers qualification for coverage under Medicare. This means that conceivably, BrainQ could be shipping devices very soon — though still a year or two out.</p>
<p>Its next step, very prudently, is a larger scale study, towards which the company intends to devote a large portion of its recent fundraise, $40M led by Hanaco Ventures, with Dexcel Pharma and Peregrine Ventures participating.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason why we raised all this money is we are on the verge of a unique study with 12 sites,&#8221; Drechsler said. While he could not yet name the hospitals or research organizations they partnered with, he said they were basically the cream of the stroke rehabilitation crop and &#8220;really we couldn&#8217;t aspire for better than getting all these top sites in the same study. There&#8217;s this excitement that maybe something new is coming — in stroke recovery there has been almost no progress in the last two or three decades, and physical therapy has been the standard for two hundred years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without making any promises, he suggested that this line of inquiry could move medicine towards not just mitigating but <em>reversing</em> some disabilities, a feat the value of which can hardly be enumerated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was looking over my pitch decks from 2016,&#8221; Drechsler mused. &#8220;Early on as a CEO, you have big dreams. We heard a lot of skepticism early on in the process, but I was proud to see that many of those dreams have materialized.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Two housekeeping slash teasers &#8230;</p>
<p>Stay tuned this week for a series of articles on <strong>Nuro</strong> reported by investigative science and tech reporter Mark Harris with assistance from myself and our copy editorial team. This deep dive into Nuro is part of Extra Crunch&#8217;s flagship editorial offerings.</p>
<p>This so-called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec1/">EC-1 series</a> is designed to provide authoritative, deep analysis into a growth-stage company that not only offers a panoramic view of a specific business, but also teaches lessons learned from the veterans of these organizations, whether they be founders, sales leaders, product managers, software engineers, marketers or anyone else who contributed to the growth of a startup.</p>
<p>The goal, as EC-1 series editor Danny Crichton has written before, is to help TechCrunch readers understand the intricacies of building a company from as many angles as possible, while also getting situational intelligence on the best tech companies scaling up in the market today. The EC-1 takes its name from the Form S-1 filing that late-stage startups submit to the SEC as part of the IPO process.</p>
<p>Finally, I wasn&#8217;t able to attend <strong>Monterey Car Week</strong> this year (that&#8217;s me sighing deeply). Luckily, <strong>Tamara Warren</strong> was. Look out for her roundup of vehicles that stood out at this year&#8217;s event.</p>

<p>The <strong>North American Rideshare and Scooter Association</strong> released its 2020 State of the Industry report, so I thought I&#8217;d share some of the findings that jumped out at me. Seeing as how 2020 will forever be known as the year of Covid, the report also quantifies the impact of the pandemic on shared micromobility and demonstrates the industry&#8217;s response.</p>
<h3>An overview</h3>
<p>In 2020, around 224 cities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico had at least one bikeshare or e-scooter system and 72 had both. <strong>This is 22% fewer than in 2019</strong>. All 129 e-scooter systems are dockless and electric, while the 167 city bikeshare systems have a mix of docked, dockless, and hybrid systems.</p>
<p><strong>Other stats</strong>:</p>
<p>• 44% of cities with bikeshare systems have fleets that include e-bikes.<br />
• Larger cities tend to have more vehicles per system and more per capita.<br />
• Vehicle densities and utilization rates were higher in larger cities.</p>
<h3>Stickin&#8217; it to the car</h3>
<p>• 36% of shared micromobility trips replace a car trip<br />
• North Americans gained almost 12.2 million hours of additional physical activity through shared micromobility, by creating new trips and replacing motorized trips.<br />
• Shared micromobility trips offset approximately 29 million pounds of CO2 emissions by replacing auto trips.</p>
<h3>Money, money, moneyyyy</h3>
<p>A recent study conducted by Emory University found that e-scooter programs increased unplanned spending at quick service restaurants and food and beverage stores. The study found:<br />
• $921 per scooter of additional spending during the 6-month study period, and a 0.6% increase in total sales<br />
• Scooter systems employ about 5,000 people. That&#8217;s 1 person for every 30 scooters.</p>
<p>Operators top program costs were: Rebalancing and recharging; Vehicle maintenance and repair; Overhead costs (e.g. insurance, fees, etc.). Their revenues came mostly from: Sponsorships (28%); Per ride fees (26%); Fixed fees (18%); Subsidies (10%)</p>
<h3>Representation skews towards $$$</h3>
<p>Rider representation improved in 2020, however it still skews towards white men and women in higher economic brackets. People with HHI of $50,000 and up were over-represented. The most over-represented group made between $50,000 and $75,000.</p>
<p>People aged 25 to 44 were massively overrepresented, as were white people and men. Black, Latinos and women to be underrepresented but again, apparently it was worse in 2019.</p>
<p>On the workforce end of things, it looks like there&#8217;s at least some conversations about diversity happening.<br />
• 71% of operators stated that diversity is part of every hiring conversation.<br />
• 69% reported that women and people of color are represented at all levels of their organization.<br />
• 57% reported that staff is representative of the populations being served.<br />
• 55% reported that their staff have completed cultural competency or diversity training</p>
<h3>Becoming a part of the public transit ecosystem</h3>
<p>• 50% of riders reported that they use shared micromobility to connect to transit.<br />
• 16% of all shared micromobility trips were for the purpose of connecting to transit.<br />
• 71% of all docked bikeshare stations are within one block of another public transportation mode.</p>
<h2>Back to our scheduled programming</h2>
<p>Indian ridehailing service <strong>Ola</strong> invested a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/ola-to-invest-327-million-to-set-up-the-worlds-largest-scooter-factory-in-tamil-nadu/"> ton of money</a> last year into an e-scooter factory, and now those labors are <a href="https://www.zeebiz.com/automobile/photo-gallery-ola-electric-before-the-launch-date-check-these-details-on-ola-e-scooter-162459">coming to fruition</a>. Ola is set to launch its electric scooter on August 15th. It comes with some fancy features like reverse mode, 10 new colors (many of which are pastels) and smarter charging that is fully automated to charge without the need for card or cash.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re in India, the moped-sharing giant <strong>Bounce</strong> also has some news. The company said it has begun replacing its fleet of <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/bounce-to-manufacture-30000-e-scooters/article35838554.ece">30,000 petrol scooters</a> with electric scooters. It&#8217;s partnering with startup Chara, which makes &#8216;switched-reluctance motors,&#8217; so that it can make its own scooters in-house.</p>
<p>Finally, micromobility company <strong>Skip</strong> filed a petition for <a href="https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/e-scooter-company-skip-files-for-chapter-7-bankruptcy/604678/">Chapter 7 bankruptcy</a> last week, so it&#8217;s time to sell off its assets and pay its debts. Skip&#8217;s creditors are scheduled to meet on September 8 to go through the $10 to $50 million worth of liabilities and $50 to $100 million worth of assets. Helbiz, which is going public via SPAC this year, acquired Skip late last year as part of its own global expansion strategy. This is the first time (but maybe not the last) that we see a major scooter company file for bankruptcy.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>The public filings they just keep on comin&#8217; in 2021. The latest is <strong>Turo</strong>, the peer-to-peer car-sharing company.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/car-sharing-startup-turo-has-filed-confidentially-for-an-ipo/">initiated the confidential process</a> of filing for an initial public offering with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. That means we don&#8217;t have that data dump that the S-1 provides. We will have to wait.</p>
<p>The number of shares to be offered in the IPO and the price range have not yet been determined, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Turo is 11 years old now; it&#8217;s not really a startup any more. Its marketplace, which lets car owners post an ad to rent out their vehicle on its app and website, is available in more than 5,500 cities across three countries. Turo was in Germany after taking over Daimler AG&#8217;s car-sharing subsidiary Croove alongside an investment deal. Notably, we learned that the company is no longer in Germany.</p>
<p>Turo&#8217;s last big funding round was in July 2019 when investors put $250 million into the company. That Series E round pushed the company into unicorn status and &#8220;past the billion-dollar valuation mark.&#8221; CEO Andre Haddad said in a blog post. Turo followed that up with a $30 million extension round the following February, bringing its total funding to date to over $500 million.</p>
<p>Speaking of publicly traded companies &#8230;. <strong>Joby Aviation</strong> made its public debut, 12 years after JoeBen Bevirt founded the company at his ranch in the Santa Cruz mountains. The air taxi developer began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker symbol &#8220;JOBY,&#8221; after completing a merger with special purpose acquisition company Reinvent Technology Partners. Aria Alamalhodaei <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/joby-aviation-makes-its-public-trading-debut-on-the-nyse/">interviewed</a> Bevirt and Joby Executive Chairman Paul Sciarra about this moment and what&#8217;s coming next.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ambri</strong>, a battery tech startup based in Marlborough, Massachusetts, <a href="https://ambri.com/2021/08/ambri-inc-secures-140m-financing-for-battery-technology-for-daily-cycling-long-duration-energy-storage-applications/">raised $144 million</a> in funding led by strategic investors Reliance New Energy Solar, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited, Paulson &amp; Co. Inc. Ambri&#8217;s largest shareholder, Bill Gates as well as new investors, Fortistar, Goehring &amp; Rozencwajg Associates, Japan Energy Fund and others participated. The company said the money will be used to commercialize its technology and to build a domestic manufacturing facility.</p>
<p><strong>Anchor Yacht Rentals</strong>, a <a href="https://www.anchorrides.com/home">Tampa, Florida startup</a> that developed a platform to connect private yacht owners and licensed captains to riders, raised $2.5 million in seed financing led by Austin-based Silverton Partners. The company, founded in 2016, raised the capital to extend its presence across major U.S. and international travel markets.</p>

The news comes just a few weeks after the EV charging network operator announced the purchase of European charging software company has·to·be.</p>
<p><strong>Gopuff</strong>, the U.S. delivery app, acquired London-based on-demand grocery startup Dija, <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/gopuff-acquires-dija/">Sifted reported</a>. The terms were not disclosed.

<p>Welcome back to policy corner.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to start this week&#8217;s column off with a little wet blanket reminder. The obvious news is that the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill &#8212; the one that&#8217;s been in negotiations for months &#8212; passed. But, let&#8217;s not forget that it has passed the Senate and more work is required in the House before it can make it to <strong>President Joe Biden&#8217;s</strong> desk.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to take away from the historic passage, which was, as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/us/politics/infrastructure-bill-passes.html?referringSource=articleShare">New York Times notes</a>, &#8220;uncommonly bipartisan.&#8221; But House <strong>Speaker Nancy Pelosi</strong> and progressive Democrats have said that they will not take up the bill unless and until both parts of Congress complete a budget reconciliation process that could earmark up to $3.5 trillion on a slew of domestic programs aimed at expanding the federal safety net, that would be funded in part by tax hikes on high-earners and corporations.</p>
<p>And the budget proposal? It has zero support from Republicans, suggesting a long and arduous road ahead for both the infrastructure bill and the national budget.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re doing here isn&#8217;t easy,&#8221; <strong>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer</strong> (D-NY) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouZB6Raw88o&amp;ab_channel=ForbesBreakingNews">said Wednesday</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;ve labored for months and months to reach this point, and we have no illusions: maybe the hardest work is yet to come, but we are united in our desire to get it done.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the infrastructure bill did pass the Senate, it is very much a compromise, especially on the provisions related to transportation electrification. That&#8217;s why some House Democrats are eyeing the budget proposal as an alternative way to slip in some provisions that didn&#8217;t make it into the infrastructure bill. <strong>Rep. Debbie Dingell</strong> (D-Mich.), along with 27 other Democrats, <a href="https://debbiedingell.house.gov/uploadedfiles/210809_leadership_ev_charging_infrastructure.pdf">sent a letter</a> to Pelosi urging that the budget proposal include $85 billion for building out a national EV charging network. (The infrastructure bill earmarks $7.5 billion for EV charging.)</p>
<p>In other news, it looks like President Biden is contemplating setting a 2050 target for airlines to switch 100% to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hand-in-hand with possible incentives to help the industry make the transition. Commercial aviation is a notoriously difficult sector to decarbonize because, with today&#8217;s battery technology and energy density limits, the amount of batteries needed to get a Boeing 737 off the ground and across the Atlantic would far exceed the weight limits of the aircraft.</p>
<p>That leaves zero-emissions jet fuels. Some current aircraft models can accept a 50/50 blend of SAF and conventional fuel, but new aircrafts will need to be developed that can accept 100% SAF. Given that fuel is one of the highest costs for airlines, industry will likely lobby for substantial government support before endorsing a zero-emission mandate, even one that is non-binding.</p>

<p>Welp, earnings dominated this week, but there was other news too. Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Einride</strong> and Bridgestone partnered partnership that should be viewed as a data collaboration. Einride will collect new layers of safety and efficiency-related data from Bridgestone’s smart-sensing tires. Meanwhile, Bridgestone will use that data from Einride&#8217;s testing and operations to integrate its advanced mobility technologies into Einride’s onboard vehicle platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Kiwibot</strong>, the robotic sidewalk delivery startup, partnered with food services and facilities management giant Sodexo to bring its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/kiwibot-partners-with-hospitality-giant-sodexo-to-bring-food-delivery-robots-to-college-campuses/">robots to U.S. college campuses</a>. Starting this month, students and faculty at New Mexico State University, Loyola Marymount University and Gonzaga University are expected to have the option to order meals via robots from Sodexo-serviced locations on campuses.</p>
<p><strong>Motional</strong>, the autonomous vehicle company born out of a $4 billion joint venture with Aptiv and Hyundai, said it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/motional-to-begin-testing-autonomous-vehicles-in-la-as-part-of-california-expansion-plan/">expanding its presence in California</a> by opening a new operations facility in Los Angeles to support testing on public roads, hiring more engineers and adding an office in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The investment into the area follows a hiring spree that has pushed Motional&#8217;s total headcount to more than 1,000 people, an expansion into Seoul and its announcement last December to launch fully driverless robotaxi services in major U.S. cities in 2023 using the Lyft ride-hailing network.</p>
<p><strong>Starship Technologies</strong>, an autonomous delivery services company that, like Kiwibot, uses sidewalk robots, announced it will begin delivery service on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/starship-technologies-is-bringing-food-delivery-robots-to-four-more-us-college-campuses-this-year/">four additional college campuses</a> this fall, adding to the 20 campuses on which it already operates.</p>
<h3>Earnings time!</h3>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong>, the UK-based electric vehicle company, still has no revenue yet to speak of and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/arrival-is-on-track-to-begin-production-of-its-electric-bus-and-van-next-year/">earnings report reflects</a> the expenses associated with bringing a new vehicle to market. Arrival reported an EBITDA loss of €29 million ($34 million). Its adjusted EBITDA loss was €35 million ($41 million) which widened from the first quarter&#8217;s loss of €27 million ($31 million).</p>
<p>Capex came to €65 million ($76 million), primarily due to the costs of staff working on product development and other costs related to factory equipment. The company anticipates spending between €175 million to €225 million ($205 million to $264 million) on capex in the remainder of the year, an increase caused by expenses from the Bicester, U.K. microfactory and planned openings of other factories in South Carolina and one-off tooling costs.</p>
<p>Notably, the company said it was on track to meet planned product launch dates, but much will depend on whether or not the company can fulfill orders and turn letters of intent into sales &#8212; especially a crucial van order with UPS, which could bring in upwards of $1 billion in revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Hyzon Motors</strong>, the hydrogen-powered heavy-duty truck company, is another pre-revenue company that went public via a SPAC. The company reported a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/hyzon-motors-has-begun-shipping-hydrogen-fuel-cell-trucks-to-customers/">net loss for the second quarter</a> of $9.4 million, including $3.5 million in R&amp;D expenses. It had a negative adjusted EBITDA of $9.1 million. The company has $517 million in cash on hand, enough to reach free cash flow by 2024 without having to sell additional equity.</p>
<p>The company, which is banking on the $500 million injection of capital from the transaction and growing customer orders to take it to positive cash flow, said it is preparing to start its first customer trials in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Lordstown Motors </strong>reported a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/lordstown-will-deliver-its-endurance-truck-to-selected-early-customers-early-next-year/">net loss of $108 million</a>, a 13.7% improvement from the first quarter loss of $125 million. Its net losses are more than tenfold higher than the -$7.9 million it reported in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The company cut research and development spending by 17% from the previous quarter to $76.5 million and increased its capital expenditures to $121 million from $53 million in the first quarter. Lordstown also increased its capital expenditure guidance for the year, from $250 million to $275 million to a $375 million to $400 million range, a spike related to its need to prepay for equipment.</p>
<p>Executives at the beleaguered EV startup said they&#8217;re on track to begin production of its flagship electric truck Endurance, but only select customers will begin to receive vehicles early next year.</p>
<p><strong>Luminar</strong>, the lidar company, <a href="https://www.luminartech.com/luminar-reports-q2-2021-results-and-business-update/">reported $6.3 million in revenue</a>, a 19% increase compared to the prior quarter. The company reported a net loss of $36.8 million up from the $25.4 million in same period last year.  The newly public company did raise its full-year 2021 revenue guidance to $30 million to $33 million versus prior guidance of $25 to $30 million. a quick scan of their second-quarter earnings shows a company trying to grow — as its expanding operating losses illustrate.</p>
<p><strong>Vroom</strong>, the online car marketplace, reported a net loss of $65.8 million, which included $22.6 million in one-time, IPO-related costs, <a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/vrooms-net-loss-grows-q2-despite-threefold-revenue-increase">Automotive News reported</a>. Vroom went public in June 2020. Vroom did report higher revenue and vehicles sales.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Elon Musk</strong> publicly complained via tweet that Renesas and Bosch, two of the world&#8217;s biggest auto-chip suppliers, are hurting the Tesla&#8217;s production, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-12/tesla-s-musk-calls-renesas-and-bosch-s-chip-supply-problematic?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Polestar</strong> released pricing and other details on two new versions of its Polestar 2 electric vehicle, <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36108646/2022-polestar-2-front-wheel-drive-version-revealed/">Car and Driver reported</a>. A single-motor version will start at $47,200, and a dual-motor version will have a base price of $51,200, which is cheaper than  last year&#8217;s Launch Edition model. (I&#8217;m looking forward to trying these new variants out.)</p>
<h3>Flight</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Amazon’s</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/amazons-1-5-billion-u-s-air-cargo-hub-is-open-for-business/">$1.5 billion air cargo hub</a> in Northern Kentucky opened this past week, marking the latest effort by the e-commerce giant to connect a network of 40 sites and control all aspects of delivery as demand for speed and convenience accelerates.</p>
<p>The Amazon Air Hub operations, located at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, will be the center of its U.S. cargo network. Amazon said the U.S. hub will eventually operate a dozen flights per day and process millions of packages every week.</p>
<p><strong>Archer Aviation</strong> is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/archer-aviation-is-seeking-1b-in-damages-from-wisk-aero-as-legal-dispute-escalates/">seeking $1 billion in damages</a> from Wisk Aero, according to court filings, escalating the ongoing legal battle between the two air taxi rivals.</p>
<p>Wisk &#8220;deployed a knowingly false extra-judicial smear campaign that projected stand-alone defamatory statements about Archer to the world,&#8221; the filing says. On this basis, Archer claims that this &#8220;smear campaign&#8221; has negatively impacted its ability to access capital and has impaired business relationships, resulting in damages &#8220;likely to exceed $1 billion.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Misc. mobility</h3>
<p><strong>BlackBerry</strong> has partnered with Car IQ to bring a secure vehicle-based payment platform to the BlackBerry/AWS IVY ecosystem. The system helps create a &#8220;digital fingerprint&#8221; for the vehicle, according to the company and will connect to a bank&#8217;s payment network, validate, and pay for services such as fuel, tolls, parking, maintenance, along with other &#8220;wallet&#8221; capabilities.</p>
<p>Michigan&#8217;s <strong>Office of Future Mobility and Electrification</strong> and the <strong>Michigan Department of Transportation</strong> have partnered to provide grants to companies focused on mobility and electrification that are looking to deploy their technology in the state.</p>
<p>Grants are focused on &#8220;sustainable futures&#8221; aka electric vehicle adoption and charging infrastructure, &#8220;equitable futures,&#8221; which means affordable and reliable transportation options, and multimodal transportation. <a href="https://www.michiganbusiness.org/mobility-funding/?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=medc-mi-mobility-report-08-13-2021-nl&amp;mkt_tok=MzMxLVhSVy0zODcAAAF-37LgoInIBJ1QPeXV4NN9FqslyFcBzxueOQHAPThExHagjaBDcBgzKBwUflZcI0tMP3x9yQjAgi-Q569qWk-CNZ1a3DdUmk3KY9d5uoy8">Check out the process here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rapido, a bike taxi aggregator in India, said on Monday it has raised $52 million in a new financing round as the six-year-old startup looks to find space in a category dominated by Ola and Uber in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>The six-year-old startup’s new funding &#8212; Series C &#8212; was financed by Shell Ventures, Yamaha, Kunal Shah of CRED, Amarjit Singh Batra of Spotify India, and Positive Moves Consulting. Existing investors Pawan Munjal of Hero Group, Westbridge, Nexus Venture Partners and Everblue Management also participated in the round, which brings its to-date raise to over $130 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rapido.bike">Rapido</a> offers its two-wheeler service in about 100 Indian cities. The startup says it has amassed over 15 million customers and 1.5 million driver-partners who it calls captains. In recent years, the startup has also expanded in three-wheeler space, which it says recorded a growth of 4X since last year in 26 cities where it is operational, and hyperlocal delivery.</p>
<p>In a statement, the startup said its platform, which was hit by the coronavirus pandemic that prompted India to enforce lockdown in several states, has already seen an 85% recovery. The startup attributed growth in part to the growing e-commerce and hyperlocal delivery opportunities in India.</p>
<p>“Even though our product and business model are lucrative and have the potential to churn out an exceptional revenue, this fundraising indicates more of the investors’ confidence in us than the need for capital,” said Aravind Sanka, co-founder of Rapido, in a statement.</p>
<p>He said the startup hopes to expand to serve 50 million customers in the next 18 months. The startup plans to also deploy capital to broaden its technology stack &#8212; it&#8217;s looking to make strategic investments &#8212; and hire more people</p>
<p>The growth of Rapido follows a shift in India&#8217;s mobility market, where Uber and Ola flooded more than a million cabs in the past decade. In urban cities, two-wheelers and three-wheelers have proven more effective because they can zip through much faster in traffic and are more affordable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Both Ola and Uber have also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/ola-bike-150-cities-towns-india/">expanded to two-wheeler and three-wheeler categories</a> in recent years, inking partnerships with firms such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/17/ola-100-million-vogo/">Vogo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/uber-begins-trialing-e-bikes-and-bicycles-rides-in-india/">Yulu</a>. Ola has additionally expanded into manufacturing of electric vehicles. On Sunday, it launched its first electric scooter, called Ola S1, that is priced at 99,999 Indian rupees, or $1,350. The electric scooter offers a range of 121 kilometers (75 miles) on a complete charge.</p>

<p>I had spent the last several years focusing on Google’s business outside the U.S., and I honestly felt out of touch with the startup world. Beyond my goal of becoming a CEO of my own company, I had two other ambitions: I wanted to help build a great consumer service that would delight people (potentially in e-commerce) and I wanted to build further wealth for myself and my family.</p>
<p>To better evaluate my options, I made the decision to quit Google first and find a way to study the wider ecosystem of companies before choosing where to go. Resolved to give myself a “blank slate” before making a final choice, I left Google when I was three months pregnant and joined Accel Partners, a top Silicon Valley venture capital firm and an investor in my previous startup, in a temporary role as CEO-in-residence.</p>
<p>In the months that followed, I helped Accel evaluate investment opportunities across a wide variety of digital sectors, with a particular focus on e-commerce, taking the opportunity to study those companies I might join or think of starting from scratch.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">On Thursday, August 19 at 2 p.m. PDT/5 p.m. EDT/9 p.m. UTC</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Managing Editor Danny Crichton will interview Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, author of &#8220;Choose Possibility,&#8221; on Twitter Spaces.</p>
<hr />
<p>One of Accel’s key partners, Theresia Gouw, helped me brainstorm, joining my cadre of professional priests. We had known one another for over a decade (I originally met her as a young founder at Yodlee) and were at similar stages of our careers, so I knew she could identify personally with my career quandaries. Like me, Theresia was pregnant with her next child and at a similar life stage — yet another commonality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>While at Accel, I spent a disproportionate amount of time testing my macro thesis that online shopping was about to explode in new ways. I had seen the rise of e-tailers at Google (many of these companies, such as eBay and Amazon, were Google’s largest advertisers at the time), but many of the leading e-commerce sites like Amazon and Zappos still had a utilitarian feel to them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, new fashion and décor e-commerce sites such as Rent the Runway, Gilt, Houzz, Wayfair and One Kings Lane were popping up everywhere and growing rapidly. These sites sought to tap into a more aspirational and entertainment-oriented kind of shopping experience and move it online.</p>
<p>Expert investors like Accel and others were funding them, and my own observations suggested that this area would yield another big wave of online consumer growth. These lifestyle categories of shopping also appealed to me personally; I was the target customer for many of them.</p>
<p>I started to work on an idea for a new e-commerce service, a luxury version of eBay, while listening to the pitches of every e-commerce company that was looking for funding and talking to several that needed early-stage CEOs. I continued to listen to non-e-commerce pitches as well, simply to give myself a point of reference for evaluating online shopping opportunities.</p>
<p>At Yodlee and Google, I had been lucky enough to work with incredibly smart and talented people who shared my values, and I wanted to do the same at my next venture.</p>
<p>I wanted to work with great investors, too, and fortunately I had the ability either to work with Accel-funded companies, start my own or leverage other investor relationships I’d developed. I spent time with multiple company founders to try to discern who they were as leaders, in addition to what they were working on.</p>
<p>By this point in my career, I had a pretty clear idea of my own superpowers and values, so I looked to find companies that could make the most of my unique gifts and whose founders or senior leaders had strengths complementary to mine.</p>
<p>Specifically, I hoped to join a company with a very strong engineering and product management culture that needed a CEO with strategy, vision, business development, fundraising and team-building expertise. Applying these criteria, I turned down several opportunities at companies whose founders had skill sets too similar to mine, reasoning that this overlap might lead to conflict if I ever became CEO.</p>
<p>Finally, I used my time at Accel to think long and hard about the risks I would take in becoming a startup CEO and whether I could afford to fail. My biggest risk by far was ego- and reputation-related. Mindful of how precarious early-stage startups are, I feared that I would leave a successful role as a global executive only to suffer a very large and visible failure. But the more I thought about this, I faced this ego risk head-on and concluded that my reputation as an executive from Google would hopefully be strong enough to survive one failure if it came to that.</p>
<p>The personal risks of taking on a startup CEO role felt different but not greater than those associated with my job at Google. While I knew that serving as a first-time CEO while having another newborn at home (my son Kieran) would be immensely stressful, I would likely benefit from no longer traveling around the world for days and weeks on end and working across multiple time zones, as I had previously.</p>
<p>Last, I evaluated the financial risks of potential moves. Although my startup equity would have uncertain value for a long time, I judged this a risk worth taking, given how excited I’d feel to have more impact and responsibility as CEO. While I lost a large financial package in choosing to leave Google and switching to a startup salary, I could pay the bills at home while digging into my savings only slightly. Under these conditions, I was prepared to make the leap.</p>
<p>In early 2010, almost a year after I left Google, I finally found the right opportunity and decided to join fashion technology startup Polyvore as its full-time CEO. A precursor to Pinterest, Polyvore was based on the idea that women could “clip” online images to create fashion and décor idea boards digitally that were instantly “shoppable.”</p>
<p>Millions of young women (including influencers) were already using the service and loved it. The founding team was led by a rock star engineer, Pasha Sadri, along with three other product and technology folks he recruited from the likes of Yahoo and Google.</p>
<p>Pasha was known for his intelligence, and we had connected informally over the years for coffee, each time having great discussions about business strategy. In fact, Polyvore twice before had tried to recruit me to become its CEO, once when I was at Google and again when I departed that company in 2008. Back then, I’d spent a productive afternoon with the founding team, helping them think through their business model. I also knew Peter Fenton, one of Silicon Valley’s most successful investors and a leading funder of the company. Peter was the one who first introduced me to Polyvore and who continued afterward to passively court me.</p>
<p>Having spent so much time exploring my options from multiple angles, I was now poised to make a great decision. I felt convinced that e-commerce was starting its next wave of growth, and felt excited to be part of it.</p>
<p>Within that vision, Polyvore was among the companies best positioned to succeed, and I knew I could contribute in significant ways to building a service that would delight millions. I was impressed with the strengths of Polyvore’s founder and investors and anticipated that I would be able to complement their efforts nicely. Recognizing that my success as a startup CEO hinged on my relationships with the founder and board, I had also invested time to get to know them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I had faced my fear demons, taking financial risk but negotiating my offer aggressively to account for downside scenarios I imagined, and coming to grips with my ego risk. With all this work in place, I finally jumped.</p>
<p>After managing a multibillion-dollar profit and loss and leading a 2,000-person team at Google, I became the newly minted CEO of a 10-person fashion startup in February 2010.</p>
<p>As we tee up the bigger choices in our careers, we all face critical moments of decision. No choice we make will be perfect, and all the frameworks in the world won’t eliminate risk entirely. But we don’t need perfection or freedom from risk. We just need to take the next step.</p>
<p>By choosing thoughtfully, using all the tools at our disposal to maximize our upside and anticipate our downside, we can grasp the opportunities available to us while equipping ourselves to handle whatever challenges reality throws our way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello friends!</p>
<p>Lucas is still out for a few more days, so I&#8217;m filling in for him again on this week&#8217;s Week In Review. To recap: I&#8217;m Greg. I started at TC back when deciding who to put in your MySpace Top 8 was a very serious matter and being able to summon an Uber with a button press made people think you were a wizard from the future.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the news you might&#8217;ve missed this week, a heads up! Brian Heater&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/actuator/">much-loved robotics recap</a> is becoming a weekly newsletter and getting a fancy new name: Actuator. The official launch date is still kind of up in the air, but you can already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">sign up for it right here.</a></p>
<p>And now, the news you might&#8217;ve missed this week.</p>
<h2>The Big Thing</h2>
<p>Whether or not you&#8217;ve ever dabbled with Unity, you&#8217;ve almost certainly interacted with something <em>built</em> with Unity. It&#8217;s the 2D/3D engine that powers so, <em>so</em> many of the video games out there, regardless of what console or platform we&#8217;re talking about. Studios use it to make animated movies. Automakers use it to help design cars.</p>
<p>This week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/unity-to-acquire-parsec-in-its-biggest-acquisition-to-date/">Unity announced its intent to make a big acquisition</a> — its biggest to date, in fact — with the $320M purchase of Parsec. And while one company buying another is hardly rare news around these parts, a Unity Senior Vice President suggests that it could be the beginning of a bigger shift for the co.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s a Parsec? Besides <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/02/kessel-run-12-parsecs/">a unit of measurement that Star Wars fans love to argue about</a>.</p>
<p>Parsec started its life as a way to stream games from your powerful PC to your less powerful devices — or to your far away friends, allowing for long-distance multiplayer in games that otherwise didn&#8217;t support it. And it still works for that!</p>

<p>When the pandemic booted everyone out of the office, though, the company found that many of the features it had built for playing games remotely (like low latency streaming, support for input devices beyond keyboard/mouse, etc.) were also super important to the folks <em>building</em> games remotely. They embraced that newfound audience hard, quickly rolling out plans and features just for creative teams. The shift worked out well for them; the company went from raising $25M to being acquired for nearly 13x that in less than a year.</p>
<p>According to Unity SVP Marc Whitten, this is the beginning of Unity diving deeper into the cloud.</p>
<p>“I think you’re gonna see that Parsec is a great foundational block for a broad sort of cloud ambition that we have as a company,” he says. “You’re going to see a lot more from us in that particular regards.”</p>
<p>Even only considering what Parsec immediately brings to the table, there&#8217;s multiple potential paths to the cloud here. They could use Parsec to help Unity developers more easily add multiplayer to their games; they could use it to build a Stadia/Amazon Luna-style game streaming service that showcases Unity-powered games sans downloads; they could use it to offer up beefier hardware-in-the-cloud rentals to help smaller studios iterate more quickly or test on a wider range of devices.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you&#8217;re one of those aforementioned people using Parsec to game with friends from afar, don&#8217;t stress: The company says its free app isn&#8217;t going anywhere.</p>

<h2>Other Things</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/fortnite-ariana-grande-concert-metaverse/"><strong>Ariana Grande takes over Fortnite</strong></a></p>
<p>The book written about the evolution of Fortnite will be a wild one. It began its life as a moderately popular tower defense game. When it shifted gears into a free-to-play Battle Royale game, it exploded into one of the biggest games the world has ever seen. Now it&#8217;s a remarkable example of how a game can be a <em>place</em>, and what can be when a developer has absolute control over their game engine and might-as-well-be-endless money to throw into content creation. Example #2,138,413: this in-game Ariana Grande &#8220;concert&#8221; in which players dogfight a demon, ride rainbows, and dance alongside a skyscraper-sized Ariana. The YouTube replay <em>alone</em> has already been seen by millions.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/twitter-redesigns-website-with-new-font-less-clutter-and-high-contrast-features/"><strong>Twitter&#8217;s redesign</strong></a></p>
<p>Twitter overhauled its website this week&#8230; and, as it tends to go when you change the look/feel of a popular thing, there was some user backlash. This time it went beyond the usual &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the radius of the rounded corners&#8221; complaints, though, with some users complaining that the new font Twitter chose <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/twitters-new-font-chirp-is-apparently-giving-some-users-headaches/">gave them headaches</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/"><strong>Apple moves to clarify how its new child safety features work</strong></a></p>
<p>Last week Apple announced that it would be rolling out a set of features meant to keep kids safe: One alerting parents if a minor is sending or receiving explicit images over iMessage, and another that would automatically compare generated hashes of iCloud Photos to detect and flag users who were storing known child abuse images. While protecting kids is undeniably and universally a good thing, security researchers have raised concerns about the potential for misuse by governments to scan for things beyond abuse imagery. It&#8217;s said to have caused a bit of a dustup within Apple, with &#8220;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-apples-child-protection-features-spark-concern-within-its-own-ranks-2021-08-12/">more than 800 messages</a>&#8221; of back-and-forth posted by employees on the company&#8217;s internal Slack. The company has spent the last few days trying to clarify how the features will work, with Apple&#8217;s Craig Federighi <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-executive-defends-tools-to-fight-child-porn-acknowledges-privacy-backlash-11628859600">admitting that it &#8220;got jumbled pretty badly in terms of how things were understood&#8221;</a>.

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/oh-hey-xiaomi-has-its-own-creepy-robot-dog-now/"><strong>Xiaomi&#8217;s Robodog</strong></a></p>
<p>Boston Dynamics&#8217; Spot is no longer the only creepy dystopian robot dog in town. This week Xiaomi announced CyberDog, a four-legged bot meant to flex the company&#8217;s robo knowledge and serve as a platform for developers to build upon. Xiaomi says they&#8217;ll be selling them for around $1,500, with a catch: they&#8217;re only making a thousand of these, initially, and they&#8217;re only selling them to select &#8220;Xiaomi fans, engineers, and robotics enthusiasts.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/chris-saccas-lowercarbon-capital-has-raised-800-million-to-keep-unfcking-the-planet/"><strong>Lowercarbon raises $800M to &#8220;keep unf*cking the planet&#8221;</strong></a></p>
<p>Lowercarbon Capital, the climate-focused fund run by Chris and Crystal Sacca, raised $800M to pour into companies that are taking on the climate crisis. &#8220;It turns out that raising for a climate fund in the context of an unprecedented heatwave and from behind the thick clouds of fire smoke probably didn’t hurt,&#8221; writes Sacca. Can tech save the planet? TBD. But continuing to do nothing definitely won&#8217;t.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/fema-emergency-alert-system/"><strong>FEMA tests the U.S. emergency alert system</strong></a></p>
<p>If your phone was shouting about a test of the National Wireless Emergency System earlier this week, don&#8217;t panic: It was, in fact, just a test. Didn&#8217;t get it? Don&#8217;t panic about that, either — the test system is opt-in. If there&#8217;s an actual test, everyone will get it. Hopefully.</p>
