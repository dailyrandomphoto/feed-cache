										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BitSight, a startup that assesses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/bitsight-a-provider-of-security-ratings-raises-60m-at-a-valuation-of-around-600m/">the likelihood that an organization will be breached</a>, has received a $250 million investment from credit rating giant Moody’s, and acquired Israeli cyber risk assessment startup VisibleRisk for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>Boston-based BitSight says the investment from Moody’s, which has long warned that cyber risk can <a href="https://www.moodys.com/research/moodys-threat-of-cyber-risk-is-of-growing-importance-to--pr_339656">impact credit ratings</a>, will enable it to create a cybersecurity risk platform, while the credit ratings giant said it plans to make use of BitSight’s cyber risk data and research across its integrated risk assessment product offerings.</p>
<p>The investment values BitSight at $2.4 billion and makes Moody’s the largest shareholder in the company.</p>
<p>“Creating transparency and enabling trust is at the core of Moody’s mission,” Moody’s president and CEO Rob Fauber said in a statement. “BitSight is the leader in the cybersecurity ratings space, and together we will help market participants across disciplines better understand, measure, and manage their cyber risks and translate that to the risk of cyber loss.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BitSight&#8217;s purchase of VisibleRisk, a cyber risk ratings joint venture created by Moody’s and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/israels-team8-raises-104m-to-make-bigger-cybersecurity-bets/">Team8</a>, brings in-depth cyber risk assessment capabilities to BitSight&#8217;s platform, enabling the startup to better analyze and calculate an organization’s financial exposure to cyber risk. VisibleRisk, which has raised $25 million to date, says its so-called “cyber ratings” are based on cyber risk quantification, which allows companies to benchmark their cyber risk against those of their peers, and to better understand and manage the impact of cyber threats to their businesses.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bitsight">BitSight</a> will also create a risk solutions division focused on delivering a suite of critical solutions and analytics serving stakeholders including chief risk officers, C-suite executives, and boards of directors. This division will be led by VisibleRisk co-founder and CEO Derek Vadala, who previously headed up Moody&#8217;s cyber risk group.</p>
<p>Steve Harvey, president and CEO of BitSight, said the company&#8217;s partnership with Moody’s and its acquisition of VisibleRisk will expand its reach to &#8220;help customers manage cyber risk in an increasingly digital world.”</p>
<p>BitSight was founded in 2011 and has raised a total of $155 million in outside funding, most recently closing a $60 million Series D round led by Warburg Pincus. The startup has just shy of 500 employees and more than 2,300 global customers, including government agencies, insurers and asset managers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[It appears that Freshworks is pretty reasonably priced in its current range.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two major private tech companies announced IPO price ranges this morning, with Toast targeting a market value of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/toast-looks-toward-18b-valuation-in-upcoming-ipo/">nearly $18 billion</a> at the top end of its range and Freshworks <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001544522/000162828021018417/freshworkss-1a1.htm">looking to price</a> its equity between $28 and $32 per share. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/freshworks-aims-for-nearly-9-billion-valuation-in-us-ipo/">calculates</a> that the company would be worth around $8.9 billion at $32 per share, not employing a fully diluted share count.</p>
<p>Inclusive of shares represented by fully vested options and the like, Freshworks&#8217; valuation could reach $9.6 billion, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/86012/Customer-support-software-company-Freshworks-sets-terms-for-$855-million-IP">Renaissance Capital reports</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike Toast, with a revenue mix including four distinct products, Freshworks is a more straightforward software company. That means we can do much more interesting work to understand its valuation. So, this morning, let&#8217;s unpack how Freshworks is considering valuing itself in its IPO at its present range, look at some market comps, and come to a conclusion regarding whether or not we expect the unicorn to raise its valuation before it floats.</p>
<h2>Lies, damned lies and revenue multiples</h2>
<p>As a refresher, in the first half of 2021 (Q1 and Q2), Freshworks posted revenues of $168.9 million. That annualizes to $337.9 million, thanks to numerical rounding.</p>
<p>At a valuation of $9.6 billion &#8212; recall that simple IPO valuations for the company and lower share-price points from its IPO range generate <em>lower</em> valuations and therefore more <em>conservative</em> multiples than what we&#8217;ll be discussing here &#8212; Freshworks would be worth 28.4x its current revenue run rate, set during H1 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year at this time, SpotOn was on the brink of announcing a $60 million Series C funding round at a $625 million valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward to almost exactly one year later, and a lot has changed for the payments and software startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, SpotOn said it has closed on $300 million in Series E financing that values the company at $3.15 billion &#8212; more than 5x of its valuation at the time of its Series C round, and significantly higher than its $1.875 billion valuation in May (yes, just three and a half months ago) when it </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/spoton-raises-125m-in-a16z-led-series-d-triples-valuation-to-1-75b/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $125 million in a Series D funding event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) led both the Series D and E rounds for the company, which says it has seen 100% growth year over year and a tripling in revenue over the past 18 months. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing investors DST Global, 01 Advisors, Dragoneer Investment Group, Franklin</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Templeton and Mubadala Investment Company too doubled down on their investments in SpotOn, joining new backers Wellington Management and Coatue</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Management. Advisors Douglas Merritt, CEO of Splunk, and Mike Scarpelli, CFO of Snowflake, also made individual</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">investments as angels. With the new capital, SpotOn has raised $628 million since its inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest investment is being used to finance the acquisition of another company in the space &#8212; Appetize, a digital and mobile commerce payments platform for enterprises such as sports and entertainment venues, theme parks and zoos. SpotOn is paying $415 million in cash and stock for the Los Angeles-based company.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 key areas SaaS startups must address to scale infrastructure for the enterprise&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/4-key-areas-saas-startups-must-address-to-scale-infrastructure-for-the-enterprise/embed/#?secret=PGP8FDOipg" data-secret="PGP8FDOipg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its 2017 inception, SpotOn has been focused on providing software and payments technology to SMBs with an emphasis on restaurants and retail businesses. The acquisition of Appetize extends SpotOn’s reach to the enterprise space in a major way. Appetize will go to market as SpotOn and will work to grow its client base, which already includes an impressive list of companies and organizations including Live Nation, LSU, Dodger Stadium and Urban Air. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Appetize currently covers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">65% of all major league sports stadiums, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specializing in contactless payments, mobile ordering and menu management. So for example, when you’re ordering food at a game or concert, Appetize’s technology makes it easier to pay in a variety of contactless ways through point of sale (POS) devices, self-service kiosks, handheld devices, online ordering, mobile web and API integrations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpotOn is taking on the likes of Square in the payments space. But the company says its offering extends beyond traditional payment processing and point-of-sale software. Its platform aims to give SMBs the ability to run their businesses “from building a brand to taking payments and everything in between.” SpotOn’s goal is to be a “one-stop shop” by incorporating tools that include things such as custom website development, scheduling software, marketing, appointment scheduling, review management, analytics and digital loyalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combined company will have 1,600 employees &#8212; 1,300 from SpotOn and 300 from Appetize. SpotOn will now have over 500 employees on its product and technology team, according to co-founder and co-CEO Zach Hyman. It will also have clients in the tens of thousands, a number that SpotOn says is growing by “thousands more every month.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acquisition is not the first for SpotOn, which also acquired </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SeatNinja last year and Emagine in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in Appetize it saw a company that was complementary both in its go-to-market and tech stacks, and a “natural fit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;SMEs are going to benefit from the scalable tech that can grow with them, including things like kiosks and offline modes, and for the enterprise clients of Appetize, they&#8217;re going to be able to leverage products like sophisticated loyalty programs and extended marketing capabilities,” Hyman told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpotOn was not necessarily planning to raise another round so soon, Hyman added, but the opportunity came up to acquire Appetize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We spent a lot of time together, and it was too compelling to pass up,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Appetize &#8212; which has raised over $77 million over its lifetime, according to </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/appetize/company_financials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; too saw the combination as a logical one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was important to us to retain a stake in the business. We were not looking to cash out,” said Appetize CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Max Roper. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are deeply invested in growing the business together. It&#8217;s a big win for our team and our clients over the long term. This is a rocketship that we are excited to be on.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic only emphasized the need for more digital offerings from small businesses to enterprises alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There has been a high demand for our services and now as businesses are faced with a Covid resurgence, no one is closing down,” Hyman said. “So they see a responsibility to install the necessary technology to properly run their business.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the moves SpotOn has made, for example, is launching a vaccination alert system in its reservation management software platform to make it easier for consumers to confirm they are vaccinated for cities and states that have those requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, a16z </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Partner David George too was bullish on the idea of a combined company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told TechCrunch that the two companies fit together “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely nicely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It felt like a no-brainer for us to want to lead the round, and continue to support them,” George said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since first investing in SpotOn in May, the startup’s growth has “exceeded” a16z’s expectations, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When companies are growing as fast as it is organically, they don’t need to rely on acquisitions to fuel growth,” he said. “But the strategic rationale here is so strong, that the acquisition will only turbocharge what is already high growth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Series E capital is primarily funding the acquisition, SpotOn continues to double down on its product and technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is our time to shine and invest in the future with forward thinking technology,” Hyman told TechCrunch. “We’re thinking about things like how are consumers going to be ordering their beer at a Dodgers game in three years? Are they going to be standing in line for 25 minutes or are they going to be interacting and buying merchandise in other unique ways? Those are the things we’re looking to solve for.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This summer, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">launched</a> its live audio app and Clubhouse rival, Spotify Greenroom, with the promises of more programming to come in the months ahead to augment its then primarily user-generated live content. Today, the company is making good on that earlier commitment, with the launch of six new shows on Spotify Greenroom focused on pop culture and music, in addition to what Spotify calls &#8220;playlist-inspired shows&#8221; &#8212; meaning those that are inspired by Spotify&#8217;s own playlists.</p>
<p>This includes a new show based on the popular playlist Lorem, which launched in 2019, showcasing an eclectic mix of music that has included indie pop, R&amp;B, garage rock, hip-hop, and more, <a href="https://www.oswegonian.com/2020/03/12/spotify-drops-new-playlist-lorem-tailor-made-for-generation-z/">focused on a younger, Gen Z audience</a>. That playlist today has over 884,000 &#8220;likes&#8221; on Spotify and has <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/11/spotify-lorem-playlist-interview">risen to become</a> one of the places new artists are able to break through on the platform. Now, Lorem listeners will be connected to &#8220;Lorem Life,&#8221; a Spotify Greenroom show that will feature a mix of culture and discussions about music, the environment, sustainability, fashion, and space, Spotify says. The show is hosted by Gen Z influencers and TikTok stars, Dev Lemons and Max Motley, who will engage with other artists and influencers. It begins airing on Wednesday, September 15, at 9 PM ET.</p>
<p>Another new &#8220;playlist-inspired&#8221; show is &#8220;The Get Up LIVE.&#8221; If the name sounds familiar, it&#8217;s because &#8220;The Get Up&#8221; was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/spotify-takes-on-radio-with-its-own-daily-morning-show/">introduced last fall</a> as Spotify&#8217;s own take on a daily morning show by mixing music with talk radio-style content led by hosts who discuss the news, pop culture, entertainment, and other topics. To date, that content has not been provided as a live program, however. Instead, the show has been pre-recorded then made available as a playlist that gives listeners the feel of a daily FM radio show. Now, &#8220;The Get Up&#8217;s&#8221; co-hosts Kat Lazo and Xavier “X” Jernigan will record their show live on Greenroom, starting on Wednesday, Sept. 15 at 11 AM ET.</p>
<p>This odd time seems to contradict Spotify&#8217;s original intention of providing a show for those who commute to the office. But with the rise of remote work in the face of the unending pandemic, addressing the commuter audience may be of less interest, with the new program. However, Spotify tells us &#8220;The Get up LIVE&#8221; will be complementary to the daily show, which will still run as normal &#8212; that&#8217;s why it has a later airing.</p>
<p>Other new Greenroom shows include &#8220;A Gay in the Life,&#8221; hosted by the married couple, actor Garrett Clayton and writer and educator Blake Knight, who will discuss LGBTQIA+ news and issues (weekly, 8 PM ET, starting today); &#8220;Take a Seat,&#8221; hosted by Ben Mandelker and Ronnie Karam of the &#8220;Watch What Crappens&#8221; podcast, who will recap reality shows and dive into other pop culture fascinations (weekly, 10 PM ET, starting today); &#8220;The Movie Buff,&#8221; hosted by film buff and comedian Jon Gabrus, who will review and break down the latest hot movies (weekly, 11 PM ET, starting today); and &#8220;The Most Necessary: Live,&#8221; a complement to Spotify&#8217;s &#8220;Most Necessary&#8221; playlist, where host B.Dot will discuss up-and-comers in hip-hop (weekly, 9 PM ET, starting Tuesday).</p>
<p>In addition to the new programs, Deuxmoi’s show &#8220;Deux Me After Dark&#8221; will also air this evening (Sept. 13) at 9 PM ET to recap the red carpet looks and gossip from this year&#8217;s Met Gala alongside guest Hillary Kerr, co-founder of Who What Wear.</p>

<p>Greenrom is now available to listeners in over 135 global markets and has been quietly expanding with live audio from sports site and podcast network &#8220;The Ringer&#8221; as well as from artists like Pop Smoke, the company says. Other programs added include <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/20VLkbny6CtlSZe5g0YjPy?si=ehecYV8gRfGNwED64tkGeQ&amp;dl_branch=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/episode/20VLkbny6CtlSZe5g0YjPy?si%3DehecYV8gRfGNwED64tkGeQ%26dl_branch%3D1&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631632022228000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFjgmRT_WRpz2YA_Q-zjNd4LGrARg">Men In Blazers</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/53l2zgXZSsaCVlK5tKyqFC?si=9uceM4zDS1a29So04uVx6A&amp;dl_branch=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/episode/53l2zgXZSsaCVlK5tKyqFC?si%3D9uceM4zDS1a29So04uVx6A%26dl_branch%3D1&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631632022228000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEytE_tZx7H9AACTB8O6K0ahVdwSg">Deaux Me After Dark</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ZXjkGQVTOXUS1z3HpVEiX?si=LYxS02ZsRHiMLkGwK_-1Ew&amp;dl_branch=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ZXjkGQVTOXUS1z3HpVEiX?si%3DLYxS02ZsRHiMLkGwK_-1Ew%26dl_branch%3D1&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631632022228000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHebpYQRKFNfY1oshNrRnn4zBknNg">True Crime Rewind</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5BGCn3r17pIMPB3y2v6JBi?si=Xp6wkpOaRqO-NGAQ1oI5Fg&amp;dl_branch=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/episode/5BGCn3r17pIMPB3y2v6JBi?si%3DXp6wkpOaRqO-NGAQ1oI5Fg%26dl_branch%3D1&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631632022228000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF6exIRZjIYavDyytNGBFnF9A9RZg">Ask The Tarot</a>. Many of the shows are also being published on-demand after the live show ends.</p>
<p>The app had gotten off to a slower start this year, given its roots had been in sports talk live programming, which didn&#8217;t necessarily connect with Spotify&#8217;s music fans. Plus, it has faced growing competition from not only Clubhouse, which inspired its creation, but also other top social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Discord, and more. Without dedicated programs to garner user interest in yet another live audio app, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/spotifys-clubhouse-rival-greenroom-tops-140k-installs-on-ios-100k-on-android/">had only seen 141,000 new downloads</a> for Greenroom on iOS a little over a month after its launch, and fewer on Google Play. But Spotify&#8217;s long-term vision for the service was to more closely tie Greenroom to the music, artists, programs, and podcasts that were already available on its flagship music streaming app &#8212; and these new shows are an example of that plan in action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As if <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bostons-startup-market-is-more-than-setting-records-in-scorching-start-to-year/">the Boston startup market needed additional momentum</a>, it appears restaurant software startup Toast will dramatically bolster its valuation in its upcoming IPO.</p>
<p>For a city perhaps best known internationally for its hard tech and biotech efforts, to see Toast not only rebound from its early-pandemic layoffs to a public debut, but to target a valuation closer to $20 billion than $10 billion, is a coup.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001650164/000119312521270772/d166297ds1a.htm">new S-1/A filing</a> this morning, Toast indicated an early IPO range of between $30 and $33 per share, leading to a maximum fundraise of $825 million in its IPO. The company was last valued at $4.9 billion in early 2020, when Toast raised $400 million. The company is set to dramatically supersede that valuation mark thanks to expanding revenues and an especially strong second quarter.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995211 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Let&#8217;s dig into the company&#8217;s new IPO price range, calculate simple and fully diluted results, and see what we can learn from where Toast may price. Recall that the company has a mix of recurring software (SaaS) incomes as well as fintech revenue (payments, mostly). Its revenue mix is interesting, and how Toast prices could help us better understand how to value vertical SaaS startups that are pursuing a payments-and-SaaS business approach.</p>
<p>Into the filing!</p>
<h2>Toast&#8217;s IPO valuation</h2>
<p>Toast is selling 21,739,131 Class A shares in its IPO. They get one vote. Class B shares get 10. If you were considering buying into Toast&#8217;s IPO in hopes of having a say in its future, don&#8217;t. You won&#8217;t. The company&#8217;s IPO is really a method by which public-market investors can endorse the company&#8217;s current management group &#8212; or decline to buy any ownership at all.</p>
<p>Regardless of how we feel about corporate governance structures designed to eliminate the influence of common shareholders, Toast will have 499,332,681 shares outstanding after its IPO, or 502,593,550 if its underwriters choose to purchase their allotted greenshoe option.</p>
<p>At the company&#8217;s expected IPO price range of $30 to $33 per share, Toast is worth $14.98 billion at the low end, and $16.48 billion at the top. Inclusive of shares from its underwriters&#8217; option, Toast&#8217;s simple IPO valuation range expands from $15.08 billion at the bottom to $16.59 billion at the top.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When people talk about &#8220;online food delivery&#8221; services, chances are that they&#8217;ll think of the Uber Eats, Instacarts and Getirs of this world. But today a startup that&#8217;s tackling a different aspect of the market &#8212; addressing the supply chain that subsequently turns the wheels of the bigger food distribution machine &#8212; is announcing a big round of funding as it continues to grow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.grubmarket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GrubMarket</a>, which provides software and services that help link up and manage relationships between food suppliers and their customers &#8212; which can include wholesalers and other distributors, markets and supermarkets, delivery startups, restaurants, and consumers &#8212; has picked up $120 million in a Series E round of funding.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from a wide mix of investors. Liberty Street Funds, Walleye Capital, Japan Post Capital, Joseph Stone Capital, Pegasus Tech Ventures, Tech Pioneers Fund are among the new backers, who are being joined by existing investors Celtic House Asia Partners, INP Capital, Reimagined Ventures, Moringa Capital Management, and others, along with other unnamed participants</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2201464" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="459" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg 5103w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?resize=768,518 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?resize=680,459 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?resize=1536,1036 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?resize=2048,1381 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Xu-2021-Photo-3.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />Mike Xu, GrubMarket&#8217;s founder and CEO (pictured, above), tells me that the company is currently profitable in a big way. It&#8217;s now at a $1 billion annualized run-rate, having grown revenues 300% over last year, with some markets like New York growing even more (it went from less than $10 million ARR to $100 million+).</p>
<p>With operations currently in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Missouri, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington, and some 40 warehouses nationwide. GrubMarket had a pre-money valuation of over $1 billion, and now it will be looking to grow even more, both in terms of territory and in terms of tech, moving ahead in a market that is largely absent from competitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are still the first mover in this space,&#8221; Xu said when I asked him in an interview about rivals. &#8220;No one else is doing consolidation on the supply chain side as we are. We are trying to consolidate the American food supply chain through software technologies, while also trying to find the best solutions in this space.&#8221;</p>
<p>(And for some context, the $1 billion+ valuation is more than double GrubMarket&#8217;s valuation in October 2020, when it raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/grubmarket-raises-60m-at-a-500m-valuation-as-food-delivery-stays-center-stage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$60 million at a $500 million post-money valuation</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Longer term, the plan will be to look at an IPO provisionally filing the paperwork by summer 2022, Xu added.</p>
<p>GrubMarket got its start several years ago as one of many companies looking to provide a more efficient farm-to-table service. Tapping into a growing consumer interest in higher quality, and more traceable food, it saw an opportunity to build a platform to link up producers to the consumers, restaurants and grocery stores that were buying their products. (Grocery stores, incidentally, might be independent operations, or something much bigger: one of GrubMarket&#8217;s biggest customers is Whole Foods, which uses GrubMarket for produce supply in certain regions of the U.S. It is currently is the company&#8217;s biggest customer.)</p>
<p>As we wrote <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/grubmarket-raises-60m-at-a-500m-valuation-as-food-delivery-stays-center-stage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year</a>, GrubMarket &#8212; like many other grocery delivery services &#8212; found that the pandemic initially provided a big fillip, and a big rush of demand, from that consumer side of the business, as more people turned to internet-based ordering and delivery services to offset the fact that many stores were closed, or they simply wanted to curtail the amount of shopping they were doing in-person to slow the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>But fast forward to today, while the startup still serves consumers, this is currently not the primary part of its business. Instead, it&#8217;s B2B2C, serving companies that in turn serve consumers. Xu says that overall, demand from consumers has dropped off considerably compared to a year ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that restaurant re-openings have meant more people are dining out again and spending less time at home,&#8221; Xu said, &#8221; and also they can go back to physical grocery stores, so they are not as interested as they were before in buying raw ingredients online. I don&#8217;t want to offend other food tech companies, but I think many of them will be seeing the same. I think B2C is really going to slow down going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The opening for GrubMarket has been not just positioning itself as a middleman between producers and buyers, but to do so by way of technology and consolidating what has been a very regionalized and fragmented market up to now.</p>
<p>GrubMarket has snapped up no less than 40 companies in the last three years. While some of these have been to help it expand geographically (it made 10 acquisitions in the Los Angeles area alone), many have also been made to double down on technology.</p>
<p>These have included the likes of <a href="https://www.farmigo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Farmigo</a>, once a <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/farmigo-local-food-communities/?_ga=2.164545404.254421615.1631522567-209244718.1579131500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disrupt Battlefield contender</a> that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/13/farmigo-shuts-down-its-online-farmers-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pivoted</a> into becoming a software provider to CSAs (an area that GrubMarket sees a lot of opportunity), as well as software to help farms manage their business staffing, insurance and more: Pacific Farm Management is an example of the latter.</p>
<p>GrubMarket&#8217;s own in-house software, WholesaleWare, a cloud-based service for farmers and other food producers, saw its sales grow 3,500% over the last year, and it is now managing more than $4 billion in wholesale and retail activity across the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p class="p1">There will be obvious ways to extend what GrubHub does deeper into the needs of its customers on the purchasing end, but this is in many ways also a very crowded market. (And not just crowded, but crowded with big companies. Just today, Toast, the company that builds software for restaurants, <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210913/p12#a210913p12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed for a $717 million IPO</a> at potentially a $16.5 billion valuation.) So instead, GrubHub will continue to focus on what has been a more overlooked aspect, that of the suppliers.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I am focused on the food supply chain,&#8221; Xu said. &#8220;Operators in the food supply chain business most of the time don’t have any access to software and e-commerce technology. But we are not just a lightweight online ordering system. We do a lot of heavyweight lifting around inventory management, pricing and customer relations, and even HR management for wholesales and distributors.&#8221; That will also mean, longer term, that GrubMarket will likely also start to explore connected hardware to help those customers, too: robotics for picking and moving items are on that agenda, Xu said.</p>
<p>“GrubMarket has built a profitable, high-growth business underpinned by its best-in-class technology platform that’s reinventing how businesses access healthy, fresh foods,” said Jack Litowitz, director of strategic investments at Reimagined Ventures, in a statement. “We’re proud to support GrubMarket as it continues to expand into new regions and grow its WholesaleWare 2.0 software platform. At Reimagined Ventures, we always seek to invest in businesses that are disrupting inefficient industries in innovative ways. Mike Xu and the GrubMarket team have built one of these businesses. We’re excited to back their vision and work in making the food supply chain more efficient.”</p>
<p>&#8220;GrubMarket is transforming the trillion-dollar food distribution industry with unprecedented speed by implementing advanced digital solutions and operational discipline. The company&#8217;s scale, growth, and profitability are extraordinarily impressive. Pegasus is delighted and honored to be part of GrubMarket&#8217;s exciting journey ahead,&#8221; added Bill Reichert, partner at Pegasus Tech Ventures.</p>

Clint Barton (aka Hawkeye) just wants to spend Christmas with his family, but his enemies have other plans.</p>
<p>The series marks the return of Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. This time around, he has a new partner: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvels-avengers-kate-bishop-hawkeye-release-date-182816765.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Kate Bishop</a> (Hailee Steinfeld), the self-professed &#8220;world&#8217;s greatest archer.&#8221; <em>Hawkeye</em> is said to center on the relationship between the two toxophilites, with Clint training Kate to take over as Hawkeye, as the character does in the comics. There are hints of that passing of the torch in the trailer. It shows the pair meeting for the first time and forming a bond as they work together to battle some goons.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VYb3B1ETlk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>There are a few nods to other parts of the MCU here, including the existence of a Broadway musical about Steve Rogers (aka Captain America) and a tip of the cap toward the &#8220;masked vigilante&#8221; Hawkeye battled in <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. Something we <em>don&#8217;t </em>see in the trailer is an appearance by Florence Pugh, who made her MCU bow as assassin Yelena Belova in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/black%20widow" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Black Widow</ins></em></a><em> </em>this summer.

<p>In any case, you won&#8217;t have to wait too long to see what happens when Yelena, Clint and Kate encounter each other. The eight-episode first season of <em>Hawkeye</em>will debut on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hawkeye-disney-plus-november-24-premiere-155812908.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><ins>November 24th</ins></a> on Disney+.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://jumpcloud.com">JumpCloud</a>, the late-stage startup that is modernizing the notion of corporate directories in a cloud context, announced a $159 million Series F investment on a healthy $2.56 billion valuation today.</p>
<p>Sapphire Ventures led the round with new investors participating, including Owl Rock, Whale Rock Capital, Sands Capital and Endeavor Catalyst, along with existing investors General Atlantic, BlackRock and H.I.G. Growth Partners. The company has now raised almost $356 million with $259 million coming over the most recent two rounds.</p>
<p>JumpCloud CEO Rajat Bhargava says that investor interest in the company is driven by his belief that the directory structure is the center of an IT organization, especially as it relates to identity, and that includes mobile device management, single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, privileged access management and identity governance. He sees all these approaches coming together in the directory structure.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that those are all part of one core directory platform. So when you think of a directory very holistically and broadly, it is really about securely and frictionlessly connecting users and their identities to whatever they may need to access,&#8221; Bhargava told me.</p>
<p>They do this by going after SMBs and mid-market companies with a cloud product that simplifies the management of these complex systems. Jai Das, who is managing director at lead investor at Sapphire Ventures, believes that this part of the market was being mostly left out of directory services because of that complexity before JumpCloud and others attempted to fill the void.</p>
<p>&#8220;Large enterprises have put in place various directory and security solutions to solve these problems, but with large investments in tech outlays and IT support teams. SMBs and mid-sized enterprises don’t have the big budgets or large staff to replicate the large enterprise model,&#8221; Das said. He adds that developing for this market is a huge challenge because it requires &#8220;building a product with all of the features large enterprises require, plus it has to be easy to use, easy to deploy and not [be] terribly expensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the company is not revealing any revenue metrics, Bhargava did say that they have added 2,000 customers since we last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/jumpcloud-raises-75m-series-e-as-cloud-directory-service-thrives-during-pandemic/">spoke in November</a>, for a total of 5,000, and he said that the company should double head count by the end of the year from the 300 last November.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He also said that he has been making progress at building a diverse company, and one way he does that is just asking every hiring manager if they interviewed historically underrepresented candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;The simple act of just asking that question makes such a massive difference inside of an organization. We&#8217;ve encouraged all of our hiring managers to interview diverse candidates but we also, when there&#8217;s an offer about to be made or when they&#8217;re in the [interview] process, we are asking them did you talk to [diverse] candidates. And then if you didn&#8217;t, we&#8217;re going to ask you to go search for those folks [before making a hiring decision],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Bhargava didn&#8217;t want to talk about and IPO when we spoke last year, and not much changed this time around. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see. It&#8217;s just not part of what we&#8217;re worried about or focused on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He did indicate however, that with such a substantial amount of money on the balance sheet, he would consider some strategic acquisitions. &#8220;We will focus on M&amp;A and where it makes sense will integrate different components and teams into our business,&#8221; he said. With a tight labor market, that could be about adding engineering, as well as adding functionality to the platform, he said.</p>

<p>Vacation was good, and a big thanks to Mary Ann and Natasha &#8212; not to mention Grace and Chris! &#8212; for keeping things flowing while I mostly sat around reading books and playing video games. But enough being maudlin! To the news!</p>
<ul>
<li>Investors <a href="https://twitter.com/SamRo/status/1437373171892637697">are kinda thinking</a> that the run-up in stocks needs to take a breather. And that the reset could land between 5% and 10%, with another 10% of respondents expecting a correction of <em>more</em> than 10%. Yowza.</li>
<li>China <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3148556/alipay-operator-ant-group-create-separate-app-lending-business">may break up Ant</a>, keeping the pace of its regulatory deluge going as this week starts. And the Chinese government thinks that its country has <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-vows-consolidate-bloated-electric-040922526.html">too many EV companies</a>. If the market or central planning will wind up taking point on solving the &#8220;problem&#8221; is not clear.</li>
<li>The Apple v. Epic decision is still driving conversation.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber has lost another legal challenge in Europe over the employment status of drivers: The Court of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:5029&amp;showbutton=true&amp;keyword=uber">has ruled</a> that drivers for Uber are employed, rather than self-employed contractors.</p>
<p>The court also found drivers are covered by an existing collective labor agreement in the country &#8212; which pertains to taxi drivers &#8212; meaning<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Uber faces increased costs to comply with the agreement which sets pay requirements and covers benefits like sick pay. (And it may be liable</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> for paying driver back pay in some cases.)</span></p>
<p>The court also ordered Uber to pay €50,000 in costs.</p>
<p>The ride-hailing giant has some 4,000 drivers working on its platform in the Dutch capital.</p>
<p>The Amsterdam court rejected Uber&#8217;s customary defence that it&#8217;s just a technology platform that connects passengers with taxi service providers &#8212; finding instead that drivers are only self-employed &#8220;on paper&#8221;.</p>
<p>The judges highlighted the nature of the service being provided by drivers and the fact Uber exerts controls over how they can work and earn through its app and algorithms.</p>
<p>Europe&#8217;s top court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/blow-to-uber-in-europe-as-top-court-rules-its-a-transport-service/">already ruled</a> back in 2017 that Uber is a transport provider and must comply with local transport laws &#8212; so you&#8217;d be forgiven for déjà vu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Dutch lawsuit was filed by the national trade union center, FNV, last year &#8212; with the hearing kicking off at the end of June.</p>
<p>In a statement today, the FNV&#8217;s VP, Zakaria Boufangacha, said: &#8220;This statement shows what we have been saying for years: Uber is an employer and the drivers are employees, so Uber must adhere to the collective labor agreement for Taxi Transport. It is also a signal to The Hague that these types of constructions are illegal and that the law must therefore be enforced.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="nl" dir="ltr">Een grote overwinning voor de rechten van de Uber-chauffeurs. Uber is werkgever en de chauffeurs zijn medewerkers, dus vallen onder de taxi-cao, zegt de rechter vandaag. Dat betekent een beter loon en meer rechten voor de chauffeurs.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/WhpqeXZuVw">https://t.co/WhpqeXZuVw</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Uber has been contacted for a response to the ruling. At the time of writing the company had not responded &#8212; but, per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/dutch-court-rules-uber-drivers-are-employees-not-contractors-newspaper-2021-09-13/">Reuters</a>, Uber said it intends to appeal and &#8220;has no plans to employ drivers in the Netherlands&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Uber confirmed it is appealing, with a spokesperson saying: &#8220;Nothing will change for drivers who use the app, as we appeal this ruling.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maurits Schönfeld, Uber&#8217;s general manager for Northern Europe, added:  “We are disappointed with this decision because we know that the overwhelming majority of drivers wish to remain independent. Drivers don’t want to give up their freedom to choose if, when and where to work. In the interest of drivers, we will therefore appeal the court’s decision, whilst also continuing to improve platform work in the Netherlands.”</p>
<p>In the U.K., Uber lost a string of tribunal rulings over its employment classification over a number of years &#8212; going on to lose in front of the U.K. supreme court this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">February</a>.</p>
<p>Following that Uber said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">would treat drivers in the U.K. as workers</a>, although disputes remain (such as over its definition of working time). In <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57254962">May</a>, Uber also said it would recognize a U.K. trade union for the first time.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, however, the company continues to fight employment lawsuits &#8212; and to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu/">lobby European Union lawmakers</a> to deregulate platform work&#8230;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The EU has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">said it wants to find a way to improve platform work</a>. However it&#8217;s not yet clear what any pan-EU &#8220;reform&#8221; may look like. </span></p>
<p>The Commission has been contacted with questions on its platform work initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Digital labour platforms are clearly worried, evident through investing heavily on their lobbying power and throwing more resources on the EU level. These companies &#8212; including Uber of course &#8212; have also recently come together to create a new funding lobby group that is specifically targeting to influence policies on platform work,&#8221; said <a href="https://twitter.com/jilltoh">Jill Toh</a>, a PhD researcher in data rights at the University of Amsterdam, talking to TechCrunch after the Amsterdam ruling.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw how Uber wielded and amended laws in their Prop 22 campaign in California, and together with other companies in Europe, they&#8217;re attempting to do so again. It&#8217;s disheartening to see that the Commission in its two consultations on platform worker regulation has only been talking to tech companies and has held no meetings with trade unions or other platform work representatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of this is incredibly problematic and concerning especially if the EC consultations result in a directive on platform work. Overall, the wins in the courts are important for workers, but there remains the issue of corporate power and influence in Brussels, as well as the lack of public enforcement to these court decisions,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>A Commission spokeswoman told us its second-stage consultation on how to improve the working conditions for people working through digital labour platforms is still ongoing (until 15 September).</p>
<p>&#8220;Depending on the outcome of this consultation, the Commission intends to put forward a proposal by the end of this year,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aim of the second-stage consultation is to gather social partners&#8217; views on how to ensure that people working through platforms have decent working conditions, while supporting the sustainable growth of digital labour platforms in the EU. In this context, social partners are also consulted on the possible content of the EU-level initiative, in areas such as (but not only) facilitating employment status classification and access to labour and social protection rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spokeswoman added that the Commission is closely following developments in Member States and taking into account in its analytical work.</p>

The DoD wants to launch missions venturing beyond Earth orbit, and existing electric and solar spacecraft are neither suitable for that job nor suitable to smaller vehicles, the department&#8217;s Defense Innovation Unit said.</p>
<p>The nuclear propulsion system will ideally offer &#8220;high delta-V&#8221; (above 33ft/s) while scaling down to less than 2,000kg in dry mass (4,409lbs on Earth). On top of providing electricity for the payload, the technology will hopefully keep the spacecraft warm when in shadow and minimize radiation both on the ground and to other components. Responses are expected by September 23rd, with contracts handed out as quickly as 60 to 90 days afterward.</p>
<p>Officials acknowledged they were making the request as a matter of expediency. NASA and other agencies are already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/darpa-lockheed-martin-blue-origin-nuclear-spacecraft-100547792.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">developing or backing nuclear spacecraft</a>, but those won&#8217;t be ready for a long while. The DoD is hoping for a prototype within three to five years — this technology would serve as a stopgap that puts nuclear propulsion into service relatively quickly for near-term projects.</p>
<p>While the request didn&#8217;t provide clues as to what spacecraft were in the works, the focus on smaller spacecraft suggests it could involve probes, satellites or other vehicles with modest goals. You won&#8217;t see this power human trips to Mars. All the same, it&#8217;s clear the DoD is frustrated by the limitations of existing spacecraft engines and wants a fast track to more powerful designs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With supply chains under constant stress because of the pandemic, freight forwarding has become one of the hottest startup sectors in the last two years. Indeed, International freight forwarding is now a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1066803/freight-forwarding-market-size-worldwide/">$199 billion market</a>. And the evidence is mounting.</p>
<p>In November last year, digital freight forwarder Forto raises <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/digital-freight-forwarder-forto-raises-another-50m-in-round-led-by-inven-capital/">another $50M</a> in a round led by Inven Capital. In April this year, Nuvocargo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/nuvocargo-raises-12m-to-digitize-the-freight-logistics-industry/">raised</a> $12M to digitize the freight logistics industry. In May, Zencargo, with a freight forwarding platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/zencargo-raises-42m-to-expand-its-digital-first-freight-forwarding-platform-internationally/">raised</a> $42 million. In June, freight forwarder sennder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/freight-forwarder-sennder-raises-80m-at-a-1b-valuation/">raised</a> $80M at a $1B+ valuation. In July Freightify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/freightify-lands-2-5m-to-make-rate-management-easier-for-freight-forwarders/">landed</a> $2.5M to make rate management easier for freight forwarders.</p>
<p>And today, <a href="http://Vector.ai">Vector.ai</a>, which says it helps freight forwarders improve productivity via its AI platform, has raised $15 million in a Series A led by US VC Bessemer Venture Partners. It was joined by existing investors Dynamo Ventures and Episode 1. Bessemer’s investment is yet another sign that US VC continues to make incursions into the UK and European tech scene.</p>
<p>Vector now plans to accelerate its international expansion plans as an automated system for freight forwarders.</p>
<p>The problem it’s tackling is this: Freight forwarders lose time to repetitive administrative tasks as they execute shipments, such as hunting through customer emails etc, rather than concentrating on higher-value activities. Vector.ai says it’s machine learning platform can automate these tasks.</p>
<p>Its customers now include Fracht, EFL, NNR Global Logistics, The Scarbrough Group, Steam Logistics and Navia Freight, as well as other top-10 freight forwarders.</p>
<p>James Coombes, Co-Founder, and CEO of Vector.ai, commented: “Most employees within freight forwarders spend the majority of their time communicating with the 10-25 different entities that might be associated with a given shipment and coordinating freight movement and documentation. Communication usually runs through email and attachments… The volume of freight continues to rise globally – and with the <a href="https://www.export.org.uk/news/579204/Is-the-UK-being-disproportionately-impacted-by-soaring-freight-prices-due-to-Brexit-.htm">added burden of Brexit</a> and pandemic disruptions such as the recent port closure in China – freight forwarders are facing staffing shortages, steep wage increases, and shipping delays that continue to cost companies money in lost revenue and spoiled goods. They cannot afford to keep wasting time on low-level processing, which is why we created the technology to automate basic tasks.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mike Droesch, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, said: “Vector.ai is one of the early leaders in an emerging category of freight forwarding workflow automation and digitization tools. It has built an intuitive and industry-focused product – which is already winning over some of the largest freight forwarders.”</p>
<p>Vector competes with <a href="https://www.shipamax.com/">Shipamax</a> out of the UK which has raised $9.5M, <a href="https://rpalabs.com/">RPA Labs</a> out of the US which has raised $1.2M and <a href="http://slync.io">slync.io</a> also in the US which has raised $75.9M.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security operations teams face a daunting task these days, fending off malicious hackers and their increasingly sophisticated approaches to cracking into networks. That also represents a gap in the market: building tools to help those security teams do their jobs. Today, an Israeli startup called <a href="https://www.rezilion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rezilion</a> that is doing just that &#8212; building automation tools for DevSecOps, the area of IT that addresses the needs of security teams and the technical work that they need to do in their jobs &#8212; is announcing $30 million in funding.</p>
<p>Guggenheim Investments is leading the round with JVP and Kindred Capital also contributing. Rezilion said that unnamed executives from Google, Microsoft, CrowdStrike, IBM, Cisco, PayPal, JP Morgan Chase, Nasdaq, eBay, Symantec, RedHat, RSA and Tenable are also in the round. Previously, the company had raised $8 million.</p>
<p>Rezilion&#8217;s funding is coming on the back of strong initial growth for the startup in its first two years of operations.</p>
<p>Its customer base is made up of some of the world&#8217;s biggest companies, including two of the &#8220;Fortune 10&#8221; (the top 10 of the <a href="https://fortune.com/fortune500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortune 500</a>). CEO Liran Tancman, who co-founded Rezilion with CTO Shlomi Boutnaru, said that one of those two is one of the world&#8217;s biggest software companies, and the other is a major connected device vendor, but he declined to say which. (For the record, the top 10 includes Amazon, Apple, Alphabet/Google, Walmart and CVS.)</p>
<p>Tancman and Boutnaru had previously co-founded another security startup, CyActive, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/10/paypal-confirms-acquisition-of-cyactive-plans-to-open-new-security-hub-in-israel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by PayPal in 2015</a>; the pair worked there together until leaving to start Rezilion.</p>
<p>There are a lot of tools out in the market now to help automate different aspects of developer and security operations. Rezilion focuses on a specific part of DevSecOps: large businesses have over the years put in place a lot of processes that they need to follow to try to triage and make the most thorough efforts possible to detect security threats. Today, that might involve inspecting every single suspicious piece of activity to determine what the implications might be.</p>
<p>The problem is that with the volume of information coming in, taking the time to inspect and understand each piece of suspicious activity can put enormous strain on an organization: it&#8217;s time-consuming, and as it turns out, not the best use of that time because of the signal to noise ratio involved. Typically, each vulnerability can take 6-9 hours to properly investigate, Tancman said. &#8220;But usually about 70-80% of them are not exploitable,&#8221; meaning they may be bad for some, but not for this particular organization and the code it&#8217;s using today. That represents a very inefficient use of the security team&#8217;s time and energy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Eight of out ten patches tend to be a waste of time,&#8221; Tancman said of the approach that is typically made today. He believes that as its AI continues to grow and its knowledge and solution becomes more sophisticated, &#8220;it might soon be 9 out of 10.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rezilion has built a taxonomy and an AI-based system that essentially does that inspection work as a human would do: it spots any new, or suspicious, code, figures out what it is trying to do, and runs it against a company&#8217;s existing code and systems to see how and if it might actually be a threat to it or create further problems down the line. If it&#8217;s all good, it essentially whitelists the code. If not, it flags it to the team.</p>
<p>The stickiness of the product has come out of how Tancman and Boutnaru understand large enterprises, especially those heavy with technology stacks, operate these days in what has become a very challenging environment for cybersecurity teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are using us to accelerate their delivery processes while staying safe,&#8221; Tancman said. &#8220;They have strict compliance departments and have to adhere to certain standards,&#8221; in terms of the protocols they take around security work, he added. &#8220;They want to leverage DevOps to release that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Rezilion has generally won over customers in large part for simply understanding that culture and process and helping them work better within that: &#8220;Companies become users of our product because we showed them that, at a fraction of the effort, they can be more secure.&#8221; This has special resonance in the world of tech, although financial services, and other verticals that essentially leverage technology as a significant foundation for how they operate, are also among the startup&#8217;s user base.</p>
<p>Down the line, Rezilion plans to add remediation and mitigation into the mix to further extend what it can do with its automation tools, which is part of where the funding will be going, too, Boutnaru said. But he doesn&#8217;t believe it will ever replace the human in the equation altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will just focus them on the places where you need more human thinking,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re just removing the need for tedious work.&#8221;</p>
<p>In that grand tradition of enterprise automation, then, it will be interesting to watch which other automation-centric platforms might make a move into security alongside the other automation they are building. For now, Rezilion is forging out an interesting enough area for itself to get investors interested.</p>
<p>“Rezilion’s product suite is a game changer for security teams,” said Rusty Parks, senior MD of Guggenheim Investments, in a statement. “It creates a win-win, allowing companies to speed innovative products and features to market while enhancing their security posture. We believe Rezilion has created a truly compelling value proposition for security teams, one that greatly increases return on time while thoroughly protecting one’s core infrastructure.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.marginedge.com/">MarginEdge</a> announced Monday it raised $18 million in Series B funding to give restaurant operators a real-time view into their costs.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Bo Davis founded the company with Roy Phillips and Brian Mills in 2015. Both Davis and Phillips are veterans of the restaurant industry: Davis was previously the founder of conveyor belt sushi restaurant chain Wasabi, while Phillips was an executive at Bloomin Brands.</p>
<p>What they recognized with independent restaurants was that they struggled with workflow like invoices and tracking food costs and were either building internal tools to help them stay on top of things or were still operating with pen and paper or spreadsheets.</p>
<p>“We focused on building something our friends would like,” Davis told TechCrunch. “We spent three years on the product and worked with 20 restaurants to use the software and focus on getting it right instead of rushing to market.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bite Ninja scoops up pre-seed funding to reimagine restaurant working environments&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/bite-ninja-scoops-up-pre-seed-funding-to-reimagine-restaurant-working-environments/embed/#?secret=PJ8j9BAuJC" data-secret="PJ8j9BAuJC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>MarginEdge’s tool is a restaurant management app that works with a business’ point of sale to streamline inventory, cost-tracking, ordering and recipes to eliminate the paperwork. It also captures all invoices, receipts or bills and converts them to line-item details within 24 hours. It is designed for independent restaurant owners that have under 50 units, Davis said.</p>
<p>Since launching its app in 2018, the Virginia-based company is seeing its platform used in over 2,500 restaurants. It raised a Series A in 2019, then an A2 in 2020 and with the latest round, led by Schooner, has raised $25 million in total.</p>
<p>IGC Hospitality, which operates restaurant properties, is not only an investor, but is also a customer, said Jeffrey Brosi, founder and managing partner. The company was using some different technology platforms to manage inventory and sales, but was looking for something to manage its whole inventory process.</p>
<p>“Bo came in and did a presentation, and it was amazing,” Brosi added. “The biggest thing for us is [being] user friendly. MarginEdge also has great customer service. We’ve invested in a few companies in the hospitality industry, and know the pain points and what we want to fix. If it makes sense financially, we will invest. This was one pain point that we didn’t have, and Bo filled that void.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like all restaurants over the past 18 months, Davis said the global pandemic caused MarginEdge to step back and evaluate. Despite many restaurants going out of business, he credits his business taking off again to restaurants rethinking their processes.</p>
<p>“We were lucky enough to be in a good position with capital that we could keep our team,” he added. “Revenue decreased for the first time, but we grew 45% even with COVID and as of Q1 was seeing 200% annual growth.”</p>
<p>MarginEdge has over 400 employees and its platform processes 45,000 invoices a week. Davis intends to invest the new funding in building out the leadership team, product development, building new features for the back office and on data science, an area he just received an advanced degree in, he said.</p>
<p>The company is using benchmark data around sales, food costs and labor costs and would like to provide more insights to its customers as it relates to inflation, which affects all of those aspects, and as a result, the menu prices.</p>
<p>“A lot of it is using data to understand menu pricing and what other people are doing so you are not pricing yourself out of the market or operating on margins where you can’t survive,” Davis added. “It will be all about predicting rather than reporting. The two things in the kitchen that are hardest are the startup prep list and the inventory late at night, and we make both easier.”</p>

The California-based firm, which started its journey in India and rivals Salesforce, said it plans to sell 28.5 million shares at a price [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Freshworks <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1544522/000162828021018417/freshworkss-1a1.htm">disclosed</a> on Monday that it is aiming for a valuation of up to $9 billion in its US initial public offering in which it is hoping to raise over $800 million.</p>
<p>The California-based firm, which started its journey in India and rivals Salesforce, said it plans to sell 28.5 million shares at a price range of $28 to $32. If the firm is able to sell its shares at the top range, it will raise $912 million. Freshworks had originally filed paperworks for its IPO in late August, but hadn&#8217;t disclosed several figures.</p>
<p>The 11-year-old firm was last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/freshworks-raises-150m-series-h-on-3-5b-valuation/">valued at $3.5 billion in a financing round in November 2019</a>. The startup considered raising a pre-IPO round earlier this year at a valuation of over $5 billion but decided against it, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Freshworks, which counts Accel, Sequoia Capital India, Tiger Global, and CapitalG among its existing investors, develops and offers a variety of business software tools, from CRM to help-desk software. In recent years, it has built enterprise SaaS platform to give customers a set of integrated business tools and aggressively pursued broadening its products offering.</p>
<p>The startup, which has applied to list its shares on Nasdaq under the symbol FRSH, serves over 50,000 customers and its revenue in the first six months of the year grew to $169 million, up from $111 million during the same period last year. At the same time, its net loss dropped to $9.8 million from $57 million a year ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, based on industry research from International Data Corporation (IDC), we believe we have a large addressable market of approximately $120 billion,&#8221; the firm said in an updated S-1 filing on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Second, based on our internal data and analysis, we estimate the annual potential market opportunity for our products to be $77 billion. [&#8230;] We expect our estimated market opportunity will continue to expand as customers onboard more or expand usage of our products, increasing the weighted average ARR per customer for use of our products.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch recently spoke with Freshworks co-founder and chief executive Girish Mathrubootham about the business. Mathrubootham is one of the most respected entrepreneurs in India. Along with three friends, Mathrubootham <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/high-profile-entrepreneurs-launch-85-million-fund-to-back-indian-saas-startups/">launched an $85 million venture fund</a> in late July this year to back early-stage SaaS startups in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company focuses on providing small to mid-size CPG companies with an automated way to manage their trade promotion in retail stores.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cresicor.ai/">Cresicor</a>, a consumer packaged goods trade management platform startup, raised $5.6 million in seed funding to further develop its tools for more accurate data and analytics.</p>
<p>The company, based remotely, focuses on small to midsize CPG companies, providing them with an automated way to manage their trade promotion, a process co-founder and CEO Alexander Whatley said is done primarily manually using spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Here’s what happens in a trade promotion: When a company wants to run a discount on one of their slower-selling items, the company has to spend money to do this — to have displays set up in a store or have that item on a certain shelf. If it works, more people will buy the item at the lower price point. Essentially, a trade promotion is the process of spending money to get more money in the future, Whatley told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GpgRCxoNsQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/whos-building-the-grocery-store-of-the-future/">Who&#8217;s building the grocery store of the future?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Who&#8217;s building the grocery store of the future?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/whos-building-the-grocery-store-of-the-future/embed/#?secret=GpgRCxoNsQ" data-secret="GpgRCxoNsQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Figuring out all of the trade promotions is a complicated process, Whatley explained. Companies receive data feeds on the promotions from several different places, revenue data from retailers, accounting source data to show how many units were shipped and then maybe data directly from retailers. All of that has to be matched against the promotion.</p>
<p>“No API is bringing this data back to brands, so our software helps to automate and track these manual processes so companies can do analytics to see how the promotions are doing,” he added. “It also helps the finance team understand expenses, including which are valid and those that are not.”</p>
<p>What certain companies spend on trade promotions can represent their second-largest cost behind manufacturing, and companies often end up reinvesting between 20% and 30% of their revenue into trade promotions, Whatley said. This is a big market, representing untapped growth, especially with U.S. <a href="https://www.revtrax.com/cpg-marketing-strategies-to-maximize-holiday-sales/">CPG sales topping $720 billion</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>“You can see how messy the whole industry is, which is why we have a bright future and huge TAM,” he added. “With this new funding, we can target other parts of the P&amp;L like supply chain and salaries. We also provide analytics for their strategy and where they should be spending it — which store, on which supply. By allocating resources the right way, companies typically see a 10% boost in sales as a result.”</p>
<p>Whatley started the company in 2017 with his brother, Daniel, Stuart Kennedy and Nikki McNeil while a Harvard undergrad. Since raising the funding back in February, the company has grown 2.5x in revenue, while employee headcount grew 4x over the past 12 months to 20.</p>
<p>Costanoa Ventures led the investment and was joined by Torch Capital and a group of angel investors including Fivestars CTO Matt Doka and Hu’s Kitchen CEO Mark Ramadan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>John Cowgill, partner at Costanoa, said though Cresicor raised a seed round, the company was already acquiring brands and capital before releasing a product and grew to almost a Series A company without any outside capital, saying it “blew me away.”</p>
<p>Cresicor is the “perfect example” of a company that Costanoa would get excited about — a vertical software company using data or machine learning to augment a pain point, Cowgill added.</p>
<p>“The CPG industry is in the middle of a rapid change where we see all of these emerging, digital native and mission-driven brands rapidly eating share from incumbents,” he added. “For the next generation of brands to compete, they have to win in trade promotion management. Cresicor’s opportunity to go beyond trade is significant. It is just a starting point to build a company that is the core enabler of great brands.”</p>
<p>The new funding will be used mainly to hire more talent in the areas of engineering and customer success so the company can hit its next benchmarks, Alexander Whatley said. He also intends to use the funding to acquire new brands and on software development. Cresicor boasts a list of customers including Perfect Snacks, Oatly and Hint Water.</p>
<p>The retail industry is valued at $5.5 trillion, and one-fifth of it is CPG, Whatley said. As a result, he has his eye on going after other verticals within CPG, like electronics and pet food, and then expanding into other areas.</p>
<p>“We are also going to work with enterprise companies — we see an opportunity to work with companies like P&amp;G and General Mills, and we also want to build an ecosystem around trade promotion and launch into other profit and loss areas,” Whatley said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Babyscripts can automate 40% to 50% of prenatal care and alert doctors as health problems occur so that both mother and baby are healthy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Obstetrics virtual care company <a href="https://babyscripts.com/">Babyscripts</a> raised $12 million in the first round of a Series B investment that will enable the company to accelerate the roll out of its virtual maternity care tool platform to providers.</p>
<p>MemorialCare Innovation Fund led the investment and was joined by Philips Ventures and the CU Healthcare Innovation Fund. The new round of funding gives Babyscripts around $26 million raised to date, Babyscripts co-founder and president Juan Pablo Segura told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>We last checked in on Washington, D.C-based Babyscripts two years ago when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/electronics-giant-philips-invests-in-monitoring-and-information-platform-for-expecting-mothers/">Phillips led a $6 million investment</a> into the company. A lot has happened since 2019, Segura said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wWVirPNCv6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/electronics-giant-philips-invests-in-monitoring-and-information-platform-for-expecting-mothers/">Electronics giant Philips invests in monitoring and information platform for expecting mothers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Electronics giant Philips invests in monitoring and information platform for expecting mothers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/electronics-giant-philips-invests-in-monitoring-and-information-platform-for-expecting-mothers/embed/#?secret=wWVirPNCv6" data-secret="wWVirPNCv6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At the time, the company had one product and was working with hospitals and healthcare providers to distribute a medical device and mobile app to expecting mothers for monitoring blood pressure and providing neonatal care information.</p>
<p>Today, the company has multiple kits that can be targeted to patients, including blood pressure monitoring, weight and captured blood sugars. Babyscripts can automate 40% to 50% of prenatal care and alert doctors as health problems occur so that both mother and baby are healthy. At one physician site, use of Babyscripts helped open up close to 1,000 appointments in a year so obstetricians there could focus on higher-risk patients, Segura said.</p>
<p>It also has larger population health focuses — driven mainly by the pandemic — to help higher-risk expecting mothers with remote patient monitoring and virtual care, as well as work to solve health inequity issues.</p>
<p>More than 70% of patients using Babyscripts are on Medicaid, which may be the only safety net provider in the patient’s geography, Segura said. As a result, the company began forming partnerships with public health departments, managed Medicaid plans and providers, like <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/leading_pregnancy_app_babyscripts_announces_collaboration_with_privia_health/prweb18102627.htm">Priva Health</a>, so that Babyscripts could be paid for at the local level.</p>
<p>“Right now, one of the biggest challenges for a pregnant patient on Medicaid and working an hourly job is asking moms to choose between prenatal care and putting food on the table,” he added. “Fifty percent of maternal complications can be avoided, but a lot of these issues come from the fact that the model of delivery care hasn’t changed in 40 years. About 12% to 15% of deaths come from blood pressure complications. If we could monitor via Babyscripts or more coordinated care to get intervention faster, we could eliminate massive swaths of delivery events in maternity and reduce mortality events in this country.”</p>
<p>Amid the pandemic, Babyscripts saw enrollments grow 10x. Segura decided to go after a new round of funding to meet that need and opportunities that could be addressed. Babyscripts’s program is now being used by 75 health systems in 32 states, and the company is monitoring 250,000 women each year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company continues to receive inquiries from markets and payers that are looking to do more for pregnant patients, so Segura wants to be able to grow to meet that demand and invest in a go-to-market strategy to get its kits into as many hands as possible.</p>
<p>The new funding will also enable the company to release new features. It recently launched a mental health product and is developing a substance use disorder experience amid others, he said. Babyscripts is also working on a national level with payers and is building an infrastructure around that as well.</p>
<p>The company has 45 employees currently, and Segura expects to double that in the next 12 to 18 months in the areas of product, payer growth, clinical expertise, implementation and customer success. Babyscripts is also working toward being available in all 50 states and bringing in more public health departments and payers as partners to get more health systems working together, he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Caleb Winder, managing director of MemorialCare Innovation Fund, said he was attracted to both Babyscripts’ outcomes data and addressing the high rates of complications in pregnancies. It also not only eliminates waiting for hours at the doctor’s office just to be seen for five minutes, but also closes some gaps in care, he added.</p>
<p>“One of the problems in this space is that providers, as much as they want to help, are stretched thin,” Winder said. “There are also access problems. Something like 50% of counties in this country lack one OB, so in-person care is difficult. Babyscripts can help patients anywhere be monitored and their health managed virtually. It can also alert a clinician when there is a real problem. We saw their data, for example, that showed preeclampsia was diagnosed 13 days faster than the standard of care.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Numan.com">Numan</a>, the European subscription service covering erectile dysfunction (ED) and men’s wellness/health needs more generally, has raised $40 million in a Series B funding round led by <a href="https://whitestarcapital.com/">White Star Capital</a>, with participation from existing investors Novator, Vostok New Global, Anthemis Exponential, Colle Capital, and new investor Hanwha Group. The new round will be used to fuel expansion.</p>
<p>Numan’s current roster of services cover ED, premature ejaculation, hair loss, gut and lung health, and nutritional deficiencies. But they can also do blood tests for general health needs which don’t require in-person appointments.</p>
<p>Post-pandemic, the digitization of health and wellness continues apace. Had we not had a pandemic, vitamins, and the like, delivered through the letterbox, would almost certainly have continued to grow steadily as a business. But with the pandemic, businesses that can speak to our health needs remotely have exploded.</p>
<p>Who would have considered taking a blood test remotely a ‘normal thing’ two years ago? Now it’s practically required. Into this space, wellness companies have uncovered an extremely lucrative nexus of trends: an aging male population with a desire to remain sexually active, increasing awareness of their own health, the convenience of subscription, and the imperative of the pandemic to keep things remote has proven to be a powerful combination of forces.</p>
<p>Numan is not alone in this space. Roman and Hims, for example, are two big players in the US. The open door Numan is pushing against is more this wider movement around male health, which men themselves are becoming more open to. As well as growing organically, Numan has also made two strategic acquisitions of companies in the UK and Sweden to expand its footprint. It’s likely this new round will lead to similar strategic plays.</p>
<p>With sexual health a tricky subject for men, digital services are stepping in to mitigate any embarrassment around having to sit in front of the family GP. Numan is also regulated by the Care Quality Commission as a registered healthcare provider, giving it a further stamp of approval.</p>
<p>Numan claims men now prefer its model to in-person healthcare meetings. In its own survey of 800 subscribers, 88% said that using the service has improved their confidence, while 68% say that using Numan has also improved their relationships, and over half said the effects of the pandemic had given them a more positive impression of using digital healthcare.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement Sokratis Papafloratos, CEO &amp; founder, Numan said: “This funding is a significant milestone on our journey to help millions of men be healthier. White Star Capital is one of the best investors in our space, and I’m delighted to be working together along with a wider team of brilliant investors.”</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, Papafloratos added that despite there being a lot of competition in the space “this is not a winner-takes-all-market. We have 25 languages on the team so we understand the market, patients, regulation, we understand it more in-depth than many competitors.”</p>
<p>Eric Martineau-Fortin, Founder and Managing Partner, White Star Capital: “Men’s health has been under-served by traditional services and needs innovative businesses to break down barriers and ensure taboos don’t prevent men from being happy and healthy. Numan’s digital offering helps men take charge of their health discreetly and decisively. We’re incredibly excited by Sokratis and his team, and look forward to working with them as they grow.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding startups that help manufacturers and sellers distribute products and merchants access them on a single platform keeps increasing across Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Cairo-based B2B e-commerce startup <a href="https://www.capiter.net/">Capiter</a> continues that trend by raising a $33 million Series A round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment was co-led by Quona Capital and MSA Capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other participating investors include Savola, Shorooq Partners, Foundation Ventures, Accion Venture Lab, and Derayah Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July 2020 by <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mahmoud-nouh-363a2b119">Mahmoud Nouh</a> and <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-nouh">Ahmed Nouh</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with TechCrunch, CEO Mahmoud Nouh says Capiter solves problems around reach and insights for suppliers and manufacturers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the manufacturers in Egypt today do not have the right infrastructure of the supply chain in place to reach merchants. Nouh says that manufacturers can only reach 30% of merchants in the market, but with Capiter, that number goes up between 80% to 100%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, a large portion of the manufacturers&#8217; end trade happens via traditional channels where there is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no transparency over data or market insights</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using machine learning, Capiter says it helps these manufacturers gain critical insights into the markets they serve, the products they sell, and how they fair with competition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then for merchants, Capiter attends to three problems. The first is the inconvenience merchants have to deal with engaging several suppliers to find the right product. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second is transparency which involves some back and forth between merchants and manufacturers on pricing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The third is that merchants often have little or no access to working capital to get the right product and the right time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Capiter, merchants can order products from FMCGs and wholesalers while the company delivers them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter also provides fair pricing and matching techniques that showcases a wide range of inventory for merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then it affords working capital to them to buy more products even when they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are strapped</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with cash. Capiter partners with local banks in Egypt and the Central Bank to perform this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter has over 12 merchant types on its platform, including mom-and-pop stores, hotels, restaurants, cafes, electronic shops, supermarkets, grocery shops, and catering companies, each with its own customized solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re able to get the data from the products they buy. So we offer them the best solution on what they should sell, at what time and peak seasons, including when are the offerings happening. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are customized</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solutions that we offer,&#8221; said Mahmoud Nouh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s revenues </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are derived</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from little margins on the products bought from manufacturers and sold to merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then on rebates for the suppliers and commission from the working capital provided to merchants. Capiter also makes money from providing market insights and data services to manufacturers and FMCGs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> B2B e-commerce platforms operate either asset-light, inventory-heavy models.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nouh tells me that Capiter chose to use a hybrid model &#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making deliveries without owning any trucks to ensure scalability and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">owning inventory, especially for high turnover products helping the company with high availability and better pricing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This way has enabled us to scale the business in a very fast manner and at the same time, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">efficiently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reliably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> warehouses and trucks, we don&#8217;t own them; we rent them. We deal with third-party logistics for transportation and we manage them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 50,000 merchants and 1,000 sellers use Capiter. According to CEO Nouh, the company has provided up to 6,000 SKUs. He also adds that the company is targeting an annualized revenue of $1 billion by next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re on a very good trajectory for achieving this,&#8221; he added. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team members, we have a team of more than 1000 people at the moment, including in warehouses, delivery, etc. So we&#8217;ve seen good traction across all board,&#8221; he answered when asked about Capiter&#8217;s traction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quona Capital, the co-lead investor in this round, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have made some B2B e-commerce bets over the past years, for instance, Kenya&#8217;s Sokowatch. The investment in Capiter adds to the firm&#8217;s portfolio in that regard and a growing presence in the MENA region being its first check made in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Quona co-founder and managing partner Monica Brand Engel said, “Capiter’s embedded finance model, combined with its expertise and strong user engagement, can have a dramatic impact on the financial lives of SMEs, helping them optimize their income which helps communities to thrive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“SME supply chain inefficiencies are massive throughout the Middle East. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the key blocker is the lack of working capital in the system. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter has built an asset-light way to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> retailers and suppliers and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> credit into the system through a comprehensive multi-product offering such as commerce, credit financing, digital payments, bookkeeping and inventory management for SMEs, leveraging on the ecosystem built by the local banks and financial institutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” adds Ben Harburg, partner at MSA Capital, a global VC that has invested in fintechs like Nubank and Klarna.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ahmed Nouh, the company&#8217;s COO, Capiter will expand into new verticals like agriculture and pharmaceutical offerings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-founder brings experience from the shipping and logistics space. Both he and Mahmoud are serial entrepreneurs. The latter&#8217;s journey is quite prominent, having worked in the mobility space as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the co-founder and COO of Egyptian ride-hailing company SWVL. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/egyptian-ride-sharing-company-swvl-plans-to-go-public-in-a-1-5b-spac-merger/">announced a potential SPAC deal valuing it at $1.5 billion</a> and is one of the few African startups breeding a tech mafia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ahmed Sabbah, another co-founder of the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/sequoia-leads-5m-pre-seed-in-egypts-1-month-old-digital-bank-telda/">now runs early-stage fintech startup Telda</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter has attracted a global team that brings together expertise from companies like Careem and Flipkart needed to achieve the company’s targets, said Mahmoud</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that the team, alongside the provision of financial services via partnerships with banks and its hybrid model, are ways the company stands out in a competitive market with the likes of Fatura, Bosta, and MaxAB</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this investment, the company plans to expand v</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ertically (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the buyer type) and geographically within the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to serve every single SME in the MENA region and expanding inside Egypt and globally.&#8221; He adds that Savola Group, one of its investors and the largest investor for FMCG products in the MENA region, will prove pivotal to this growth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter also plans to diversify its financial services offerings to include payments. </span></p>
