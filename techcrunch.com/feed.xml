										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/12/apple-boys-and-girls-clubs-team-up-to-offer-coding-opportunities-to-kids-teens/">partnered with Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America</a> to launch a new program that aims to bring coding opportunities to children and teens across the US. Using the tech giant&#8217;s &#8220;Everyone Can Code&#8221; curriculum, children and teens at local Boys &amp; Girls Clubs will integrate coding into their activities. Apple says the new collaboration will give students the chance to create and learn about the basics of app design and development. The program will focus on critical thinking and creative problem-solving.</p>
<p>The new program will initially launch in 10 new regions, including Atlanta; Austin, Texas; metro D.C.; Miami-Dade County, Florida; Wake County, North Carolina and Silicon Valley, with the goal of expanding coding opportunities to clubs nationwide. It has already launched in Atlantic City, New Jersey; Chicago; Detroit; Nashville, Tennessee and Newark, New Jersey.</p>

<p>“Together with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, we’ve already introduced thousands of students to innovative technology experiences, and we are thrilled to expand our partnership to bring coding with Swift to even more communities across the country,&#8221; said Lisa Jackson, Apple&#8217;s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/12/apple-boys-and-girls-clubs-team-up-to-offer-coding-opportunities-to-kids-teens/">press release</a> about the announcement.</p>
<p>This newest launch builds on Apple’s existing partnership with Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America through the company’s Community Education Initiative in support of its <a href="https://www.apple.com/racial-equity-justice-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Racial Equity and Justice Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s latest expansion of its &#8220;Everyone Can Code&#8221; curriculum comes two months after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/apple-launches-new-coding-guide-for-elementary-school-students/">rolled out </a>new resources for elementary school students, including a new “Everyone Can Code Early Learners” activity guide.  The recently launched guide extends Apple’s curriculum resources from kindergarten to college. The Everyone Can Code Early Learners guide allows students in kindergarten through third grade to build a foundation in core coding concepts through several subjects including music, art, science and physical education.</p>
<p>The company has been expanding its Everyone Can Code program over the years and making it available for more ages. In 2019, Apple launched a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/apple-expands-and-updates-its-everyone-can-code-program/"> program called Everyone Can Code Puzzles</a>, which aims to help students experiment with concepts. Last year, the tech giant<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/apple-expands-its-free-coding-courses-and-materials-for-educators/"> launched Everyone Can Code Adventures,</a> a program with more advanced coding activities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to saving the planet, <a href="https://twitter.com/rajil?lang=en">Raj Kapoor,</a> Lyft’s former chief strategy officer and head of business, doesn’t think asking consumers (or the government) to change their ways is an effective strategy. Instead, he and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshfelser/"> Josh Felser</a>, the co-founder of Freestyle Capital and a serial entrepreneur, are betting that the future of climate tech begins in the enterprise.</p>
<p>“What we&#8217;re seeing is that the enterprise is totally changing its behavior,” said Kapoor. “By the end of 2021, the fortune 500 will all have shared sustainability goals publicly and 65% of global GDP has committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.” Amazon, for example, is making efforts to have net-zero carbon operations by 2040 &#8211; and recently dipped back into its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/amazon-2b-climate-fund-invest-three-startups/"> $2 billion climate fund</a> to back fast-charging technology upstart for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>To capitalize on the awareness, Kapoor and Felser have spent the last year working on <a href="https://www.climactic.vc/">Climactic</a>, an early-stage venture capital firm that wants to invest explicitly in startups working to fix the climate from an enterprise angle. The investors have backed eleven companies to date, cutting $50,000 to $100,000 checks using personal money. They declined to comment on any fundraising plans, but at this point, Climactic has not filed any paperwork with the SEC indicating plans to raise a formal investment vehicle</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243547" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Climactic’s primary thesis is helping enterprises hit their net zero emissions goals, followed by an interest to back new consumer products that will not sacrifice value in pursuit of being better for the planet. Felser said that they’re looking for startups that help enterprises, as they become a “captive base of customers that have all publicly raised their hands and asked for help with the innovative technologies they need to meet their publicly started goals.”</p>
<p>Clean tech 1.0 was more about scientific innovation, led by scientists and academia, while clean tech 2.0, happening right now, is about entrepreneurs creating vehicles or software that is ready to go to market sooner, Kapoor said. The shift means that Climactic is keeping busy, investing in everything from technology hoping to measure and analyze carbon emissions, software that leads to more efficient supply chain and mobility tech for both transportation and goods.</p>
<p>“Just because it&#8217;s hard to quantify the impact of software on the planet does not mean we shouldn&#8217;t be funding it,&#8221; he said. “We can solve that problem, and software is going to help in this battle.”</p>
<p>Kapoor, who was also a managing director at Mayfield, left Lyft in April 2021 after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/">ride-hailing giant sold off its autonomous vehicle unit</a> to Toyota’s Woven Planet Holdings subsidiary for $550 million. Felser, meanwhile, launched an app #climate that aggregates the climate change actions from leading nonprofits and matches them with social media Influencers before eventually co-founding Freestyle Capital. The entrepreneurs eventually teamed up thanks to two catalysts: the planet dying, and the realization that nonprofits were not going to change the planet so there had to be a for-profit, sustainable solution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Background in mind, Kapoor admitted that Climactic expertise specific climate knowledge is “light” compared to the “OG climate investors.”</p>
<p>It’s good news, because Felser said that entrepreneurs are largely asking Climactic for enterprise sales, marketing, and pricing help; not nitty gritty explanations on the bounds of cellular meat commercialization. The firm has employed a number of consultants who have been former head of sales and marketing at other companies, leading to cross-pollination between scientists in charge of revolutionary technology, and people who are less in the weeds (and thus more equipped to help market it to the general public).</p>
<p>“We’re [bringing] a knowledge of sales, enterprise sales and marketing, product expertise, and general CEO coaching,” said Kapoor. “And that’s what’s missing from the climate venture community.”</p>
<p>Climactic is breaking out in a time when many are launching climate-tech focused funds, including Chris Sacca’s Lowercarbon Capital which just landed an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/chris-saccas-lowercarbon-capital-has-raised-800-million-to-keep-unfcking-the-planet/">$800 million fund</a>, 2150’s new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/2150-vc-hits-312m-for-fund-to-build-and-run-cities-greener-and-emit-vastly-less-co2/">$312 million fund</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/wavemaker-impact-launches-to-help-entrepreneurs-build-climate-tech-startups/">Wavemaker Impact’s launch.</a> Kapoor is a limited partner in VSC Ventures, a firm that similarly wants to help climate tech startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/vsc-startup-fund-climate/">hone in on storytelling through public relations guidance. </a>On the other side of the table, recently-public EV manufacturer Rivian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/rivian-raises-2-65-billion-in-new-capital-as-it-pushes-towards-production-of-its-electric-pickup/">raised $2.5 billion in one of the largest climate tech</a> deals of the quarter, and Redwood Materials, a battery startup launched by a Tesla co-founder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/">raised $700 million.</a></p>
<p>While a spotlight is positive for any nascent sector, climate tech investors must wade through greenwashing, deceptive marketing spin that says products are sustainable when they actually aren’t.</p>
<p>“The word sustainable is appearing in a lot of decks,” said Felser. The other day, he spoke to the CEO of a circular economy company that creates material for more durable clothing. “I looked at it and I’m like, ‘Wait, the source of the material is not sustainable, the manufacturing process is not sustainable…that feels like a sustainable marketing plan, not a sustainable company.” The offset world has similarly received a fair amount of criticism for startups that don’t have the right verification of offsets before selling to enterprises, another red flag that the co-founders are looking for.</p>
<p>The noise just means that Climactic’s first bets will face due diligence around impact, not claims. The bar hasn’t hurt the moonshots (literally): Climactic portfolio to date includes Orca Mobility, a compact autonomous delivery robot company, Rubi Labs, a service that turns carbon emissions into sustainable textiles and Muon Space, which is building multi-modal satellite remote sensing systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For now, we can still say that the number of people who&#8217;ve been to space is vanishingly small. But with the new pace at which Blue Origin is sending private citizens up, that might not be the case next decade. We&#8217;re excited to talk to one newly-minted private space explorer at our upcoming online <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TechCrunch Sessions: Space event</a> next week.</p>
<p>Dr. Chris Boshuizen has been to space, and he&#8217;s been there very recently — he was one of four passengers on board Blue Origin&#8217;s second ever human spaceflight, which took place on October 13, and which also carried TV&#8217;s Captain James T. Kirk, aka Canadian actor William Shatner.</p>
<p>Boshuizen is no stranger to the space business either, having co-founded Planet Labs before becoming a venture investor and now a partner at DCVC, where he invests in space companies and other frontier tech ventures. That&#8217;s why his perspective is super unique, given that he&#8217;ll be able to tell us not only about what it&#8217;s like to actual leave Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, but also tell us what he thinks about Blue Origin&#8217;s business and the space tourism industry in general.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243541" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">Tune in next week</a> to hear from one of only 574 people across all of human history who can talk about what it&#8217;s like to view Earth from space, and stay tuned for his unparalleled take on space startup and VC investing in this brave new era of space exploration.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15. Don’t miss the big value in our sponsored sessions. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets">Buy your pass right now</a> and get ready to take away mission-critical information to help you build a better business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lyft&#8217;s long-time CFO Brian Roberts, who took the company public, announced Monday that he was departing the ride share company that he joined in 2014 to take the same role at NFT marketplace OpenSea. Roberts had <a href="https://twitter.com/bkroberts/status/1467873287405514754?s=21">confirmed</a> earlier reports in a Twitter post</p>
<p>The departure is another signal of how executives and engineers are migrating from the &#8220;traditional&#8221; roster of big tech companies towards so-called Web3 crypto startups. OpenSea is one of several fast-rising startups in the crypto space, which has seen renewed attention from venture capitalists who have minted dozens of crypto unicorns in the past two years.</p>
<p>OpenSea has been the poster-child startup of the booming NFT industry. The startup raised at a $1.5 billion valuation this summer. The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nft-marketplace-opensea-offered-10-billion-valuation#:~:text=OpenSea%2C%20the%20most%20popular%20marketplace,direct%20knowledge%20of%20the%20matter.">reported</a> last month that OpenSea had received offers to raise at a $10 billion valuation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243519" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>NFTs have had a particularly hot 2021 and while many foresaw the boom earlier this year being followed by a chilly winter of inactivity, the alternative asset class has continued to enjoy builds and busts of enthusiasm while serving as a lightning rod of online conversation and speculation. After an extremely active fall, OpenSea&#8217;s business has cooled a bit, but the marketplace still saw almost $1.9 billion in transaction volume over the past 30 days across over 240k active crypto wallet addresses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook Gaming might not be a hot streaming destination like Twitch or YouTube Gaming, but the social network is steadily adding interactive features to build its appeal.</p>
<p>Facebook is trying out a new layer of interactivity the company is calling &#8220;play with streamer&#8221; that lets viewers hop into game streams with their favorite streaming personalities. The company is highlighting the feature with the launch of <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/pac-man-community-facebook-gaming/">Pac-Man Community</a>, a version of the classic that adds modern touches like multiplayer, user-generated mazes and viewer interactivity aiming to capture a bit of the magic of something like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/11/twitch-turns-twitch-plays-pokemon-into-a-native-ad-format/">Twitch Plays Pokemon</a>.</p>
<p>For games with the feature enabled, viewers can click a button to open the game directly and join in multiplayer mode. The game selection is very small for now, limited to the new Pac-Man game and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/worldsfrvr/">Worlds FRVR</a>, a Minecraft clone that quietly introduced the functionality in August.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243404" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Streamers have control over who gets the privilege and can dole it out as a perk to their most dedicated supporters, a key tool for creators building and connecting with gaming-based communities.</p>
<p>To make itself attractive as a hub friendly to emerging streamers, Facebook Gaming currently gives 100 percent of revenue to creators, but if that deal sounds too good to be true, it is: the offer expires in 2022.</p>
<p>In October, Facebook added a co-streaming feature to let creators collaborate with one another and stream simultaneously. It&#8217;s a feature that Twitch has had since back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/twitch-launches-a-four-person-squad-stream-feature-to-help-creators-get-discovered/">2019 in the form of &#8220;Squad Stream&#8221;</a> and a necessary one for building a vibrant streaming ecosystem.</p>

<p>Since the dawn of FarmVille, Facebook has hosted a stable of casual games that share little in common with Twitch&#8217;s most popular titles. While Facebook Gaming highlights streams from games like Fortnite and Call of Duty too, the company&#8217;s emphasis on mobile-friendly HTML5 games could lend the platform unique appeal beyond hardcore gamers. As streaming becomes even more mainstream, that could attract first-time viewers who probably wouldn&#8217;t find themselves on Twitch.</p>
<p>Twitch still commands the lion&#8217;s share of streaming hours watched. By the<a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-and-stream-hatchet-q4-live-streaming-industry-report-a898c98e73f1"> end of 2020</a>, the platform accounted for 66 percent of hours watched, with YouTube Gaming trailing with 23 percent and Facebook with 11 percent. But the latter two platforms are gaining ground — in 2020, Facebook Gaming tripled its number of streaming hours watched compared to the year prior while YouTube&#8217;s own numbers doubled.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Serve Robotics, the autonomous sidewalk delivery company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/uber-spins-out-delivery-robot-startup-as-serve-robotics/">spun out from Uber-owned Postmates in March</a>, has closed an expanded seed round at $13 million. The company will use the funds to accelerate its expansion plans into new customer segments and geographic areas, which will require them to build more sidewalk robots to fuel that growth.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal is to put robots in every major U.S. city in the next two to three years,&#8221; Ali Kashani, co-founder and CEO of Serve, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p>Uber participated in the round as a strategic investor, alongside Delivery Hero-backed DX Ventures, 7-Eleven&#8217;s corporate venture arm 7-Ventures and Wavemaker Partners&#8217; food automation-focused venture studio Wavemaker Labs. This round extends Serve&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/uber-spins-out-delivery-robot-startup-as-serve-robotics/">previous seed funding from March</a> and includes participation from existing investors like VC firms Neo and Western Technology Investment, as well as entrepreneur and angel investor Scott Banister.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242550" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Serve has been delivering to Postmates customers in multiple Los Angeles neighborhoods since 2018, when the startup was still &#8216;Postmates X&#8217;, the robotics division of the delivery platform. It started a commercial service in 2020 and its robots have completed tens of thousands of contactless deliveries from over 100 merchants in LA and San Francisco, according to the company. In November, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/serve-robotics-and-uber-expand-partnership-to-bring-robotic-delivery-to-uber-eats-301418245.html">Serve said it would be offering its on-demand robotic delivery service to Uber Eats</a> customers in LA early next year.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kashani said it made sense to bring on new strategic investors in advance of its Series A round, and these investors provide a hint of what&#8217;s to come for the startup next year.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re expanding beyond Uber Eats customers and Postmates customers, and we are going to increase the number of neighborhoods that we&#8217;re operating in LA next year, as well as going to new cities,&#8221; said Kashani. &#8220;7-Eleven and Delivery Hero have now invested into the company so hopefully we will share more about any collaborations that develop. There are a number of other partners that we are in discussions with right now whenever we are ready to share.&#8221;</p>
<p>Convenience store giant 7-Eleven is no stranger to autonomous delivery. The company recently began a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/nuro-7-eleven-autonomous-delivery-service-california/">small commercial delivery pilot with Nuro</a> using the company&#8217;s autonomous vehicles. The operator of 7-Eleven stores in Korea also began testing sidewalk delivery robots developed by local startup Neubility, and in 2016, 7-Eleven tested autonomous delivery in Reno, Nevada with drone company Flirtey. Delivery Hero has also experimented with sidewalk robots in the past, enlisting <a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/blog/lessons-one-year-robot-food-delivery/">Starship Technologies in 2018 to serve delivery company Foodora&#8217;s customers</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Serve Robotics has brought self-driving delivery to major U.S. cities and is leading the field of robotics with its cutting-edge autonomous technology,” said Brendon Blacker, partner at DX Ventures, in a statement. “This game-changing technology has the potential to reshape the future of delivery and we are investing in Ali’s vision and the world-class team he has assembled.” </span></p>
<p>Kashani said aside from the closing of its seed round, Serve has some upcoming news about advancements in its autonomy, but wouldn&#8217;t go into specifics. While some companies, like competitor<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/segway-makes-its-first-foray-into-sidewalk-robot-delivery-with-coco-partnership/"> Coco, which just signed a deal with Segway</a> to use the manufacturer&#8217;s robotics platform for its future vehicles, often tout the importance of having a human in the loop for autonomy, Serve aims to remove remote pilots from the equation as much as possible.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our robots can operate independently in autonomous mode most of the time,&#8221; said Kashani &#8220;This has very important implications for safety and economics of our operation, and is part of the reason we are able to commercially operate our fleet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have humans in the loop, the economics just won&#8217;t work, even if the remote operators are offshore, says Kashani. However, he admitted, relying on humans only doesn&#8217;t make sense if it&#8217;s a one-to-one relationship, as in, one person monitoring one robot at a time. As with Coco, the question with Serve then becomes, how can we improve our autonomy to the point that we can have multiple robots on the streets being supervised by one human at a time? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Robots need to have onboard capability to keep themselves safe when the network drops or when someone is about to make a mistake,&#8221; said Kashani. &#8220;We want people to watch the robots when they&#8217;re doing things like crossing the street, just because, from a safety point of view, this is when they&#8217;re interacting with cars. Sometimes the humans take over if the robot can&#8217;t figure it out, sometimes they don&#8217;t. Usually the robot makes an attempt to figure situations out by itself and then if it can&#8217;t, a person can step in, but part of it is because of the time it takes. You don&#8217;t want to wait if you&#8217;re on a timeline.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Sidewalk robot delivery is just starting to heat up as an industry, and with it will be a race among companies to come up with the most sophisticated technology and the best go-to-market strategy. With this round of funding, and its accompanying partners, Serve is already prepping for scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;7-Eleven represents convenience stores we could work with, Delivery Hero gives you a sense of delivery platforms we could work with,&#8221; Aduke Thelwell, head of communications at Serve, told TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;re certainly going to engage with restaurant chains and over time, there&#8217;s medical delivery, pharmacy, alcohol, cannabis, et cetera. So it is the gamut that you&#8217;d expect we&#8217;re going after in terms of partnerships.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. securities regulators have opened a probe into Tesla over allegations from a whistleblower that the company did not disclose to shareholders fire risks from its solar panel systems.</p>
<p>The allegations were made by Steven Henkes, a former Tesla employee, who filed his complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission back in 2019, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/exclusive-sec-probes-tesla-over-whistleblower-claims-solar-panel-defects-2021-12-06/">Reuters reported</a>. The probe only came to light after Henkes filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the commission, regarding the outcome of his original whistleblower allegations.</p>
<p>While the SEC did not provide any records to Henkes, it did confirm in a Sept. 24 letter that “the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing.” The SEC told TechCrunch that it &#8220;does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243525" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In his complaint, Henkes alleges that Tesla and SolarCity – its subsidiary that it acquired in 2016 – did not let customers know about defective electrical connectors that could cause fire.</p>
<p>Henkes was fired from Tesla in August 2020 after working for the company for nearly four-and-a-half years, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before his role was terminated, he was a field quality manager. He had also previously worked as a manager focused on quality development and planning for Toyota North America.</p>
<p>Henkes later sued Tesla for wrongful termination, claiming that his dismissal was in retaliation for raising safety concerns. According to his complaint, he notified Tesla about the fire risk prior to expressing his concerns to the SEC.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that issues regarding the safety of Tesla’s solar panels has come to light. In 2019, the automaker was sued by Walmart over allegations of breach of contract and gross negligence after rooftop solar panel systems on seven of the retailer&#8217;s stores allegedly caught fire. Walmart dropped the lawsuit after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/walmart-reaches-settlement-with-tesla-over-solar-panel-fires-drops-lawsuit/">reaching a settlement</a> with Tesla.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was also revealed by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-project-titan-replace-bad-solar-panel-parts-2019-8">Business Insider</a> that Tesla undertook a massive project, codenamed Project Titan, to replace faulty solar panel connectors.</p>
<p>Tesla is also facing a separate safety investigation from another federal regulator. The National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration is also investigating the automaker regarding incidents of crashes that took place when Tesla’s Autopilot advanced driver assistance system was engaged.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">There are plenty of barriers to entry for a career in cybersecurity &#8212; or so the workforce of today believes. At the (ISC)² Security Congress 2021 event,<a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/analysis/careers/cyber-careers-still-perceived-by-many-as-expensive-unattainable?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=SCUS_Newswire_%7B%7Bnow%7Cdate%3A%25Y%25m%25d%7D%7D&amp;hmSubId=%7B%7Bcontact.cms_id_encrypted%7D%7D&amp;email_hash=%7B%7Bcontact.email%7Cmd5%7D%7D&amp;mkt_tok=MTg4LVVOWi02NjAAAAGANvepq5q8nFWfYZKrsIMsSr802-_dTKBzCauG36fCU1lpNfFdYJj7DqX7kBcVs301UDH6bQgqBP6JIpm4oKCAhY3SiGT8fTMfmBjl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> panelists noted</a> that individuals are put off because they believe they need to have advanced technical abilities gained in further education.</p>
<p>Not only do such hurdles hinder equality, but they could also hamper an organization’s ability to defend against an attack.</p>
<p>There is a massive range of complex issues open to abuse by attackers. They don’t care how they gain access to an organization &#8212; just that they do. This ultra-pragmatic mindset liberates them and gives them purity of focus that transcends everything. Unbounded by factors such as group politics, gender, appearance, regulations, geographies and social standing, they don&#8217;t want a particular person for the job &#8212; they just want the best skills.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243290" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Take, for example, the dark markets where attackers scout for team members. Picking from an anonymized and globally dispersed talent pool, people are evaluated purely on capability. If someone with standing says you are the best malware distribution person, phisher or web app hacker, you get the job. No certificates required, no four-stage interviews to see if you have the same worldview as your colleagues &#8212; just a job.</p>
<p>This eliminates the subconscious hiring bias that counterparts on the defensive side of cyber are conditioned into. Education, certifications, years in the role, shared experiences: It is a puzzle made up of a vast number of pieces, many of which are largely irrelevant and limit the talent flowing into organizations to people who fit a certain “type.”</p>
<p>The way attackers work naturally breathes more diversity into their ranks. If the only qualification required is whether you can do the job, geography, economic background, gender, race and neurodiversity become non-issues.</p>
<p>This provides an edge. In cybersecurity, where success often relies on doing the unexpected, diversity of thought is a valuable weapon. If the defensive team is standardized, but the attack group is diverse, it has a larger pool of perspectives from which to draw.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Diversity as a defensive weapon</h2>
<p>For this reason, the need to attract new and different types of talent in cybersecurity is crucial. It surfaces new types of thinking, which, in turn, provides problem-solving skills that could help regain the competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Diversity in defense is about bringing together a wealth of different perspectives, solutions, experiences and ideas, all of which are absolutely vital to keeping ahead of threats. Ultimately, cybersecurity needs an approach to diversity that’s as pragmatic as the attackers &#8212; one that focuses on breadth of skills first and does away with long lists of expensive certifications and qualifications.</p>
<p>We all have different ways of looking at things, which has a significant impact on the way we react in times of crisis. Put simply, one person could fail to see a solution that’s glaringly obvious to another. Studies have shown that diversity has a huge<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/annapowers/2018/06/27/a-study-finds-that-diverse-companies-produce-19-more-revenue/?sh=1227d10b506f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> practical application</a> to problem-solving in the workplace, as it brings a wealth of different knowledge, skills and judgment to the table. When organizations have this breadth of knowledge and thinking in crisis scenarios, it gives them the upper hand to fend off the sophisticated attackers that make up today’s environment of threats.</p>
<h2>Prioritizing skills when hiring and retaining talent</h2>
<p>We need to remove the myth in cybersecurity that candidates must tick off a range of qualifications and certifications if they hope to enter the industry or advance their careers.</p>
<p>Aside from the fact that certifications are made obsolete very quickly by the pace of the threat landscape, they are also out of reach of many people. This introduces an artificial barrier to entry that undermines diversity in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Instead, why not copy the hackers? Hire based on the ability to do the job. Put candidates to the test to uncover unique problem-solving qualities and capabilities. Whether they have a piece of paper has no bearing on whether they can spot a vulnerable application at 50 paces.</p>
<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/research-how-companies-committed-to-diverse-hiring-still-fail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HBR research</a> suggests that unconscious biases underpin many hiring processes, pulling the wrong candidates into organizations’ recruiting funnels. This has to change because it holds defensive teams back by introducing the kind of flat approach to problem-solving that brings risk.</p>
<h2>Encouraging new and different talent to join — and stay in — the field</h2>
<p>As with many things in technology, new disruptive ways of thinking are required to address the problem. There is a need to instill platforms, funding, policies and processes that diversify the talent pool in cybersecurity, opening it up to as wide a range of backgrounds as possible.</p>
<p>Intelligence and law enforcement agencies are leading the way, keen to reclaim the edge from attackers. What started with the FBI grappling with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/d737mx/the-fbi-cant-find-hackers-that-dont-smoke-pot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether to hire hackers who smoke cannabis</a> in 2014 has turned into more formalized programs with open arms to diversity.</p>
<p>Organizations such as GCHQ, the U.K.’s signals intelligence agency, are leading the way by actively hiring neurodiverse individuals for their unique ability to spot patterns in data. As with anything in cyber, what starts in intelligence agencies has a knack of achieving mainstream adoption with those defending large corporations.</p>
<p>Those in cybersecurity need to recognize that diversity is about more than just equality. It is about optimizing defensive capabilities by having access to the widest possible range of problem-solving abilities. In a space defined by pragmatism, this means getting a head start on initiatives that measure and hire based on knowledge, skills and judgment &#8212; not pieces of paper.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">One of the toughest nuts to crack when it comes to developing carbon-free transportation is flying. Commercial electric planes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/we-wont-have-electric-airplanes-until-battery-tech-improves-160058357.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">won&#8217;t be feasible</a> until batteries become more powerful and lightweight. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hydrogen/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">Hydrogen-powered</a> flight is another possible way forward, and a research group has <a href="https://dft-newsroom.prgloo.com/news/government-backed-liquid-hydrogen-plane-paves-way-for-zero-emission-flight" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">revealed</a> what such a plane could look like.</p>
<p>The FlyZero project, which is led by the Aerospace Technology Institute and funded by the UK government, came up with a concept for a liquid hydrogen-powered midsize aircraft. It said the plane would be able to fly 279 passengers non-stop from London to San Francisco, or from London to Auckland, New Zealand with one stop for refueling. The aircraft, which has a 54-meter wingspan with two turbofan engines, would offer the &#8220;same speed and comfort as today’s aircraft&#8221; but with zero carbon emissions.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The ATI says its concept plane would have cryogenic fuel tanks in the rear fuselage, which would store hydrogen at -250 degrees Celsius (-418 degrees Farenheit). Two smaller &#8220;cheek&#8221; tanks along the forward fuselage would keep the plane balanced as fuel is used.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We&#8217;re years away from commercial hydrogen aircraft becoming a reality, though. The refueling infrastructure doesn&#8217;t exist yet and hydrogen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-06/u-k-showcases-hydrogen-powered-jetliner-concept?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=tech&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1">is more expensive</a> and difficult to store onboard than kerosene-based fuel. Those types of planes might not be too much of a pipe dream, however.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243507" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The ATI <a href="https://www.ati.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FlyZero-one-stop-global-connectivity-FINAL-3.12.21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1">expects</a> that, by the middle of the 2030s, efficient hydrogen planes might be a more economical option than current planes. That&#8217;s partly because other sectors are shifting toward hydrogen, which is likely to reduce supply costs.</p>
<p>The FlyZero project plans to publish more detailed findings early next year, including concepts for regional, narrowbody and midsize aircraft, economic and market reports, roadmaps for the required tech and a sustainability assessment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok has launched a new app for its seller community taking advantage of its suite of TikTok Shopping features, but the app is only available in Indonesia at present. TikTok Seller, as the app is called, allows TikTok&#8217;s seller community to run all aspects of their TikTok shop from their mobile device, from initially registering as a seller to managing inventory and orders to analyzing their online business, among other things.</p>
<p>The app also lets sellers register their campaigns and manage their promotions, engage in customer service, as well as access seller education materials, the app store listing explains.</p>
<p>The app was made available <a href="https://apps.apple.com/id/app/id1591003012">on iOS devices</a> as of December 3rd, but had launched on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=id&amp;id=com.tiktokshop.seller">Android</a> last month. According to data from Sensor Tower, the app is ranked No. 42 in Google Play&#8217;s Top Shopping category, and No. 5 in its Top New Shopping category. On iOS, the app is No. 52 in Shopping on the Indonesian App Store, per its app&#8217;s listing page.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243385" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>TikTok confirmed the app is launching in Indonesia where the company is running its TikTok Shopping pilot programs and continues to test a growing suite of commercial solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are always looking at ways to enhance our community&#8217;s experience and regularly test new features that inspire creativity, bring joy and innovate the TikTok experience,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson said. &#8220;Brands on TikTok have found a creative outlet to authentically connect with audiences, and we&#8217;re excited to experiment with new commerce opportunities that enable our community to discover and engage with what they love,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>Indonesia for some time has served as a test market for many of TikTok&#8217;s investments in its e-commerce business, thanks in part to the growing adoption of smartphones in the country and a hunger for online services catering to its mobile-first population. In 2020, around 64% of the country&#8217;s population was accessing the internet from their mobile phone, and that figure is expected to grow to 81% by 2026, per <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/558642/number-of-mobile-internet-user-in-indonesia/">Statista data</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this year, for example, TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/this-week-in-apps-sneak-peek-at-tiktok-shopping-new-ios-and-android-betas-kids-app-prodigy-hit-with-ftc-complaint/">launched</a> a &#8220;Seller University&#8221; <a href="https://seller-id.tiktok.com/university/home">website</a> aimed at its Indonesian audience, where it detailed how brands could advertise their products on videos and helped sellers get started on its app. The company confirmed at the time the site was one of many tests of its e-commerce solutions in Indonesia. Later in 2021, TikTok more formally introduced its suite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tiktok-expands-shopify-partnership-pilots-tiktok-shopping-in-us-uk-and-canada/">of TikTok Shopping tools</a>, allowing merchants to add a &#8220;Shopping&#8221; tab to their TikTok profiles and sync product catalogs to create mini-storefronts on the app. Shopify was a debut partner on this initiative in select markets, including the U.S., but TikTlok later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">expanded its range of partners</a> to include others like Square, Ecwid and PrestaShop, and more.</p>
<p>Today, sellers can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">highlight their products</a> in TikTok videos and direct users to product pages on their website. The newer LIVE shopping features allow brands and sellers to share dynamic links while streaming a live broadcast. And sellers have access to a handful of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">ad formats</a> for online shopping, which allow them to target users with personalized videos, generate leads, and offer swipeable product catalogs.</p>
<p>It makes sense, then, that the company would see a dedicated app as the next step in addressing the needs of its mobile selling community, particularly in a smartphone-heavy market like Indonesia.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no word on if or when TikTok will make its new dedicated Seller app available to other markets.</p>

<p>Deutsche Telekom, AlleyCorp and signals Venture Capital also participated as returning investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243427" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new financing follows Everphone&#8217;s $40M Series B, closed in summer 2020, as the 2016-founded startup reported an uplift in interest driven by the COVID-19-triggered remote working boom.</p>
<p>Everphone&#8217;s business takes care of the supply, support, repair/replacement and recycling of mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) for enterprises customers &#8212; billed under a per-user monthly subscription.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s a device rental model the startup touts as being more sustainable than alternative routes for provisioning mobile devices (such as buying devices outright) &#8212; arguing it saves environmental resource by baking in circularity from the start.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As well as taking care of its customers&#8217; hardware procurement needs &#8212; and the refurbishment/recycling/reuse of used mobile devices &#8212; Everphone bakes in MDM (mobile device management), touting reduced IT support costs as another perk of paying it to take the device strain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Over the past year it&#8217;s been expanding internationally &#8212; and says the new capital will go toward further internationalization in Europe and the US as it vies up to win more customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Series C funds will also go on increasing its headcount, spending on product development, and growing its active device fleet &#8212; which it says now numbers over 100,000 devices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting in a statement, Leonard Clemens, co-founder and managing partner at CGC, added: “We have been accompanying <span class="il">Everphone</span> for years and see great potential for a successful positioning as a partner for customers from the enterprise and SME sectors in Germany, Europe, and the USA. <span class="il">Everphone</span>&#8216;s <span class="il">one</span>-stop solution fits perfectly into our time of change enabling flexible working hours and, lately, hybrid location models. This makes <span class="il">Everphone</span> an enabler of New Work and, at the same time, implements sustainability with a significant contribution to the Circular Economy.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The larger context for SenseTime's debut is that it is going public after the Chinese government cracked down on a number of tech sectors in the country. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Here in the United States, we&#8217;re <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">counting down to the Nubank</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/hashicorps-ipo-filing-reveals-a-growing-business-but-at-a-slower-pace/">HashiCorp IPOs</a> that should touch down in mere days. But those are not the only technology offerings to keep eyes on at the moment. SenseTime, a Chinese AI company, is also listing this week, providing a new window into the value of the country&#8217;s upstart tech companies under a changed regulatory regime.</p>
<p>As Didi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/chinas-ride-hailing-giant-is-delisting-from-new-york/">looks to delist from U.S. markets</a> amid <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4472259-alibaba-baba-stock-possible-delisting">hubbub that Alibaba could do the same</a>, it&#8217;s not a surprise that SenseTime will list in Hong Kong and not the Nasdaq or NYSE.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Despite listing close to home, however, SenseTime is not having the best time possible in its public-market debut. The company&#8217;s IPO, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3158603/sensetime-shrinks-hong-kong-ipo-size-62-cent-us768-million">according to the South China Morning Post</a>, &#8220;plans to raise as much as HK$5.99 billion (US$768 million) by selling 1.5 billion shares at HK$3.85 to HK$3.99 each.&#8221; Raising three-quarters of a billion dollars is nothing to sneeze at, but at the same time is a far cry from the $2 billion that SenseTime wanted to raise.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s offering is expected to begin tomorrow, so expect to hear more about its listing over the coming day.</p>
<p>SenseTime could command a valuation of as much as $17 billion in its IPO, depending on its final price. Is that figure strong? And what can we learn from comparing the company&#8217;s miniaturized IPO to its operating results? Let&#8217;s dive into the numbers and see what we can find out.</p>
<h2>Fast, expensive growth</h2>
<p>SenseTime builds AI products. Or as it puts it in its <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/app/sehk/2021/103756/documents/sehk21082702575.pdf">IPO prospectus</a>, it has &#8220;built a first-of-its-kind universal AI infrastructure to achieve mass production of a diverse and growing portfolio of AI models with rich functionality and superior accuracy.&#8221; Normally we wouldn&#8217;t quote something as self-serving as that particular riff, but the <em>breadth</em> implied by the comment was noteworthy.</p>
<p>Why? Because it undergirds SenseTime&#8217;s claims that it has &#8220;leading market positions&#8221; in AI areas as far afield as &#8220;smart&#8221; cities, manufacturing, apps and healthcare. The company, then, has a very wide market lens for its software products.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s business model isn&#8217;t hard to parse. SenseTime notes that it &#8220;primarily&#8221; generates revenues from selling software licenses, along with &#8220;AI software-embedded hardware and related services.&#8221; The company&#8217;s model includes the &#8220;license of software installed on customers’ devices or on-premise at customers’ servers,&#8221; along with hardware-software combinations including physical products made by SenseTime and other companies. SenseTime also provides an &#8220;AI-as-a-service offering to customers for customized model production.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lucid Group has been subpoenaed by securities regulators investigating the electric automaker&#8217;s merger that enabled it to become a publicly traded company.</p>
<p>Lucid <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001811210/000110465921146498/tm2134520d4_8k.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a regulatory filing</a> Monday morning that the Securities and Exchange Commission requested certain documents related to its investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although there is no assurance as to the scope or outcome of this matter, the investigation appears to concern the business combination between the Company (f/k/a Churchill Capital Corp. IV) and Atieva, Inc. and certain projections and statements,&#8221; Lucid&#8217;s regulatory filing says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243400" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lucid said it is cooperating fully with the SEC in its review.</p>
<p>Shares of Lucid fell more than 9.5% on the news.</p>
<p>In February, Lucid Motors announced that it had reached an agreement to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/lucid-motors-strikes-spac-deal-to-go-public-with-24-billion-valuation/">become a publicly traded company</a> through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV Corp. At the time, it was considered one of the largest deals between a blank-check company and an electric vehicle startup.</p>
<p>Shareholders approved the merger between Lucid Motors and Churchill Capital IV in late July, after the companies extended the deadline by one day because not enough retail investors showed up to cast their vote. The company is now called Lucid Group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since then, Lucid Group has started deliveries of its first all-electric luxury vehicle, the Lucid Air, and announced plans to expand its factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, by 2.7 million square feet. Some of that expansion will be used for Project Gravity, a luxury electric vehicle SUV that is supposed to go into production in 2023.</p>
<p>SPACs, a financial instrument that came back into vogue two years ago, has been framed as a better, faster way for companies to become public. A number of venture capitalists have also jumped into the SPAC game, which has helped propel the pace of deals. But that has also caused regulators to take a closer look at some of these mergers. At least three mobility-related SPAC mergers have come under scrutiny by the SEC. Regulators&#8217; probe into Nikola Motors led to the founder&#8217;s resignation and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-indicted-on-three-counts-of-fraud/"> three indictments on charges of fraud</a>. Lordstown Motors is under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/department-of-justice-opens-investigation-into-ev-startup-lordstown-motors/">investigation by the SEC and the Department of Justice</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DoorDash<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/doordash-introduces-ultra-fast-grocery-delivery-providing-busy-consumers-with-a-reliable-and-convenient-way-to-restock-instantly-301437735.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> announced</a> today that it&#8217;s introducing &#8220;ultra-fast&#8221; deliveries in 10-15 minutes beginning with a single <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/doordash-launches-a-convenience-store/">DashMart</a> location in New York City. To start, ultra-fast deliveries will be offered from a new location in <span class="xn-location">Chelsea</span>, with more locations and partners coming over the next few months in New York and elsewhere. The company is additionally beginning to test a new model of employment which relies on full-time employees, not gig workers, to handle these new deliveries.</p>
<p>The company first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/doordash-launches-a-convenience-store/">launched DashMart</a>, its digital convenience store channel, in April 2020.</p>
<p>DashMarts sell household items, as well as the types of things you’d find at a convenience store. They&#8217;re essentially micro-fulfillment centers that carry around 2,000 items, where DashMart warehouse associates pick and pack the orders, and then delivery workers, known as Dashers, come to collect the order and deliver to the customer. Starting today, DoorDash customers within the delivery zone can visit the DoorDash app or website and place an order from DashMart for a delivery. The company notes that the DashMart Chelsea location will be open from <span class="xn-chron">7 am to 2 am</span> daily.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243248" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To ensure the 15-minute delivery time, these ultra-fast deliveries are limited to a smaller radius from the DashMart location, which reduces the courier&#8217;s commute and ensures they&#8217;ll be traveling familiar routes. Their e-bikes will be capped at speeds of 20 mph, DoorDash says.</p>
<p>The company also announced that ultra-fast deliveries will offer a new opportunity for couriers who are seeking a set schedule and more earnings. DashCorps, a newly created DoorDash company, will employ courier employees who will work regular schedules and report to a manager. The employees <a href="https://doordash.news/2021/12/06/introducing-ultra-fast-deliveries-with-doordash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be paid</a> an hourly wage starting at $15 per hour plus tips and will be offered other full-time benefits like medical, dental and vision insurance, Employee Assistance Programs, Flexible Spending Accounts and commuter benefits, among other things.</p>
<p>DashCorps employees will use a new app designed specifically for their work, which includes job responsibilities beyond delivery such as shelf-stocking, customer support and administrative work. They&#8217;ll wear a uniform and work an average of 20 hours per week, with many working full-time, the company says.</p>
<p>Currently, DoorDash works with over 400 local convenience stores and grocers in New York City, and says it plans to expand to more local bodegas through partnerships with DashCorps.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This new opportunity indicates that DoorDash is veering away from its strict gig worker model and shifting its strategy. It&#8217;s worth noting that DoorDash is among several gig companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/californias-gig-worker-prop-22-ruled-unconstitutional-by-superior-court/">that have fought regulations</a> that seek to implement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/doordash-workers-protest-outside-ceo-tony-xus-home-demanding-better-pay-tip-transparency-and-ppe/">employment rights</a> for gig workers. The company&#8217;s latest announcement signifies a departure from the existing gig worker model that it has fought to uphold.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re proud to be a leader in providing economic opportunities that fit the lives of so many people. And now, we&#8217;re excited about the new employment opportunity that DashCorps offers for a different type of work,&#8221; said DoorDash president Christopher Payne in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/doordash-introduces-ultra-fast-grocery-delivery-providing-busy-consumers-with-a-reliable-and-convenient-way-to-restock-instantly-301437735.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement. </a></p>
<p>In addition to providing courier employees with safety training and equipment, the new courier app for full-time workers will also integrate DoorDash’s in-app safety toolkit, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/doordash-rolls-out-safedash-an-in-app-security-toolkit-for-delivery-people-on-the-platform/">SafeDash</a>. The recently launched toolkit is aimed at helping its delivery providers feel safe while they work. SafeDash is available in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Users on the delivery side of the platform across the U.S. will get access to SafeDash by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The company also announced that it has created a new small business advisory council that will inform its future partnerships with small businesses in New York. DoorDash has also partnered with the Yemeni American Merchant Association (YAMA), a small business advocacy and social support organization in New York.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>Despite the advanced week, news is still coming in hot and heavy, so strap in for today&#8217;s busy episode:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243241" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Cryptos have failed to recover from their weekend swoon, leading to most major crypto assets suffering from a double-digit decline in their value over the last week.</li>
<li>SenseTime&#8217;s Hong Kong IPO is <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3158603/sensetime-shrinks-hong-kong-ipo-size-62-cent-us768-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set to raise less money than the AI company had hoped</a>.</li>

<li>A number of investors are considering<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/vcs-eye-investment-in-polygon/"> pouring capital into Polygon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/tradedepot-raises-110m-from-ifc-novastar-to-extend-bnpl-service-to-merchants-across-africa/">TradeDepot raised $110 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/stacked-raises-35m-to-bring-passive-investing-tools-to-retail-crypto-traders/">Stacked raised $35 million</a> for its crypto-investing system.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would normally say that it&#8217;s a holiday week, so let&#8217;s relax, but instead I wonder if we&#8217;re going to see a final push of news this week before things do calm down for the holiday period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp users can now choose to easily have all new messages they send or receive disappear as the world’s largest instant messaging service broadens its offerings for what an executive described as the next privacy standard.</p>
<p>The Facebook-owned service, used by over 2 billion users globally, on Monday rolled out an option that allows users to enable the ephemeral feature by default for all new chats. Prior to Monday&#8217;s update, users had to manually enable ephemerality for each new chat with another individual.</p>
<p>WhatsApp is additionally also giving users the option to have their messages disappear after 24 hours or 90 days, in addition to the seven-day period it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-now-lets-you-post-disappearing-messages-which-go-away-after-7-days/">originally introduced the feature with last year</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243283" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Ephemerality gives you the space to have conversations in a more open and honest way,” said Zafir Khan, head of Consumer Product at WhatsApp, in an interview with TechCrunch. Having the option to set ephemerality on all new messages by default should help users avoid awkwardness with their friends, he said, adding that the WhatsApp team heard feedback from users while developing these new options.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243391" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243391" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2243391" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/whatsapp-disappearing-messages.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/whatsapp-disappearing-messages.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/whatsapp-disappearing-messages.jpg?resize=150,66 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/whatsapp-disappearing-messages.jpg?resize=300,132 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/whatsapp-disappearing-messages.jpg?resize=768,337 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/whatsapp-disappearing-messages.jpg?resize=680,299 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/whatsapp-disappearing-messages.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243391" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WhatsApp</p></div></p>
<p>The messages will disappear after a certain time if either of the participating members in a conversation has enabled the ephemerality option, he said. WhatsApp is also rolling out this option to all group messages, and giving this choice at the time of the group&#8217;s creation itself, he said.</p>
<p>Ephemerality appears to be a big focus for WhatsApp as it works to expand the offering. &#8220;Privacy has always been core to WhatsApp. We launched the end-to-end encryption and made it default long before it became somewhat of a standard in messaging,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We view ephemerality as a new emerging standard in messaging,&#8221; he said. In a Facebook post, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg added, &#8220;Not all messages need to stick around forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way disappearing messages are designed is not foolproof, to be sure.</p>
<p>Users can still bypass the disappearing protocol by forwarding the messages or taking a screenshot, but Khan suggested that it&#8217;s more of a non-tech problem: If the person you’re sending the messages to doesn’t wish to comply with your request, there is nothing much that can be done other than not communicating with them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a landmark court decision against Uber, the U.K. High Court has <a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/format.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2021/3290.html">ruled</a> that its business model is unlawful.</p>
<p>The decision &#8212; which reboots the application of London&#8217;s regulations around private hire vehicle contracts &#8212; has huge ramifications for how ride-hailing platforms like Uber can operate in the U.K. capital and how much U.K. tax they will pay.</p>
<p>The crux of the issue is the contract model Uber and many other ride-hailing platforms have been applying. (And, indeed, how London&#8217;s transport regulator, TfL, has been overseeing &#8212; or, well, failing to &#8212; their compliance with the law.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243217" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Long-standing regulations, dating back to 1998, establish the conditions for a private hire vehicle booking to be lawful in London.</p>
<p>The Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act predates ride-hailing apps &#8212; and companies like Uber have claimed to be complying with its stipulations despite simultaneously arguing they are not contractually bound by trips booked by its platform.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">February</a>, a U.K. Supreme Court judgement &#8212; which demolished Uber&#8217;s claim that drivers were contractors not workers &#8212; raised key questions over its ride-hailing business model, as the justices suggested that the contractual scheme devised by Uber to claim compliance with U.K. regulations may be unlawful.</p>
<p>Uber, with the support of another ride-hailing player (FreeNow), responded by litigating to seek to have its model declared lawful by the courts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Uber has argued that the acceptance of a booking constituted a contract between the passenger and the driver &#8212; to which it claimed it was not a party &#8212; seeking to maintain that its only role was to act as a booking agent providing technology services and collecting payment as agent for the drivers. (And, therefore, to shrink the legal obligations on its business.)</p>
<p>In a second judicial proceeding following the Supreme Court ruling, a London taxi association also sought to have FreeNow&#8217;s operator license quashed &#8212; arguing it was not compliant with the 1998 Act in relation to the issue of &#8220;plying for hire&#8221;.</p>
<p>The High Court ruling deals with both those claims &#8212; and while the court did not agree that FreeNow&#8217;s licence should be revoked because the judges did not conclude that the app is facilitating or encouraging drivers to ply for hire (the key point of legal challenge there) &#8212; the judges have essentially struck down the prevailing ride-hailing business model that operates under a claim of a mere agent role for booking platforms.</p>
<p>In concluding the judgement, the High Court makes it clear platforms cannot avoid a contractual obligation &#8212; writing that &#8220;in order to operate lawfully under the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 a licensed operator who accepts a booking from a passenger is required to enter as principal into a contractual obligation with the passenger to provide the journey which is the subject of the booking&#8221;.</p>
<p>The implications of the ruling on ride-hailing businesses operating in the U.K. look significant &#8212; not least in how much tax London-licensed ride-hailing platforms will have to pay per trip.</p>
<p>That in turn means there are likely to be ramifications for the cost of offering a ride-hailing service &#8212; and, more broadly, how viable it may be to operate such a service at all.</p>
<p>After all, even with self-serving contractual workarounds and other employment law fiddles shrinking operating costs, many of these platforms have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/will-ride-hailing-profits-ever-come/">not been able to turn a profit</a>. And the core criticism remains that the gig platform business model is inherently &#8212; and, indeed, unlawfully &#8212; exploitative of labor.</p>
<p>Per the App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union (ADCU), which challenged Uber&#8217;s attempt to have its contracts declared lawful, almost all 1,832 TfL-licensed operators in the private hire industry have used an Uber-style contract model since regulatory supervision began back in 2002 &#8212; hence the ruling will have industry-wide implications.</p>
<p>Other ride-hailing players in London include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/uber-rival-bolt-returns-to-london-21-months-after-a-tfl-investigation-shut-it-down/">Bolt</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/ola-fails-to-get-ride-hailing-license-renewed-in-london-says-it-will-appeal-and-continues-to-operate/">Ola</a> &#8212; which may also need to rework their models in light of this ruling in order to continue operating in the U.K. capital.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will ride-hailing profits ever come?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/will-ride-hailing-profits-ever-come/embed/#?secret=jTLJcj4bO0" data-secret="jTLJcj4bO0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the High Court ruling affects the ride-hailing industry in general, it was Uber that took legal action seeking the opposite outcome, so there&#8217;s no doubt this is a serious blow to the company&#8217;s hopes.</p>
<p>In a statement Uber nonetheless sought to put out a less damaging spin &#8212; claiming to be ahead of rivals in providing benefits to workers, given it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">already made some changes</a> following the Supreme Court ruling.</p>
<p>“This court ruling means that all the details of the Supreme Court decision are now clear. Every private hire operator in London will be impacted by this decision, and should comply with the Supreme Court verdict in full. Drivers on Uber are guaranteed at least the National Living Wage, holiday pay and a pension plan but we’re not the only player in town. Other operators must also ensure drivers are treated fairly,” an Uber spokesperson said in the statement.</p>
<p>(NB: Uber is still being challenged on how it calculates driver working time &#8212; as it only starts the clock when drivers accept a job, not when they&#8217;re logged into its app and available to accept a booking &#8212; so its legal risks over employment classifications have plenty more road to run.)</p>
<p>Uber added that it is reviewing the judgement &#8212; and said it will comply with the decision of the court.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber says it will treat UK drivers as workers in wake of Supreme Court ruling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/embed/#?secret=PrlpnXEcdN" data-secret="PrlpnXEcdN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>We also contacted FreeNow for a reaction and a spokesperson told us it is also reviewing the ruling.</p>
<p>“As Europe’s leading multi-mobility platform we take our compliance to regulation seriously so we are currently reviewing this ruling in order to fully understand its implications for our business and what next steps we may need to take,&#8221; its spokesperson said in the statement.</p>
<p>The ADCU was jubilant on another major win &#8212; this time against what it dubbed &#8220;bogus contract constructions&#8221; which it characterized as &#8220;typical in the gig economy and the private hire industry&#8221;.</p>
<p>Such contracts are &#8220;the means to misclassify workers as independent contractors&#8221;, it argued, further claiming they&#8217;ve been the vehicle used to &#8220;shield operators like Uber from employer liability, legal liability to their customers and for payment of VAT&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Union further dubbed the ruling a &#8220;huge embarrassment&#8221; for TfL and the Mayor of London &#8212; which it said have &#8220;failed to regulate the trade according to the requirements of the legislation&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has resulted in drivers being brutally exploited and passenger safety put at risk while operators profited from the lack of proper regulatory supervision,&#8221; it added, citing a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/09/uber-drivers-report-sweated-labour-minimum-wage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 report</a> by former Work &amp; Pensions Select committee chair Frank Field MP &#8212; which it said described &#8220;the desperate conditions tolerated in a trade supervised by TfL&#8221;. (Field went on to conduct an inquiry into pay and conditions for platform workers in the food delivery space &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/deliveroos-flexible-labor-model-likened-to-20th-century-dockyards/">likened those apps&#8217; labor model to conditions experienced by workers in 20th century dockyards</a>.)</p>
<p>James Farrer, the ADCU&#8217;s general secretary, and a claimant in the aforementioned successful employment tribunal against Uber, also welcomed today&#8217;s High Court ruling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The private hire industry under Transport for London has been a cess pit of labour abuse for decades. With this ruling in place, TfL must ensure that all private hire operators take full responsibility for every trip they book and not dump responsibility on to drivers,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The knock on effect of this will be that drivers can far more easily access worker rights protections now that the confusion of misclassification has been removed, passengers will enjoy greater protection and the Treasury will stand to collect 20% on every fare,&#8221; Farrer predicted.</p>
<p>In a statement, Yaseen Aslam, the ADCU&#8217;s president, added: &#8220;For years, the Mayor and Transport for London told us they had no powers to protect TfL licensed drivers from brutal exploitation by licensed operators like Uber. This ruling confirms that, not only had the powers all along but, in fact, they had the duty to act on these powers but failed to do so. The Mayor of London must now order an urgent review of TfL to find out what went wrong, to bring the industry rapidly into compliance and to ensure passengers and drivers are never again put at risk like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch contacted TfL and the Mayor of London&#8217;s office for comment &#8212; but at the time of writing neither had responded.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> TfL has now sent this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We note the High Court’s judgment that London private hire operators are required to enter into a contract with passengers. All operators will need to carefully consider the Court’s judgment and take steps to ensure that they comply with it, including considering whether any changes to their way of working are required.  We also note that the Court dismissed an argument that private hire vehicles made available via the FreeNow app unlawfully ply for hire.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ruling is certainly embarrassing for London&#8217;s authorities, which have claimed to be taking a tough stance against Uber on issues of safety and governance, including &#8212; since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/22/uber-loses-its-license-to-operate-in-london/">2017</a> &#8212; TfL repeatedly denying Uber a full licence renewal.</p>
<p>If TfL had applied the regulations as intended there&#8217;s no doubt Uber&#8217;s business would have had to look very different from the get-go. Indeed, the whole private hire vehicle model might have taken a very different turn.</p>
<p>While this High Court ruling is specific to London/the U.K., wider pro-worker changes also appear to be on the way for gig platforms across Europe &#8212; as EU lawmakers are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">working on legislation they say will improve working conditions</a> for platforms workers.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-02/food-delivery-ride-apps-to-pay-billions-more-a-year-in-eu-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> reported this forthcoming EU plan could see as many as 4.1 million people working through food delivery and ride-hailing apps reclassified as employees &#8212; which sounds like it certainly take a bunch of steam out of a very VC-inflated sector.</p>
<p>Uber and other gig platforms, meanwhile, have been lobbying the bloc&#8217;s lawmakers to steer the other way &#8212; pushing for a Prop 22-style legal carve out for platform work that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">critics argue</a> would cement a lower standard of employment protections for workers who are already among the most vulnerable and precarious.</p>
<p>So U.K. judges&#8217; clarity on upholding the purpose of legislation being to protect workers looks very timely and may further influence the shape of incoming pan-EU rules for gig workers.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melas-Kyriazi will be based in the firm’s San Francisco office and focus on seed and Series A investments in emerging fintech and commerce companies &#8212; two core areas of focus for the firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Christina’s expertise at the intersection of fintech and e-commerce is a perfect complement to BCV’s deep focus on these domains,” said Merritt Hummer, partner at BCV, who met Melas-Kyriazi while both attended Harvard Business School.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243072" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Harris, partner at Bain Capital Ventures, agrees. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said his firm had been “looking for a long time” for someone well-versed in the intersection of fintech and commerce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We at Bain Capital Ventures are very committed to domain expertise and building leadership positions in the areas we&#8217;re interested in,” he told TechCrunch.”Fintech and commerce are certainly two of those areas. More than half of our investing dollars go to work in those two categories. And what we&#8217;ve experienced is that some of the best companies don&#8217;t fit neatly into one category. They&#8217;re often at the seams between two activities.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Melas-Kyriazi, BCV now has seven investing partners based in San Francisco and Palo Alto. Its early-stage investing practice on the West Coast will continue to represent more than half of its investments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm currently has $9.2 billion in assets under management. In May, it </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/bvc_fund_nine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closed two funds </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">valued at a combined $1.3 billion and announced a renewed focus on seed and Series A deals. Since BCV’s first fund in 2001, the firm has invested more than $4.5 billion in 365 companies and claims to have helped its portfolio realize over $430 billion in enterprise value. It’s backed the likes of Finix, GoCardless, Airbase and Orum. Recent IPOs include AvidXchange, FlyWire, Rent the Runway and SmartRent, among a number of other </span><a href="https://www.baincapitalventures.com/portfolio/?status=excited" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melas-Kyriazi went to Stanford University for undergrad and studied economics and engineering before joining Goldman Sachs as an investment banker. She then moved on to LinkedIn, where she worked “closely with product” before heading to Shift Cars in its early days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After attending Harvard Business School to get her MBA, Melas-Kyriazi started getting interested in fintech, realizing that “fintech infrastructure is fundamentally broken.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She started working in product and growth at GoFundMe, which she said benefited from the fact that payment service providers like PayPal made it easier to accept payments and just in general from the new wave of fintech distribution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melas-Kyriazi then started alternative lender Affirm in 2019, where she went on the “wild ride” of seeing the company grow from 400 people to over 2,000 by the time she left. There, she got to work across multiple product areas and on the merchant side of the product team focused on enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I realized I really loved the zero to one phase of product building,” Melas-Kyriazi recalls. “I love working with founders at that stage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was that passion that drew her to angel investing about five years ago &#8212; and ultimately to BCV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The move to VC felt like a natural transition,” Melas-Kyriazi said. “There are still so many hard problems left to solve, especially within fintech and commerce tech and I am excited  to continue to work with great founders and back the next generation of mission-driven fintech founders.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an angel investor, Melas-Kyriazi has invested in over 20 startups, many of which are in the fintech, proptech and enterprise SaaS sectors. In fact, BCV had worked with her on a number of early-stage deals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have worked with Christina for many years as an angel investor partner on early-stage deals,” Harris said. “Her commitment to entrepreneurs’ success is second to none; she always goes the extra mile for founders,” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Melas-Kyriazi is interested in a few broad categories &#8212; from buy now, pay later to how new payment rails are being built on top of decentralized networks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other areas Melas-Kyriazi believes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“continue to explode” are e-commerce enablement and B2B payments, which despite tremendous innovation, remains “quite broken” in her view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commerce is a logical area for BCV to invest considering that Bain Capital owns dozens of multibillion-dollar retailers, noted Harris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something that we can bring to the table for the benefit of our venture capital portfolio companies,” he told TechCrunch, “is access to Dunkin&#8217; Donuts and Michael stores, for example. The list goes on of the multibillion-dollar global commerce businesses that we own as a firm. And then also, in terms of financial services, Bain Capital as a $130 billion asset management firm is an important player for all the banks and all the insurance companies and the broker dealers. So it is not purely a coincidence that we&#8217;ve chosen these two lanes.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Astra is set to expand its launch footprint, after exclusively flying its first few rockets from Kodiak, Alaska. The startup will fly a mission from Cape Canaveral in Florida for client NASA in January 2022, it <a href="https://astra.com/news/astra-announces-cape-canaveral/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Monday morning.</p>
<p>The launch will take place at Space Launch Complex 46 on the sprawling Cape Canaveral Space Force Station grounds, which is a site that was previously used for missile testing before being subsequently deactivated until it was re-opened for commercial space operations in 1997. It saw sporadic use from then until its last mission in 2019.</p>
<p>Astra&#8217;s planned launch there is not only a big win for the company, but also for the U.S. Space Force&#8217;s Space Launch Delta 45, a space launch support squadron that is instrumental to launches taking off from U.S. soil. The mission got its necessary approvals in just &#8220;months,&#8221; as compared to multiple years for all the sign-off required for prior space launches.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243246" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For Astra, this also means that it&#8217;ll have another active option for launches, which is important in terms of broadening the scope of what kind of orbits it can target for client payload delivery. Florida is also a popular launch location for reasons that include its historically relatively stable weather systems.</p>
<p>One of Astra&#8217;s core value propositions is that its rocket is small and its on-site launch operations lightweight enough that it can effectively deploy from a wide range of different sites with minimal personnel and site prep requirements, so diversifying its launch-site pool is also key to demonstrating that in action.</p>
<p>Astra&#8217;s Benjamin Lyon and Kelyn Brannon will be joining us as speakers at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=TRUE">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> next week, so be sure to tune in there to learn more about the company&#8217;s plans for 2022.</p>
