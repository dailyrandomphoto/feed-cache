										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch&#8217;s 2020 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We&#8217;re here to help! We&#8217;ll be rolling out gift guides from now through the end of December. </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2020/"><em>You can find our other guides right here.</em></a></p>
<p>For many of us, being home a lot more right now also means being online a lot more. It&#8217;s a great time to evaluate how you&#8217;re keeping your data safe — and to help others in your life do the same.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s teaching them to use things like physical security keys or just convincing them to stop writing their passwords on sticky notes, there are LOTS of little ways to nudge your friends and family in a safer direction. We&#8217;ve put together an array of gift ideas that&#8217;ll help them keep things locked down without breaking the bank (and, if you&#8217;re the one they&#8217;d call to help clean up after a security incident, probably save you some time in the end.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Much of what we wrote for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/gift-guide-essential-security-and-privacy-gifts-to-help-protect-your-friends-and-family/">our 2019 guide</a> still holds true. There are some timeless security essentials that you can&#8217;t miss out on, and we&#8217;ve searched around for the best deals. But we also have a few more fun gift ideas up our sleeves for the holiday season.</p>

<h2>Timeless security essentials for your friends and family</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2085611" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085611" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2085611 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="587" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg?resize=768,440 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg?resize=680,390 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085611" class="wp-caption-text">(Images from top-left clockwise: Yubico, 1Password, Amazon, and Amazon)</p></div></p>
<h2 id="a-password-manager-subscription">A password manager subscription</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/25/cybersecurity-101-guide-password-manager/">Password managers</a> are a real lifesaver. One strong, unique password lets you into your entire bank of passwords. They&#8217;re great for storing your passwords and other secrets, but also for encouraging you to use better, stronger, unique passwords. And because many are cross-platform, you can bring your passwords with you. Plenty of password managers exist — from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/free-lastpass/">LastPass</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/mozillas-free-password-manager-firefox-lockbox-launches-on-android/">Lockbox</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/dashlane-series-d/">Dashlane</a>, to open-source versions like KeePass. Many are free, but a premium subscription often comes with benefits and better features. And if you&#8217;re a journalist, 1Password has <a href="https://1password.com/for-journalism/">a free subscription</a> just for you.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Many free, premium offerings start at $36 – $45 annually<br />
<strong>Available from:</strong> <a href="https://1password.com/sign-up/">1Password</a> | <a href="https://lastpass.com/premium/payment">LastPass</a> | <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/plans">Dashlane</a> | <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a></p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t forget about a physical two-factor key</h2>
<p>Your online accounts have everything about you and you&#8217;d want to keep them safe. A security key is a physical hardware device that offers far greater protections than a two-factor code going to your phone. A security key plugs into your USB port on your computer (or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/yubikey-dual-usb-c-lightning/">the charging port on your phone</a>) to &#8220;prove&#8221; to online services, like Facebook, Google, and Twitter, that you are who you say you are. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/08/yubico-launches-a-new-nfc-security-key-and-preps-iphone-support/">YubiKeys</a> are by far our favorite and come in all shapes and sizes. The latest YubiKey 5 series has something for everyone, no matter what kind of devices they have. They&#8217;re also cheap. Google also has a range of its own branded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/14/google-titan-security-key-usb-c/">Titan security keys</a>, one of which also offers Bluetooth connectivity.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> From $25 to $55, depending on device type, from <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/compare-yubikey-5-series/">Yubico Store</a> or <a href="https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key">Google Store</a></p>
<h2 id="a-webcam-cover-to-hide-your-modesty">A webcam cover to protect your privacy</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re all living through this pandemic together, and most of us are still working from home. If you, like me, have accidentally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/08/sorry-i-gatecrashed-your-zoom-meeting/">joined a video call by mistake</a>, you&#8217;ll be more thankful for your webcam cover than you could ever know. Webcam covers slide open when you need to access your camera, and slides to cover the lens when you don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s that easy. You can buy webcam covers from practically anywhere — just make sure you get a thin cover that supports your device so as to not damage its display when you close the lid. You can support local businesses and non-profits — you can search for unique and interesting webcam covers on Etsy or from your favorite internet rights group.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> from $5 – $10.<br />
<strong>Available from:</strong> <a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/webcam_covers">Etsy</a> | <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/shop/laptop-camera-cover-set-ii">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a></p>
<h2 id="a-microphone-blocker">A microphone blocker to prevent hot mics (and malware)</h2>
<p>Now you have your webcam cover, what about your microphone? Just as hackers can tap into your webcam, they can also pick up on your audio. Microphone blockers contain a semiconductor that tricks your computer or device into thinking that it&#8217;s a working microphone, when in fact it&#8217;s not able to pick up any audio. Anyone hacking into your device won&#8217;t hear a thing. Some modern Macs already come with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/apple-t2-security-chip-microphone-eavesdropping/">a new Apple T2 security chip</a> which prevents hackers from snooping on your microphone when your laptop&#8217;s lid is shut. But a microphone blocker will work all the time, even when the lid is open.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LPQJGA2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01LPQJGA2&amp;linkId=e78b907f7bb41f37fbd6a0478aa177aa">$7</a> to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V9T14N3/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07V9T14N3&amp;linkId=3b38295afe79ddde59bc38485389254d">$20</a> on Amazon</p>

<h2 id="pi-hole-to-block-pesky-ads-and-online-trackers">A Pi-hole to block pesky ads and online trackers</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2073779" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2073779" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2073779 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="555" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg?resize=768,416 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2073779" class="wp-caption-text">(Image: Pi-Hole)</p></div></p>
<p>Think of a Pi-hole as a &#8220;hardware ad-blocker.&#8221; A Pi-hole is a modified Raspberry Pi mini-computer that runs ad-blocking technology as a box that sits on your network. It means that everyone on your home network benefits from ad blocking. Online ads generate revenue for websites but are also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/apple-online-ads-private/">notorious for tracking users</a> across the web. Until ads can behave properly, a Pi-hole is a great way to capture and sinkhole bad ad traffic. The hardware may be cheap, but the ad-blocking software is free. Donations to the cause are welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> from $35.<br />

<h2 id="a-privacy-screen-for-your-computer-or-phone">Get your computer or phone a privacy screen</h2>

<p>How often have you seen someone&#8217;s private messages or documents as you look over their shoulder, or see them in the next seat over? It&#8217;s not as much of an issue when we&#8217;re all at home — but we&#8217;re also all getting pretty comfortable with having whatever on our screens right now, which might not be the best habit to develop. Privacy screens can help protect you from &#8220;visual hacking.&#8221; These screens make it near-impossible for anyone other than the device user to snoop at what you&#8217;re working on. And, you can get them for all kinds of devices and displays — including phones. But make sure you get the right size!</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> from about $17 and up, depending on display size<br />

<p><strong><span class="schedule-item__title">University Showcase — Boldly Innovating in Space, for Space (Part One)</span></strong></p>
<p>Technologies to Go Boldly in Space &#8212; For the past half century, space exploration and technology has been earth-centric. We’ve studied the earth, orbited the earth and sent images of distant places back to earth. In the coming decade, we’ll embark on a new commitment: We’re going to space to stay. We’re committing to space commerce, space habitation and space exploration in order to not just stay in space, but to extend our human footprint into this solar system. To be successful, we need bold people and new technology to build and deploy the next generation of space capabilities. We need to capture these space opportunities, avoid potential threats and deliver on the promise of a multi-planet human race. This session showcases our partners USC and MIT, as they provide insight into their space programs. They are joined by university partners UCLA, ASU and Caltech, showcasing a range of emerging space technologies. Working with the Aerospace Corporation, these emerging capabilities can be evaluated and integrated into government space-faring missions for communicating, navigating and exploring in space with NASA, NOAA and the Air Force.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced that it is acquiring <a href="https://squadapp.io/">Squad</a> and that the team from the screen-sharing social app will be joining Twitter&#8217;s ranks. Squad&#8217;s co-founders, CEO Esther Crawford and CTO Ethan Sutin, and the rest of the team will be coming aboard inside Twitter&#8217;s design, engineering, and product departments, Twitter tells us. Crawford specifically notes that she will be leading a product in the conversations space.</p>
<p>What isn&#8217;t coming aboard is the actual Squad app, which allowed users to share their screens on mobile or desktop and simultaneously video chat, a feature that aimed to find the friend use case in screen-sharing beyond the enterprise use case of presenting. The app will be shutting down tomorrow, Twitter confirms, an unwelcome surprise for its user base largely made up of teen girls.</p>
<p>Twitter declined to share further terms of the deal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2086110" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086110" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2086110 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="298" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=150,66 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=300,131 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=768,336 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=680,298 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=1536,673 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086110" class="wp-caption-text">Image via Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>The app&#8217;s functionality seems like a natural fit for the service, though the company did not confirm whether any tech was coming aboard as part of the deal. Twitter hasn&#8217;t been keen to keep separate apps functioning outside of the core Twitter app. Vine was infamously shut down, upsetting users who likely later rallied behind TikTok, a massive success story and perhaps one of the biggest missed opportunities for American social media companies. Meanwhile, Periscope which has largely bumbled along over the years, is in a particularly fragile place with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/twitter-app-code-indicates-that-live-video-broadcasting-app-periscope-may-get-shut-down/">app code emerging </a>just today that indicates an impending shutdown for the app.</p>
<p>Squad was notably partnered closely with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/snapchat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="snapchat">Snap <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and was an early adopter of many of the company&#8217;s Snap Kit developer tools. Building so much of the app using Snap&#8217;s developer tools could have made porting the tech to Twitter&#8217;s infrastructure a more complicated task, especially when considering how often Snap Kit apps are tied quite closely to the Snapchat user graph.</p>

Squad was in the right place at the right time in early 2020. When the pandemic first struck, CEO Esther Crawford told TechCrunch that usage of her app spiked 1100%.</p>
<p>Crawford spoke at length about the challenges of scaling a modern social app while avoiding the pitfalls of toxicity that so often seem to come with reaching new heights. In an interview with TechCrunch last year, she told us her team was “trying to learn from the best in what they did but get rid of the shit.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://esthercrawford.medium.com/squad-is-now-part-of-twitter-48dd73891f71">Medium post</a>, Crawford also took the opportunity of her startup&#8217;s exit to lobby investors to start backing more diverse founders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that our exit will tip the scale a bit more toward convincing investors to put money into diverse teams because each success is another proof point that we, the historically under-capitalized and underestimated founders, are a good bet,&#8221; Crawford wrote in a Medium post. &#8220;Invest in women and people of color because we will make you money.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This quarter, strong earnings results from public cloud companies were overshadowed by a seemingly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">endless IPO cycle</a>. Another moment we somewhat missed over the last few weeks was the stock market pushing the value of public cloud companies to all-time highs.</p>
<p>These events are connected. And they bode well for startups working on SaaS and API-delivered software, which are keeping the climate for cloud venture investment warm and valuations stretched by historical norms.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The earnings results that have made Wall Street content include a growing number of cloud companies that are seeing revenue growth accelerate from Q2 2020 to Q3 2020, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/jaminball/status/1337174904861458435">recent analysis by Redpoint&#8217;s Jamin Ball</a>.</p>
<p>Astute readers will recall that The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/why-is-cloud-revenue-growth-so-slow-if-the-digital-transformation-is-accelerating/">chatted with Ball after the Q2 earnings cycle</a>, a conversation that included puzzling over how to square a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/12/is-the-vaunted-cloud-acceleration-falling-flat/">nearly uniform deceleration in revenue growth</a> from Q1 to Q2 in the software sector, which, at the very same time, was supposedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/the-accelerating-digital-transformation-redux/">undergoing a boom in demand</a> thanks to the pandemic and a suddenly remote workforce.</p>
<p>One hypothesis Ball offered was that deals signed in Q2 by SaaS companies would not show up much until Q3 if they were signed in the back-half of the quarter. Regardless of the reason, Q3 featured a far-stronger crop of cloud results that imply a strengthening sector.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For us startup watchers on the hunt for a hint of what is going on in opaque private markets, this is a useful data point. If you&#8217;ve been slightly befuddled as to why the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/3-investors-discuss-the-state-of-saas-investing-in-2020/">venture capital space has seen deals accelerate</a> with time-to-conviction falling from weeks to minutes — and pre-emption the new normal — this is part of the why.</span></p>
<p>As the future has been pulled forward when it comes to digitizing the American and global economies, it&#8217;s a good time to be a software company. This was visible in SaaS company <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/smartsheet-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="smartsheet-3">Smartsheet&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> earnings this quarter. The Exchange chatted with <a href="https://twitter.com/markmader">CEO Mark Mader</a> about his company&#8217;s recent earnings results that beat expectations and led to the company&#8217;s shares rising. Analyst upgrades have followed.</p>
<p>This morning, let&#8217;s examine the data regarding how many cloud companies are seeing revenue growth accelerate, dig into Smartsheet&#8217;s results to see what we can learn (hint: SMBs matter), and then apply all our findings to the startup market itself so that we can go into the weekend as informed as possible.</p>
<h2>Public acceleration</h2>
<p>At the risk of being cheeky, I&#8217;ve embedded <a href="https://twitter.com/jaminball/status/1337174904861458435/photo/1">Ball&#8217;s chart</a> concerning Q3 revenue acceleration from cloud companies below. (If you are into similar data sets, <a href="https://twitter.com/jaminball/">he&#8217;s worth following on Twitter</a>.) Here&#8217;s the data:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086049" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086049" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2086049 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-9.30.00-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="342" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-9.30.00-AM.png 1001w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-9.30.00-AM.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-9.30.00-AM.png?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-9.30.00-AM.png?resize=768,387 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-9.30.00-AM.png?resize=680,342 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-9.30.00-AM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086049" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Jamin Ball</p></div></p>
<p>This chart shows Q2&#8217;s cloud year-over-year growth rates subtracted from Q3&#8217;s own; a result greater than one shows that a company&#8217;s year-over-year growth accelerated from the second quarter to the third. The higher the number of cloud companies that wind up with a result of 1% or greater in the above chart, the faster the cloud market as a whole is accelerating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Commission must block the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-Fitbit merger as a matter of democratic imperative, prominent academic and author Shoshana Zuboff has warned.</p>
<p>The Harvard professor who wrote the defining book on <a href="https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/shoshana-zuboff/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/9781610395694/">surveillance capitalism</a> has become the latest voice raised against the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/google-is-acquiring-fitbit/">$2.1 billion data+devices deal</a> &#8212; that&#8217;s now been delayed at the regulatory clearance stage for more than a year.</p>
<p>Others calling for the Google-<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fitbit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fitbit">Fitbit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> acquisition to be blocked &#8212; unless or until robust competition, democratic and human rights safeguards can be baked in &#8212; include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/no-google-fitbit-merger-without-human-rights-remedies-says-amnesty-to-eu/">Amnesty International</a>; scores of <a href="https://newamericadotorg.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Joint_NGO_Statement_on_Google_Fitbit_merger_final.pdf">consumer</a>, <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/press-release/3750/press-release-privacy-international-calls-googlefitbit-merger-be-blocked">privacy</a> and digital rights groups across civic society; and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/google-gobbling-fitbit-is-a-major-privacy-risk-warns-eu-data-protection-advisor/">EU&#8217;s very own data protection advisor</a>, to name a few.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EU regulators are still considering whether or not to greenlight the merger. The deadline for them to make up their minds was recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/eus-google-fitbit-antitrust-decision-deadline-pushed-into-2021/">extended into early 2021</a> &#8212; although a decision could come as soon as next week.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/google-fitbit-deal-to-be-scrutinized-in-europe-over-data-competition-concerns/">August</a>, the Commission opened an in-depth investigation into the deal &#8212; saying it was concerned it would &#8220;further entrench Google’s market position in the online advertising markets by increasing the already vast amount of data that Google could use for personalisation of the ads it serves and displays&#8221;.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers have also expressed skepticism over initial concessions offered by Google which suggested storing Fitbit data in a silo that it said would be kept separate from other Google data.</p>
<p>It also said it would not use Fitbit data for ad targeting &#8212; at least for a time-limited period (though it&#8217;s not clear what exactly it has proposed in Europe). Elsewhere, Australian regulators are also still eyeing the deal &#8212; and recently <a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/accc-asks-industry-if-google-s-fitbit-acquisition-plan-will-work-20201130-p56j79">sought industry feedback</a> on a pledge by Google not to use Fitbit data for ads for 10 years.</p>
<p>The ACCC published <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/public-registers/mergers-registers/public-informal-merger-reviews/google-llc-proposed-acquisition-of-fitbit-inc">draft undertakings</a> in November which includes stipulations such as: &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Google must not use any Measured Body Data or Health and Fitness Activity Location Data in or for Google Ads&#8221; and that data must be kept separate. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;No Google-Fitbit merger without human rights remedies, says Amnesty to EU&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/no-google-fitbit-merger-without-human-rights-remedies-says-amnesty-to-eu/embed/#?secret=GFjt18eGJq" data-secret="GFjt18eGJq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But Zuboff&#8217;s point is that targeted advertising is just the tip of the vast data-extracting ambitions of surveillance capitalists &#8212; while health data is one of the few personal data fields these digital giants have not yet been able to mine in their usual limitless way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any notion of approving the Fitbit acquisition &#8212; based on Google&#8217;s promises not to do something that is anyway an irrelevant thing, to do or not to do &#8212; is a serious mistake,&#8221; she said yesterday, giving the keynote speech at the annual lecture of the EU Parliament&#8217;s Science and Technology Options Assessment (<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/en/home/highlights">STOA</a>) panel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a decision should be reconsidered immediately. And never again repeated,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>A Google spokesman declined to comment on Zuboff&#8217;s remarks &#8212; pointing only to its <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/update-fitbit/">blog post</a> from August where it claims the deal is about &#8220;devices not data&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Beware the &#8220;epistemic coup&#8221;</h2>
<p>In the STOA lecture, Zuboff articulates a view of tech giants&#8217; uncontrolled extraction and use of data leading to what she described as an &#8220;epistemic coup&#8221; &#8212; where bottomless digitally-enabled data extraction leads to an unprecedented dominance of knowledge by the private sector, generating radical inequalities and full-spectrum harms, as a data-empowered few are able to run roughshod over humanity, democratic values and the rule of law in the name of increasing their profits.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no &#8216;attention economy&#8217;; these are effects of a deeper cause &#8212; and that cause is surveillance capitalism&#8217;s economic imperatives. These corporations are not publishers, they are not distributors, they are not merely adtech providers; they are indiscriminate, radically indifferent all-you-can-eat extractors of everything forever, all for the sake of prediction that become more lucrative as they approach certainty,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowledge at this kind of scale produces a new kind of power over people. This is what data scientists call the shift from monitoring to actuation. Where there&#8217;s actually sufficient data about a machine system to be able to control it remotely. The thing is now it&#8217;s not just the machine systems; it&#8217;s the human systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wide-ranging <a href="https://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/panel-for-future-of-science-and-technology-annual-lecture-2020_20201209-1500-SPECIAL-STOA_vd">keynote is well worth watching in full</a> for how clearly Zuboff articulates why allowing corporates to &#8220;unilaterally claim[&#8230;] private human experience for raw material, bent to the purposes of datafication, computational production and sales&#8221; is terrible for humanity and the (genuine) communities which make up our civilization &#8212; likening it to how uncontrolled extraction of oil for corporate profit has threatened the survival of life on earth, fuelling climate change, biodiversity decline and mass species extinction.</p>
<p>The nub of the argument is that surveillance capitalism&#8217;s target is <em>human nature itself</em> &#8212; with Zuboff calling out the &#8220;data business&#8221; playbook of &#8220;hidden extraction mechanisms&#8221; which she said are robbing us of the ability to fight back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today our nemesis is not, and could never be, mere data or technology &#8212; but rather the extractors, led by a handful of giant corporations: Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, to name only the largest, along with their complex, far-reaching ecosystems, these are corporate institutions that have pioneered a new logic of extraction but with a dark and startling twist&#8230; These corporations have placed the defence of their narrow economic self-interest above the interests of individual sovereignty, democracy and humanity itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The keynote included a call to action to European lawmakers to step in and reverse what has been allowed to become entrenched at humanity&#8217;s expense.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am here today because the European Union represents humanity&#8217;s best hope to alter this course before lawless, unprecedented computational concentrations of knowledge and power become as irreversible and poisonous to our societies as the toxic concentrations of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere have become to our earth,&#8221; said Zuboff, adding: &#8220;The idea that we could bequeath both of these cataclysms to our children is intolerable.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google-Fitbit deal to be scrutinized in Europe over data competition concerns&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/google-fitbit-deal-to-be-scrutinized-in-europe-over-data-competition-concerns/embed/#?secret=nYOmJcVoTZ" data-secret="nYOmJcVoTZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>EU lawmakers are on the cusp of unveiling a major package of legislative proposals which will update rules for digital services and bring in new requirements for platforms with significant market power.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA) proposals are due to be presented next Tuesday &#8212; the start of a long road of negotiating to turn the policies into EU law.</p>
<p>It has turned out to be particularly awkward timing for the Commission, in parallel with the Google-Fitbit decision. Not least because a key EVP involved in shaping the new digital strategy, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/margrethe-vestager" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="margrethe-vestager">Margrethe Vestager, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is also the competition commissioner &#8212; so she&#8217;s simultaneously tasked with deciding whether to waive the tech giant&#8217;s latest data acquisition through, even as she puts the finishing touches on ex ante rules for gatekeepers that won&#8217;t likely come into force for years.</p>
<p>Vestager told the EU parliament&#8217;s <a href="https://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/committee-on-economic-and-monetary-affairs_20201210-0900-COMMITTEE-ECON_vd">Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs</a> this week that the Commission&#8217;s incoming proposals for a major overhaul of digital regulations are necessary to tackle the challenges of the platform economy.</p>
<p>The scale and the scope of the platform economy is &#8220;unprecedented and it&#8217;s increasing&#8221;, she said, acknowledging that the digitization process has &#8220;given us a concentration of data, intellectual property, capital &#8212; and because of that there&#8217;s a lot of power in the hands of a few global players&#8221;.</p>
<p>That in turn is making it &#8220;really urgent&#8221; to complement existing EU competition law enforcement with dedicated regulation for digital services and platform giants, said Vestager.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DSA will propose a clear set of due diligence obligations and operate the e-commerce framework for all Internet services within the EU and the point is to ensure that digital services face no borders within the EU, define clearer responsibilities and accountability for online platforms such as social media and marketplaces,&#8221; she told MEPs &#8212; saying the overarching aim is to ensure consumers have the same protections online as they already do offline.</p>
<p>The aim of the DMA &#8212; and its incoming list of &#8220;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8221; for platforms that the EU will define as gatekeepers &#8212; is to make sure digital markets &#8220;stay open and contestable&#8221;, and thus to serve consumers in &#8220;the best possible way&#8221;.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Trust but verify&#8217; via audit authority</h2>
<p>In her keynote, Zuboff suggested EU regulators should follow two key principles as they consider what to do.</p>
<p>Firstly, &#8220;trust but verify&#8221; is how to treat with surveillance capitalists &#8212; so no more &#8220;taken at face value&#8221; pledges swallowed naively and later regurgitated under the one-way logic of extraction maximization. (She raised the awkward example of Facebook&#8217;s reversal of an earlier pledge to EU regulators not to combine WhatsApp user data with Facebook data.)</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Secondly we have to keep in mind so often we reduce the harms back to that originating context of targeted advertising &#8212; when in fact this whole economic logic has moved way beyond targeted advertising to many other markets,&#8221; she also said, warning against EU regulators taking too narrow a view on any concessions made by Google as it works to push open another data gate.  </span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the Commission for comment on Zuboff&#8217;s remarks.</p>
<p>Zuboff also spoke to concerns that EU regulators don&#8217;t believe they have legal grounds to deny Google-Fitbit.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the decision to approve Google&#8217;s acquisition of Fitbit was made because of a determination that EU laws are not strong enough to defend the acquisition denial in the European courts then let us please stop talking this minute; let&#8217;s suspend our event while the parliament moves into an emergency session to pass new laws that are strong enough to take this kind of rejection through the courts. Because we need those laws,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>It would certainly be ironic if the Commission green-lit the Google-Fitbit merger because it was worried about losing a legal challenge down the line &#8212; given how frequently tech giants resort to legal action to try to thwart the application of existing EU regulations. Not to mention how fiercely these giants lobby against <em>any</em> new regulation or legislative proposal that would dare to put limits on their ability to continue maximizing their data extraction.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google pushes Europe to limit &#8216;gatekeeper&#8217; platform rules&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/google-pushes-europe-to-limit-gatekeeper-platform-rules/embed/#?secret=MEOwlUdXbe" data-secret="MEOwlUdXbe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Zuboff said the forthcoming DMA &#8220;is the legal instrument to accomplish this necessary lawmaking [against the surveillance capitalists]&#8221;, addressing her remarks to those in the EU who have the power to pass laws.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make no mistake: This is your opportunity to make a bold intervention to defend democracy against the surveillance capitalists. Faint heartedness is not an option,&#8221; she said, adding that<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">DSA is likewise an essential intervention to </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">defend democracy. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is your chance to finally pry open the black box of surveillance capitalism and demand the right of democratic societies to control their own destiny,&#8221; she said, suggesting regulators&#8217; watch word here should be &#8220;audit authority&#8221;.</p>
<p>Democracy must have audit authority to protection the public just as regulators have done in countless other industries, she added.</p>
<p>The Google-Fitbit acquisition was raised in a question to Vestager yesterday during a <a href="https://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/committee-on-economic-and-monetary-affairs_20201210-0900-COMMITTEE-ECON_vd">session</a> of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs &#8212; where she was asked what the EU intends to do vis-à-vis health data and competition, given the risk of tech giants gleaning far deeper and more intimate knowledge of users than they&#8217;ve been able to via current data-mining practices.</p>
<p>Vestager told the committee she couldn&#8217;t comment on the specific merger as the process is ongoing but she said she agreed health data &#8220;are much more precious and much more sensitive&#8221; than other types of commercially exploited data.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why one has to be very careful when it comes to health data and advertising &#8212; because here it can be a much more vulnerable position for the person in question,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For health data as such I think it&#8217;s very important that the market develops because the more health data that becomes available the more services people expect for the market to provide for them to have a better understanding of how their health develops,&#8221; she went on, adding on Google-Fitbit specifically that &#8220;it remains to be seen how the remedies were to bear out if they were to be accepted&#8221;.</p>
<h2>U.S. versus EU approach to antitrust</h2>
<p>During the session Vestager also faced a number of questions from MEPs about the difference of approach to antitrust between the EU and the U.S. &#8212; where states have just opened a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">massive antitrust case against Facebook</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="75eQH82Yhe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">Facebook hit with massive antitrust lawsuit from 46 states</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook hit with massive antitrust lawsuit from 46 states&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/embed/#?secret=75eQH82Yhe" data-secret="75eQH82Yhe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>She repeatedly stressed that Europe has a &#8220;different&#8221; approach to competition law versus the U.S., sounding a tad on the defensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. Facebook case is a different approach than what we have. In Europe we do not have a ban of monopolies. They have a different legal basis in the U.S. We would say you&#8217;re more than welcome to be successful but with success comes responsibility &#8212; which is why we have article 102 [against abusing a dominant position],&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a last resort in Europe we would also be able to ask our [institutions] to split up companies but then we would also have to prove that this was the only thing to solve a competition problem and I don&#8217;t think we have been there yet,&#8221; Vestager added.</p>
<p>Responding to other questions from MEPs she described her department as doing its &#8220;best&#8221; across a number of big tech investigations &#8212; pointing it&#8217;s recently opened case against Amazon and has others ongoing into Google&#8217;s and Facebook&#8217;s use of data for advertising.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a couple of ongoing investigations into the Facebook ecosystem &#8212; on the use of data from customers and consumers into advertising and how the Facebook marketplace is functioning,&#8221; she noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;These cases are not as advanced as they are in the U.S. when it comes to Facebook but I find [the U.S. action] very encouraging,&#8221; she added, saying it&#8217;s a sign that &#8220;the global debate about tech dominance has been shifting over the last couple of years&#8221;.</p>
<p>Asked about Facebook&#8217;s reversal of an earlier promise not to combine Facebook and WhatsApp user data, Vestager said EU regulators had performed an analysis at the time &#8212; looking into whether such a move would still allow for competition &#8212; and &#8220;found there would be room for others services of the same kind&#8221;.</p>
<p>There were no follow-up questions in the event format so MEPs were unable to ask whether Vestager believes that analysis was sound or flawed. But it&#8217;s not a good look that the EU&#8217;s competition authorities were left so wrong-footed on Facebook&#8217;s market power.</p>
<p>Off her own bat, Vestager merely said: &#8220;It remains to be seen what will be the outcome of the U.S. [Facebook antitrust] case; as I said they have a different legal basis &#8212; to see if by acquiring this company you have entrenched monopoly position.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was also asked what the Commission intends to do about companies using self-serving tactics to artificially prolong investigations (and thus delay competition enforcement) &#8212; such as by procrastinating or handing out requested information only with substantial delay.</p>
<p>Vestager said its approach is to aim to &#8220;always try to balance things out&#8221; but she argued it&#8217;s important to give businesses enough time to respond properly even though it extends the length of investigations.</p>
<p>During the session she did also note that the aim for the DMA is to enable competition authorities to be &#8220;so much quicker&#8221; &#8212; because the ex ante rules will bake in &#8220;self-executing obligations&#8221;.</p>
<p>The gatekeeper status also means regulators will not need to do the work of establishing dominance first &#8212; &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">which means you&#8217;ll get to the sanction must faster and should prevent damages in the marketplace&#8221;, she noted. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether or not the forthcoming legislative package will feature a new competition tool for specifically tackling digital markets &#8212; which the Commission consulted on earlier this year.</p>
<p>Reports have suggested this has been dropped after a standard EU pre-regulatory review process. But the commissioner did not confirm either way.</p>
<p>She was also asked about interim measures &#8212; an existing tool she dusted off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/europe-issues-interim-antitrust-order-against-broadcom-as-probe-continues/">last year</a> after an extended period when it had not been used, applying it in a case against chipmaker Broadcom.</p>
<p>On this she said the tool has been shown to have been useful &#8212; noting the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/european-antitrust-regulators-settle-with-broadcom-a-year-after-interim-measures-flex/">Broadcom case was settled in a year</a> (which is a very speedy turnaround for a competition case) &#8212; and she suggested the tool could be used more frequently in the future. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I think that we will see we can use it more often,&#8221; she told the MEPs. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.inemotion.com/en/">In&amp;motion</a> has raised a $12 million (€10 million) funding round led by Upfront Ventures with 360 Capital also participating. The company has been working on wearable airbag systems for motorbikes.</p>
<p>Integrated in a vest, the airbag is completely autonomous and can detect crashes in 60 milliseconds. The company has worked on a device called the In&amp;box that analyzes movements in real time. Thanks to different sensors, the device can determine when it’s time to activate the airbag.</p>
<p>In&amp;motion has worked on different profiles for different types of activities. For instance, if you’re riding a motorcycle on a MotoGP track, chances are you’re going to move faster and change your trajectory quite often. You can choose between traditional motorcycle riding, track and off-road.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Professional racers are also increasingly using airbag systems. In addition to MotoGP racers, participants in the 2021 Dakar Rallye will have to use airbags.</p>
<p>The go-to-market strategy is interesting as the startup isn’t selling its system directly to end users. In&amp;motion has partnered with existing motorcycle brands so that they can integrate the system in some vests. This way, In&amp;motion doesn’t have to build out a network of resellers from scratch. So far, the company has sold tens of thousands of systems.</p>
<p>There’s also a <a href="https://www.inemotion.com/myinemotion/en/moto-membership">subscription component</a> with unlimited warranty and the ability to replace the In&amp;box device with a new model after three years.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company wants to expand beyond its home country with a focus on Germany and the U.S. The company plans to double the size of its team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://gorillasapp.com">Gorillas</a>, a grocery delivery startup that operates its own hyper local fulfillment centers and has already been a hit in Berlin, has raised $44 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Probably one of European tech&#8217;s worst kept secrets this year, the round is led by hedge fund Coatue, with participation from other unnamed European investors. Coatue’s Daniel Senft and Bennett Siegel will join Gorillas‘ board.</p>
<p>Noteworthy, Accel and Index were <a href="https://www.deutsche-startups.de/2020/11/02/dealmonitor-02-11-2020/">reportedly</a> in the running, but ultimately didn’t invest. Atlantic Food Labs previously backed Gorillas in a seed round thought to be around €1.2 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by Kağan Sümer and Jörg Kattner in May this year and operating in Berlin and Cologne, Gorillas delivers groceries within an average of ten minutes. Unlike gig economy models, it employs riders directly and is emphasising its ability to get fresh groceries, along with other household items, to shoppers at very short notice and at “retail prices”. The idea is that the startup can address a large part of the groceries market that falls outside of a weekly bulk shop.</p>
<p>Some have dubbed the model that Gorillas is attempting to make work, &#8220;dark&#8221; convenience stores, in reference to the dark kitchens that run on top of Deliveroo and UberEats and operate as delivery only restaurants. In this instance, Gorillas and other European competitors, such as Dija (which we reported is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/dija/">closing its own large funding round</a>) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, are building out local delivery only grocery/convenience stores. These startups are also often compared to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gopuff-funding/">goPuff</a> in the U.S.</p>
<p>Gorillas CEO Kağan Sümer says that mass supermarkets, including their delivery models, are designed so that the consumer organises their grocery shopping around the needs of the supermarket and supply chain, rather than the supermarket being designed around the needs of the consumer.</p>
<p>This sees an emphasis on long shelf life products, where even fresh goods are treated for longer expiry dates, and a model that serves the weekly bulk shop well, but at the detriment of two other use-cases: “emergency” shopping, such as when you’re missing a key ingredient, or quickly replenishing your fridge based on what you fancy consuming right now.</p>
<p>“The biggest problem is that bulk purchases are super served. What I mean by that is this: all of the supermarket infrastructure is shaped around bulk purchases,” Sümer tells me, arguing that this leaves one third of the market underserved.</p>
<p>“You have penne but no Arrabiata; how do you get that sauce that you need now? [There is] no way.</p>
<p>“So we asked ourselves, what would happen if a company pops up and serves people with what they need when they need it? Our hypothesis was that people would appreciate it and shift their interaction with groceries to more on demand purchases”.</p>
<p>With a slogan that reads: “Faster than you,” and a delivery fee of just €1.80, one question mark over Gorillas (and others in the space) is if the unit economics can ever stack up, especially at scale and if the company really isn’t marking up prices significantly. “Through our procurement relationships, we have healthy margins which allow us to sell at retail prices,” says Sümer, pushing back. “Taking into account the solid basket sizes and procurement margins we are able to build a long-term sustainable business”.</p>
<p>He says the average delivery time is 10 minutes. “Through our network of centrally located fulfillment centers we are able to service customers in a small delivery radius. Ultimately we strive to deliver an efficient and fast service with full transparency on delivery times,” adds the Gorillas CEO.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gorillas says the new funding will be used for expansion across Germany and will accelerate its rollout across more of Europe &#8212; first stop, Amsterdam. Additionally, the company will use the capital to build out its team in Berlin. More ambitious, by the end of Q2 next year, Gorillas says it plans to be available in over 15 cities in Germany and across Europe, operating over 60 fulfillment centers.</p>

<p><em>UPDATE 12:55 PM EST: <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> called a hold in the countdown with 30 seconds remaining. It hasn&#8217;t shared details about the cause yet, but they did confirm that they won&#8217;t be attempting the launch today and will advise as to the next attempt window.</em></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is already having a banner year, with major accomplishments including its first human spaceflight, and it&#8217;s aiming to pad its current record-breaking launch year with a 25th flight today. The launch will carry SiriusXM-7, a broadcasting satellite for satellite radio service SiriusXM, delivering it to a geostationary transfer orbit from Space Launch Complex-40 in Florida.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is actually the second launch that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-ecb7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-ecb7">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has conducted just this week, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/06/spacex-launches-new-cargo-dragon-to-space-station-for-100th-successful-falcon-9-flight/">flying its 21st commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station for NASA on December 6</a>. SpaceX has a nearly two hour window for today&#8217;s launch, beginning at 11:21 AM EST (8:21 AM PST), and weather is currently looking good. <em>UPDATE: SpaceX updated the launch time to 12:55 PM EST.</em></p>
<p>The booster used on this launch flew during Demo-1, the first crewed flight for SpaceX ever, which brought astronauts to the ISS in May, as well as during a RADARSAT launch, and four separate Starlink launches during 2020. This will be its seventh flight, tying a record for SpaceX&#8217;s flight-proven first-stage boosters. It&#8217;ll attempt to land aboard the company&#8217;s drone landing ship in the Atlantic Ocean after deploying its second stage and cargo.</p>
<p>The broadcast above should begin around 15 minutes prior to the opening of the launch window, so long as everything is tracking on time.</p>

<h3 id="google-researcher-finds-a-major-iphone-security-bug-now-fixed">Google researcher finds a major iPhone security bug, now fixed</h3>
<p>What happens when you leave one of the best security researchers alone for six months? You get one of the most devastating vulnerabilities ever found in an iPhone — a bug so damaging that it can be exploited over-the-air and requires no interaction on the user&#8217;s part.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084868" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084868" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2084868" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/google-project-zero-iphones.gif" alt="" width="900" height="506" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084868" class="wp-caption-text">The AWDL bug under attack using a proof-of-concept exploit developed by a Google researcher. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ian Beer/<a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/12/an-ios-zero-click-radio-proximity.html">Google Project Zero</a></p></div></p>
<p>The vulnerability was found in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Wireless Direct Link (AWDL), an important part of the iPhone&#8217;s software that among other things allows users to share files and photos over Wi-Fi through Apple&#8217;s AirDrop feature.</p>
<p>&#8220;AWDL is enabled by default, exposing a large and complex attack surface to everyone in radio proximity,&#8221; wrote <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/i41nbeer/status/1333884909858004992">Ian Beer</a> in a tweet, who found the vulnerability in November and disclosed it to Apple, which pushed out a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210918">fix for iPhones</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210919">Macs</a> in January.</p>
<p>But exploiting the bug allowed Beer to gain access to the underlying iPhone software using Wi-Fi to gain control of a vulnerable device — including the messages, emails and photos — as well as the camera and microphone — without alerting the user. Beer said that the bug could be exploited over &#8220;hundreds of meters or more,&#8221; depending on the hardware used to carry out the attack. But the good news is that <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/12/an-ios-zero-click-radio-proximity.html">there&#8217;s no evidence</a> that malicious hackers have actively tried to exploit the bug.</p>
<p>News of the bug drew immediate attention, though Apple didn&#8217;t comment. NSA&#8217;s Rob Joyce said <a href="https://twitter.com/RGB_Lights/status/1333928951941566468?s=20">the bug</a> find is &#8220;quite an accomplishment,&#8221; given that most iOS bugs require chaining multiple vulnerabilities together in order to get access to the underlying software.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has been doubling down on video services within its app, building out Twitter Live and recently launching <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fleets</a> so that users can share more moving media alongside their pithy 180-word observations, links and still photos. But in the process, it appears that it may also be streamlining its bigger stable of services. Code in the Twitter app indicates that Periscope &#8212; the live video broadcasting app that launched a thousand fluttering hearts &#8212; may be headed into retirement.</p>
<p>Date and other details are still unknown, but super-sleuth developer Jane Machun Wong <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1337344129995395073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found a line</a> in Twitter&#8217;s app code that indicated a link to a shutdown notice for Periscope (which currently does not go to a live link).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This text found inside Twitter’s app indicates the shutdown notice might be shown in future versions of the Periscope app, directing users to a FAQ page about the app <a href="https://t.co/gGrNNxRLL7">pic.twitter.com/gGrNNxRLL7</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1337344129995395073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>There are no shutdown references in any of the code in the currently obtainable version of the Persicope app, Wong told us, but she also pointed out that the two apps do share some code &#8212; indeed there are integrations between the two Twitter-owned apps &#8212; and &#8220;I guess [that] is how the text in the screenshot got slipped into Twitter,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>We are reaching out to Twitter for a response to her discovery and will update as we learn more.</p>
<p>If this does play out with Periscope getting retired, it would be the end of a five-year run for the app.</p>
<p>Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/13/how-periscope-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired Periscope</a> before it had even launched (we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/04/twitter-in-talks-with-live-streaming-app-periscope/?_ga=2.101545153.1912869610.1607285587-2020914112.1606652257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">broke the news</a> of the acquisition before that), as part of a bold move to double down on video, and specifically live video. At the time, the move was coming as Twitter was really coming into its own as a platform for media companies, &#8220;citizen journalists&#8221; and simply people who wanted to get the word out more widely on whatever they were thinking about or doing.</p>
<p>At the time, Twitter was also eyeing up and apparently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/12/this-stream-aint-big-enough-for-the-both-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trying to stem the viral growth</a> of Meerkat, &#8220;the&#8221; app of 2015. That was not going to be an issue for the long run, though. Eventually Meerkat, either because of Periscope or because of the cyclical nature of hype, did <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/30/meerkat-star-of-2015-is-officially-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fizzle out</a>, only to relaunch as interactive video chat app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/21/the-internet-third-place/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Houseparty</a>, which eventually got noticed by Fortnite maker Epic, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/fortnite-maker-epic-acquires-social-video-app-houseparty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">then bought it</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Periscope, meanwhile, took a different route as part of Twitter from the very start of its launched life.</p>
<p>It remained a standalone app, but its team, and specifically founder Kayvon Beykpour, became a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/29/twitter-gets-a-re-org-and-new-product-head/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">central part of all of Twitter&#8217;s product development</a>.</p>
<p>And the central feature of Periscope was the app became a native part of the Twitter app; <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/a/2016/go-live-on-twitter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Live</a> &#8220;powered by Periscope,&#8221; which has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/21/in-push-for-more-live-video-twitter-officially-announces-the-producer-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expanded with API access</a> and other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/29/twitter-makes-it-easier-to-share-the-right-part-of-a-live-video-with-launch-of-timestamps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">features</a>. Twitter itself promotes Twitter Live content, not Periscope&#8217;s: you can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/twitterlive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TwitterLive</a> to get highlights of some of the people and organizations using the live feature in the app. (Other leading social apps like Instagram and Facebook have taken a similar route, offering live video features but more as embedded parts of the main platforms, rather than standalone apps where live is front and center.)</p>
<p>Periscope, you might say, has in the meantime been dying a slow death as a standalone brand and app. But it&#8217;s not a new story: my former (missed!) colleague Josh pointed out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/hindscope-is-20-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was sinking</a> at the end of 2016.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s just about been bobbing along. <a href="https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/972909677/app-ranking?app_slug=972909677&amp;market_slug=ios&amp;device=iphone&amp;type=ranks&amp;date=2020-12-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppAnnie&#8217;s rankings</a> indicate that it&#8217;s essentially among the top 100 social networking apps in most markets &#8212; maybe not a bad figure considering how big app stores are now &#8212; although when looking at overall rankings, Periscope is generally too low to register in any major markets.</p>
<p>Indeed, it&#8217;s definitely not an app that has much buzz, not least because of its owner being popular, but also because video fads have taken a different, TikTok-style turn of late.</p>
<p>The TikTok effect is an interesting one to consider here. Earlier this year it was reported that Twitter was among those interested in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-tiktok-have-held-preliminary-talks-about-possible-combination-11596925449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potentially acquiring TikTok</a> when the popular app, owned by China&#8217;s ByteDance, found itself in some regulatory hot water over national security interests (that is a different story, still playing out and seemingly in limbo right now). Some of the apparent reasoning for Twitter&#8217;s interest? It never really got past its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/haunted-by-regret-over-killing-vine-twitter-purportedl-1844667451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regret</a> over killing off Vine.</p>
<p>Vine, if you recall, was the popular short-form video app that Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/if-twitter-gets-into-the-video-hosting-game-it-could-be-a-wonderful-and-horrible-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired</a>, grew <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/08/just-six-months-after-being-acquired-twitters-vine-hits-1-free-spot-on-apples-app-store/?_ga=2.21372859.1070664616.1607334007-209244718.1579131500">really well for a while</a> as it saw it gain some entertaining virality, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/twitter-is-shutting-down-vine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">then shut down</a> to focus more attention on &#8212; yep &#8212; Periscope.</p>
<p>Many in retrospect have wondered &#8220;what could have been&#8221; had Twitter held on to Vine and put the effort and investment into building it out. (Or indeed, what could have happened <a href="https://twitter.com/rus/status/791681274339622913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E791681274339622913%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2016%2F10%2F27%2Ftwitter-is-shutting-down-vine%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">if it never sold to Twitter in the first place</a>, but that is also a different story.)</p>
<p>If Periscope sinking away is on the cards, it&#8217;s a question that probably still bears asking &#8212; what could have been? Even with live video within Twitter&#8217;s app, it&#8217;s not the star of the show. One can&#8217;t help but wonder if live video might next appear front and center elsewhere, made by a different company, much like short-form video finally had its day in a ByteDance way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s official. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boston-dynamics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boston-dynamics">Boston Dynamics <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is becoming part of the Hyundai family (pending regulatory approval, naturally). The Waltham, Massachusetts-based robot maker confirmed in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyundai-motor-group-to-acquire-controlling-interest-in-boston-dynamics-from-softbank-group-opening-a-new-chapter-in-the-robotics-and-mobility-industry-301191028.html">a press release</a> today that the South Korean technology company is acquiring controlling interest. The deal, which values the company at $1.1 billion, gives Hyundai Motor Group an 80% stake, with SoftBank controlling the remaining 20%.</p>
<p>The transaction marks the Spot-maker’s third change of hands in a mere seven years. After nearly a quarter-century operating as a research firm (with some big financial help from organizations like DARPA), it sold to Google in 2013, becoming part of a new robotics wing led by then-executive Andy Rubin.</p>
<p>After Google X Robotics was largely dissolved, Boston Dynamics changed hands in 2017, becoming a subsidiary of Japanese investment giant <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/softbank" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="softbank">SoftBank <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. It was an odd fit for the company, and a rough year for SoftBank likely hasn’t helped matters. At the very least, Hyundai is a more logical home for the company, after being owned by a firm whose best-known robot is Pepper, the humanoid hospitality &#8216;bot.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iSxz07VGq1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/hyundai-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-softbank-owned-boston-dynamics/">Hyundai reportedly in talks to buy SoftBank-owned Boston Dynamics</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hyundai reportedly in talks to buy SoftBank-owned Boston Dynamics&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/hyundai-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-softbank-owned-boston-dynamics/embed/#?secret=iSxz07VGq1" data-secret="iSxz07VGq1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As we noted while reporting on earlier rumors about the acquisition, Hyundai has been making some big investments in the category. The list includes a recent joint venture with Aptiv to commercialize autonomous driving systems. There’s also the recently announced ultimate mobility vehicles, or UMV &#8212; a borderline sci-fi vehicle with legs.</p>
<p>“Boston Dynamics’ commercial business has grown rapidly as we&#8217;ve brought to market the first robot that can automate repetitive and dangerous tasks in workplaces designed for human-level mobility,&#8221; CEO Rob Playter said in a release tied to the deal. &#8220;We and Hyundai share a view of the transformational power of mobility and look forward to working together to accelerate our plans to enable the world with cutting edge automation, and to continue to solve the world’s hardest robotics challenges for our customers.”</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics, of course, has been blurring the lines between science fiction and reality for several decades now. More recently, however, it’s taken a much stronger interest in commercializing its advanced technologies. Under SoftBank, the company launched Spot, a quadruped robot that draws on years of robotic innovation, including the iconic Big Dog.</p>
<p>Spot went up for sale last year in limited quantities. It’s now available for anyone in the U.S. with $74,500 burning a hole in their pocket. The company is also pushing to commercialize its wheeled Handle robot for warehouse and fulfillment related purposes. That robot is due out some time next year. While the sophistication and resulting price tags for the company’s robots have drawn a fair bit of skepticism, investors have taken increased interest in robots and automation firms in the wake of year-long COVID-19-related shutdowns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hyundai Motor Group will provide Boston Dynamics a strategic partner affording access to Hyundai Motor Group’s in-house manufacturing capability and cost benefits stemming from efficiencies of scale,&#8221; according to the release. &#8220;Boston Dynamics will benefit substantially from new capital, technology, affiliated customers, and Hyundai Motor Group’s global market reach enhancing commercialization opportunity for its robot products.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close in by June.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Open banking platforms, where services that might not have previously lived next to each other are now joined up by way of APIs, has been one of the emerging trends of the last couple of years, and today one of the leaders in the space out of Europe has closed a round of funding to expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="http://tink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tink</a>, a startup out of Stockholm, Sweden that aggregates a number of banks and financial services by way of an API so that those can in turn be accessed via new channels, has raised €85 million (or $103 million at current rates), at a post-money valuation of €680 million (or around $825 million). It plans to use the capital to double down on expanding its network of banks and payment services in Europe. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tink" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tink">Tink <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> already links up 3,400 banks, covering some 250 million people, with partners including PayPal, NatWest, ABN AMRO, BNP Paribas, Nordea and SEB, some of which are also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/tink-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategic investors</a>. On the other side, it has some 8,000 developers using its APIs.</p>
<p>This latest tranche of funding is being co-led by new investor Eurazeo Growth and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dawn-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dawn-capital">Dawn Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with PayPal Ventures, HMI Capital, Heartcore, ABN AMRO Ventures, Poste Italiane and BNP Paribas’ venture arm, Opera Tech Ventures, also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding comes less than a year after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/19/tink-raises-e90m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced a round of €90 million</a> ($105 million) in January 2020, and is more specifically an extension of that round. For context, that previous round was at a €415 million ($503 million) valuation, and the company has definitely grown since then: in January it said it had 2,500 banking partners in its network. It has now raised €175 million in total.</p>
<p>The last year &#8212; shaped by a global health pandemic &#8212; has been all about bringing more services online and into the cloud, so people and businesses that can no longer do things like banking or selling/shopping in person can still get things done. That has most definitely played out strongly in the world of financial services, with banks, bank competitors and their tech partners seeing a surge in demand for more flexible, digital channels.</p>
<p>“Despite the difficulties of 2020, it was a year of great growth for Tink,&#8221; said Daniel Kjellén, co-founder and CEO of Tink, in a statement. &#8220;2020 has seen payments powered by open banking take-off, and in 2021 we expect to see this scale – most prominently in the UK, followed by Europe. This funding extension will further facilitate the development of our payment initiation services across Europe, while continuing to deliver new data-products built on open banking technology to our customers.”</p>
<p>Tink is not the only company that is looking to capitalize on this. Just earlier this week, another startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/unit-raises-18-6m-to-offer-banking-features-as-a-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unit, came out of stealth with $18.6 million in funding</a>. It also has ambitions to provide a way to integrate banking features, and banks, into environments where they might have not previously existed. Others also linking up financial services and helping them integrate into other platforms and apps include Plaid and Rapyd.</p>
<p>Plaid is in the process of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting acquired by Visa</a> for $5.3 billion, although that deal is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/doj-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visas-5-3-billion-acquisition-of-plaid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently under antitrust scrutiny</a>. Rapyd remains VC-backed and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/rapyd-which-offers-fintech-as-a-service-via-a-single-api-adds-20m-more-to-its-coffers-at-a-1-2b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last valued at $1.3 billion</a>. The proliferation and growth of these might prove to be a strong argument in favor of the market not being sewn up by Plaid (no pun intended), although having one owned by a single payments giant would definitely shift how the market is evolving.</p>

<p>&#8220;The open banking movement continues to pick up pace, with 2021 showing every sign that it will bring increased collaboration between fintechs and large enterprises, who want to take digitally enabled services to their customers with a tried and trusted partner,&#8221; said Zoé Fabian, MD of Eurazeo Growth, in a statement. &#8220;Since its inception eight years ago, Tink has proven itself to be the leading open banking platform in Europe, and our investment underlines the confidence we and the industry have in Tink and open banking. We look forward to supporting them on their continued journey.”</p>
<p>Tink&#8217;s business is based around payment initiation technology, providing easy integrations into existing banking services, and then making a commission on transactions that subsequently take place. The company said that it currently processes around 1 million payment transactions per month in five markets.</p>
<p>Although it doesn&#8217;t specify the value of those transactions, or how much it makes itself, it notes that current customers include Kivra, a digital mailbox provider with 4 million adults in Sweden; and, as of earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/lydia-partners-with-tink-to-improve-open-banking-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">payment fintech Lydia</a>, with over 5 million customers. It is live in Sweden, U.K., France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands and the plan is to expand to 10 markets in 2021.</p>

<p>While the company will be using the funding to expand partnerships and its footprint, it&#8217;s also not shying away from inorganic growth. This year it made no less than three acquisitions to expand its business &#8212; a sign also of how there is likely more consolidation to come as not every company can find the scale and funding to grow in the current market. Tink&#8217;s acquisitions included Swedish credit decisioning firm Instantor, to expand in credit risk products; Spanish account aggregation provider Eurobits; and U.K. aggregation platform OpenWrks.</p>
<p>“Tink has truly emerged as Europe&#8217;s leading open banking platform and is quickly becoming a key strategic piece of financial technology infrastructure,&#8221; said Josh Bell, general partner of Dawn, in a statement. &#8220;We have seen activity across Tink&#8217;s network rapidly accelerate this year, with increasing adoption and implementation of open banking products and services across their platform. We are delighted to support Tink’s latest funding round, and look forward to working with the team across 2021 to expand the breadth and depth of its already considerable network of banks, accelerate the rollout of its account-to-account payments initiation solutions, and continue to deliver exceptional value to its fast-growing customer base.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">All over the world startups are piling into the space marked “virtual interaction and collaboration”. What if a startup created a sort of &#8220;Club Penguin for adults&#8221;?</p>
<p>Step forward <a href="http://cosmos.video">Cosmos Video</a>, which has a virtual venues platform that allows people to work, hang out and socialize together. It has now raised $2.6 million in seed funding from LocalGlobe, with participation from Entrepreneur First, Andy Chung and Philipp Moehring (AngelList), and Omid Ashtari (former president of Citymapper).</p>
<p>Founders Rahul Goyal and Karan Baweja previously led product teams at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/citymapper-limited" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="citymapper-limited">Citymapper <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and TransferWise, respectively.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cosmos allows users to create virtual venues by combining game mechanics with video chat. The idea is to bring back the kinds of serendipitous interactions we used to have in the real world. You choose an avatar, then meet up with their colleagues or friends inside a browser-based game. As you move your avatars closer to another person you can video chat with them, as you might in real life.</p>
<p>The competition is the incumbent video conferencing platforms such as Zoom and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Teams, but calls on these platforms have a set agenda, and are timeboxed &#8212; they’re rigid and repetitive. On Cosmos you sit on the screen and consume one video call after another as you move around the space, so it is mimicking serendipity, after a fashion.</p>
<p>As well as having a social application, office colleagues can work collaboratively on tools such as whiteboards, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> documents and Figma, play virtual board games or gather around a table to chat.</p>
<p>Cosmos is currently being used in private beta by a select group of companies to host their offices and for social events such as Christmas parties. Others are using it to host events, meetup groups and family gatherings.</p>
<p>Co-founder Rahul Goyal said in a statement: “Once the pandemic hit, we both saw productivity surge in our respective teams but at the same time, people were missing the in-office culture. Video conferencing platforms provide a great service when it comes to meetings, but they lack spontaneity. Cosmos is a way to bring back that human connection we lack when we spend all day online, by providing a virtual world where you can play a game of trivia or pong after work with colleagues or gather round a table to celebrate a friend’s birthday.”</p>
<p>George Henry, partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/localglobe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="localglobe">LocalGlobe, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said: “We were really impressed with the vision and potential of Cosmos. Scaling live experiences online is one of the big internet frontiers where there are still so many opportunities. Now that the video infrastructure is in place, we believe products like Cosmos will enable new forms of live online experiences.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/massachusetts-votes-to-pass-statewide-police-ban-on-facial-recognition/">returned a police reform bill</a> back to the state legislature, asking lawmakers to strike out several provisions — including one for a statewide ban on police and public authorities using facial recognition technology, the first of its kind in the United States.</p>
<p>The bill, which also banned police from using rubber bullets and tear gas, was passed on December 1 by both the state&#8217;s House and Senate after senior lawmakers overcame months of deadlock to reach a consensus. Lawmakers brought the bill to the state legislature in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/diversity-equity-inclusion-overview/">the killing of George Floyd</a>, an unarmed Black man who was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer, later charged with his murder.</p>
<p>Baker said in a letter to lawmakers that he objected to the ban, saying the use of facial recognition helped to convict several criminals, including a child sex offender and a double murderer.</p>
<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/12/10/metro/baker-sends-police-bill-back-legislature-asking-changes/">with The Boston Globe</a>, Baker said that he&#8217;s &#8220;not going to sign something that is going to ban facial recognition.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A beginner&#8217;s guide to diversity, equity and inclusion&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/diversity-equity-inclusion-overview/embed/#?secret=jdYJ3iy5fv" data-secret="jdYJ3iy5fv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Under the bill, police and public agencies across the state would be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/massachusetts-votes-to-pass-statewide-police-ban-on-facial-recognition/">prohibited from using facial recognition</a>, with a single exception to run facial recognition searches against the state’s driver license database with a warrant. The state would be required to publish annual transparency figures on the number of searches made by officers going forward.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts House voted to pass by 92-67, and the Senate voted 28-12 — neither of which were veto-proof majorities.</p>
<p>The Boston Globe said that Baker did not outright say he would veto the bill. After the legislature hands a revised (or the same) version of the bill back to the governor, it&#8217;s up to Baker to sign it, veto it or — under Massachusetts law, he could allow it to become law without his signature by waiting 10 days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unchecked police use of surveillance technology also harms everyone’s rights to anonymity, privacy, and free speech. We urge the legislature to reject Governor Baker&#8217;s amendment and to ensure passage of commonsense regulations of government use of face surveillance,&#8221; said Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Baker&#8217;s office did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.swellenergy.com/">Swell Energy</a>, an installer and manager of residential renewable energy, energy efficiency and storage technologies, is raising $450 million to finance the construction of four virtual power plants representing a massive amount of energy storage capacity paired with solar power generation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a sign of the distributed nature of renewable energy development and a transition from large-scale power generation projects feeding into utility grids at their edge to smaller, point solutions distributed at the actual points of consumption.</p>
<p>The project will pair 200 megawatt hours of distributed energy storage with 100 megawatts of solar photovoltaic capacity, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Los Angeles-based Swell was commissioned by utilities across three states to establish the dispatchable energy storage capacity, which will be made available through the construction and aggregation of approximately 14,000 solar energy generation and storage systems. The goal is to make local grids more efficient.</p>
<p>To finance these projects &#8212; and others the company expects to land &#8212; Swell has cut a deal with Ares Management Corp. and Aligned Climate Capital to create a virtual power plant financing vehicle with a target of $450 million.</p>
<p>That financing entity will support the development of power projects like the combined solar and battery agreement nationwide.</p>
<p>Over the next 20 years, Swell is targeting the development of over 3,000 gigawatt hours of clean solar energy production, with customers storing 1,000 gigawatt hours for later use, and dispatching 200 gigawatt hours of this stored energy back to the utility grid.</p>
<p>It has the potential to create a more resilient grid less susceptible to the kinds of power outages and rolling blackouts that have plagued states like California.</p>
<p>“Utilities are increasingly looking to distributed energy resources as valuable ‘grid edge’ assets,” said Suleman Khan, CEO of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/swell-energy" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="swell-energy">Swell Energy, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in a statement. “By networking these individual homes and businesses into virtual power plants, Swell is able to bring down the cost of ownership for its customers and help utilities manage demand across their electric grids,” said Khan. “By receiving <i>GridRevenue</i> from Swell, customers participating in our VPP programs pay less for their solar energy generation and storage systems, while potentially reducing the risk of a local power outage, and keeping their homes and businesses securely powered through any outages.”</p>
<p>Along with the launch of the virtual power plant financing vehicle, Swell is also giving homeowners a way to finance their home energy systems through Swell. They need the buy-in from homeowners to get these power plants off the ground, and for homeowners, there&#8217;s a way to get some money back by feeding power into the grid.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a win-win for the company, customers and early investors like Urban.us, which was seed investor in the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disney just wrapped up the first segment of an investor day in which it laid out its plans for its direct-to-consumer streaming business, including Disney+, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hulu" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hulu">Hulu, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> ESPN+ and Hotstar/Star.</p>
<p>The company kicked off the presentation with some new subscriber numbers — 86.8 million for Disney+ (roughly 30% of those are subscribers to Disney+ Hotstar, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/disney-plus-india-launched-netflix-amazon-prime-video/"> leveraged an existing streaming service in India</a>), 38.8 million for Hulu and 11.5 million for ESPN+, adding up to more than 137 million subscribers across the company&#8217;s streaming business.</p>
<p>The rest of the event is expected to focus on content announcements and previews, but Chairman of Media and Entertainment Distribution Kareem Daniel has already hinted at big plans for the next &#8220;few years.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While high-profile Disney+&#8217;s originals have largely been limited to &#8220;The Mandalorian&#8221; and &#8220;Hamilton&#8221; in year one, Daniels said the company has plans to launch 10 Marvel series, 10 Star Wars series, 15 Disney Animation/Disney live action/Pixar series and 15 Disney Animation/Disney live action/Pixar feature films exclusively on Disney+.</p>
<p>At the same time, Daniel said that Disney remains committed to a variety of distribution strategies, particularly &#8220;theatrical exhibition’s ability to establish major franchises.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FhrWdi4jZu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/disney-73-million-subscribers/">Disney+ has more than 73M subscribers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Disney+ has more than 73M subscribers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/disney-73-million-subscribers/embed/#?secret=FhrWdi4jZu" data-secret="FhrWdi4jZu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He also announced that the Disney Animation film &#8220;Raya and the Dragon&#8221; will follow the same distribution strategy as &#8220;Mulan&#8221; this fall, with the film launching simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ as a Premier Access release that subscribers will need to pay extra to see.</p>
<p>The presentation also made it clear that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/disney-plus-india-launched-netflix-amazon-prime-video/">the Hotstar/Star brand will be key to Disney&#8217;s international growth plans</a>. In Latin America, the company plans to launch a standalone Star+ service, while a new Star section in the Disney+ app will become the home to &#8220;general entertainment&#8221; content (basically, the kinds of content that U.S. viewers will find on Hulu) in other markets like Europe.</p>
<p>Adding a Star section will mean introducing mature content to Disney+, which was previously limited to family-friendly content. So Disney also offered a quick demonstration of new parental controls that will allow subscribers to turn access to more mature content on and off — that should also introduce new content to other parts of Disney+, for example bringing the R-rated film &#8220;Logan&#8221; to the Marvel section.</p>
<p>You can also expect to see more integrations between different Disney streaming services. For example, Star+ will include content from ESPN, while Hulu will introduce the ability to subscribe and watch ESPN+ content directly in the app.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re a subscriber to the Disney bundle, which combines Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for $12.99 per month, the company plans to add a new tier in January that offers ad-free Hulu for an extra $6 per month.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> And now we have some details on those shows. On the Star Wars side, they include two series developed by &#8220;Mandalorian&#8221; executive producers Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni — &#8220;Rangers of the New Republic&#8221; and a spinoff focused on Ahsoka Tano, the beloved &#8220;Clone Wars&#8221; character who recently made the jump to live action on &#8220;The Mandalorian.&#8221; Lucasfilm&#8217;s Kathleen Kennedy said the three shows will come together in a &#8220;climactic storytelling event.&#8221;</p>
<p>There will also be previously announced shows focused on &#8220;Rogue One&#8221; character Cassian Andor and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/23/confirmed-disney-is-making-an-obi-wan-series-with-ewan-mcgregor/">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> — the latter will see the return not just of Ewan McGregor, but also Hayden Christiansen, who played Anakin Skywalker in the prequel trilogy. Plus, a Lando Calrissian series is in the works, as well as &#8220;The Acolyte,&#8221; a series from &#8220;Russian Doll&#8221; writer Leslye Headland.</p>
<p>Kennedy also announced that the next theatrically released Star Wars film will be a Rogue Squadron movie directed by &#8220;Wonder Woman&#8221; director Patty Jenkins, due for release on Christmas 2023.</p>
<p>Beyond Star Wars, Lucasfilm is also developing a &#8220;Willow&#8221; series with Jon M. Chu, plus an adaptation of Tomi Adeyemi&#8217;s &#8220;Childen of Blood and Bone.&#8221; And it plans to start production on the much-delayed fifth Indiana Jones film next spring, with James Mangold directing and Harrison Ford returning, due for release in July 2022.</p>
<p>Non-Marvel, non-Star Wars Disney+ live action shows in development include a &#8220;Mighty Ducks&#8221; sequel with Emilio Estevez and Lauren Graham, a &#8220;Turner and Hooch&#8221; reboot and a &#8220;Swiss Family Robinson&#8221; reboot from Chu and acclaimed &#8220;Battlestar Galactica&#8221; rebooter Ron Moore.</p>
<p>Hulu and FX had a few announcements of their own as well, including a fifth season of &#8220;The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale&#8221; and an &#8220;Alien&#8221; series from Noah Hawley.</p>
<p>Disney will also continue reviving its classic animation titles, with Disney+ Originals including a new version of &#8220;Pinocchio&#8221; directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks, a new version of &#8220;Peter Pan and Wendy&#8221; and &#8220;Sister Act 3&#8221; with Whoopi Goldberg.</p>
<p>And Pixar has three series coming to Disney+, starting with the &#8220;Up&#8221; spinoff &#8220;Dug Days&#8221; next fall, followed by a &#8220;Car&#8221; series and an original show called &#8220;Win or Lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lastly, on the Marvel side, &#8220;WandaVision&#8221; launches on January 15, &#8220;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&#8221; (which Marvel&#8217;s Kevin Feige described as &#8220;a Marvel Studios movie played out over six episodes&#8221;) is coming in March, &#8220;Loki&#8221; in May, &#8220;Ms. Marvel&#8221; sometime next year (and the character will also appear in &#8220;Captain Marvel 2,&#8221; illustrating what Feige called the &#8220;interconnectedness&#8221; of the TV shows and films) and &#8220;Hawkeye&#8221; late next year. Also on the horizon are &#8220;She-Hulk&#8221; with Tatiana Maslany (and Mark Ruffalo returning as the Hulk) and &#8220;Moon Knight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Feige also announced the Disney+ series &#8220;Secret Invasion&#8221; (based on the popular crossover, with Samuel L. Jackson returning as Nick Fury), &#8220;Ironheart&#8221; and an &#8220;Iron Man&#8221; tie-in &#8220;Armor Wars&#8221; with Don Cheadle. And there&#8217;s a &#8220;Guardians of the Galaxy&#8221; holiday special written and directed by James Gunn due out in Christmas 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">stunning</a> debut of the food delivery company <a href="https://www.doordash.com/en-US">DoorDash</a> on the public market this week has plenty of people puzzled. While undeniably <a href="https://secondmeasure.com/datapoints/food-delivery-services-grubhub-uber-eats-doordash-postmates/">fast-growing</a>, the unprofitable delivery company has come <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doordash-still-be-pocketing-tips-despite-pay-model-change-2019-8">under fire</a> numerous times over its <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/01/19/doordash-drivers-make-an-average-of-145-an-hour-analysis-finds/">employment practices</a>, and its IPO, like that of other gig-economy companies, leaves a lot of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d75f4dd3-6f48-4fea-93e8-4f60172aa9cf">economic issues unresolved</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">So why is a company that lost $667 million in 2019 and $149 million in the first nine months of 2020 &#8212; during a period of hypergrowth because of the pandemic &#8212; being valued at $55.8 billion by public market investors? Have they lost their minds?</p>
<p class="p1"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/saar-gur" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="saar-gur">Saar Gur <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> thinks he has answers to such questions. Gur, a longtime general partner with the early-stage venture firm <a href="https://crv.com/">CRV</a>, was able to write a check to DoorDash in its earliest rounds, including its seed, Series A and Series B financings, and we gather the firm&#8217;s stake in the business will return multitudes of the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/crvvc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="crvvc">CRV <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> fund from which those checks came. In short, he&#8217;s very far from biased. However, in a call earlier today, he painted a picture of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="doordash">DoorDash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wherein it not only becomes profitable but is 10 times larger than it is today. It was an interesting conversation, one that has been edited lightly for length and clarity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>TC: You wrote a seed check to DoorDash. Did you seek out the company or did the team pitch CRV?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">SG: I went on this hunt, looking for Tony. [Rival delivery service] Postmates had started two-and-a-half to three years earlier, and I thought the founder was great [but I wasn&#8217;t sure about investing]. Another company, Fluc, was run by this very scrappy entrepreneur, Adam, who was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/27/fluc-a-lyft-for-food-launches-in-san-francisco-and-mountain-view/">getting some buzz</a> in Palo Alto, and I was quite curious and met the team because we were in the food business and knew a lot of restaurant owners; my wife was a food entrepreneur and built this chain of homemade yogurt stores called Fraiche.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WjMuhY0gAO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">DoorDash, C3.ai skyrocket in public market debuts</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DoorDash, C3.ai skyrocket in public market debuts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/embed/#?secret=WjMuhY0gAO" data-secret="WjMuhY0gAO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p1">So I emailed my friend Misty, who was the general manager at the time of <a href="https://orenshummus.com/">Oren&#8217;s Hummus</a> on University Avenue [in Palo Alto] and said, &#8216;We&#8217;re looking at this company, Fluc, and we&#8217;d love to get your thoughts.&#8217; And she said, &#8216;The team at Fluc is okay; their technology is better [than some others], but they don&#8217;t understand our problems in a way that&#8217;s truly helpful to us. You should talk to these kids out of Stanford at DoorDash.&#8217;</p>
<p class="p1">If there&#8217;s any skill in investing, it&#8217;s not just confirmation bias of investing in Fluc [whose founders later moved on] but we did a hard pivot and chased down the DoorDash team. We met them at Fraiche in Palo Alto, and from that moment, it was like we were finishing each other&#8217;s sentences.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>TC: What did you talk about?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">SG: The team from day one talked about building a logistics company. For example, they understood Oren&#8217;s Hummus, which at that time was quite popular but had limited front-of-house seating and a big kitchen in the back. And [co-founder and CEO] Tony [Xu] and [co-founder turned VC] <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-doordash-fourth-cofounder-evan-moore-2020-12">Evan Moore</a> said, &#8216;We want to target customers of popular concepts that have limited [seating] and extra kitchen capacity, and to integrate directly with the kitchen so we don&#8217;t have to interact with front-of-the-house staff.&#8217;</p>
<p>At the time, Postmates had pivoted from waiting in line to get you an iPhone to delivering food, including from Fraiche, but they would send someone to your store, place the order and wait. DoorDash instead put an iPad in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve said that CRV missed out on Uber, that Travis Kalanick left your offices and headed over to Benchmark, where they wouldn&#8217;t let him leave until he signed a term sheet. Do you think Uber could or should have been DoorDash? I met with Travis in 2011, before DoorDash was founded, and he called Uber a logistics company that <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:N2vBq1zyuWMJ:https://www.venturecapitaljournal.com/on-a-ride-with-uber/+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">would deliver food and a lot of other things</a>. Given DoorDash&#8217;s dominant market share, do you think Uber waited too long to jump into deliveries? </strong></p>
<p>SG: The<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> original Uber was not at all about food; it was that ride hailing hadn&#8217;t changed [over time]. Its Series A deck was a picture of a guy holding his hand up and trying to hail a taxi, with no real vision about food &#8212; at least that&#8217;s my recollection. Over time, it became Uber for everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But in terms of what happened, DoorDash launched in Palo Alto. A number of other companies were in San Francisco, and Tony and the team had to decide whether to launch in San Francisco as its next major city or whether to launch somewhere else. And after a number of discussions that I was a part of, they focused on San Jose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Most people don&#8217;t know, but San Jose is something like the 10th largest city in the United States and its layout is much more similar to other mid-tier cities and suburban America than it is to San Francisco. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I think that was one key strategic decision. At the time, [larger rivals] Grubhub and Seamless had proven [the model] in dense cities. It was really <em>not</em> obvious that it would work in San Jose or any suburb.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Clearly, investors are excited about what DoorDash has built &#8212; so excited that its stock went crazy yesterday. Are you, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gurley-doordash-ipo-pop-2020-12">like Bill Gurley</a>, frustrated that money was left on the table by its underwriters? Do you think traditional IPOs are broken?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">SG: I actually started my career at Lehman Brothers on the investment banking team, and so having seen the IPO process, while I can appreciate [frustration that a] company left some money on the table based on the pricing, the tactical challenge [is that] it&#8217;s very hard to predict. You know what the market will bear once it moves to retail investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">What&#8217;s exciting to me is [that] DoorDash is raising money because they are just getting started. I do think this could be a $500 billion-plus company. There&#8217;s so much to be excited about. As for the capital-raising event, I think it&#8217;s hard for the bankers to know where it will land with the broader market, so I&#8217;m not as negative as maybe some others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TC: Five-hundred billion dollars is a big number. How do you get there?</span></strong></p>
<p>SG: Let&#8217;s just start with food delivery. DoorDash&#8217;s suburban market share has grown to more than 60% and its overall U.S. market share is over 52%, so they&#8217;ve won the market in food delivery. And if you look at the [Chinese shopping platform] Meituan and other global food delivery businesses, that alone paints a path where DoorDash should be [valued at] $100 billion, assuming they continue to execute on the path that they&#8217;re on.</p>
<p>But the bigger story to me is, if you go back to U.S. Postal Service, it used to take two weeks to get a letter. Then FedEx launches and all of a sudden the mail seems slow. The [net promoter score] was really high for the USPS until FedEx launched. Or [think of] dial-up [internet access], which was great until [we had] broadband.</p>

<p>What we&#8217;re seeing is that consumers prefer immediacy and this magic ability to press a button and have ice cream delivered in under 25 minutes, or milk, and you start to layer [items on] from there. We&#8217;ve partnered with Macy&#8217;s in December, for example, so if you buy a shirt or a dress, you can now have it at your house in an hour. When you look at the infrastructure that DoorDash has built to deliver on that vision, that&#8217;s where this company looks more like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s dreaming the dream, and that&#8217;s a very different business than ridesharing and Uber&#8217;s core business.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re comparing DoorDash to Amazon, which is a much more capital-intensive business with lots of hard assets. Do you see DoorDash moving in that direction? Relatedly, what kinds of acquisitions would DoorDash be potentially interested in making?</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">SG: The company is always focused on technology first. <a href="https://www.doordash.com/drive/portal/discover">DoorDash Drive</a> is a product that many people don&#8217;t understand but it powers merchants that don&#8217;t want to roll out their own delivery network. Say you go to Walmart.com and order a bunch of groceries. DoorDash is powering those deliveries. Macy&#8217;s wants to roll out one-hour delivery. DoorDash Drive is allowing them to do that. DoorDash also now has a product that&#8217;s purely like a SaaS business that enables larger chains that want to control the whole experience of delivery with their own drivers to do that. Jimmy John&#8217;s [a sandwich chain] is now running its entire order and delivery business with their own drivers, using DoorDash software.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">There are parts of DoorDash that are a true software business, just like AWS, and there are parts of it that are capital-intensive, like <a href="https://blog.doordash.com/introducing-dashmart-1891ecc0257d">Dashmart</a> [that rolled out this summer and which are convenience stores are owned and operated by DoorDash]. Will they buy 7-Eleven or something like that? We saw [delivery startup] goPuff <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/gopuff-acquires-bevmo/">acquire BevMo</a> last month; it&#8217;s not out of the question that there might be a reason to do that. With Dashmart, they already can see a lot of stuff based on data that people want to have immediately.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GjAhsdaYq7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/gopuff-acquires-bevmo/">Delivery startup goPuff acquires BevMo for $350M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Delivery startup goPuff acquires BevMo for $350M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/gopuff-acquires-bevmo/embed/#?secret=GjAhsdaYq7" data-secret="GjAhsdaYq7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>TC: DoorDash has also ventured into the ghost kitchen market, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doordash-ghost-kitchen-silicon-valley-chick-fil-a-photos-2019-11">opening a facility</a> in Redwood City, south of San Francisco. Could this become a bigger initiative?</strong></p>
<p>SG: I think it&#8217;s definitely in the zone. DoorDash can use data and say, you know, you don&#8217;t need to build another Long John Silver or Taco Bell [to get closer to some of your customers]; you use our Redwood City kitchen. We can already show you the data that [highlights how] deliveries that might take an hour could be turned into 15 minutes. They&#8217;re really facilitating the revenue growth of these concepts.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another set of entrepreneurs where they can use the data to say, for example, &#8216;Hey, there is no pizza restaurant in Palo Alto, so we&#8217;re just going to launch Saar&#8217;s Pizza Company to fill that hole and do it cost-effectively because we don&#8217;t need to build a location out with seating and all the building codes involved serving customers in person.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: In the meantime, one reads stories of restaurateurs who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/technology/delivery-apps-restaurants-fees-virus.html">complain about the fees</a> involved in working with DoorDash. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">SG: Having been a restaurant owner, I can tell you, even for my wife, who has a Wharton MBA, it&#8217;s very hard to keep track of all the numbers. You feel like everyone is screwing you; it&#8217;s just really hard to run a small business. So it&#8217;s not based on great data, or even if it is, if you view that DoorDash is adding incremental revenue, and if you understand the concept of marginal profit, then you should continue to sell things as you can make money on the margins of the food and you have the excess kitchen capacity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> If you look, that&#8217;s why DoorDash has signed [roughly] 45 of the top 50 quick-service restaurants. Those are quantitative groups, and they wouldn&#8217;t do it do it for as long as they have and invest in these partnerships if it wasn&#8217;t working. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But there&#8217;s always going to be a sticker shock. </span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Regarding these quick-service restaurants and ghost kitchens, these systems are so efficient that the worry is that mom-and-pop restaurants get wiped out over time. How do you think about that concern?</strong></p>
<p>SG: I think we are<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> social beings and we look for experiences [and] breaking bread with someone is not going away. I think smarter brands will &#8212; just like what we see in retail with physical locations and online locations &#8212; [be both offline and online]. Smarter concepts will understand how to build those brands across channels. And then I still think that the Saisons of the world and The French Laundry will only continue to to do well post-COVID as people look for these experiences of how to be together and share food, which is a passion of many folks.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: How does DoorDash itself become profitable? </strong></p>
<p>SG: If you check the facts, this summer the company was actually profitable. Not only that, they gave $120 million, or they give credit, to other small businesses, in support of COVID, so had they not done that, they actually would have produced quite a bit of cash.</p>
<p>With a company like DoorDash, you have to sell a big vision and be able to recruit, but you also need to be highly quantitative, and Tony has always been able to spit out numbers that are accurate and set goals that are very quantitative. And while they&#8217;re not profitable in the newer markets [because they are growing], they&#8217;ve got the cohorts to show you not only how they&#8217;re profitable in older markets but how their profitability expands over time in those markets.</p>
<p>At any point, they could kind of slow their growth and become more profitable, but that&#8217;s not the playbook.</p>

This means that it&#8217;s one step closer to beginning to be administered to people in special circumstances &#8212; including for front-line healthcare workers dealing with healthcare facilities stressed to the breaking point due to the ongoing and rising pandemic crisis in the U.S., which continues to break grim records for single-day death counts among afflicted patients.</p>

<p>The Pfizer/BionNTech vaccine is an mRNA vaccine, which means that it provides a set of instructions to a person&#8217;s cells to prompt them to begin creating antibodies that are effective against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that leads to COVID-19. So far, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/pfizer-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-is-95-effective-in-final-clinical-trial-results-analysis/">vaccine has been shown to be 95% effective according to Pfizer&#8217;s own final trial data</a>. Based on the strength of those Phase 3 results, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/pfizer-and-biontech-to-submit-request-for-emergency-use-approval-of-their-covid-19-vaccine-today/">Pfizer applied for an EUA from the FDA toward the end of November</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Already, Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine has been approved for use in other countries, including Canada, where the national health regulator cleared it earlier this week. The FDA&#8217;s EUA process involves reviewing key information about efficacy and safety, and the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-holds-advisory-committee-meeting-discuss-authorization-covid-19?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">agency says that it has &#8220;reviewed thousands of pages of technical information&#8221;</a> about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, including materials related to its development and manufacturing, as well as the results of its clinical trials to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disney+, the on-demand streaming service that launched a year ago and has already courted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/disney-investor-day/">over 86 million subscribers</a>, is ready to expand to more international markets.</p>
<p>At its annual investor day Thursday, the American entertainment giant announced a new streaming brand called “Star” that will feature content from ABC, FX and 20th Century Studios.</p>
<p>In some markets, such <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/with-lower-bandwidth-disney-opens-streaming-service-in-uk-ireland-5-other-european-countries-france-to-come-online-april-7/">as Europe</a>, Canada, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, Star will be unveiled to customers as a new hub within Disney+ app beginning February 20 next year, the company said. It will expand Star to more markets next year, the company said, but it did not identify those markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Star will come at a price: The company said it will be increasing the monthly subscription price of Disney+ from £5.99 to £8.99 in Europe. The tariff will be similarly adjusted (raised) in every other market where Disney+ subscribers get access to Star, the company said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085892" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085892" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2085892 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/star-brand.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/star-brand.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/star-brand.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/star-brand.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/star-brand.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/star-brand.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/star-brand.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085892" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Disney</p></div></p>
<p>In Latin America, Star will be a standalone streaming service and offered under the brand name “Star+.” The service will launch there in June 2021, and will feature general entertainment movies and television shows as well as a lineup of live sports &#8212; thanks to ESPN &#8212; including soccer and tennis.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement appears to be an admission that Hulu, another streaming service owned by Disney and which has amassed about 39 million subscribers, might never go international.</p>
<p>Disney also hinted that it plans to expand Disney+ Hotstar, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/08/disney-plus-hotstar-subscribers-india/">on-demand streaming service it currently offers in India and Indonesia</a>, to more markets, but it did not name those markets. The company said that Disney+ Hotstar accounts for roughly 30% of Disney+’s subscriber base &#8212; which roughly translates to 26 million. Disney+ Hotstar had about 18 million subscribers at the end of September, the company revealed last month.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pDZ87ey0CJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/08/disney-plus-hotstar-subscribers-india/">Disney+ Hotstar has about 8 million subscribers</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Hotstar had millions of subscribers before Disney rebranded the service in India earlier this year. The streaming service became part of Disney <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/disney-closes-it-71-3b-fox-acquisition/">as part of the acquisition of Fox</a>, which owned Hotstar-operator Star India (<a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc/status/1337158216392687616">a different Star!</a> Star India operates dozens of TV channels in India and is now owned by Disney.)</p>
<p>Disney has used a similar strategy of relying on existing regional properties and industry collaborations to expand to several other international markets. In France, for instance, the service is available through a partnership with Canal. In Spain, with Moviestar.</p>
