										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just over 24 hours into its open beta, <a href="https://app.visionrare.com/dealflow">Visionrare</a>, which launched an NFT marketplace for &#8220;fantasy startup investing,&#8221; is temporarily shutting down and refunding users who purchased shares, saying it will relaunch soon as a free-to-play game.</p>
<p>The platform allowed users to bid on auctions of fake NFT shares of real startups, building up a quasi-portfolio that they could compete in a fantasy sports-styled league around who could build the most &#8220;profitable&#8221; portfolio. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/fantasy-equity-nft-game-wants-you-to-spend-real-money-buying-fake-shares-of-real-startups/">As we noted in our coverage of the startup&#8217;s launch yesterday</a>, they didn&#8217;t have the permission of most of the startups that they were selling synthetic shares in.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://app.visionrare.com/dealflow">note</a> posted to the company&#8217;s auction marketplace this morning, the founders noted that they had &#8220;underestimated the legal complexities&#8221; with selling novelty NFT shares in real startups and were temporarily shutting down the marketplace and refunding users as they planned out a pivot. In a message on the company&#8217;s public Discord channel, the team noted it had already processed all of the credit card refunds to buyers, though some refunds may still be pending due to Stripe processing.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The platform and its founders had received some substantial pushback after Visionrare&#8217;s launch yesterday, with various tech entrepreneurs and investors questioning whether the platform was legal, whether it was a security, whether the NFT platform was taunting the SEC and/or whether this was finally the sign of the market&#8217;s &#8220;top&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>Visionrare&#8217;s founders say they aren&#8217;t done with the idea of &#8220;fantasy startup investing&#8221; quite yet, but that they are going to have to rethink how the platform is fundamentally structured.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the coming days, we will re-launch Visionrare as a completely free-to-play game. All players start with a fixed amount of credits that they can use to build their startup portfolio, and they can compete in leagues based on how well their portfolios perform in the real world. Down the line, we&#8217;ll figure out if and how we can add a financial element again,&#8221; the founders&#8217; blog post reads.</span></p>

As teased in March, the Tinder app <a href="https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/lyft-and-tinder-first-impression" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">now includes</a> an Explore hub that lets you buy a Lyft ride for your date.

<p>The credit is only useful for dropoffs within a half-mile of a set destination, and you&#8217;ll get a refund for any unused credit. You don&#8217;t have to worry that your would-be beau will travel to the other end of town, in other words.</p>
<p>The motivations are fairly obvious here.

<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise expects to leap from a limited commercial robotaxi and delivery service that will start in earnest in 2022 to a business of &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of its purpose-built Origin AVs on the road over the next few years.</p>
<p>The eye-popping projections will be reached, according to CEO Dan Ammann, through a combination of regulatory approvals, capital from investors and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cruise-secures-5b-credit-line-to-buy-electric-autonomous-cruise-origin-vehicles-from-gm/">$5 billion credit line from GM Financial</a> and technological breakthroughs, including a 90% reduction in compute costs over the next four years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the next 12 to 24 months, you will be able to push a button and get a ride with a very short ETA in a couple of major cities in the United States,&#8221; said Ammann. &#8220;If you look at the next three to four years, we will be deployed in multiple cities, multiple markets around the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are seriously bold claims, but the company appears to be laying down some of the groundwork to back them up. Just last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/cruise-waymo-get-ok-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">Cruise received its driverless deployment permit</a>, which allows the company to begin charging for autonomous services, from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. It just needs one more permit from the California Public Utilities Commission to operate a commercial robotaxi service in San Francisco. Cruise says that reality is only months away.</p>
<p>The $5 billion line of credit from GM Financial, which Cruise secured this summer, will be used to pay for the production of the Origin without having to give away more equity to investors. Separately, GM has invested a total of $6 billion in Cruise, including the initial acquisition cost, operating costs for 2015 to 2016, and further investments, according to the company.</p>
<p>The question is whether all this is enough to help Cruise scale up into the thousands of vehicles at a lower cost per mile than a human driver service over the next half a decade.</p>
</div>
<div class="p-rich_text_block" dir="auto">
<p>Cruise laid out its plan to go from a limited commercial AV service to tens of thousands of vehicles in a short span during GM&#8217;s Investor Event on Wednesday. Let&#8217;s dive into the claims.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>From product-market fit to rapid scaleup</h2>
<p>Ammann broke down Cruise&#8217;s path to market into three phases. The first was the R&amp;D phase, which took the company to the beginning of driverless testing at the end of last year and into this year. Phase two, which will begin next year, will be early commercialization via the retrofitted Chevy Bolt EV-based fleet of Cruise vehicles, which are currently on the roads in San Francisco and Phoenix, Arizona. During this time, Cruise wants to demonstrate product-market fit with a minimum viable product.</p>
<p>Phase three, the &#8220;rapid scaling phase,&#8221; begins in 2023, when production of the Cruise Origin will begin at GM&#8217;s Zero Assembly Plant, a factory dedicated to the production of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that first year, we&#8217;ll be building what can be measured in thousands, and in 2024 we&#8217;ll be thinking about things measured in tens of thousands,&#8221; said Ammann.</p>
<p>Having GM as a backer for OEM-level production of vehicles will be a huge advantage for Cruise, said the CEO. The Origin will be built off the same Ultium platform that GM has built to support a wide range of products across its brands, which should enable faster production.</p>
<p>The company also invested in the technology and software tools needed to ramp up the rate of improvement of Origin&#8217;s autonomous system, which is ultimately a platform that allows AI and robotics to develop together in a closed-loop system.</p>
<p>Part of that investment went into Cruise&#8217;s simulation software, through which the Origin will largely be validated. It&#8217;s already begun virtual autonomous testing, even though it has not gone out onto public roads yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal in the medium to longer term for everybody working on this is to get to low-cost generalized autonomy,&#8221; said Ammann. &#8220;We want fully autonomous driving, we want it to work everywhere and we want it to be really inexpensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Throwing obvious shade at Tesla, Ammann said that while some companies are trying to solve the autonomy problem by working their way up from a low-cost Level 2 autonomous system, which translates to an advanced driver assistance system, Cruise&#8217;s approach is to solve the hardest problem first: getting the human out of the loop and doing so in one of the most complex driving environments – downtown San Francisco.</p>

<h2 class="p-rich_text_section">Driving costs down with technological advancements</h2>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">It might seem counterproductive, but Cruise says it has thrown a lot of money into the compute power of the Origin to get it to a place where it&#8217;ll be able to commercialize and scale profitably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though the technology carries a higher cost, we&#8217;re able to amortize that cost over a high-utilization fleet, high-mileage vehicle, and do that at a compelling cost point,&#8221; said Ammann. &#8220;The cost advantage of the Origin relative to a retrofitted vehicle, even including a Bolt AV, is about 60% to 70% lower cost per mile.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, Cruise has plans to bring down the cost of that compute power over the next four generations by 90%. One way to do this is to start manufacturing custom silicon, which Cruise says will help it both scale compute use and cut costs. Ammann didn&#8217;t go into detail about what it will use the silicon for &#8212; a tidbit that will be touched upon further at the company&#8217;s &#8220;Under the Hood&#8221; recruitment event in November &#8212; but at the very least, the company is signaling a move toward vertical integration.</p>
<p>Considering the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/gm-extends-chevy-bolt-ev-production-shutdown-through-mid-october/">damage the semiconductor shortage has done to GM&#8217;s production lines</a> and the fact GM has just announced a supplier agreement with Wolfspeed to provide silicon carbide semiconductors for GM&#8217;s EV program, it&#8217;s probably safe to say Cruise has put chips on the menu. Others in the industry, like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-tesla-designing-chips-train-self-driving-tech/">Tesla,</a> are also securing the supplies and production of their own silicon chips.</p>
<h2>Cheaper than a human by nature</h2>
<p>The Origin is purpose-built to provide excellent customer service at a low cost for both ride-hail and delivery, said Ammann. The vehicle itself is only as long as a Chevy Cruze, but the inside will be optimized to provide plenty of space to make for a pleasant ride-hail experience. It&#8217;ll also be able to convert from passenger mode to delivery mode, complete with a delivery unit that can slide in and out multiple times within a 24-hour operating cycle to make the most use of each vehicle.</p>
<p>Cruise thinks within just a few years, its Origin will be able to outstrip Uber and Lyft with cheaper prices and higher revenues. In some cities, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/07/1025534409/lyft-and-uber-prices-are-high-wait-times-are-long-and-drivers-are-scarce">Uber and Lyft prices are up almost 80%</a> from pre-pandemic prices, but the companies are still &#8220;not materially profitable today,&#8221; said Ammann. That&#8217;s due to their business model, he claimed. In San Francisco today, a rider is paying about $5 per mile, three-quarters of which probably goes to the driver and the rest gets spent on funding expenses and other costs, which results in companies just breaking even.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two fundamental differences in our model, the first being that we don&#8217;t split the revenue &#8212; we get all the revenue,&#8221; said Ammann. &#8220;Because we have a lower cost structure, we&#8217;re able to charge less and make a profit. It&#8217;s as simple as that.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Can Cruise scale as rapidly as it hopes?</h2>
<p>Cruise didn&#8217;t share its revenue projections, but it did compare itself to other companies that have brought breakthrough products to very large markets and within a decade or so have gotten to &#8220;say $50 billion in revenue.&#8221; Ammann did say that Cruise conservatively expects to make about $100,000 in revenue per vehicle per year.</p>
<p>The company plans to own everything to do with its services, from the vehicles and autonomous software to the ride-hailing app and customer service. It hopes that by bringing more services in-house, it&#8217;ll be able to scale quickly and save money in the long run through constantly improving software that will allow it to begin to ditch sensors along the way.</p>
<p>Ammann even went so far as to say that it&#8217;ll be able to get its autonomous system&#8217;s cost curve so far down that it&#8217;ll be at a price point where it can be deployed into retail vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can go to your local dealer and buy a car that has Cruise L4 system capability inside of it, and with a partnership with GM, that obviously gives us a huge opportunity to turn that into a reality, and to do that at a really large scale,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That reality is likely many, many years off, but Cruise isn&#8217;t shy about dreaming big.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look out eight to 10 years from now, <span style="font-weight: 400;">I think we&#8217;ll look back and we&#8217;ll see that we&#8217;ve started to actually bend the curve on road safety in the United States and around the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;C</span>ities will be given back to the humans &#8230; our cities will be cleaner and less congested. And people will have access to transportation that don&#8217;t have access to transportation today.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data observability &#8212; necessary to keep tabs on infrastructure performing as it should; to see if apps are returning errors; and to ensure that critical business data is getting to where it needs to go &#8212; is becoming an evermore complicated task as organizations&#8217; cloud-native data demands and data usage grow. Today a startup that&#8217;s built a scalable platform to manage that is announcing a big round of funding to continue its own scaling journey. <a href="https://chronosphere.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chronosphere</a> &#8212; a cloud-native monitoring platform co-founded by two former Uber engineers &#8212; has raised $200 million, a Series C that values the company at over $1 billion.</p>
<p>Alongside this, Chronosphere is also announcing a new set of tools specifically for distributed tracing, which will help make more granular observations and respond quicker to issues on the network as they arise.</p>
<p>General Atlantic led the round with Addition, Greylock, Lux Capital and new backer Founders Fund also participating. In yet one more example of how the most promising companies are fundraising with increasing frequency these days, General Atlantic, Addition&#8217;s Lee Fixel, Greylock and Lux Capital all backed Chronosphere in its Series B, which was only nine months ago, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/chronosphere-nabs-43m-series-b-to-expand-cloud-native-monitoring-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January of this year</a>.</p>
<p>As with its previous round, this one was opportunistic, not because it was needed. &#8220;We are in the same spot as a year ago: more than 85% of our Series B b is still in our bank account and we didn’t need the cash,&#8221; said Martin Mao, Chronosphere&#8217;s co-founder and CEO. &#8220;But this was a response to our growth this year.&#8221; The company has been making regular updates to its tech and its revenues have grown tenfold in the last year, a reflection of what is also happening with data in the industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Demand has risen 10X, too,&#8221; he said, adding that the size of the Chronosphere team has not, so it will be hiring. &#8220;This is indicative of the product providing value to customers and shows how quickly the market is adopting cloud. So we are trying to capture the market as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company, which is 2.5 years old, has now raised $255 million to date.</p>
<p>Mao and co-founder Rob Skillington (CTO) founded Chronosphere on the back of early work that they started at Uber, where they built an observability platform very specific to Uber&#8217;s needs as a business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The underlying large-scale metrics storage technology they built was <a href="https://eng.uber.com/m3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually open sourced as M3</a>. The two then left Uber to build Chronosphere to take their ideas and concepts for cloud-native monitoring technology to a wider market.</p>
<p>Specifically, they saw an opportunity to address a particular gap: Uber built its own observability platform from the ground up to handle its particular mix of microservices and containers because, as Mao described it, the Googles of the world had built their own, &#8220;so we followed the same path.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, he added, &#8220;there was nothing on the market designed for this type of architecture&#8221; that others could equally use, so they wanted to tackle the more general challenges of cloud-native complexity, by building that platform themselves.</p>
<p>Since being widely released in GA in January, Chronosphere has found early traction with companies that operate at the same &#8220;horsepower&#8221; (Mao&#8217;s word) as Uber &#8212; other on-demand businesses like DoorDash that may also deal in a similar architecture involving multiple cloud applications, on-demand services and real-time analytics.</p>
<p>Other customers include those whose business models are equally banked on moving and analyzing large amounts of data, such as cryptocurrency mining platform Cudo, sports data company Genius Sports, and Tecton, an enterprise-focused &#8220;store&#8221; for machine learning applications.</p>
<p>The distributed tracing tools also being announced today speak to how Chronosphere will be, going forward, looking for further applications of its monitoring tech. It will give users more detailed notifications around workflows, with root cause analysis, and it will also give engineers, whether or not they are data science specialists, more tools to run analytics on their datasets.</p>
<p>While the two co-founders continue to maintain M3, Mao points out that Chronosphere&#8217;s platform can work independent of it; it&#8217;s aimed at companies whose data needs have outgrown <a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prometheus</a>, another monitoring and alerting solution that works well with M3. In terms of competitors, Mao describes Datadog as &#8220;the 800-pound gorilla in the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>(That is another reason to continue building fast and taking market share &#8212; and investment &#8212; where it can.)</p>
<p>“Chronosphere is purpose-built to address the needs of large modern cloud-native enterprises,&#8221; said Anton Levy, co-president, MD and head of technology investing at General Atlantic, in a statement. &#8220;Sitting at the intersection of the major trends transforming infrastructure software – the rise of open-source and the shift to containers – Chronosphere has quickly become a transformative player in observability. We’re excited by the team’s ambitious vision, with distributed tracing as yet another solution that differentiates Chronosphere as a next generation leader and paves the way for its continued growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech giants have gotten worse at removing illegal hate speech from their platforms under a voluntary arrangement in the European Union, according to the Commission&#8217;s latest assessment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_21_5106">sixth evaluation report</a> of the EU&#8217;s Code of Conduct on removing illegal hate speech found what the bloc&#8217;s executive calls a &#8220;mixed picture&#8221;, with platforms reviewing 81% of the notifications within 24 hours and removing an average of 62.5% of flagged content.</p>
<p>These results are lower than the average recorded in both 2019 and 2020, the Commission notes.</p>
<p>The self-regulatory initiative kicked off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/facebook-twitter-youtube-and-microsoft-agree-to-remove-hate-speech-across-the-eu/">back in 2016</a>, when Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube agreed to remove in less than 24 hours hate speech that falls foul of their community guidelines.</p>
<p>Since then Instagram, Google+, Snapchat, Dailymotion, Jeuxvideo.com, TikTok and LinkedIn have also signed up to the code.</p>
<p>While the headline promises were bold, the reality of how platforms have performed has often fallen short of what was pledged. And while there had been a trend of improving performance, that&#8217;s now stopped or stalled per the Commission &#8212; with Facebook and YouTube among the platforms performing worse than in earlier monitoring rounds.</p>

<p>A key driver for the EU to establish the code five years ago was concern about the spread of terrorist content online, as lawmakers sought ways to quickly apply pressure to platforms to speed up the removal of hate-preaching content.</p>
<p>But the bloc now has a regulation for that: In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/eu-adopts-rules-on-one-hour-takedowns-for-terrorist-content/">April</a> the EU adopted a law on terrorist content takedowns that set one hour as the default time for removals to be carried out.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="MCuK3De8zs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/eu-adopts-rules-on-one-hour-takedowns-for-terrorist-content/">EU adopts rules on one-hour takedowns for terrorist content</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU adopts rules on one-hour takedowns for terrorist content&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/eu-adopts-rules-on-one-hour-takedowns-for-terrorist-content/embed/#?secret=MCuK3De8zs" data-secret="MCuK3De8zs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>EU lawmakers have also proposed a wide-ranging update to digital regulations that will expand requirements on platforms and digital services in a range of areas around their handling of illegal content and/or goods.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Services Act</a> (DSA) has not yet been passed, so the self-regulatory code is still operational &#8212; for now.</p>
<p>The Commission said today that it wants to discuss the code&#8217;s evolution with signatories, including in light of the &#8220;upcoming obligations and the collaborative framework in the proposal for a <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package">Digital Services Act</a>&#8220;. So whether the code gets retired entirely &#8212; or beefed up as a supplement to the incoming legal framework &#8212; remains to be seen.</p>
<p>On disinformation, where the EU also operates a voluntary code to squeeze the tech industry to combat the spread of harmful non-truthful content, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/">Commission has said</a> it intends to keep obligations voluntary while simultaneously strengthening measures and linking compliance with it &#8212; at least for the largest platforms &#8212; to the legally binding DSA.</p>
<p>The stalled improvement in platforms&#8217; hate speech removals under the voluntary code suggests the approach may have run its course. Or that platforms are taking their foot off the gas while they wait to see what specific legal requirements they will have.</p>
<p>The Commission notes that while some companies&#8217; results &#8220;clearly worsened&#8221;, others &#8220;improved&#8221; over the monitored period. But such patchy results are perhaps a core limitation of a non-binding code.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers also flagged that &#8220;insufficient feedback&#8221; to users (via notifications) remains a &#8220;main weakness&#8221; of the code, as in previous monitoring rounds. So, again, legal force seems necessary &#8212; and the DSA proposes standardized rules for elements like reporting procedures.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest report on the hate speech code in a statement, Věra Jourová, the Commission&#8217;s VP for values and transparency, looked ahead to the incoming regulation, saying: &#8220;Our unique Code has brought good results but the platforms cannot let the guard down and need to address the gaps. And gentlemen agreement alone will not suffice here. The Digital Services Act  will provide strong regulatory tools to fight against illegal hate speech online.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The results show that IT companies cannot be complacent: just because the results were very good in the last years, they cannot take their task less seriously,&#8221; added Didier Reynders, commissioner for Justice, in another supporting statement. &#8220;They have to address any downward trend without delay. It is matter of protecting a democratic space and fundamental rights of all users. I trust that a swift adoption of the Digital Services Act will also help solving some of the persisting gaps, such as the insufficient transparency and feedback to users.”</p>
<p>Other findings from the illegal hate speech takedowns monitoring exercise include that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal rates varied depending on the severity of hateful content; <strong>69%</strong> of content calling for murder or violence against specific groups was removed, while <strong>55%</strong> of the content using defamatory words or pictures aiming at certain groups was removed. Conversely, in 2020, the respective results were <strong>83.5%</strong> and <strong>57.8%</strong>.</li>
<li>IT companies gave feedback to <strong>60.3%</strong> of the notifications received, which is lower than during the previous monitoring exercise (<strong>67.1%)</strong>.</li>
<li>In this monitoring exercise, <strong>sexual orientation</strong> is the most commonly reported ground of hate speech (<strong>18.2%)</strong> followed by xenophobia (<strong>18%)</strong> and anti-Gypsyism (<strong>12.5%)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Commission also said that for the first time signatories reported &#8220;detailed information&#8221; about measures taken to counter hate speech outside the monitoring exercise, including actions to automatically detect and remove content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Avatar startups have come and gone over the past few years, but the future that many of the entrepreneurs behind them originally imagined has proven more or less accurate. Apple is increasingly interested in avatar representations through Memoji, Mark Zuckerberg wants Facebook to be a metaverse company and platforms like Roblox, where users enter a virtual world and buy accessories for their character, have never been more popular.</p>
<p><a href="https://facemoji.co/">Facemoji</a> is building a plug-and-play tech platform to help game and app developers put avatar systems into their apps with the startup&#8217;s SDK. Facemoji has raised a $3 million seed round led by Play Ventures, with participation from Twitter and Roosh Ventures, alongside some angel investors.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s lightweight solution leans on its own rendering pipeline, with the team noting that most other players in the space lean on Unity plugins that many developers don&#8217;t want to deal with. They also already have a full, diverse system of avatar art that developers can lean on out of the box if they so desire.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2214149" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2214149" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2214149" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-8.13.31-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="655" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-8.13.31-AM.png 1420w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-8.13.31-AM.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-8.13.31-AM.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-8.13.31-AM.png?resize=768,491 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-8.13.31-AM.png?resize=680,435 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-8.13.31-AM.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2214149" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facemoji</p></div></p>
<p>Facemoji believes that more game-makers want to easily build their own avatar systems but don&#8217;t necessarily want to plug into other networks. The Achilles&#8217; heel of most early avatar platforms has often been the ambition to build a consistent cross-platform avatar system that functioned as its own metaverse. It makes sense for the startup building the product and users, but for game-makers, leaving that slice of the platform opportunity on the table was a waste.</p>
<p>Facemoji says they don&#8217;t anticipate Apple opening up Memoji to the developer community and that Snap is a more salient competitor. Facemoji&#8217;s startup competitors have been getting acquired at an increasingly rapid pace. In 2020, Roblox <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/roblox-buys-digital-avatar-startup-loom-ai/">bought</a> Loom.ai and Epic Games acquired HyperSense.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s founders are still heavily intrigued by the metaverse hype and the latest NFT craze and have been working on plug-and-play NFT storefronts that developers can integrate to let their users buy accessories for their avatars. Facemoji sees some of the early crypto Twitter profile pic usage as a sign that regular consumers are going to be excited about tricking out their avatars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, it boils down to ego,&#8221; Facemoji CEO Robin Raszka tells TechCrunch. &#8220;How you show off that you have a Birkin bag, avatars on Twitter is the prime real estate for this, people just want to show off.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a particularly interesting investment for Twitter, which is an infrequent corporate investor. Facemoji&#8217;s team said they had some conversations with the team at screen-sharing social app Squad about integrating their avatars before that startup was bought by Twitter. Twitter has also detailed a number of NFT projects in the works and CEO Jack Dorsey has been a major cheerleader for startups in the space.</p>
<p>In addition to gaming, Facemoji&#8217;s team hopes that soon people have the option of easily dialing into their next Zoom as an avatar or attending a class as one and that that live-action avatar overlays lose some of their silly reputation in favor of being treated as a healthy medium between having your camera on and off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’ve been working on a big project the past several days (more on that soon), which means, unfortunately, I’ve been away from the daily breaking news. That means, in turn, that I really haven’t been on top of the big robotics news this week. So let’s use this column as an opportunity to play a little catch-up.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, however, I did have the opportunity to sit down with an interesting robotics company that had a unique pandemic experience.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say the world was a different place when <a href="https://www.diligentrobots.com/">Diligent Robotics</a> announced its Series A. March 2020 wasn’t all that long ago, of course, but the worlds of healthcare and hospitals have seen tremendous strain amid a pandemic whose scope and length few could have predicted. Demand for the company’s nurse assisting robot Moxi has spiked as hospital staffs have grown increasingly overworked and understaffed, accelerating trends that existed prior to COVID-19.</p>
<p>While last year’s $10 million cash infusion has no doubt helped Diligent grow, the company has faced the difficult task of accelerating production while dealing with the familiar challenges of moving to remote work.</p>
<p>Andrea Thomaz, the associate professor of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech who co-founded Diligent in 2017 with Vivian Chu, joined us this week to discuss the unique challenges and opportunities the last year has held.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191371" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191371" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2191371" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191371" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</p></div></p>

<p><strong>How profound an impact is the pandemic having on both robotics generally and Diligent specifically?</strong></p>
<p>It is really just a dramatic shift in labor markets across a lot of different industries. It seems to be related both to people kind of having a great resignation, where people are deciding that they want to do different things. And a lot of people shifting jobs. We’re seeing that all across tech work, a lot in our industry and healthcare. A lot of people are just deciding to do something else. There were already workforce challenges pre-pandemic, and now those are reaching crisis levels.</p>
<p><strong>This is kind of a perfect storm, in a sense, because you have fewer people wanting to do the job, and more people needed to do the job all at the same time.</strong></p>
<p>And that trend was starting before the pandemic. The pandemic just added fuel to the fire. But the trend kind of started with the Affordable Care Act. More people having access to healthcare means more people are going to hospitals and getting care. That together with an aging population, and you just have more care needing to happen with fewer and fewer people.</p>
<p><strong>Are you able to quantify that demand, in terms of how many hospitals you were in initially, and how that demand has spiked subsequently?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re not really sharing that. I think towards the early half of next year, we&#8217;ll be sharing more specific announcements around scale numbers, but I can say that we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re doubling the number of robots that are deployed every quarter.</p>
<p><strong>What is that process like in terms getting one of these robots up and running?</strong></p>
<p>I think that’s what’s really interesting about hospital markets. It’s different than traditional warehouse or manufacturing automation. There’s people in the environment and they’re nurses and clinicians. The robot has to work within that environment and alongside the people. The first thing we do is workflow assessments. How does work currently happen in that environment?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213848" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213848" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2213848" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Moxiteammatesinhallway.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Moxiteammatesinhallway.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Moxiteammatesinhallway.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Moxiteammatesinhallway.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Moxiteammatesinhallway.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Moxiteammatesinhallway.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213848" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Diligent Robotics</p></div></p>
<p><strong>How has the pandemic impacted your own growth?</strong></p>
<p>Pre-pandemic, we were still proving out product market fit. We were keeping the R &amp; D team pretty small, making small tweaks to the product, but really, it was all about getting it out in front of customers and showing that they were really seeing value. And Now it&#8217;s all about execution and delivery, how do we make it as fast as possible to implement and as robust as possible. On the hardware side, in particular, it&#8217;s around design for manufacturing and reliability. Now that we&#8217;ve had robots out in the field for over a year, you&#8217;re starting to see some of the pieces and parts that we could get more reliability around, so we’re getting to that fun longtail of robotics.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any surprising features or demands that people had of the robots that are a result of the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>I think that across all of our customer sites, the one request that we get, from every single nurse is, “is that robot gonna be able to bring me coffee?” They want Moxi to go to the Starbucks in the lobby and bring coffee for everyone. They try to justify that as a time savings, because then I wouldn&#8217;t have to go and stand in line at Starbucks. It&#8217;s not out of the question. But we&#8217;re not actively piloting that one.</p>
<p><strong>So, you’re not going to build an espresso machine into Moxi?</strong></p>
<p>Not in the next year.</p>
<p><strong>Do you anticipate seeking additional funding at some point in the near future?</strong></p>
<p>We are making plans for growth capital. They&#8217;re still working it out. But with the huge uptick in demand from customers, I think we&#8217;re ready to sort of accelerate some of our team and get more robots out.</p>
<p><strong>Are you focusing on the U.S. for the time being?</strong></p>
<p>For the time being. We are starting to consider what an international strategy would look like. I wouldn’t expect that we’ll have any international deployments next year, but we’ve started to have a lot of interest. We’re deciding what the right distribution partners would look like. We get several inquiries a month from international clients. At this point, we’re not actively in any project with them.</p>

<p>So, more on funding rounds and coffee deliveries at a later time. There are, however, a couple of delivery stories worth noting this week. First off, Tortoise (which we’ve covered a bunch in the past), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/tortoise-expands-remote-operated-robotic-delivery-to-convenience-stores-across-the-us/">is getting a big boost</a> for its team of remote-controlled delivery bots. A deal with Idaho-based King Retail Solutions will bring more than 500 of its robots to U.S. sidewalks for last-mile delivery.</p>
<p>“Everybody’s waking up to this new reality that same-day is the new normal, and it’s just not sustainable on every possible front to have that consumer expectation be met with people making $20 an hour doing those deliveries,” CEO Dmitry Shevelenko said of the deal. “The math just doesn’t work.”</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wing-prod.blogspot.com/2021/10/check-out-worlds-first-rooftop-drone.html">Google’s Wing announced its own partnership</a>. Teaming with Australian retail property group Vicinity Centres lets the drone-based delivery program expand its footprint. Following the recent announcement of its 100,000<sup>th</sup> delivery, the Wing team says it’s already launched 2,500 deliveries from the roof of Logan, Australia’s Grand Plaza shopping center over the past month.</p>
<p>Residents can get bubble tea, juice, sushi and now health and beauty products. Says Wing, &#8220;Because almost every business has a roof, our new rooftop delivery model opens up the possibility for more businesses to offer drone delivery services with little additional cost or added infrastructure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Speaking of juice (not a segue I get to use very frequently in this roundup), Bay Area-based smoothie robot maker Blendid this week announced that it will be powering Jamba’s second mall kiosk. The location opened this week at a mall in Downey, California, a city in LA County that’s also home to the oldest operating McDonald’s (thanks, Wikipedia).</p>
<p>Wave of the future or gimmick? Yes and yes.</p>
<p>“After a successful launch of our first Jamba by Blendid kiosk, we’re excited to open a second test kiosk at the Stonewood Center, bringing freshly blended smoothies to mall shoppers,” Jamba president Geoff Henry, <a href="https://www.blendid.com/jamba-and-blendid-announce-the-opening-of-second-robotic-smoothie-kiosk-at-the-stonewood-center-in-downey-california/">said in a release</a>. “Jamba by Blendid provides an opportunity for our local franchisees to make smoothies more accessible to Jamba fans, while leveraging the latest in technology to deliver contactless food.”</p>

<p>On the orchard side of the fruit business, <a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/wavemaker-labs-acquires-ip-from-agtech-startup-abundant-robotics/">The Robot Report this week notes</a> that Wavemaker Labs has acquired the IP for Abundant Robotics, which shuffled off this mortal coil over the summer. Unfortunately, this likely doesn’t mean the return of Abundant’s apple-picking robots, but rather the integration of its technology into the robotic systems from Future Acres, a Wavemaker portfolio startup.</p>

<p>And finally, a quick bit of robotic <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/robot-finds-items-camera-antenna-1005">search out of MIT</a> that uses an RF antenna and camera mounted to an arm to find lost objects. Per the school:</p>
<blockquote><p>Using machine learning, the robotic arm automatically zeroes-in on the object’s exact location, moves the items on top of it, grasps the object, and verifies that it picked up the right thing. The camera, antenna, robotic arm, and AI are fully integrated, so RFusion can work in any environment without requiring a special set up.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat is rolling out new tools and educational resources to prevent younger users from buying counterfeit pills and illicit drugs via the platform. The company said on Thursday that the goal of the new tools is to keep its users safe from “the devastating impacts of the fentanyl crisis.”</p>
<p>“We are determined to remove illegal drug sales from our platform, and we have been investing in proactive detection and collaboration with law enforcement to hold drug dealers accountable for the harm they are causing our community,” Snapchat’s parent company, Snap, said in a <a href="https://snap.com/en-US/safety-and-impact">blog post</a>. “While we still have work to do, across all types of law enforcement requests we receive, our response times have improved 85% year over year.”</p>
<p>The company says it has improved its proactive detection capabilities to remove drug dealers from its platform before they are able to engage with users and cause harm. Snapchat notes that its enforcement rates have increased by 112% during the first half of 2021, and that it has increased proactive detection rates by 260%. It also claims nearly two-thirds of drug-related content found on the platform is detected proactively by its artificial intelligence systems. It has also worked to improve its in-app reporting tools to make it easier for users to report drug-related content.</p>
<p>Further, when users search for drug-related keywords, they’ll now see a new in-app educational portal called “Heads Up.” The portal will show relevant educational content designed to prevent harm. Heads Up distributes content from reputable organizations such as Song for Charlie, Shatterproof and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Additional resources from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be added in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The launch of the new tools comes as a recent report from <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/pills-bought-on-snapchat-deadly/index.html">NBC News</a> investigated the deaths of teens and young adults who allegedly used Snapchat to purchase pills that had turned out to be laced with fentanyl. The report alleged that drug dealers have been using the social media platform to find buyers and that Snapchat isn&#8217;t doing enough to prevent harm.</p>
<p>“We have heard devastating stories from families impacted by this crisis, including cases where fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills were purchased from drug dealers on Snapchat. We are determined to remove illegal drug sales from our platform,” the company said.</p>
<p>Social media platforms like Snapchat and TikTok, which are geared toward young users, are facing increased pressure to crack down on the sale and promotion of illicit drugs as overdose deaths continue to soar. Parent groups have argued that the digital giants aren’t doing enough to prevent harm to young users on these apps. Additionally, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration issued a warning last week about the increase of fake pills laced with fentanyl.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The administration released <a href="https://www.dea.gov/alert/sharp-increase-fake-prescription-pills-containing-fentanyl-and-meth">a public safety alert</a> “warning the American public about the increasing availability of fake pills that are more deadly than ever before, and that are easy to purchase, widely available, and often contain deadly doses of fentanyl.”</p>
<p>Snapchat has said it’s “heartbroken” that drugs have taken the lives of people in its user community and that it will work to do better and keep its users safe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.otto.xyz"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a fintech startup which aims to allow people to tap into their vehicle’s equity for access to credit, has raised $4.5 million in a seed round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dallas-based company is building a mobile platform that will essentially let people borrow against their vehicles at the same interest rate as standard credit cards. But unlike other cards, Otto will not charge fees or overdraft charges, and will not require applicants to supply their FICO credit scores. Users will be able remotely verify and collateralize their cars through Otto’s mobile platform, which is set to launch in early 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncommon Capital led the startup&#8217;s seed financing, which included participation from Pelion Venture Partners, 1930 Capital, Bloom VP and Spacecadet Ventures. Other investors include Mark Cuban, entrepreneur and Shark Tank investor; Leo Polovets, co-founder and general partner at Susa Ventures; Bill Clerico, co-founder and CEO of WePay; and Vivek Garipalli, co-founder and CEO of Clover Health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends and former colleagues George Utkov, Jordan Miller and Daniel Ashy came up with the idea for the company after Utkov’s friend became the victim of a “predatory” title loan agreement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Millions of people every year take out what are called title loans &#8212; and it&#8217;s when you own your car outright, and basically go pledge the title of your car as collateral against the loan,” said Miller. “These loans are 30 days long. There are 500%+ APR, and they absolutely crush people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uktov’s friend, who had lost a job during COVID, got a title loan against a truck that was worth between $15,000 and $20,000. When he couldn’t pay it back, he lost his car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That exposed us to this whole world of lending products for the underserved, for the non-banked,” Miller said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio began work on Otto at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. After Uktov’s friend’s experience, they realized that people, for example, with unstable incomes or that are recent immigrants are extremely limited in options when needing money. As such they often have to resort to payday and title lenders, pawn shops or other non-bank credit lenders who often charge “exorbitant” fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Otto, the friends/founders want to give people another option and one that won’t make their financial situation worse, but instead, better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otto chose the asset class since vehicles are often the most common and biggest asset owned by so many who are struggling financially and are underbanked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the company’s mobile app, users will be able to apply and get pre-approved “within minutes” for standard interest credit cards, which are about 96% cheaper than the loans typically available to this user. The user is then guided through a step-by-step process of remotely validating their information and activating their new Otto credit card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers can use their credit cards to help pay for in-store and online purchases, build credit, and earn rewards. Part of the goal is to help users build their credit so they can gain access to even more affordable credit products. When consumers use Otto, their repayment history will be reported to all three major credit bureaus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like all major credit card issuers, Otto will make money in two ways &#8212; via interchange fees and interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to provide financial mobility to those that need it most, regardless of their credit history, and help them move forward in their lives by giving them credit options that they may not otherwise be able to access,” Uktov said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides helping people build credit, the Otto team also will track a user’s financial health and tell them things like what they’re spending their money on, and to be prepared for certain expenses based on their previous charging history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really what we’re creating is a system that is 95% cheaper than the lending products that these people use every day,” Miller said. “We feel like as we build this, and launch it, we have the power to fundamentally change millions of people&#8217;s lives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of their plan to get their word out is tap into the resources of their investors. For example, Mark Cuban is already helping Otto forge local partnerships with businesses doing adjacent services such as advancing financial literacy and credit repair that are already doing outreach in communities, Uktov noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that building trust from the ground up is very important, and that there’s a benefit to building on the community level,” Miller said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via email, Cuban said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he invested in Otto simply because he liked “the idea of helping people use the equity in their cars.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think Otto has a strong commitment to helping those who are underbanked and need financial support rather than extracting every dollar they can,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tikhon Bernstam, managing partner at lead investor Uncommon Capital, said his firm was inspired by Otto&#8217;s vision of offering a new type of asset-backed loan for the underbanked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you&#8217;re unbanked or underbanked you currently don&#8217;t have access to credit at the price that Otto is going to provide it at,” Bernstam wrote via email. “Your alternatives are traditional payday loans at predatory interest rates or traditional title loans at predatory interest rates. Otto is changing that.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The platform enables enterprises to design intelligent user access policies and automate reviews of current company access points.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remember when a Twitter contractor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/meet-the-man-who-deactivated-trumps-twitter-account/">deactivated Donald Trump’s personal account</a> for 11 minutes in 2017? <a href="https://opal.dev/">Opal</a> co-founder Stephen Cobbe says that is one example of an instance where certain employees were provided too much access to the inner-workings of the company.</p>
<p>His company, based in San Francisco and New York, is working with enterprises to design intelligent user access policies and automate reviews of current company access points. Cobbe explained that companies either grant access that is too broad or restrict it too much.</p>
<p>Cobbe and his founding team come from companies like Dropbox, Scale, Brex, MuleSoft and Palo Alto Networks. He personally saw at Dropbox some of the pain points of managing access at scale. What happens is that organizations have access policies around which roles do what, but in reality, life doesn’t fit perfectly into those access structures, he added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213697" style="width: 3594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213697" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2213697 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png" alt="Opal" width="3584" height="1842" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png 3584w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png?resize=768,395 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png?resize=680,349 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png?resize=1536,789 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png?resize=2048,1053 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Opal_SS1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3584px) 100vw, 3584px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213697" class="wp-caption-text">Opal dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Opal</p></div></p>
<p>“Employees can have too much access, which is how the Twitter employee was able to go rogue,” Cobbe told TechCrunch. “When companies that we talked to tried to deal with the problem, they weren’t happy with existing solutions. We interviewed 100 companies and found that they all have versions of the same internal tool that they were individually updating each time.”</p>
<p>The tools are also typically based on SAML, or Security Assertion Markup Language, and not up to the task of managing the diverse systems companies have. Instead, Opal’s approach is to turn a once rigid model into a needs-based one through API integrations.</p>
<p>Companies can log in and see a list of engineering infrastructure, SaaS apps and internal tools. When access requests are made, they are routed to an owner for approval. On the flip side, when an employee leaves the company, an owner can go in and remove access with the push of a button.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To continue developing its platform, Opal closed on a $1.8 million seed round led by Greylock. Angel investors participating in the deal include Expanse CEO Tim Junio, Abnormal Security CEO Evan Reiser and Signal Sciences CEO Andrew Peterson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every enterprise knows that managing permissions at scale is challenging,” said Saam Motamedi, partner at Greylock, in a written statement. “More systems mean more attack vectors, places to audit, and overhead to ensure engineers have the access they need. Opal is tackling these problems with a strong team of security experts, and I look forward to partnering with them on their journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opal was founded in 2020, but came out of stealth mode a few months ago. It already touts a list of customers including Blend and Coffee Meets Bagel. The company used the new investment to hire on both the engineering and business side, Cobbe said.</p>
<p>He did not disclose growth metrics, but did say the company is poised to raise another round of funding in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand grocery delivery platform Instacart announced this morning that it’s acquiring FoodStorm, a SaaS order management system (OMS) that powers end-to-end order-ahead and catering for grocery retailers. The companies have not disclosed the financial details of the deal, but as part of the acquisition, Instacart will integrate FoodStorm’s technology into its suite of enterprise grocery e-commerce solutions.</p>
<p>FoodStorm has developed a SaaS offering that covers multi-channel ordering, order management, payment and fulfillment. Its technology also integrates with several third-party systems, including point-of-sale systems (POS). The technology also offers CRM capabilities that help grocers collect feedback and leverage promotional features.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to help our retail partners increase their sales and ensure more of their customers’ everyday meals come from the grocery store. That’s why we’re excited to welcome the talented FoodStorm team to Instacart and integrate their end-to-end, order-ahead and catering platform into Instacart’s leading enterprise offering,” said Instacart’s chief technology officer, Mark Schaaf, in a statement.</p>
<p>FoodStorm, which was founded 14 years ago, has formed partnerships with several of Instacart’s existing retail partners, including Bi-Rite Market, Mollie Stone’s Markets, Uncle Giuseppe’s and Roche Brothers. Instacart plans to make FoodStorm’s technology available to more retailers.</p>
<p>Instacart states that this new enterprise solution helps retailers bring even more of their inventory online and enhance their e-commerce capabilities while meeting the needs of customers. As for customers, Instacart says the technology unlocks a more affordable alternative to restaurant delivery.</p>
<p>“Grocery is an incredibly complex retail category, making the need for enterprise-grade solutions like FoodStorm and Instacart critical to the long-term success of the industry we all rely on to put food on our tables. We’re excited about this next chapter as we join the Instacart team and create new ways for retailers to serve the ever-changing needs of their businesses and customers,” said FoodStorm CEO Rob Hill in a statement.</p>
<p>Instacart notes that order-ahead technology solutions provide grocery retailers with a significant growth opportunity. For instance, Instacart customers who purchase prepared foods and catering items like hot and cold side dishes, cakes and sushi from the grocery store have significantly larger baskets and shop more frequently than customers who don’t. As for retailers, Instacart outlines that order-ahead items and prepared foods are also typically more profitable than traditional groceries like produce and package goods.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this year, Instacart <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/">raised a $265 million funding</a> round from existing investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, D1 Capital Partners and others. The funding pushed the company’s valuation to $39 billion. Instacart also recently debuted a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/instacart-speeds-up-grocery-orders-with-priority-delivery-option/">faster delivery service, &#8220;Priority Delivery,</a>&#8221; in select markets in the U.S. and Canada with the aim of attracting customers who would have otherwise quickly run to the store for their smaller orders or more urgent needs.</p>

You wouldn&#8217;t have to switch between CarPlay and your car&#8217;s (likely clunky) infotainment software just to turn up the heat.</p>
<p>IronHeart is still early in development, according to the tipsters, and would require partnerships with car brands. Apple has declined to comment.</p>
<p>An initiative like this could extend Apple&#8217;s presence in cars far beyond limited technologies like CarPlay or its more recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/carkey-apple-unlock-car-iphone-nfc-bmw-ios-14-13-175711038.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">CarKey</a> feature.

<p>Whether or not automakers embrace the concept is another matter. Apple would effectively bypass a car&#8217;s native interface for many common tasks. It&#8217;s easy to see manufacturers balking after pouring extensive work into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-30-fords-sync-4-add-wireless-carplay-android-auto.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">their own car interfaces</a> and companion apps, particularly if they have any services that compete with Apple offerings. If IronHeart ships, it may be limited to a handful of makes and models unless there&#8217;s an enthusiastic response from car buyers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://brighthire.com">BrightHire</a>, a startup that wants to transform the way people are hired inside organizations, announced a $20.5 million Series B investment today led by 01 Advisors with participation from Index Ventures and Zoom Apps Fund.</p>
<p>The fact that Zoom Apps Fund is involved is not a coincidence, as the company is based on taking information from a Zoom-based interview and using the data to drive hiring decision making. Company co-founder and CEO Ben Sesser says that while most business decisions are grounded in data, hiring decisions have been an obvious exception with a lot of emotion and gut feelings involved. He is hoping to change that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to transform the way teams are built. In business, it&#8217;s kind of expected that any critical decision will be grounded in hard data and rigorous analysis. And yet in hiring which is perhaps the most important thing a company does for its future, the decisions are made largely based on gut feel and memories and recollections,&#8221; Sesser told me.</p>
<p>He said that most companies are not terribly consistent about the way they hire and BrightHire brings some order to the hiring exercise and in that way improves the experience for everyone involved.</p>
<p>The company records and transcribes each interview, which is conducted over Zoom, enabling the interviewer to concentrate solely on the candidate, and not on taking notes or other tasks. In addition, throughout the interview, the software will surface critical questions to ask the candidate, which helps ensure every interview is conducted in a consistent way.</p>
<p>After every interview, the software surfaces highlights and insights that help companies as they hire new employees and ultimately to continually improve hiring overall.</p>
<p>Dick Costolo, who is managing partner at lead investor 01A, says that one of the reasons he liked what BrightHire was doing was because he recognized that they were solving a fundamental hiring problem he had when he was running Twitter from 2009-2015 during a period of extreme growth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;One of the things we noticed at Twitter was there was all this unconscious or unintentional bias in the interview process or even in the promotion process,&#8221; he said. This led them to try to seek a more data-driven way to make better decisions, something that&#8217;s much easier to do with a tool like BrightHire. &#8220;This would have solved so many issues we had around subjectivity and unconscious bias,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>During the pandemic when so much business was shifting online, the idea of interviewing over Zoom became much more normalized than perhaps it would have been when the company launched in 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;Six months or seven months prior to the pandemic, just based on the problem, hiring was too important to not fix in really fundamental ways, but ultimately 2020 was a very interesting year due to the pandemic, and ultimately there have been a bunch of changes that have been big accelerants for our business,&#8221; Sesser said.</p>
<p>As the company grows, Sesser says he is using the product to drive diversity in hiring inside his own organization, but it&#8217;s just one tool in the arsenal. &#8220;We don&#8217;t solve diversity in hiring, but what our product does is create a more equitable process,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He adds, &#8220;How can you have an equitable approval process if you&#8217;re assessing candidates inconsistently [&#8230;], and if we have no grounding or basis for our decisions that we can fall back on or hold ourselves accountable to. Otherwise, it&#8217;s literally our subjective memory and our feelings, which is a really really hard thing to do.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.withmedley.com/">Medley</a>, the group coaching platform that focuses on both personal and professional development, announced the close of a $3.7 million seed round led by A16Z today</p>
<p>Connie Chan and Anne Lee Skates of Andreesen Horowitz led the round, with participation from Aglaé Ventures, Foundation Capital, Ciara Wilson, Jen Rubio, Dara Treseder (Peloton). and Sanyin Siang (Duke University), among others.</p>
<p>Medley was cofounded by Edith Cooper and Jordan Taylor, a mother-daughter duo who believe that the personal and professional development of people are inextricably linked together. The platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/medley-a-life-and-career-coaching-community-for-everyone-launches-today/">launched back in July of 2020</a> with the goal of facilitating small group discussions led by a professional development coach. These groups were matched with the express intention of fostering diversity and inclusion, with different age groups, genders, ethnicities and backgrounds represented in each group.</p>
<p>With inclusivity top of mind, Medley welcomes everyone to join the membership, and even launched with an opportunity-based sliding scale for the annual membership fee.</p>
<p>Alongside the announcement of the funding, Medley is also introducing Medley Moments in the coming months. Moments are specifically designed courses that members can enroll in to focus on their particular goals. Taylor gave a few examples of the kinds of topics that Moments will cover, including becoming a new parent, learning about leadership, relocating, career pivots and more.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pxlpYDyjSf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/medley-a-life-and-career-coaching-community-for-everyone-launches-today/">Medley, a life and career coaching community for everyone, launches today</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Medley, a life and career coaching community for everyone, launches today&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/medley-a-life-and-career-coaching-community-for-everyone-launches-today/embed/#?secret=pxlpYDyjSf" data-secret="pxlpYDyjSf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;There was a heightened focus on the significance of gaining perspective on other people&#8217;s reality that was in people&#8217;s consciousness when we first launched, but now is critical to their center of gravity, in terms of what people are seeking when participating in groups,&#8221; said Edith Cooper. &#8220;There&#8217;s also an increasing expectation from people that their employers actually care about them and provide offerings that are not tactically oriented but for the benefit of them as people.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Given these insights, and a successful pilot program with LinkedIn, Medley is now looking at B2B options for the company, with the potential to sell the programs to larger organizations for the benefit of their employees.</p>
<p>Following the LinkedIn pilot, which saw a 99 percent NPS score, the professional social behemoth will be expanding that partnership in 2022.</p>
<p>The fresh funding means hiring is certainly on the table for Medley this year. Cooper, who sits on numerous boards including those of Amazon and PepsiCo, says that the biggest challenge for Medley, or any organization for that matter, is attracting and retaining world-class talent, where both the passion and the vision are aligned.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best part of being an entrepreneur is getting to work with people who challenge me, who I learn from and who I can enjoy spending time with,&#8221; said Jordan Taylor. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great challenge but also something that I feel grateful for, is being able to, with Edith, build out a team of people who are always looking to learn.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aside from billions of dollars of personal wealth and historically impressive levels of corporate control, what&#8217;s the point of being a successful tech CEO these days?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not asking in the abstract. There are tweets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>

<hr />
<p>It&#8217;s easy to forget how lucky we are to have Twitter in the world. The company&#8217;s social media service has handed a digital megaphone to anyone who wants one, allowing you and me the chance to not only be expressive on a regular &#8212; obsessive, in my case, I know &#8212; basis, but also the opportunity to hear directly from folks who are otherwise ensconced behind walls of minders and communications professionals.</p>
<p>Not that I agree with what everyone says on Twitter, of course; I just like the chance to listen a bit, because it can be rather illustrative.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>I enjoy the occasional Twitter threads from <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/">Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong</a> because they provide a neat, clear window into his thinking &#8212; not only what&#8217;s on his mind, but what he thinks could be solutions to the issues he sees. It&#8217;s useful as someone who writes about the business world where he holds influence.</p>
<p>And the crypto-focused exec had quite the thread earlier this week, digging into how large companies are treated in the United States.</p>
<p>To prevent criticism that I am misquoting the man, here&#8217;s the thread in its entirety:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://paddle.com/">Paddle</a>, a solutions provider subscription-based businesses, is betting on a future where App Store developers are able to use third-party payment systems &#8212; and it wants to be among the first to market with an alternative once such a system is permitted. The company today <a href="https://twitter.com/PaddleHQ/status/1446050078301605890?">announced</a> a new in-app purchasing (IAP) system aimed at iOS developers that&#8217;s designed to be a drop-in replacement for Apple&#8217;s own IAP. And it&#8217;s one where developers get to keep more of the revenue they earn, Paddle says.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big bet and not one that&#8217;s clear to pay off.</p>
<p>Paddle says its system will provide developers with access to customer data throughout their lifecycle; will offer a combination of direct subscription management and tools to pause subscriptions; and will support other payment mechanisms, like PayPal. It will also allow developers to manage their own refunds, which is something many developers have wanted for some time. Its fees would be 10% on transactions under $10 and 5% on transactions over $10. That&#8217;s less than Apple&#8217;s fees of 30% (which drop to 15% for year two of subscription-based apps, and for small businesses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">program</a> and Apple News Partner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/">program</a> participants.)</p>
<p>But Paddle&#8217;s entire product&#8217;s product hinges on its belief that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">court&#8217;s ruling</a> in the Epic v. Apple lawsuit will be held up upon appeal, and that the way Apple will interpret the ruling will allow payment system alternatives such as Paddle&#8217;s to operate. That&#8217;s not something Paddle at this point could definitively know.</p>
<p>In September, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">sided with Fortnite maker Epic Games</a> on the topic of third-party payments in the App Store in the landmark decision, though she found that Apple was not engaging in antitrust conduct. Epic, which wants to be able to also distribute its games directly to iOS users in addition to using its own payment mechanisms, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">said it would be appealing</a> the court&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the ruling was that Apple could no longer prohibit developers from including buttons, external links, and other calls to action inside their apps that could direct users to alternative payment mechanisms.</p>
<p>Even if this part of the judgment is not adjusted following the appeal, the judge&#8217;s wording on the matter of third-party payments is still open to interpretation by Apple. And currently, the thinking here is that it simply blocks Apple from rejecting apps pointing to other means of payment outside its store &#8212; not that Apple would have to go so far as to support a competitive payment system that&#8217;s built into the apps themselves. <a href="https://www.imore.com/app-purchase-alternative-paddle-will-see-apps-rejected-says-expert">Experts have already pushed back</a> on the idea this system could make it through App Review.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paddle, however, believes it has a shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our understanding, and that of our legal advisors, is that Paddle In-App Purchase is permissible within the Apple vs Epic legal ruling,&#8221; said Paddle, in a statement. &#8220;We would welcome Apple sharing its own interpretation on this to bring further clarity to an issue that will have a significant impact on iOS developers and the wider market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company plans to make its system available from Dec. 7, 2021, in line with the court&#8217;s ruling.</p>
<p>Paddle today has over 3,000 software clients (sellers) using its platform for other services today, and processes billions of dollars in payment volume per year. It will be interesting to see if any developers actually go so far as to implement this Apple IAP alternative, which could risk having their apps rejected from the App Store. So far, Paddle says some devs have agreed to try it, including MacPaw.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Increasingly, conversations about big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence are going hand-in-hand with conversations about privacy and data protection. Now, a startup that is building tools to make it easier for engineers to implement the two simultaneously is announcing a round of growth funding to continue expanding its operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://gretel.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gretel AI</a>, which lets engineers create anonymized, synthetic, datasets based on their actual datasets to use in their analytics and to train machine learning models has closed $50 million in funding, a Series B that it will be using to get the company to the next stage of development. The product &#8212; which is built as a SaaS product but can also be accessed via APIs &#8212; is still in beta but aims to be open to general availability later this year.</p>
<p>Anthos Capital is leading the round with Section 32 also participating alongside Greylock and Moonshots Capital. Greylock led the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/gretel-announces-12m-series-a-to-make-it-easier-to-anonymize-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s previous round in 2020</a>, and the startup has raised $65.5 million to date.</p>
<p>From what we understand, this latest round puts the company&#8217;s valuation at between $320-$350 million.</p>
<p>The idea behind using synthetic datasets is that it lets an organization remove the risk of data leaking that might contain personal information or other kinds of sensitive data. There are other solutions to address the same issue involving data encryption, although this can be a costly, time-consuming and resource intensive approach that faces scaling challenges.</p>
<p>The germination for Gretel.ai came out of the direct experiences of the three co-founders in work they did as cybersecurity specialists at a range of organizations including IBM, AWS, Netscout and the U.S. military and over the years.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&#8220;We always found that using the right permissions with data was always the bottleneck,&#8221; said Ali Golshan, the CEO who co-founded the company with Alex Watson (CPO) and John Myers (CTO). The could see that the longer-term issue wold be a growing need and priority for data privacy. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As the world moves from the web to the immersive world of sensors and IOT we are transitioning into a world where people will share their data unconsciously or unknowingly. But humans are not meant to be mined.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">As data engineers, their priority is to be able to work with data easily and quickly, but as citizens of the world, they were unhappy with data protection implications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Removing the bottleneck of compute is the problem we’ve solved, and we have created high velocity development,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But now we are running into the bottleneck of the data. AI is on a collision course with privacy. At this collision course, we should create tools&#8221; to fix that.</p>
<p class="p1">Gretel&#8217;s opportunity is one that many companies targeting the enterprise market have taken in the world of digital transformation: many organizations now have large engineering operations working on applications to run their businesses, but they still do not have the firepower of the world&#8217;s largest technology companies. So Gretel set out to build a toolkit that would let any company build anonymized datasets for themselves, similar to what big tech companies use in their own data work.</p>
<p>The advantage of anonymized data goes beyond simply replacing a synthetic dataset for an actual one; they can also be used to augment a dataset, or to fill in the gaps where the real-world data might be lacking. Both of these are critical components especially in cases where the data is needed to train systems, such as in the case of autonomous services, where you seemingly can never have enough teaching data.</p>
<p>Watson had previously worked at AWS (fun fact: we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/amazon-aws-harvest-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scooped</a> when Amazon acquired his previous startup, harvest.ai), and he says that to date Gretel.ai <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has secured early customers in areas like </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">life sciences, financial services and gaming. In more basic use cases, it can take as little as 10 minutes to create a synthetic dataset. In more complex applications &#8212; for example in a genomic database, it could take several days. </span></p>
<p>Relatively speaking, this represents &#8220;very low friction&#8221; for engineers, Watson said, both compared to other approaches such as data encryption using techniques like homomorphic encryption, or indeed the analogue approach of contacting third parties and getting permissions to use datasets. The latter can take six months or longer, too long in cases where time is of the essence;</p>

<p>“This significant Series B investment is a direct reflection of Gretel’s ambitious vision, swift growth, and strength of position in the AI industry as the standard-bearer of tools that enable privacy by design,” said Emily White, President of Anthos Capital, in a statement. “Gretel’s ease of use, the extendability of its services, and the superior accuracy and quality of its synthetic data are much-needed solutions to simplify the exceedingly complex legal and technical barriers companies face due to data privacy concerns.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Gretel gives data teams working in any framework or language the tools they need to build privacy by design into their existing workflows and data pipelines, greatly simplifying this process,&#8221; added Sridhar Ramaswamy, partner at Greylock. &#8220;Time and time again I hear from software engineers and data scientists about the value Gretel offers. Its developer-first, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">tech-agnostic approach to solving privacy issues is incredibly valuable to every business sector.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I work in talent acquisition for a rapidly scaling startup, and I’m looking for an edge to onboard top engineers. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m seeing many stellar candidates who are about to graduate from a U.S. university and who mention programs like CPT, OPT and STEM OPT. How do we recruit and retain them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Rigorous Recruiter</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dear Rigorous,</p>
<p>Many startups overlook the pool of talented international students or those who recently graduated or will soon graduate from U.S. colleges or universities &#8212; many of whom want to remain here to work &#8212; because the companies might feel intimidated by what they know they don’t know about the U.S. immigration process.</p>
<p>Early-stage startups often assume that offering a job to an international student or recent graduate on an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/f-1-visa-students/">F-1 student visa</a> might be too complicated, or they worry if it’s too hard for an early-stage startup to secure them an H-1B. I recently dove into <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/091-what-you-need-to-know-about-hiring-student-on-opt/">What You Need to Know About Hiring Students on OPT</a> on my podcast. Fortunately, international students and grads provide a rich talent pool full of highly motivated individuals, and managing their immigration is totally possible.</p>
<p>The two main types of training programs available to most international students who hold an F-1 visa to work in their field of study include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curricular Practical Training (CPT), which is available at some colleges and universities to currently enrolled students. Not every university or degree program offers it.</li>
<li><a href="http://alcorn.law/opt-optional-practical-training/">Optional Practical Training</a> (OPT), which is available during coursework (Pre-Completion OPT) or after graduation (Post-Completion OPT) and in some cases can be extended through the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/stem-opt-extension/">STEM OPT</a> extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike work visas, employers do not have to directly “petition” F-1 students for CPT and OPT (for example, the Form I-129, which is used for H-1Bs and O-1As, is not involved). However, CPT and OPT require the student to work in an area directly related to their field of study, and the employer may need to provide information or other documents such as a training plan for the student to qualify or apply. I’ll go into these in more depth below.</p>
<p>For an H-1B in the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/002-2020-h-1b-lottery-update/">lottery</a>, a startup only needs to meet some basic <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B sponsorship requirements</a> to have a shot. These can include being incorporated, offering a specialty occupation job, and having the ability to pay the H-1B candidate’s salary for the term of the requested H-1B petition (usually up to three years). Then a startup’s candidate has the same chance of being selected in the annual lottery as a candidate with the same education level who is sponsored by a tech giant. (Big Tech and tech consulting companies may tend to sponsor a lot of people in the lottery, but their candidates are not given extra weight in the government’s process!) In addition, a proposal to shift from a random H-1B lottery to a wage-based lottery was thrown out by a federal court judge in September, so next year’s lottery will be random with a slight preference for candidates with advanced U.S. degrees, but no preference based on salary.</p>
<p>I recommend that you consult with an experienced immigration attorney to guide you, your startup and the student or graduate through this process. An immigration attorney can also help you strategize the best course of action for the students and graduates that you decide to sponsor for a work visa or green card.</p>

<h2>How does CPT work?</h2>
<p><a href="https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/sevis-help-hub/student-records/fm-student-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training-cpt">Curricular Practical Training (CPT)</a> is available at somes universities where training is already an integral part of the school’s established curriculum. Some graduate programs allow or even require students to apply for CPT at the very beginning of the program, dubbed “Day 1 CPT.”</p>
<p>Students must get approval for CPT from the Designated School Official (DSO) at their university or college. If you want to hire an international student on CPT, the student will need to provide information about the job to the DSO, such as the position, duties, wage, time commitment and any other information the DSO may request to decide whether the job qualifies.</p>
<p>One year of full-time (more than 20 hours per week) CPT eliminates a student’s eligibility for OPT. However, part-time (20 hours per week or less) CPT will not impact a student’s eligibility.</p>
<h2>How does OPT work?</h2>
<p>Like CPT, Optional Practical Training (OPT) is limited to 12 months. OPT is available to international students at each education level: bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral.</p>
<p>There are two types of OPT: pre-completion (before graduation) and post-completion. Most F-1 students choose to start OPT after graduation so that they can work full time. Under pre-completion OPT, students can only work part time. Every two months of part-time, pre-completion OPT will reduce by one month the amount of OPT that can be done after graduation.</p>
<p>If a student wants to work while taking courses, I often recommend pursuing CPT if available and work part time to preserve post-completion OPT.</p>
<p>For OPT, the student must apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a work permit. How do they do it? The student must obtain the DSO’s authorization and signature on Form I-20 (Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status). That form, along with Form I-765 (Application for Employment Authorization Document) and the filing fee, must be submitted to USCIS within 30 days of the DSO’s endorsement.</p>
<p>For post-completion OPT, Form I-765 can be filed as early as 90 days before the student graduates, but no later than 60 days after graduation. If a student is applying on or before October 31, 2021, then the application can be filed as early as 120 days before graduation. That temporary change resulted from a settlement in a class-action lawsuit. The student or graduate can begin working once the work authorization card is received.</p>
<h2>How does the STEM OPT extension work?</h2>
<p>Students or graduates on OPT can qualify for a 24-month extension if they earned a <a href="https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/stem-list.pdf">STEM degree</a>. To be eligible to hire an individual on STEM OPT, your startup must:</p>
<p>Be enrolled and in good standing in the government’s <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/e-verify">E-Verify</a> program; provide a formal training program in the individual’s field of study and complete <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/i983.pdf">Form I-983</a> (Training Plan for STEM OPT Students); and offer a position that is equivalent to others in duties, hours and compensation, among other legal requirements.</p>
<p>STEM OPT also requires a new work permit. Form I-765, an updated Form I-20 that is signed by the DSO can be filed as early as 90 days before OPT ends (or 120 days if filing on or before October 31, 2021), but no later than 60 days after the DSO signs off on the I-20. Candidates seeking a STEM OPT extension can still <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/complete-correct-form-i-9/completing-section-1-employee-information-and-attestation/foreign-academic-students">continue to work</a> for I-9 purposes for up to 180 days while they are waiting for the approval.</p>
<h2>What happens next?</h2>
<p>Graduates have a 60-day grace period following their OPT or STEM OPT expiration date to either leave the U.S., change to another status or start a new degree program on an F-1 visa.</p>
<p>Any students your startup wants to retain should be registered in the annual H-1B lottery in March of each year. You can enter students in the H-1B lottery even before they graduate. If they don’t get selected, you can register them the following year, and so on until they’re selected or their time on OPT or STEM OPT runs out.</p>
<p>Some students might be eligible to stay working in the U.S. while their H-1B is pending in a status called “Cap Gap.” Your immigration attorney can help you determine alternatives to the H-1B for students and graduates based on their situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you think about service meshes, a somewhat esoteric cloud native tool designed to stitch different microservices together, you might not think it&#8217;s the most lucrative side of the Kubernetes led cloud native market, but you would be wrong. Today, <a href="http://solo.io">Solo.io</a>, a Cambridge, Massachusetts service mesh startup, announced a $135 million Series C at a fat $1 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Altimeter Capital led today&#8217;s round with participation from existing investors Redpoint Ventures and True Ventures. By the way, that valuation is a 10x increase over their previous valuation at the time of their $23 million Series B round in October 2020 and brings the total raised to $171.5 million.</p>
<p>While founder and CEO Idit Levine says the company she started in 2017 anticipated the rise of the service mesh market in general, she doesn&#8217;t see her company strictly focusing on that particular technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;We predicted everything that will happen in the market and honestly service mesh is catching on like crazy. But I will say that saying Solo is [strictly] a service mesh company, to me it&#8217;s like saying that Amazon only sells books. That&#8217;s where we started, and we&#8217;ll do whatever we need to do and go with the market,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company made some early bets on the open source Envoy proxy and Istio service mesh, Both projects have grown to be leaders in this space, and the company has been a major contributor to both from the very beginning, which puts it in a good position to build commercial products on top of these projects.</p>
<p>Just recently, Solo released <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/solo-io-integrates-a-cloud-native-api-gateway-and-service-mesh-into-its-enterprise-platform/">an updated version of Gloo Mesh technology</a>. The startup was able to combine an API gateway and service mesh into a single control plane, vastly simplifying the management of these technologies.</p>
<p>As they grow, as you would expect, the team is growing too with around 70 employees. She said her strategy has been to hire young people and teach them the business and it&#8217;s been working well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of diversity, she says that as a woman with a highly technical background, she has sometimes been frustrated by tokenism. &#8220;I never asked for anybody to give me this discount because I&#8217;m a woman. Actually, sometimes it has been irritating. Oh, we want to give you a talk because you&#8217;re a woman. It pissed me off. You need me to give a talk because I am damn good,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As she builds her company, she is making the effort to find more diverse candidates. Her current group of engineers is 30% women, which is high by tech company standards, and she continually looks for historically underrepresented groups as she hires.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of diversity in the company. [&#8230;] I think that it&#8217;s contributing to [our success]. We are reaching out to women in tech and people of color in tech, so we are definitely trying. We are going to meetups [and other places] and looking out for [diverse] people. And so we are trying and it&#8217;s definitely what we want to achieve,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>While Levine didn&#8217;t want to share specific revenue numbers, she said that the company&#8217;s goal for FY2021, which runs February to February, was to triple their ARR from the previous year, and they were able to do that by the end of Q2 of the fiscal year, putting them on track for some explosive growth. And she says, part of the reason for that is that companies are signing up for Solo&#8217;s products for multiple years. In fact, 35% of their contracts are for 2-3 years, accounting for over 100 contracts so far.</p>
<p>That could explain why investors were willing to pour so much money into this company and value it so highly. Levine says that she wasn&#8217;t looking for funding, but customer demand has been growing so quickly, and the funds will enable them to accelerate and keep the growth they&#8217;ve been experiencing going.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically there wasn&#8217;t any reason to take the money. I think that the reason I took this on is because we want to take over [the entire] market, and we need to grow. There&#8217;s so many demands and we need to scale dramatically, and that&#8217;s the main reason that we took this round,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rise of privacy-oriented financial blockchain projects are going to be crucial if “DeFi” (decentralized finance) is to have any kind of future. We have come to expect privacy in our “normal” financial lives, so we will expect it in the blockchain and Crypto world, whatever some might claim.<br />
We saw murmurs of that starting to happen back in May, when the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/in-the-race-towards-web-3-financial-privacy-secret-network-attracts-backing-from-key-players/">Secret Network blockchain</a>, a privacy-first smart contract platform, attracted investment from Arrington Capital, and Blocktower Capital. Furthermore, it was apparent when decentralized finance company Sienna Network <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/signalling-that-privacy-is-coming-to-defi-sienna-network-raises-11-2m-for-its-platform/">raised $11.2 million</a> from institutional investors and public supporters.</p>
<p>It was no coincidence that Sienna is built on the aforementioned Secret Network. Thus today Sienna is launching its &#8216;Automated Market Maker’ SiennaSwap, which works on its platform. Sienna token holders can now convert tokens into their private equivalent and then swap or place them in liquidity pools to gain yield.</p>
<p>It means users can avoid the lack of privacy on exchanges that allow others to see what users are doing and arbitrage on those transactions with “<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp">front-running</a>” &#8211; a key weakness of Crypto transactions today.</p>
<p>Also playing in this privacy space are Uniswap, PancakseSwap and other DEXs in the crypto ecosystem. However, where SiennaSwap differentiates, it says, is its privacy-preserving features, which, it claims, address the front-running issue. Sienna is also part of the Cøsmos Ecosystem, where plenty of new projects are launching, virtually every day, further enhancing its broader offering.</p>
<p>The SiennaSwap launch follows the organization’s $11.2 million private and public sale of its tokens in May when the organization raised $10 million in the private sale from investors such as Magnus NGC, Inclusion Capital, Lotus Capital, FBG, Skyvision Capital, and others.</p>
<p>It’s perhaps also worth noting that Sienna Network is a ‘carbon-friendly’ Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, requiring vastly less energy Proof-Of-Work chains like Bitcoin which require miners to use large amounts of power.</p>
<p>Tor Bair, Founder, Secret Foundation said: “Sienna’s launch marks a massive turning point both for Secret’s DeFi ecosystem and for DeFi in general. Providing privacy by design to users is critical to securing and scaling these new financial platforms, meaning Sienna is primed to create a new explosion of growth.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
