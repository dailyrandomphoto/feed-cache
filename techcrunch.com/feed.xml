										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple introduced new iMacs at its event on Tuesday, outfitted with its M1 processor and redesigned inside and out from the ground up. The hardware is impressive, but one of the biggest improvements for everyone&#8217;s Zoom-heavy life might be the webcam. Apple said it&#8217;s the &#8220;best camera ever in a Mac,&#8221; which honestly wouldn&#8217;t take much, but its specs suggest it actually is a big upgrade.</p>
<p>The camera finally achieves 1080p video capabilities, and Apple has also equipped it with a larger sensor that should provide greatly-improved low light performance. The M1 chip has better image signal processing capabilities, and uses computational video powers to correct and improve the image on the fly, which has brought benefits to the image quality even on existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro hardware with the same old, bad webcam equipment.</p>
<p>That should mean this iMac actually has really good image quality — or at least not image quality you need to be embarrassed about. The on-board machine learning processor in the M1, which Apple calls the Neural Engine, will be working in real-time to optimize lighting and do noise reduction, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On top of the camera, Apple touts new beam forming mics in a three-mic array that will optimize audio, focusing on your voice and eliminating background noise. All told, this should finally be a Mac that provides a videoconferencing experience that doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s stuck in the early 2000s.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Research papers come out far too frequently for anyone to read them all. That&#8217;s especially true in the field of machine learning, which now affects (and produces papers in) practically every industry and company. This column aims to collect some of the most relevant recent discoveries and papers — particularly in, but not limited to, artificial intelligence — and explain why they matter.</p>
<p>It takes an emotionally mature AI to admit its own mistakes, and that&#8217;s exactly what this project from the Technical University of Munich aims to create. Maybe not the emotion, exactly, but recognizing and learning from mistakes, specifically in self-driving cars. The researchers <a href="https://www.tum.de/nc/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/details/36509/">propose a system</a> in which the car would look at all the times in the past when it has had to relinquish control to a human driver and thereby learn its own limitations — <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9310689">what they call &#8220;introspective failure prediction.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>For instance, if there are a lot of cars ahead, the autonomous vehicle&#8217;s brain could use its sensors and logic to make a decision <em>de novo</em> about whether an approach would work or whether none will. But the TUM team says that by simply comparing new situations to old ones, it can reach a decision much faster on whether it will need to disengage. Saving six or seven seconds here could make all the difference for a safe handover.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important for robots and autonomous vehicles of all types to be able to make decisions without phoning home, especially in combat, where decisive and concise movements are necessary. The Army Research Lab is <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/244778/army_researchers_work_to_make_robots_self_sufficient">looking into ways</a> in which ground and air vehicles can interact autonomously, allowing, for instance, a mobile landing pad that drones can land on without needing to coordinate, ask permission or rely on precise GPS signals.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WzF8mHlZds4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Their solution, at least for the purposes of testing, is actually rather low tech. The ground vehicle has a landing area on top painted with an enormous QR code, which the drone can see from a fairly long way off. The drone can track the exact location of the pad totally independently. In the future, the QR code could be done away with and the drone could identify the shape of the vehicle instead, presumably using some best-guess logic to determine whether it&#8217;s the one it wants.</p>

<p>In the medical world, AI is being put to work not on tasks that are not much difficult but are rather tedious for people to do. A good example of this is tracking the activity of individual cells in microscopy images. It&#8217;s not a superhuman task to look at a few hundred frames spanning several depths of a petri dish and track the movements of cells, but that doesn&#8217;t mean grad students like doing it.</p>
<p>This software from<a href="https://www.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/english/research-news/03291709/"> researchers at Nagoya City University</a> in Japan does it automatically using image analysis and the capability (much improved in recent years) of understanding objects over a period of time rather than just in individual frames. <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59187">Read the paper here</a>, and check out the extremely cute illustration showing off the tech at right … more research organizations should hire professional artists.</p>
<p>This process is similar to that of tracking moles and other skin features on people at risk for melanoma. While they might see a dermatologist every year or so to find out whether a given spot seems sketchy, the rest of the time they must track their own moles and freckles in other ways. That&#8217;s hard when they&#8217;re in places like one&#8217;s back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has been slowly building a position for itself as a financial services giant, banked around its digital wallet for storing a user&#8217;s payment cards and the launch of its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/apple-rolls-out-apple-card-preview-to-select-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Card in 2019</a>. Today during Apple&#8217;s spring event, the company <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-introduces-apple-card-family-enabling-people-to-share-apple-card-and-build-credit-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the newest chapter in that functionality: the launch of Apple Card Family, which will let partners/spouses build joint credit, and give family members aged over 13 access to using Apple Card, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://apple.com/apple-card" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Card Family</a> will launch first in the US in May after users update to the latest version of iOS.</p>
<div>&#8220;One of the things that became apparent to us in the beginning [of launching Apple Card] was a lack of fairness in the way the industry calculated credit scores when there were two holders of a credit card,&#8221; said CEO Tim Cook today. &#8220;One of you got the benefit of building a good credit history, and the other did not. We want to reinvent the way this works.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some of this is not coming as a surprise: developer previews of iOS 14.5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/apple-card-multi-user-support-ios-14-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Apple was building in multi-user support for Apple Cards, laying the groundwork for joint accounts for adults and wider family usage.</p>
<p>As Cook described it, spouses and partners will be allowed to share and merge their credit lines have equal rights on their account, in order to &#8220;build credit equally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This solution helps deliver financial equity, and it&#8217;s a game changer,&#8221; he said. Indeed, in cases where either one partner has outstanding debts, or has defaulted on some of that debt, or doesn&#8217;t have the same earning power, this move is way to confer the stronger spending power of one partner on another, in cases where partners are actually combining their finances anyway. It makes sense and frankly is long overdue.</p>
<p>The ability to give Apple Card access to over-13s will come with spending limits if you want to put them in, along with other controls in terms of how it can be used.</p>
<p>This is also smart, an extension of how Apple has built a role for itself as the &#8220;responsible&#8221; technology company with privacy controls for all users, and parental controls for devices, and now it&#8217;s adding on a new angle to this provide, becoming an educative tool. Many parents are turning to technology and apps to build more financial nous among their children, and so it makes sense for Apple to position itself as a partner in this effort.</p>
<p>While letting families run their finances in a more equitable way, there is of course another, more business-minded strategy here: it&#8217;s clearly giving Apple a much, much bigger pool of potential consumers using its Apple Card, using services like Daily Cash (which gives up to 3 percent of every purchase as cash on users’ Apple Cash card each day) and access to using the secure titanium Apple Card that comes without a visible card number, CVV security code, expiration date, or signature.</p>
<p>On that subject, we don&#8217;t quite know how many people are using that Apple Card today. Cook simply called Apple Card, which was estimated to be used by over 3.1 million people as of March 2020, &#8220;the most successful credit card launch ever.&#8221;</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After years of waiting, Apple has finally given the world a dramatic new iMac redesign, aimed at the company&#8217;s long-standing goal of &#8220;making the computer disappear.&#8221; That, of course, only applies to the the thin new design, because these things are eye-popping. Naturally, the latest version of the 24-inch all-in-one desktop is built around the company&#8217;s new proprietary M1 chips.</p>
<p>The screen sports a 4.5K Retina Display, coupled with a 1080p camera &#8212; a first for the Mac line, and a sign the company is taking both audio and video more seriously as these products are serving as a kind of life line for the work from home crowd. True Tone is, naturally, on board for better color balance, and sound have been improved with six-speaker setup.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2141097" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-04.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="581" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-04.jpg 1914w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-04.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-04.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-04.jpg?resize=768,436 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-04.jpg?resize=680,386 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-04.jpg?resize=1536,872 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-imac-2021-04.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new devices are significantly thinner &#8212; with overall volume reduced by half, according to the company. The rear is also flat, instead of curved. In addition to allowing for a much thinner design, the new chip allows for far faster performance than previous models &#8212; a huge performance bump we&#8217;ve seen in our own testing of the most recent generation of Macs. All told, the company says it&#8217;s up to 85% faster than the last model, coupled with a GPU that&#8217;s up to twice as fast and 3x the machine learning.</p>
<p>Around back are two Thunderbolt ports and a new magnetic power adapter that also delivers Ethernet.</p>
<p>The system comes in seven colors. It starts at $1,299 (with four colors &#8212; you unlock all seven at $1,499). It goes up for pre-order April 30 and starts shipping in the second half of May.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Class, an edtech startup that integrates exclusively with Zoom to make remote teaching more elegant, has raised $12.25 million<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/class-announces-12m-investment-from-salesforce-ventures-and-seven-time-super-bowl-champion-tom-brady-301271967.html"> in new financing</a>. The round brings Salesforce Ventures, Sound Ventures and Super Bowl champion Tom Brady onto its capital table.</p>
<p>CEO and founder Michael Chasen said that Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, approached the company about investing in Class. Salesforce Ventures launched a $100 million Impact Fund in October 2020, a month after Class launched, to back edtech companies and cloud enterprises businesses with an impact lens.</p>
<p>As for Tom Brady entering the edtech world, Chasen said that the famous football player has made tech investments in the past and, “as the father of three is passionate about helping people through education.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Tom Brady and I are both fathers to three kids and like all parents, we get the need to add teaching and learning tools to Zoom,” Chasen added.</p>
<p>Class has now raised $58 million in less than a year, with a $30 million Series A in February 2021 and a $16 million seed round in September 2020. Today’s raise is less than its Series A round, which signals it was likely more done strategically to bring on investors than out of necessity.</p>
<p>The money will be used to help roll out Class to K-12 and higher-ed institutions across the world. The startup’s software publicly launched on the Mac a few months ago, and will exit beta for Windows, iPhone, Android and Chromebook in the next few weeks, Chasen said. The larger public launch will help scale the some 7,500 schools that have shown interest in adopting Class.</p>
<p>The big hurdle for Class, and any startup selling e-learning solutions to institutions, is post-pandemic utility. While institutions have traditionally been slow to adopt software due to red tape, Chasen says that both of Class’ customers, higher ed and K-12, are actively allocating budget for these tools. The price for Class ranges between $10,000 to $65,000 annually, depending on the number of students in the classes.</p>

<p>“We have not run into a budgeting problem in a single school,” Chasen said in February. “Higher ed has already been taking this step towards online learning, and they’re now taking the next step, whereas K-12, this is the first step they’re taking.” So far, Class has more than 125 paying clients with even-split between K-12 and higher ed, and 10% of customers using it for corporate teams.</p>
<p>It’s not the only startup that is trying to reinvent Zoom University. A number of companies are trying to serve the same market of students and teachers who are fatigued by current video conferencing solutions which — at best — often look like a gallery view with a chat bar. Three companies that are gaining traction include Engageli, Top Hat and InSpace.</p>
<p>While each startup has its own unique strategy and product, the founders behind them all need to answer the same question: Can they make digital learning a preferred mode of pedagogy and comprehension — and not merely a backup — after the pandemic is over?</p>
<p>As that question continues to get explored, today’s news shows that Class isn’t having any trouble recruiting people to believe the answer is yes. In just nine months, the company has gone from two to more than 150 employees and contractors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has added a new color option to the iPhone 12 lineup — a rare mid-cycle facelift for the company&#8217;s flagship product. The new color is purple, and looks like a lavender-ish pastel hue, which is in keeping with the tones on the rest of the color options on the 12 lineup, which include a mint green and a red that leans towards the pink end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>The purple iPhone 12 is going on sale starting this Friday, April 23, and will begin shipping out to customers on April 30. It&#8217;s available for iPhone 12 and 12 mini, but the iPhone 12 Pro isn&#8217;t getting any new color options to match.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a small thing, but not a bad way for Apple to jazz up their hardware mid-cycle in a bid to excite general consumers. Also, it suggests Apple is leaning in even more to a multicolor aesthetic for its hardware, which is a refreshing change after a mostly monochrome approach in recent years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today officially <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-introduces-airtag/">unveiled</a> AirTag, its location tracking beacons that can help Apple device owners find lost items through Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Find My&#8221; application. The AirTags themselves are small, rounded tracking devices that can be attached to personal items, like purses, bags or keys. Pre-orders start this Friday, and the product goes on sale April 23rd, for $29. A pack of four runs $99.</p>
<p>The tags are small, polished stainless steel and white, and circular in shape, and have the Apple logo printed on the front. They also come with a various case options and keychain dongles, allowing you to add an AirTag to your keys, for example, or a handbag or duffle, and so on. Further customization exists, including emoji symbols.</p>
<p>The item tracking uses the company&#8217;s proprietary U1 ultra-wideband chip for what it calls &#8220;Precision Finding.&#8221; This will work with Apple&#8217;s newer iPhones (iPhone 11, 11 Pro and the newer iPhones 12 devices) using the U1 chip and ultra-wideband, as well as other input from the camera, ARKit, accelerator, and gyroscope. This way, the Find My app can guide users to a lost AirTag using a combination of sound, haptics and visual feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The device also uses Bluetooth LE (low-energy) and is able to get a year of battery life, according to the company. When the battery is out of juice, it&#8217;s user replaceable.</p>
<p>A built-in speaker will play sounds to locate the AirTag when the item it&#8217;s attached to goes missing. If the AirTag is farther afield than under your couch cushion, for example, users can place the device into a &#8220;Lost Mode&#8221; that will leverage Apple&#8217;s Find My network across everyone&#8217;s devices.</p>
<p>To ensure privacy, AirTags&#8217; location data and location history is physically stored inside the device. Communication across the Find My network, meanwhile, is end-to-end encrypted.</p>
<p>And if you come across a lost AirTag, you can tap it with your iPhone or other NFC devices to be taken to a website where you can contact the owner by phone.</p>
<p>At launch, Apple is offering a range of accessories including the Polyurethane Loop, Leather Loop and Leather Key Ring. Apple and Hermès teamed up to create the AirTag Hermès, which include a custom-engraved AirTag, and assortment of leather accessories including the Bag Charm, Key Ring, Travel Tag, and Luggage Tag.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to bring this incredible new capability to iPhone users with the introduction of AirTag, leveraging the vast Find My network, to help them keep track of and find the important items in their lives,” said Kaiann Drance, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing, in a statement. “With its design, unparalleled finding experience, and built-in privacy and security features, AirTag will provide customers with another way to leverage the power of the Apple ecosystem and enhance the versatility of iPhone.”</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">assets</a> found in Apple&#8217;s code referencing the new product last year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/apple-accidentally-confirms-the-existence-of-an-unreleased-product-airtags/">a mistake in an official Apple YouTube video</a>, AirTags had also been brought up as an example of Apple&#8217;s anticompetitive behavior before U.S. regulators.</p>

<p>Last year, for example, Tile <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-apple-tile/tile-says-apples-behavior-is-anticompetitive-and-has-gotten-worse-not-better-idUSKBN21J72V?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtechnologyNews+%28Reuters+Technology+News%29">spoke about AirTags before a panel</a> of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, saying that Apple&#8217;s decision to launch its own version of the lost-item finder gave Apple&#8217;s new product a first-party advantage over its competitors. Apple&#8217;s devices, Tile explained, would be able operate in the background without having to continually popping up requests asking users to agree to background tracking, like Tile&#8217;s app has to do. Apple&#8217;s devices would also be integrated with &#8220;Find My,&#8221; but other tags would not be.</p>
<p>Following the regulatory scrutiny, Apple at its developer conference WWDC in June said<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"> it would extend &#8220;Find My&#8221;</a> to third-party companies. However, a report by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/24/apple-find-my-competition/">The Washington Post</a> indicated that olive branch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/25/this-week-in-apps-apple-argues-for-commissions-find-my-nda-alexa-to-open-apps/">may not have been what it seemed</a> &#8212; companies would have to sign an NDA and said Apple customers would be barred from using competing devices simultaneously.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141065" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141065" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2141065" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1463" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=105,150 105w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=210,300 210w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=768,1097 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=476,680 476w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=1075,1536 1075w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple_airtag-finding-screen_042021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=35,50 35w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141065" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Ahead of today&#8217;s event, Apple announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/e-bikes-and-earbuds-among-the-first-third-party-hardware-to-support-apples-find-my-tracking/">the launch of its Find My Network Accessory program</a>, which officially opened the doors to third-party manufacturers who wanted access to the Find My app. Early adopters included VanMoof’s S3 and X3 e-bikes, Belkin’s SOUNDFORM Freedom True Wireless Earbuds, and an AirTags competitor, the Chipolo ONE Spot &#8212; but not Tile. We understand Tile doesn&#8217;t want to participate in Find My because it has a direct relationship with customers through its own iOS app that it doesn&#8217;t want to give up.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s entry in this &#8220;lost item finder&#8221; space means competitors, like Tile, will have more serious competition even with the concessions Apple has made with the opening up of &#8220;Find My.&#8221; Tile so far has responded to Apple&#8217;s plans by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">pre-announcing its plans to launch its own UWB-powered tracker</a>, arriving this year. Apple&#8217;s tight hold over its ecosystem benefits its launch of new products, like AirTags, forcing Tile to focus on touting its advantages, like its wider variety of form factors and cross-platform support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After years of increased competition from Spotify, Apple today announced its own expansion into podcast subscriptions. At the company&#8217;s spring event this afternoon, Apple unveiled its plans for a podcasts subscription service which would allow listeners to unlock &#8220;additional benefits,&#8221; like ad-free listening, early access to episodes and the ability to support favorite creators. The service will be available as part of Apple&#8217;s newly updated Podcasts app where free podcasts are also found.</p>
<p>The announcement of the new service, Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, follows shortly after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spotify-podcast-listeners-to-top-apples-for-the-first-time-in-2021-forecast-claims/">an industry report suggested</a> that Spotify&#8217;s podcast listeners would top Apple&#8217;s for the first time in 2021.</p>
<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook briefly introduced the subscription at the launch of today&#8217;s event, noting that this was &#8220;the biggest change to Apple Podcasts since its debut.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cook also noted the Apple Podcasts app had been updated, with newly redesigned show and episode pages that make it easier to listen, follow and share podcasts. The app will also include a new &#8220;Channels&#8221; feature that lets you find shows from favorite creators and get recommendations. This area will include both free channels and paid channels, which feature benefits for paid subscribers.</p>
<p>The channels themselves are groups of shows curated by creators, with &#8220;unique titles, descriptions, and artwork,&#8221; Apple says.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2141045" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="362" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg 2702w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?resize=768,409 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?resize=1536,819 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1091 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-20-at-1.05.06-PM.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app will also include a &#8220;Smart Play&#8221; button that helps listeners automatically start episodic shows from the latest episode and serialized shows from the beginning of each series, Apple says. Other new features let users save individual episodes for offline playback, an enhanced Search tab for quick access to Top Charts, and an updated <a href="https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-analytics-exit-link="">Apple Podcasts Connect</a> dashboard for podcasters. The dashboard allows creators to edit their shows&#8217; metadata, schedule and manage show availability, organize shows into channels, manage multiple users and roles, and track how well their shows are doing via new performance metrics and visualization tools.</p>
<p>Apple said the new service will be available in May to listeners in more than 170 countries and regions.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-leads-the-next-chapter-of-podcasting-with-apple-podcasts-subscriptions/">press release</a>, Apple said the first premium subscriptions would come from both &#8220;independent voices and premier studios,&#8221; including Tenderfoot TV, Pushkin Industries, Radiotopia from PRX, and QCODE, as well as larger brands like NPR, the Los Angeles Times, The Athletic, Sony Music Entertainment, and others.</p>
<p>“Fifteen years ago, Apple took podcasts mainstream, offering creators a premier, open platform to inform, entertain, and inspire hundreds of millions of listeners around the world,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, in a statement. “Today, Apple Podcasts is the best place for listeners to discover and enjoy millions of great shows, and we are proud to lead the next chapter of podcasting with Apple Podcasts Subscriptions. We’re excited to introduce this powerful new platform to creators around the world, and we can’t wait to hear what they make with it.”</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s plans for a podcast subscription service was previously scooped by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-spring-event-expected-to-reveal-latest-ipad-pro-subscription-podcasts-11618911002?page=1">The Wall St. Journal</a>, which said the company was preparing to add a paid subscription option to its product, as well as by Vox Media’s <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;jsonp=vglnk_161893061758410&amp;key=c1c7d488bb2df8a8b659d5d41634d304&amp;libId=knq4nliq010023dg000DL3p0gc3luw2cs&amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2021%2F04%2F19%2Freport-premium-podcasts-subscription-service-to-be-announced-at-the-apple-event%2F&amp;v=1&amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fpkafka%2Fstatus%2F1383878437119479811&amp;title=Report%3A%20Premium%20podcasts%20subscription%20service%20to%20be%20announced%20at%20the%20Apple%20event%20-%209to5Mac&amp;txt=podcast%20subscription%20service">Peter Kafka</a>, who said he believed Apple would introduce a paywalled podcast subscription product at today&#8217;s event. There were also hints found in the iOS 14.5 beta, which showed a redesigned Podcasts app featuring an account button on the Listen Now tab. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/19/apple-may-announce-podcasts-service-at-event/">MacRumors</a> had reported that show notifications had been relocated here, and suggested that managing paid subscriptions may also be found in this new area in the future.</p>
<p>The move to enter the subscription podcast space follows years of significant investment by the Apple Podcasts and Apple Music competitor, Spotify, also a chief Apple critic.</p>
<p>Spotify in February noted it had <a href="https://www.axios.com/spotify-podcasts-number-6c06a71f-6548-4f03-b7e1-5c9e71814f62.html">tripled</a> the number of podcasts on its platform, year-over-year, to 2.2 million. It has also forged a variety of exclusive deals over the years with big names like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/spotify-signs-the-joe-rogan-experience-to-an-exclusive-multi-year-deal/">Joe Rogan</a>, Kim Kardashian, DC Comics, Michelle Obama and The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, among others. And it has acquired podcast startups, ad tech and studios, including hosting and ad company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">Megaphone</a>, creation tools from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">Anchor</a>, content producers like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">Gimlet</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/spotify-is-buying-the-ringer-to-boost-its-sports-podcast-content/">The Ringer,</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/spotify-acquires-true-crime-studio-parcast-to-expand-its-original-podcast-content/">Parcast.</a></p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/spotify-signs-the-joe-rogan-experience-to-an-exclusive-multi-year-deal/">Spotify announced plans for its own podcast subscriptions</a> via an Anchor feature and invested in live audio through its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spotify-is-getting-into-live-audio-because-of-course-it-is/">acquisition of live chat app Locker Room</a> by Betty Labs. Spotify had said it would share subscription revenue with podcast creators, who would keep the majority of their earnings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/as-crypto-comes-back-binance-backed-injective-protocol-launches-testnet-for-its-defi-trading-platform/">December</a> last year <a href="https://injectiveprotocol.com/">Injective Protocol</a>, launched the testnet for its DeFi protocols for cross-chain derivatives trading, with  backing from giant crypto exchange Binance. It has now raised $10 million in a “party&#8221; funding round. Participating in the round was Pantera Capital, BlockTower, Hashed, Cadenza Ventures (formerly BitMex Ventures), CMS, and QCP Capital. Billionaire NBA team owner and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1362427956107345924?s=21">has also</a> made a strategic investment into Injective, according to my sources.</p>
<p>Injective’s main competitors (centralized and decentralized exchanges) include CME Group, BitMEX, LedgerX and OKEx, among others. The advantage of the approach used by Injective (it says) combines the advantages of decentralized exchanges: resistance to front running, scams, and hacks, with the speed, low transaction fees, and no gas fees associated with centralized platforms. Developers can also create their own derivatives and markets to trade.</p>
<p>Eric Chen, CEO of Injective Protocol said in a statement: “Legacy institutions and practices create a number of artificial delays and middlemen that prevent innovation in the financial markets ecosystem. At Injective, our goal is to enable an unparalleled decentralized trading experience, whereby retail traders globally can for the first time access limitless markets without the typical predatory fees and slow transaction times”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The background to this is that Injective is essentially trying to build a decentralized competitor to Robinhood, because their platform allows the creation of synthetic tokens that represent stock in public companies like Apple and indices like S&amp;P 500. This means meaning trading can happen 24/7 with instant finalization, as DeFi promises.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do I invest in Injective: the whole stop out because of the capital requirements, Robinhood didn’t do it on purpose to hurt traders, they just didn’t have enough equity and they would have gone bankrupt because they had too many customers. But if you’re doing it in a decentralized manner every investor gets to see how much Injective has of all of this, there’s no hiding it and that creates an opportunity&#8221;, said Mark Cuban on his investment in Injective.</p>
<p>The potential here is that brokers wouldn’t be able to block trades on certain stocks, as they did with GameStop, as pointed out by Cuban above.</p>
<p>Injective’s team is drawn from Stanford University, came up with its project in 2018, and Chen was working at hedge funds and worked in cryptographic research at a blockchain-focused fund.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is now the default business model for most B2B and B2C software startups. And while it&#8217;s been around for a while now, its momentum keeps accelerating and the ecosystem continues to expand as technologists and marketers are getting more sophisticated about how to build and sell SaaS products. For all of them, we&#8217;re pleased to announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=launchpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=launchpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Sessions: SaaS 2021</a>, a one-day virtual event that will examine the state of SaaS to help startup founders, developers and investors understand the state of play and what&#8217;s next.</p>
<p>The single-day event will take place 100% virtually on October 27 and will feature actionable advice, Q&amp;A with some of SaaS&#8217;s biggest names, and plenty of networking opportunities. $75 Early Bird Passes are now on sale. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=launchpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=launchpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Book your passes today to save $100 before prices go up</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not quite ready to disclose our agenda yet, but you can expect a mix of superstars from across the industry, ranging from some of the largest tech companies to up-and-coming startups that are pushing the limits of SaaS.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The plan is to look at a broad spectrum of what&#8217;s happening in with B2B startups and give you actionable insights into how to build and/or improve your own product. If you&#8217;re just getting started, we want you to come away with new ideas for how to start your company and if you&#8217;re already on your way, then our sessions on scaling both your technology and marketing organization will help you to get to that $100 million annual run rate faster.</p>
<p>In addition to other founders, you&#8217;ll also hear from enterprise leaders who decide what to buy &#8212; and the mistakes they see startups make when they try to sell to them.</p>
<p>But SaaS isn&#8217;t only about managing growth &#8212; though ideally, that&#8217;s a problem founders will face sooner or later. Some of the other specific topics we will look at are how to keep your services safe in an ever-growing threat environment, how to use open source to your advantage and how to smartly raise funding for your company.</p>
<p>We will also highlight how B2B and B2C companies can handle the glut of data they now produce and use it to build machine learning models in the process. We&#8217;ll talk about how SaaS startups can both do so themselves and help others in the process. There&#8217;s nary a startup that doesn&#8217;t want to use some form of AI these days, after all.</p>
<p>And because this is 2021, chances are we&#8217;ll also talk about building remote companies and the lessons SaaS startups can learn from the last year of working through the pandemic.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t miss out. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=launchpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=launchpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Book your $75 Early Bird pass today and save $100.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.catchandrelease.com">Catch&amp;Release</a> founder and CEO Analisa Goodin told me that she wants to help brands break free from the limitations of stock photography — and that her startup has raised $14 million in Series A funding to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>Goodin explained that the company started out as an image research firm before becoming a product-focused, venture-backed startup in 2015. The Series A was led by Accel (with participation from Cervin Ventures and other existing investors), and it brings Catch&amp;Release&#8217;s total funding to $26 million.</p>
<p>Stock media and video services are moving in this direction themselves, for example by introducing <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/contributor/206488441/eyeem">their own libraries of user-generated content</a>. Goodin applauded this, and she said Catch&amp;Release isn&#8217;t opposed to the use of stock photos — it integrates with these stock marketplaces. At the same time, she suggested that she has a much bigger vision.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This isn’t just about UGC, this is about tapping into the creative potential of the internet,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>After all, you can now find pretty much any kind of content you can imagine somewhere online, but &#8220;a lot of advertising agencies and brands have been trained that if a piece of content comes form internet, avoid it,&#8221; because it&#8217;s just &#8220;too hard&#8221; to figure out how to license it. (And indeed, that&#8217;s why I went with a stock photo for the lead image of this post.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140993" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140993" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140993" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?w=680" alt="Catch&amp;Release screenshot" width="680" height="421" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg 2952w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?resize=768,476 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?resize=1536,951 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?resize=2048,1268 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140993" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Catch&amp;Release</p></div></p>
<p>Catch&amp;Release aims to make that process as simple as possible, first with a browser extension that allows marketers to save any media that they find on the web, anytime they think they might want to use in their own campaigns (this is the &#8220;catch&#8221; part of the process). It even presents a &#8220;licensability score,&#8221; which is a rating based on factors like the person who posted the content, the description and the comments, indicating how likely it is that a marketer will actually be able to license this content.</p>
<p>Then, when someone from a brand or advertising agency decides that they want to use a piece of content, they can send a licensing request with a push of a button (this is the &#8220;release&#8221;). Catch&amp;Releases also analyzes the content for anything else that needs to be cleared or obscured, such as a company logo.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;ve written about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/20/lobster-nets-1m-to-scale-its-user-generated-content-licensing-marketplace/">other tools for licensing online content</a>, Goodwin emphasized that Catch&amp;Release isn&#8217;t just about finding photos for a social media campaign. Part of the goal, she said, is to erase the &#8220;stigma&#8221; around UGC, which now &#8220;represents the entire spectrum of culturally relevant content.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, she showed me <a href="https://www.catchandrelease.com/customer-work#red-lobster-the-hard-way">a Red Lobster commercial</a> that looks like a normal TV ad, but was in fact assembled entirely from footage found online — something that&#8217;s been even more useful in the past year, with pandemic-related safety concerns around large shoots.

<p>Goodwin added that the new funding will allow Catch&amp;Release to continue investing in product, engineering and marketing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For <a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a>, much of the last 8 years simply posting positive revenue growth was a challenge. In fact, the company had a period between 2013 and 2018 when it experienced<a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/19/ibm_fy2017_sales_growth/"> an astonishing 22 straight quarters</a> of negative revenue growth. So when Big Blue <a href="https://www.ibm.com/investor/att/pdf/IBM-1Q20-Earnings-Press-Release.pdf">reported yesterday</a> that revenue was up slightly, I&#8217;m sure the company took that as a win. Investors appear to be happy with the results with the stock up 4.73% this morning as of publication.</p>
<p>Consider that over the last 8 quarters encompassing FY2019 and FY2020, the company had only one positive revenue quarter when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/ibm-snaps-out-of-revenue-doldrums-breaking-a-five-quarter-losing-streak-in-q4/">it was up 0.1%</a> in Q42019. It had had five losing quarters prior to that one. When you look at yesterday&#8217;s report in that light, and combine it with growth in the Cloud and Cognitive Services group, it adds up to a decent quarter for IBM, one it badly needed after another negative report <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/ibm-transformation-struggles-continue-with-cloud-and-ai-revenue-down-4-5/">in the prior quarter.</a></p>
<p>Looking back at the January report, the company reported Cloud and Cognitive Services revenues down 4.5% at $6.8 billion, which was a big blow considering the company has been betting much of its future on those very areas, fueled in large part by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/with-the-acquisition-closed-ibm-goes-all-in-on-red-hat/">$34 billion Red Hat acquisition</a> in 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Its most recent quarterly report proved much better with the company reporting Cloud and Cognitive Services revenues of $5.4 billion, up 3.8% YoY. Interestingly quarter-on-quarter revenue for the segment was down, but rose on a year-over-year basis. Perhaps a year-end enterprise revenue push could account for the difference between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021.</p>
<p>At any rate, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna saw today&#8217;s report as a positive sign that his attempts to push the company toward a future focused on hybrid computing and AI were starting to take root. He also saw enough in the report to predict some growth this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our last call, we shared our financial expectations for the year, revenue growth and $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. While it’s still early in the year and a lot remains to be done, we are confident enough to say that we are on track,&#8221; Krishna said in the earnings call with analysts yesterday.</p>
<p>The company has made a number of smaller acquisitions over the last year including a couple of consulting companies, which should help as they try to work with customers around the transition to hybrid computing and artificial intelligence, both of which tend to require a lot of hand-holding to get done.</p>

<p>At the same time of course, the company is continuing apace with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/as-ibm-spins-out-legacy-infrastructure-management-biz-ceo-goes-all-in-on-the-cloud/">its spin out of the legacy infrastructure services division</a>, which it announced last year. The plan at this point is to rename the company Kyndryl (an unfortunate choice) and complete the spin out by year&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>CFO Jim Kavanaugh also sees the modestly positive quarter as something the company can build on. &#8220;&#8230;in fact we are even more confident in the position we put in place with regards to our two most important measures, one, revenue growth, and second, adjusted free cash flow, which is going to provide the fuel for the investments needed for us to capture that hybrid cloud $1 trillion TAM,&#8221; Kavanaugh said in the earnings call with analysts.</p>
<p>All of this is being pushed by Red Hat, which grew revenue 15% in the most recent quarter, something the company is banking will continue to advance it deeper into positive territory throughout the rest of 2021.</p>
<p>Krishna is not looking for booming growth by any means. He just wants growth, and even sustained single digit top line expansion will make him happy. &#8220;Our systems if I take a two-year to three-year view kind of flattish, but in any given year it might increase or decrease but not by a whole lot. It doesn’t impact the topline a lot and that’s how sort of we get to the mid-single-digit sustainably,&#8221; Krishna said in the call.</p>
<p>The CEO simply wants to bring some long-term stability back to the company it has been sadly lacking in recent years. Of course, it&#8217;s hard to know if this quarter was a temporary upward blip on IBM&#8217;s earnings chart, one of those fluctuations up or down he spoke of, or if it is the corner the company has been looking to turn for years. Only time will tell whether IBM can sustain the modest revenue goals Krishna has set for the organization, or if it will fall back into the revenue doldrums that have plagued the company for the last eight years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment landscape for insurtech startups is off to a hot start in Q2 2021. Since the end of the first quarter, we’ve seen several players in the broad startup category announce new capital, including </span><a href="https://clearcover.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearcover</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://alan.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.nextinsurance.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next Insurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.thezebra.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zebra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, as anyone who&#8217;s familiar with startups that offer insurance-related products and services knows, the sector is enough of a mixed bag that one needs to segment down to get clarity on how constituent companies are performing. So while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearcover</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s $200 million round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from <a href="https://clearcover.com/press/#/clearcover-raises-200-million">last week</a>, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/next-insurance-raises-250m-doubling-its-valuation-to-4b-in-under-a-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next Insurance’s $250 million round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the first of the month and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/alan-raises-220-million-for-its-health-insurance-and-healthcare-super-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alan’s $220 million round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from yesterday are interesting, this morning we’re going to focus a bit more on The Zebra’s side of the insurtech house. </span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Exchange divides insurtech startups into three categories: neoinsurance providers, insurtech marketplaces and insurtech enablers. (You can see why we need to segment the insurtech genre!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briefly, neoinsurance providers are companies like </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/root-targets-6b-valuation-in-pending-ipo-a-boon-for-insurtech-startups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Root</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/as-metromile-looks-to-go-public-insurtech-funding-is-on-the-rise/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metromile </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/as-next-insurance-makes-its-first-acquisition-insurtech-looks-energetic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next Insurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which use technology to underwrite and sell insurance in an updated manner; these companies also often have optimized mobile experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketplaces like The Zebra, Gabi, Insurify and others provide a way for consumers to better identify their insurance options. And, finally, there are companies like </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/agentsync-lands-consecutive-rounds-as-insurtech-booms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AgentSync</span></a>, which<span style="font-weight: 400;"> fit neatly into our third category of firms that help other companies in the insurance business digitize their operations or otherwise modernize. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This morning, let’s discuss insurtech’s 2020 as a whole, peek at some preliminary 2021 venture data and then dive deep into what we’ve collected regarding growth among insurtech marketplace players. The Exchange has data and other details from The Zebra, Insurify, Wefox and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering longitudinal progress of specific startup categories is one of our favorite things to do. So, please, walk with us!</span></p>
<h2>2020 to today</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PitchBook data regarding </span><a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q4-2020-emerging-tech-research-insurtech"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the insurtech category in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> underscores how large the startup niche has grown. Per the data company, $18.3 billion was spent last year on insurtech startups across venture capital, private equity and M&amp;A activity. That was a billion dollars under its 2019 result, but given the pandemic’s onset, 2020’s final result is somewhat impressive &#8212; who expected insurance investing to hold up during an unprecedented global catastrophe?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year is proving lucrative for the insurtech market, at least from a venture capital perspective. Normally I’d make a joke about how unprofitable some neoinsurance providers are at this juncture, but because our focus is elsewhere, bringing up the fact that, say, Lemonade’s adjusted losses in the final quarter of 2020 were around 150% of its revenue is kind of irrelevant. So we won&#8217;t!<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wayup.com">WayUp</a> started out as a platform to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/wayup-gets-18-5-million-more-to-help-college-grads-find-jobs/">help college graduates find jobs and internships</a>, but over time, it has increasingly focused on helping employers find diverse job candidates. And it recently introduced a new feature to help those employers see exactly where their diversity and inclusion efforts may be falling short.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Liz Wessel explained that when companies aren&#8217;t hiring enough employees from diverse backgrounds, recruiters and executives often assume &#8220;we&#8217;re not getting enough of those candidates at the top of our funnel.&#8221; That idea, she suggested, is exemplified by Wells Fargo CEO <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/22/wells-fargo-ceo-ruffles-feathers-with-comments-about-diverse-talent.html">Charles Schlarf&#8217;s controversial remarks last fall</a>, when he said the company wasn&#8217;t reaching its diversity goals because there simply aren&#8217;t enough qualified candidates.</p>
<p>Wessel suggested that when you take a look closer look at the data, you find that the initial outreach and recruiting is only part of the problem. WayUp&#8217;s new dashboard allows employers to track this, because it shows the demographic (race and gender) breakdown of the candidate pool at each part of the funnel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, Wessel said that many employers hiring for technical roles discover that they&#8217;re reaching a relatively diverse candidate pool during their initial outreach, and that the pool stays diverse during the first interviews — only to become much more white and male after the technical assessments/programming tests.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140948" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140948" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140948" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Demographics-by-Stage.jpg?w=680" alt="WayUp demographics dashboard" width="680" height="532" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Demographics-by-Stage.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Demographics-by-Stage.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Demographics-by-Stage.jpg?resize=300,235 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Demographics-by-Stage.jpg?resize=768,601 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Demographics-by-Stage.jpg?resize=680,532 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Demographics-by-Stage.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140948" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WayUp</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Similar to the SATs, many technical assessments have high correlation to socioeconomics status,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Upon discovering this, some recruiters may choose to stop requiring these tests. Others may choose to keep them — but thanks to WayUp, at least they know where the breakdown is really happening.</p>
<p>After Wessel showed me the dashboard, I wondered why other hiring platforms didn&#8217;t offer something similar. In a follow-up email, she suggested that many platforms don&#8217;t realize that achieving these goals requires about more than just getting a diverse diverse pool of candidates. Plus, she said WayUp is &#8220;one of the only sourcing/job platforms that I know of that has candidates self-report their race/ethnicity, gender and veteran status (in an EEOC/OFCCP compliant way).&#8221;</p>
<p>She added, &#8220;We really are focusing on having our platform make it so your entire hiring process is equitable and optimizes for employers hiring a diverse workforce, [versus] putting a Band-Aid or quick fix on the issue by just sourcing more diverse candidates at the top of your funnel.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farshad Yousefi and Masoud Jalali used to drive through Palo Alto neighborhoods and marvel at the outrageous home prices. But the drives sparked an idea. They were not in a financial position to purchase a home in those neighborhoods (to be clear, not many people are) either for investment or to live. But what if they could invest in homes in up and coming cities throughout the U.S.?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then they realized that even that might be a challenge considering that with all their student debt, affording a down payment would be impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was nothing available out there besides a crowdfunding platform, which when we first signed up, took away $1,000 from our account that we didn’t have, and then our capital would be locked up for 3 to 10 years,” recalls Yousefi.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the pair started doing research and spoke to 1,000 individuals under the age of 35. Eight out of 10 said they would like to invest in real estate but were deterred by all the barriers to entry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is clearly a large demand for access to real estate,” Yousefi said. “And we wanted to give people a way to invest in it like they can in stocks, via a mobile app.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so the idea for <a href="https://www.fintor.com">Fintor</a> was born.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yousefi and Jalali founded the company in 2020 with the goal of purchasing homes via an LLC, and turning each into shares through a SEC-approved broker dealer. Individuals can then buy shares of the homes via Fintor’s platform. Its next step is to sign agreements with individual real estate investors or bigger real estate development firms to list their properties on the platform and give people the opportunity to buy shares</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now Fintor has raised $2.5 million in seed money to continue building out its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fractional real estate investing platform. The startup aims to “fractionalize” houses and other residential property, giving people in the U.S. access to investment opportunities “starting with as little as $5.” The company attracted the interest of investors such as 500 Startups, Hustle Fund, Graphene Ventures, Houston-based real estate investor Manny Khoshbin, Mana Ventures and other angel investors such as Cindy Bi, Skyler Fernandes, VU Venture Partners, Minal Hasan, Andrew Zalasin, Alluxo CEO and Founder Safa Mahzari, SquareFoot CEO and founder Jonathan Wasserstrum and Teachable CEO and founder Ankur Nagpal.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140934" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140934" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2140934" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="593" height="445" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140934" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fintor</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintor is eying markets such as Kansas City, South Carolina, and Houston, Texas, where it already has some properties. It’s looking for homes in the $80,000 to $350,000 price range, and millennials and GenZers are its target demographic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fintor can give the same return as the stock market, but at half the risk,” Yousefi said. “As two [Iranian] immigrants, we’ve seen how much this country has to offer and how real estate sits at the top of everything, yet is so inaccessible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair had originally set out to raise just $1 million but the round was quickly “way oversubscribed,” according to Yousefi, and they ended up raising $2.5 million at triple the original valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jalali said the company will use machine learning technology to filter and rate properties as it scales its business model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll use ML to categorize neighborhoods and to come up with the price of properties to offer to potential sellers,” he added. “Our ultimate goal is to create indexes so that people can invest in multiple properties in a given city. That creates diversification right away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth Yin, co-founder and general partner of Hustle Fund, believes that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintor is solving a generational problem with real estate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Retail investors have almost no access to great real estate investments today and the best opportunities are reserved for the select few,” she told TechCrunch. “Not to mention that in addition to access, retail investors often need a lot of capital in order to have a diversified portfolio or be accredited to join funds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintor’s approach to securitize real estate assets will give millions of investors who are not accredited investors access they would otherwise not have had, Yin added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Simultaneously, it provides increased liquidity to property owners, while improving the user experience for both parties,” she said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effectively this becomes a new asset class, because it’s entirely turnkey and is fractionalized, which opens up many new pockets of investors.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/19/apple-just-created-and-killed-a-generation-of-ar-businesses/">introduction of ARKit</a> changed the game for entrepreneurs, not unlike the App Store did on a much, <em>much</em> larger scale back in 2008.</p>
<p>One entrepreneur, <a href="https://twitter.com/luckyloberg">Dana Loberg</a>, has capitalized on the launch of ARKit with her startup <a href="https://leoapp.com/">Leo AR</a>.</p>
<p>Leo is the result of a few pivots. The company first started out as MojiLala, which launched out of <a href="https://www.betaworks.com/">betaworks</a>. It was a hassle-free sticker marketplace that allowed artists to upload their stickers and sell them through the platform for end-users to use in a number of locations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2017, MojiLala <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/27/surreal-wants-to-be-the-one-stop-shop-for-3d-virtual-objects/">released a new app called Surreal</a>, which allowed artists to sell virtual objects to end users and lay them over their camera to record fun content. Now as Leo AR, the company is focused on 3D augmented reality objects without losing focus on giving artists an easy-to-use outlet for their virtual wares.</p>
<p>Today, Leo is announcing the raise of a $3 million seed round led by <a href="http://www.greatoaksvc.com/">Great Oaks Ventures</a>, with participation from Dennis Phelps of IVP, betaworks, <a href="https://www.dtcp.capital/">Deutsch Telekom</a>, <a href="https://www.quakecapital.com/">Quake Capital</a>, and other angel investors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140921" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140921" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140921" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed.gif?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140921" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Leo AR</p></div></p>
<p>The app operates on a freemium basis, letting end users subscribe to certain artists they like on the platform. Leo takes a 30 percent cut on those purchases, but Loberg said that her main priority beyond generating revenue is ensuring that artists get paid well and are incentivized to create and sell through her platform.</p>
<p>Loberg also shared that the app has exploded in popularity among children, who enjoy creating videos with dinosaurs or dragons in them.</p>
<p>In fact, Leo users have created more than 8 million videos on the platform, and active users add more than 85 3D objects to their scenes and average 10+ minutes in the app when they use it.</p>
<p>Leo not only lets users distribute their content out to other platforms like Instagram, but it also has a feed of the best videos created in Leo for others to check out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As AI improves, the possibilities of what we can do with the technology grow exponentially (for better or worse). <a href="https://www.synthesia.io/">Synthesia</a>, an AI video generation platform, is looking to make video content creation as simple and efficient as possible, and FirstMark is taking a bet on it making the world better, and not worse.</p>
<p>The company has just announced the close of a $12.5 million Series A funding round led by <a href="https://firstmarkcap.com/">FirstMark Capital</a>, with participation from angels Christian Bach (CEO, Netlify) and Michael Buckley (VP Communications, Twilio), as well as existing investors <a href="https://www.ldv.co/">LDV Capital</a>, <a href="https://mmc.vc/">MMC Ventures</a>, <a href="https://seedcamp.com/">Seedcamp</a>, Mark Cuban, Taavet Hinrikus, Martin Varsavsky, and <a href="https://www.tiny.vc/">TinyVC</a>.</p>
<p>Though Synthesia&#8217;s technology could be applied to dozens of use cases, the startup is focused initially on educational content for organizations and enterprises. Think training videos and company- or department-wide video updates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: Users can choose from a library of existing actors (who get paid per video they appear in) or upload their own video to create an avatar. To use their own voice and avatar, Synthesia walks them through instructions on what type of video and audio they should send in.</p>
<p>Users can then type in a script, add other components like text, images, shapes, etc. and ultimately generate the video without any video creation or editing skills whatsoever. It&#8217;s also super easy to update or edit the video without having to do any traditional video editing.</p>
<p>The startup is well aware of how this platform could be used nefariously, and has built in multiple layers of security and authentication to ensure that users are aware of how their avatar is being used in videos, with the ability to check the script or the video before it&#8217;s generated or published.</p>
<p>Not only can this platform be used for the dozen or so training and educational videos that a company deploys each year, but it can be used in more creative ways. The general principle is that video content is more compelling and engaging than text or other content. So imagine, say, that the weekly emails that come from your manager or CEO with updates on the business came in the form of video. With Synthesia, it&#8217;s super easy and low-cost to create that video quickly.</p>
<p>Synthesia has an entry-level plan, which costs $30 per month per seat and offers 10 minutes of video per month. The startup also has an enterprise level plan that starts at $500 per month and comes with more video minutes and extra functionality.</p>
<p>The company plans on using the funding to fuel customer growth and product development.</p>
<p>Beyond the enterprise video platform, Synthesia is also working on an API that would allow organizations to hook the Synthesia tech into their own systems <em>and</em> distribute that video. Cofounder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/vriparbelli?lang=en">Victor Riparbelli</a> showed an example where users could choose a stock and plug in a phone number that would automatically create a video with a daily stock price update and distribute that video to the specified phone number.</p>
<p>The enterprise product, called STUDIO, launched into public beta in the summer of 2020 and has since amassed more than 1000 companies as users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://pragma.gg">Pragma</a> is building what it calls a &#8220;backend as a service,&#8221; providing ready-made infrastructure to developers of online, live service games. And it&#8217;s announcing today that it has raised $12 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The round was led by David Thacker at Greylock, with participation from Zynga founder Mark Pincus, Oculus founder Nate Mitchell and Cloudera founder Amr Awadallah, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/pragma-is-a-backend-toolkit-for-gaming-companies-so-game-developers-can-focus-on-games/">previous investors</a> Upfront Ventures and Advancit Capital. Amy Chang, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/cisco-acquires-accompany/">sold her business intelligence startup Accompany</a> to Cisco, is joining Pragma&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Eden Chen told me that where Unity and Unreal have built popular frontend game engines, he and his co-founder Chris Cobb (former engineering lead at Riot Games) are hoping Pragma will fill the void for a &#8220;de facto backend game engine.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And while &#8220;many companies tried to do this&#8221; over the past decade, Chen suggested that this is the right time to launch the platform, thanks to the continued rise of live service games (like League of Legends) that have to be treated as &#8220;living, breathing products,&#8221; as well as improved tooling around infrastructure platforms like Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140903" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140903" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140903" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?w=680" alt="Pragma screenshot" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140903" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pragma</p></div></p>
<p>Pragma is launching a <a href="https://pragma.gg/starter-kit">starter kit</a> today designed to allow developers to quickly set up and test game loops. Meanwhile, the broader platform is currently in private beta testing with studios including One More Game (started by started by Pat Wyatt, one of Blizzard’s first employees) and Mitchell&#8217;s Mountain Top Studios.</p>
<p>Chen said the platform&#8217;s features fall into three broad categories — player accounts/social, game loops (including lobbies and matchmaking) and player/game data. Pragma isn&#8217;t building all of this from scratch; in some cases, it&#8217;s &#8220;acting as the integrator&#8221; for other platforms like Discord. Chen also noted that while the team plans to build a fully managed solution in the future, the current version is on-premise: &#8220;We’re building an instance of Pragma on the studio’s own infrastructure, [so they can] so they can take our code base and customize it to their own preferences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pragma is initially targeting game studios with about 10 to 50 team members. Eventually, Chen hopes the platform could serve larger studios while also supporting &#8220;the democratization of these tools, so that a one- to five-person team can really leverage [them] to launch a networked, online game.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;The vision for us long term is that we really want to be innovating on the social side, creating social features that improve the game and build stronger connections.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, Scale AI announced a massive $325 million Series E. Led by Dragoneer, Greenoaks Capital and Tiger Global, the raise gives the San Francisco data labeling startup a $7 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Alexandr Wang founded the company back in 2016, while still at MIT. A veteran of Quora and Addepar, Wang built the startup to curate information for AI applications. The company is now a break-even business, with a wide range of top-notch clients, including General Motors, NVIDIA, Nuro and Zoox.</p>
<p>Backed by a ton of venture capital, the company plans a large-scale increase in its headcount, as it builds out new products and expands into additional markets. “One thing that we saw, especially in the course of the past year, was that AI is going to be used for so many different things,” Wang told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/the-station-a-chat-with-scale-ais-alexandr-wang-the-nyc-scooter-winners-and-tusimple-goes-public/">TechCrunch in a recent interview</a>. “It’s like we’re just sort of really at the beginning of this and we want to be prepared for that as it happens.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The executive will join us on stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=alexandr&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=alexandr&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility</a> on June 9 to discuss how the company has made a major impact on the industry in its short four years of existence, the role AI is playing in the world of transportation and what the future looks like for Scale AI.</p>
<p>In addition to Wang,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=groupsales&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=groupsales&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> will feature an incredible lineup of speakers, presentations, fireside chats and breakouts all focused on the current and future state of mobility — like EVs, micromobility and smart cities for starters — and the investment trends that influence them all.</p>
<p>Investors like <strong>Clara Brenner</strong> (Urban Innovation Fund), <strong>Quin Garcia</strong> (Autotech Ventures) and <strong>Rachel Holt</strong> (Construct Capital) — all of whom will grace our virtual stage. They’ll have plenty of insight and advice to share, including the challenges that startup founders will face as they break into the transportation arena.</p>
<p>You’ll hear from CEOs like Starship Technologies’ <strong>Ahti Heinla</strong>. The company’s been busy testing delivery robots in real-world markets. Don’t miss his discussion touching on challenges ranging from technology to red tape and what it might take to make last-mile robotic delivery a mainstream reality.</p>
