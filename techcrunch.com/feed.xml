										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For all the ways that the Silicon Valley scene excels, diversity and inclusion is not one of them. But a new startup called Fundr is looking to do the heavy lifting to help investors diversify their portfolio.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fundr.ai/">Fundr</a> is an investment marketplace founded by Lauren Washington, Boris Moyston, and Jean-Philippe Desmontils. The platform is aimed at angel investors, but available to institutional VCs as well, to do the vetting and due diligence across the startup ecosystem that angels don&#8217;t always have the resources to pull off on their own.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Startups apply to the platform and share in-depth quantitative data about their market, team, traction, and background, which ultimately results in a Fundr score assigned to each company. This score determines how much that company is able to raise, or if they&#8217;re even eligible to be on the platform to begin with.</p>
<p>Fundr then uses that information to put these companies in a diversified portfolio. In fact, today Fundr is announcing its first portfolio of 15 startups out of more than 450 global applications.</p>
<p>Investors can then write a check to invest into that portfolio, with the ability to opt out of investing in certain companies or allocate more of their funds to their top picks. The goal is to raise $1.5 million and invest $100k into all 15 companies, with plans to close fundraising for this portfolio on December 11.</p>
<p>According to Fundr, there are more than <a href="https://dqydj.com/accredited-investors-in-america/#:~:text=We%20estimate%20in%202020%20there,trillion%20in%20wealth%20in%202020">13.6 million accredited investors</a> out there, only three percent are actively angel investing. Washington explained that the major barriers to angel investing are time, resources, and access to high-quality startups. Moreover, broad indexing at the seed stage usually outperforms individual investor selection by upwards of 90 percent over ten years, according to the company.</p>
<p>Within Fundr&#8217;s first portfolio, ten industries are represented (including clean energy, AI, blockchain and fintech). Fifty-six percent of founders in the portfolio identify as underrepresented people of color, and 44 percent identify as female, with 75 percent of founders hailing from outside traditional tech hubs like Silicon Valley and New York.</p>
<p>Washington said that the company tested its algorithm at the Black Women Talk Tech international pitch competition this year, and correctly predicted the winner. It took a seasoned team of investors six hours to come to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Fundr is bootstrapped save for $100,000 that it raised through an Austin-based accelerator, and plans to first raise for its new portfolio before it raises more funding for itself.</p>
<p>You can check out the full list of startups in Fundr&#8217;s portfolio right <a href="https://www.fundr.ai/post/it-s-here-fundr-s-first-portfolio-launches-with-15-companies">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NTreatment, a technology company that manages electronic health and patient records for doctors and psychiatrists, left thousands of sensitive health records exposed to the internet because one of its cloud servers wasn&#8217;t protected with a password.</p>
<p>The cloud storage server server was hosted on Microsoft Azure and contained 109,000 files, a large portion of which contained lab test results from third-party providers like LabCorp, medical records, doctor&#8217;s notes, insurance claims, and other sensitive health data for patients across the U.S., a class of data considered protected health information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Running afoul of HIPAA can result in steep fines.</p>
<p>None of the data was encrypted, and nearly all of the sensitive files were viewable in the browser. Some of the medical records belonged to children.</p>
<p>TechCrunch found the exposed data as part of a separate investigation. It wasn&#8217;t initially clear who owned the storage server, but many of the electronic health records that TechCrunch reviewed in an effort to trace the source of the data spillage were tied to doctors and psychiatrists and healthcare workers working at hospitals or networks known to use nTreatment. The storage server also contained some internal company documents, including a non-disclosure agreement with a major prescriptions provider.</p>
<p>The data was secured on Monday after TechCrunch contacted the company. In an email, NTreatment co-founder Gregory Katz said the server was &#8220;used as a general purpose storage,&#8221; but did not say how long the server was exposed.</p>
<p>Katz said the company would notify affected providers and regulators of the incident.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest in a series of incidents involving the exposure of medical data. Earlier this year we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/labcorp-website-bug-medical-data-exposed/">found a bug in LabCorp&#8217;s website</a> that exposed thousands of lab results, and reported on the vast amounts of medical imaging <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/10/medical-images-exposed-pacs/">floating around the web</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/qualcomm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="qualcomm">Qualcomm <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> kicked off an all-virtual version of its annual summit this morning by announcing the launch of the the Snapdragon 888 platform. The chipmaker is clearly saving some key information for later in the virtual event, because it has yet to reveal a ton about its next SoC.</p>
<p>We do, however, have an extremely modest quote from Qualcomm president Cristiano Amon to go on: “Creating premium experiences takes a relentless focus on innovation. It takes long-term commitment, even in the face of immense uncertainty. It takes an organization that’s focused on tomorrow, to continue to deliver the technologies that redefine premium experiences.”</p>
<p>Granted, that’s more self-congratulatory than legitimately helpful. We do know that some key device makers have signed up to include the chip on future handsets, including ASUS, Black Shark, LG, MEIZU, Motorola, Nubia, realme, OnePlus, OPPO, Sharp, vivo, Xiaomi and ZTE.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Also, Qualcomm when ahead and blew past the expected 875. The company tells TechCrunch,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">8 has always been a special number for Snapdragon. For over a decade, the number 8 has stood for premium. The Snapdragon 8-series is comprised of our premium tier mobile platforms, which is where we debut our latest technology innovations that will power the next generation mobile experiences. Year after year, these advancements are not only firsts for Snapdragon, but also for the mobile industry. Especially this year, 5G is rapidly expanding globally and creating new experiences and new opportunities, which are far beyond the industry’s expectation. Snapdragon is the platform of choice to deliver those 5G experiences to more consumers worldwide.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The number 8 is also a lucky number around the world. For some, it signifies infinity, success or inner wisdom, while for others it symbolizes luck. For example, in India the number 8 is known as Ashtha, Asta, or Ashta in Sanskrit and is the number of wealth and abundance. While in Chinese numerology 888 is a representation of triple luck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, not dissimilar from moves we&#8217;ve seen from handset makers like OnePlus. Naturally, 5G is on board. The chip will sport the company’s third-gen X60 5G modem, which sports both sub-6 and mmWave 5G bands. There’s also a 6th-gen AI Engine, capable of performing 26 tera operations per second (TOPS) with improved power efficiency.</p>
<p>Imaging is, naturally, a big piece of the puzzle, as well. The 888 features an up to 35% faster ISP, with support for up to 2.7 gigapixels per second (~120 12-megapixel photos). Gaming performance has also been improved, courtesy of an update to its Elite Gaming platform. More info &#8212; including the first few smartphones to sport the new SoC &#8212; soon, no doubt.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Is Airbnb expensive or not?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="airbnb">Airbnb <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> released <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520306257/d81668ds1a.htm">an S-1/A filing</a> that details its initial IPO price range. The home-sharing unicorn intends to price its shares between $44 and $50 per share in its debut.</p>
<p>Per the company&#8217;s own accounting, it will have 596,399,007 or 601,399,007 shares outstanding, depending on whether its underwriters exercise their option. That gives the company a valuation range of $26.2 billion to $30.1 billion at the extremes.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s simple share count does not include a host of other shares that have vested but not yet been exercised. Including those shares, the company&#8217;s fully diluted valuation stretches to $35 billion, by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/airbnb-ipo-seeks-valuation-of-up-to-35-billion.html">CNBC&#8217;s arithmetic</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p>The top-end of Airbnb&#8217;s simple valuation places it near its Series F valuation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/09/airbnb-closes-1b-round-at-31b-valuation-profitable-as-of-2h-2016-no-plans-for-ipo/">set in 2017</a>. Its fully-diluted valuation exceeds <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/airbnb-series-f--e7075227">that $30.5 billion valuation</a> and is far superior to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/airbnb-ups-its-debt-by-1bn-amid-the-coronavirus-travel-crunch/">$18 billion, post-money valuation</a> that it raised at during its troubled period early in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

For the company&#8217;s preceding investors, to see the company appear ready to at least match its preceding private valuation is a win as well, given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/5-questions-from-airbnbs-ipo-filing/">how much damage Airbnb&#8217;s business sustained</a> early in the pandemic.</p>
<p>But how do those Airbnb valuation numbers match up against its revenues, and will public market investors value the company based on its current results, or expectations for a return-to-form once a vaccine comes to market? And if so, is Airbnb expensive or not?</p>
<h2>Expectations, hopes and hype</h2>
<p>Shares of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/the-priceline-group" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="the-priceline-group">Booking Holdings, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which owns travel services like Kayak, Priceline, OpenTable and others, have almost doubled in value since its pandemic lows and is within spitting distance of its all-time highs. This despite its revenues <a href="https://ir.bookingholdings.com/static-files/3dfd6475-5e72-44bd-a0e3-889194a24285">falling 48%</a> in its most recent quarter. There&#8217;s optimism in the market that travel companies are on the cusp of a return to form, buoyed &#8212; we presume &#8212; by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/positive-vaccine-news-punishes-pandemic-boosted-companies-like-zoom-peloton-etsy/">good news</a> regarding effective coronavirus vaccines.</p>
<p>My expectation is that Airbnb is enjoying a similar bump, as investors intend to buy its shares not to bask in awe of its Q4 2020 results, but instead to enjoy what happens in the back half of 2021 as vaccines roll out and the travel industry recovers.</p>
<p>But happens if we stack Airbnb&#8217;s revenues against its valuation today?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/libra-association" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="libra-association">Libra Association, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a consortium created by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to support its Libra cryptocurrency efforts, <a href="https://www.diem.com/en-us/updates/diem-association/">announced</a> this morning that it has a new name — <a href="https://www.diem.com/">the Diem Association</a> — and made some key hires ahead of its launch.</p>
<p>This is just the latest course correction since the Libra project was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/facebook-libra/">announced last year</a>. In an attempt to appease financial regulators around the world, the association <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/facebook-backed-association-revamps-libra-following-regulatory-concerns/">shifted its strategy</a> away from creating a global stablecoin and will instead launch multiple stablecoins, each tied to a different fiat currency (such as the U.S. dollar and the euro).</p>
<p>The project has also seen some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/12/leave-the-association/">high-profile departures</a>, with announced partners like Visa and Stripe leaving the project. And Facebook has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi/">rebranded its cryptocurrency wallet, changing the name from Calibra to Novi</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, Diem Association CEO Stuart Levey more-or-less acknowledged that the new name is an attempt to distance the group from Facebook, and from its earlier controversies.</p>
<p>“The Diem project will provide a simple platform for fintech innovation to thrive and enable consumers and businesses to conduct instantaneous, low-cost, highly secure transactions,” Levey said. “We are committed to doing so in a way that promotes financial inclusion – expanding access to those who need it most, and simultaneously protecting the integrity of the financial system by deterring and detecting illicit conduct. We are excited to introduce Diem – a new name that signals the project’s growing maturity and independence.”</p>
<p>As for the new hires, they include Chief Technology Officer Dahlia Malkhi, Chief of Staff Christy Clark, Chief Legal Officer Steve Bunnel and Executive Vice President for Growth and Innovation/Deputy General Counsel Kiran Raj. Diem Networks, the subsidiary that will actually operate the Diem payment system, has also hired James Emmett as managing director, Sterling Daines as chief compliance officer, Ian Jenkins as chief financial and risk officer and Saumya Bhavsar as general counsel.</p>
<p>While today&#8217;s announcement doesn&#8217;t include any specifics about timing, it suggests the association is positioning itself for an imminent launch — albeit one that will &#8220;proceed only upon receiving regulatory approval, including a payment systems license for the operational subsidiary of the Association from FINMA.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uber <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/stronger-together-uber-eats-postmates-partner-to-benefit-merchants/">detailed some of its further thinking</a> around the newly combined companies and what that will mean for the businesses they work with in a new blog post. The company posited the move as of benefit to the merchant population they work with, and alongside the official closure announced a new initiative to encourage <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">and gather customer feedback on the merchant side.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They&#8217;re calling it a &#8220;regional listening exercise&#8221; to be run beginning next year, wherein they&#8217;ll work with local restaurant associations and chambers of commerce to hear concerns from local business owners in their own communities. This sounds similar in design to Uber&#8217;s prior efforts to focus on driver feedback from a couple of years ago in order to improve the way it works with that side of its double-sided marketplace.</p>
<p>Focusing on the needs of its merchant population is doubly important given the current global pandemic, which has seen Uber Eats emerge as even more of a key infrastructure component in the food service and grocery industries as people seek more delivery options in order to better comply with stay-at-home orders and other public safety recommendations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we&#8217;ve moved to work from home during the pandemic, it&#8217;s been challenging for remote workers to feel connected. <a href="https://loopteam.co/">Loop Team</a>, a new entrant into the enterprise communications space, thinks the way we are communicating needs improvement. That&#8217;s why the startup is releasing <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/loop-team" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="loop-team">Loop Team <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today, a tool that is trying to use software to reproduce the in-office experience.</p>
<p>Company founder and CEO Raj Singh says that he learned about the problems of feeling disconnected first-hand at a previous remote-first company, but in spite of his best attempts to use technology to produce that in-office feel, he said he continued to feel out of the loop (so to speak). That&#8217;s when he decided to build the solution he wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve looked at a lot of the interactions that happen when you&#8217;re physically in an office &#8212; the visual communication, the background conversations, the hallway chatter, the serendipitous bumping, things like that. And we built an experience that effectively is a virtual office. And so it tries to represent the best parts of what a physical office experience might be like, but in a virtual form,&#8221; Singh explained to me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cWs6k2PGjy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/wall-street-needs-to-relax-because-remote-work-is-here-to-stay/">Wall Street needs to relax, as startups show remote work is here to stay</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wall Street needs to relax, as startups show remote work is here to stay&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/wall-street-needs-to-relax-because-remote-work-is-here-to-stay/embed/#?secret=cWs6k2PGjy" data-secret="cWs6k2PGjy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While he created this company prior to COVID, the pandemic has highlighted the need for a tool like this. Before he created the software, he interviewed hundreds of people who worked from home to understand their issues working outside of the office and he heard a lot of common complaints.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was an office and they didn&#8217;t necessarily know what was going on. They didn&#8217;t know who was available. They didn&#8217;t know who was around. It was difficult to connect. Everything was scheduled through calendar. They were missing some of that presence &#8212; and they were feeling lonely or out of touch or out of the loop,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His company&#8217;s solution tries to reproduce the office experience using AI, good, old-fashioned presence awareness and other tech to let team members know what you&#8217;re doing and if you&#8217;re available to chat. So just as you would wander down the hall and see your colleague on the phone or deeply involved with work on the laptop, and know to leave them be, you could get that same feel with Loop.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2080883" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2080883" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2080883" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Loop-Team-Highlights.png?w=680" alt="Loop Team Highlights" width="680" height="534" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Loop-Team-Highlights.png 1981w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Loop-Team-Highlights.png?resize=150,118 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Loop-Team-Highlights.png?resize=300,236 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Loop-Team-Highlights.png?resize=768,604 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Loop-Team-Highlights.png?resize=680,534 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Loop-Team-Highlights.png?resize=1536,1207 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Loop-Team-Highlights.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2080883" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Loop Team</p></div></p>
<p>It gives the current status of the person, and you can know from looking at the list of people on your team, who&#8217;s available to talk and who&#8217;s busy. As you go into virtual discussions, the team can see who&#8217;s having meetings and individuals can pop in too, just as you might do in the office.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, you can set up rooms (like in Slack), but these are designed to give you a more personal connection using video and audio for actual discussion. You can work on projects via screen share and people who miss these meetings because of other obligations or time zone differences, can always review what they missed.</p>
<p>While you can do all of these things in Slack and Zoom, or in some combination of similar tools, Loop&#8217;s layout and presentation is designed to help you see the conversations in a clear way and expose what you want to see, while hiding parts of the day that don&#8217;t interest you.</p>
<p>The product is available for free starting today, but Singh wants to introduce a pricing model sometime next year based on team size. He expects there will always be a freemium version for teams under 10 people.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2018 and nurtured at the Stanford SRI Institute. It has raised $4.75 million so far. Today it starts on its journey as a startup with its first product, and it&#8217;s one that comes with good timing as more teams find themselves working remotely than every before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of Facebook taking a big step into customer service with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquisition of Kustomer for $1 billion</a>, another big move is afoot in the world of CRM. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sinch</a>, a Swedish company that provides cloud-based &#8220;omnichannel&#8221; voice, video and messaging services to help enterprises communicate with customers, has <a href="https://investors.sinch.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sinch-ab-publ-sinch-announces-completion-directed-new-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> that SoftBank is taking a $690 million stake in the company. Sinch said that it plans to use the proceeds of the share sale for M&amp;A of its own.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see clearly how our cloud-based platform helps businesses leverage mobile technology to reinvent their customer experience,&#8221; said Oscar Werner, Sinch CEO, to TechCrunch. &#8220;Whereas people throughout the world have embraced mobile messaging to interact with friends and family, most businesses have yet to seize this opportunity. We are establishing Sinch as a leader in a global growth market that is still very fragmented, and we&#8217;re excited that SoftBank is now helping us realize that vision.&#8221;</p>
<p>Specifically, Sinch has issued and sold 3,187,736 shares worth SEK 3.3 billion, and large shareholders have sold a further 5,200,000 shares &#8212; with SoftBank the sole buyer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The move underscores the growing opportunity that those in the world of CRM &#8212; which include not just Sinch and Kustomer but Salesforce and many others &#8212; are seeing to double down on their services at the moment. With people working and doing everything else remotely, and with the general upheaval we&#8217;ve had in the global economy due to Covid-19, there has been an increased demand and strain put on the digital channels that people use to communicate with organizations when they have questions or problems.</p>
<p>The catch is that customer relations has grown to be more than just 1-800 numbers and being on hold for endless hours: it includes social media, email, websites with interactive chats, chatbots, messaging apps, and yes those phone calls.</p>
<p>Organizations like Sinch and Kustomer &#8212; which build platforms to help businesses manage all of those fragmented options in what are described as omnichannel offerings, have been capitalising on the demand and are now investing and looking for the next step in their strategies to grow.</p>
<p>For Kustomer that has been leaping into the arms of Facebook, which itself has spotted an opportunity to build out a CRM business to complement its other services for businesses. Recall that it&#8217;s also been experimenting and working on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/facebook-is-working-on-neighborhoods-a-nextdoor-clone-based-on-local-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest Nextdoor competitor</a> to promote local businesses; and it has added a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-adds-hosting-shopping-features-and-pricing-tiers-to-whatsapp-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ton of business tools</a> to its messaging apps too.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what Salesforce does next. While acquiring Slack gives the company an obvious channel into workplace communications, don&#8217;t forget that Slack is also a very popular tool for engaging with people outside of your employee network, too. It will be worth watching how and if Salesforce looks to develop that aspect of the business, too.</p>
<p>For Sinch, its strategy has been around making acquisitions of its own, including paying $250 million to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/sinch-acquires-saps-digital-interconnect-messaging-business-for-250m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pick up a business unit of SAP, Digital Interconect</a>, which has 1,500 enterprise customers mostly in the US using it to run &#8220;omnichannel&#8221; CRM. Now the plan will be to do more, since there are still huge swathes of the market that have yet to upgrade and update their CRM approaches.</p>
<p>Sinch, notably, is traded publicly on Sweden&#8217;s stock exchange and it currently has a market cap of SEK70 billion ($8.2 billion at current rates). It is profitable and generating cash so has &#8220;no need to raise funding for our ongoing business,&#8221; Thomas Heath, Sinch&#8217;s chief strategy officer and head of investor relations, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>For SoftBank, the investment marks another step in the company taking sizable stakes in fast-growing public or semi-public tech companies in Europe.</p>
<p>In October, it put <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/kahoot-picks-up-215m-from-softbank-for-its-user-generated-gamified-e-learning-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$215 million into Kahoot</a>, the online education platform aimed both at students and enterprises, built around the concept of users themselves creating &#8220;learning games&#8221; that can then be shared with others. Kahoot trades a proportion of its shares publicly on the stock exchange in Norway and like Sinch, the plan is to use a good part of the money for acquisitions.</p>
<p>Not all of SoftBank&#8217;s investments in scaled-up European businesses have panned out. Having put around $1 billion into German payments company Wirecard, the company turned out to be one of the biggest scandals in the history of European fintech, facing accounting scandals before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/house-of-wirecard-insolvency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collapsing into insolvency earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>Sinch, as a profitable and a steady business with predictable lines of recurring revenue, looks like a safer bet for now. Even with Salesforce, Facebook and others raising their game, there as Sinch&#8217;s CEO says, there is enough of an untapped market that playing well might be enough to do well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s Oyo has been one of the worst impacted startups with the coronavirus, but it has enough cash to steer through the pandemic and then look at funding further scale, a top executive says.</p>
<p>In a townhall with employees last week, Oyo founder <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ritesh-agarwal" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ritesh-agarwal">Ritesh Agarwal <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said the budget lodging firm “continued to hold on to close to a billion dollars of cash” across its group companies and joint venture firms and has “tracked to runway very closely.”</p>
<p>“At the same time, we&#8217;ve been very disciplined in making sure that we can respond to the crisis in a good way to try and ensure that we can come out of it at the right time,” he said in a fireside chat with Rohit Kapoor, chief executive of Oyo India and SA, and Troy Alstead, a board member who previously served as the chief executive officer of Startbucks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The revelation will deliver a huge reassurance to employees and hotel partners of Oyo, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/softbank-backed-indian-startup-oyo-to-cut-5000-jobs-globally/">eliminated or furloughed over 5,000 jobs earlier this year</a> and reported in April that the pandemic had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/08/indias-oyo-furloughs-thousands-of-employees-as-revenue-drops-by-over-50/">cut its revenue and demand by more than 50%</a>.</p>
<p>Oyo also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/16/oyos-revenue-surged-in-fy19-but-loss-widened-too/">reported a loss of $335 million on $951 million revenue globally</a> for the financial year ending March 31, 2019, and earlier this year pledged to cut down on its spending.</p>
<p>Agarwal said the startup is recovering from the pandemic as nations relax their lockdowns, and with recent progress with vaccine trials, he is hopeful that the travel and hospitality industries will bounce back strongly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together globally, we were able to get to around 85% of the gross margin dollars of our pre COVID levels. This I can tell you was extremely hard. But in my view was probably only possible because of the efforts of our teams in each one of the geographies,&#8221; he said, adding that Oyo Vacation has proven critical to the business in recent months delivering &#8220;packed&#8221; hotels and holiday homes.</p>
<p>During the conversation, a transcript of which was shared with employees and obtained by TechCrunch, Agarwal was heard talking about making Oyo &#8212; which was privately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/india-oyo-ritesh-agarwal-investment/">valued at $10 billion last year when it was in the process of raising $1.5 billion</a> last year &#8212; ready for IPO. He, however, did not share a timeline on when the SoftBank-backed startup plans to go public and hinted that it’s perhaps not in the immediate future.</p>
<p>“And last but not the least, for me, it is very critical. I want the groups to know that I, our board and our broader management are fully committed to making sure that long-term wealth creation for our OYOpreneurs &#8212; beyond that of just the compensation, but the wealth creation by means of your stocks can be substantially grown.”</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, what is the right time to go out is frankly a decision of the board to make and from the management side, we&#8217;ll be ready to make sure that we build a company that is ready to go public. And we will look at various things like that of the market situation, opportunities outside and so on, that the board will consider and then potentially help advise on the timeline,” he said.</p>
<p>Alstead echoed Agarwal’s optimism, adding, “I think that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oyo-rooms" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oyo-rooms">OYO <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is made up of a combination of assets, its hotels, its homes, its vacation homes. That&#8217;s unique, I think in the industry in the category, I think it makes it probably a little more challenging sometimes for people externally to measure and compare and benchmark a unique portfolio company like this. But I&#8217;d also tell you, I think that makes OYO resilient. It makes OYO balanced for the future. It gives OYO several sorts of vertical opportunities to address both customer needs at any time, whether it be a hotel or a small hotel or a vacation home.”</p>
<p>“And it also gives opportunities and expands that interaction in a good healthy way with the property owners, with the partners, who have an opportunity depending on what asset type they have partnered with OYO in different ways, and also to have the access to a technology platform and a continued investment in that innovative platform for customers. So all those things, I think a balanced portfolio, a technology platform, a heavy focus on putting the customer first, putting the business partner first &#8212; all those things, in my view, are what positioned OYO for the future.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are 12 million small and medium businesses in the US, yet they have continued to be one of most underserved segments of the B2B universe: that volume underscores a lot of fragmentation, and alongside other issues like budget constraints, there are a number of barriers to building for them at scale. Today, however, a startup helping SMBs get online is announcing some significant funding &#8212; a sign of how things are changing at a moment when many businesses have realised that being online is no longer an option, but a necessity.</p>
<p><a href="http://gosite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoSite</a>, a San Diego-based startup that helps small and medium enterprises build websites, and, with a minimum amount of technical know-how, run other functions of their businesses online &#8212; like payments, online marketing, appointment booking and accounting &#8212; has picked up $40 million in funding.</p>
<p>GoSite offers a one-stop shop for users to build and manage everything online, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">with the ability to feed in up to 80 different third-party services within that. </span>&#8220;We want to help our customers be found everywhere,&#8221; said Alex Goode, the founder and CEO of GoSite. &#8220;We integrate with Facebook and other consumer platforms like Siri, Apple Maps, and search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bing and more.&#8221; It also builds certain features like payments from the ground up.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series B comes on the back of a strong year for the company. Driven by Covid-19 circumstances, businesses have increasingly turned to the internet to interact with customers, and GoSite &#8212; which has &#8220;thousands&#8221; of SMB customers &#8212; said it doubled its customer base in 2020.</p>
<p>This latest round is being led by Left Lane Capital out of New York, with Longley Capital, Cove Fund, Stage 2, Ankona Capital and Serra Ventures also participating. GoSite is clearly striking while the iron is hot: Longley, also based out of San Diego, led the company&#8217;s previous round, which was only in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gosite-closes-16m-series-a-investment-round-adds-key-hires-to-fuel-growth-301108478.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August of this year</a>. It has now raised $60 million to date.</p>
<p>GoSite is, in a sense, a play for more inclusivity in tech: its customers are not companies that it&#8217;s &#8220;winning&#8221; off other providers that provide website building and hosting and other services typically used by SMBs, such as Squarespace and Wix, or GoDaddy, or Shopify.</p>
<p>Rather, they are companies that may have never used any of these: local garages, local landscapers, local hair salons, local accountancy firms, local dentists and so on. Barring the accounting firm, these are not businesses that will ever go fully online, as a retailer might, not least because of the physical aspect of each of those professions. But they will need an online presence and the levers it gives them to communicate, in order to survive, especially in times when their old models are being put under strain.</p>
<p>Goode started GoSite after graduating from college in Michigan with a degree in computer science, having previously grown up around and working in small businesses &#8212; his parents, grandparents and others in his Michigan town all ran their own stores. (He moved to San Diego &#8220;for the weather&#8221; he joked.)</p>
<p>His belief is that while there are and always will be alternatives like Facebook or Yelp to plant a flag, there is nothing that can replace the value and longer term security and control of building something of your own &#8212; a sentiment small business owners would surely grasp.</p>
<p>That is perhaps the most interesting aspect of GoSite as it exists today: it precisely <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> see any of what already exists out there as &#8220;the competition.&#8221; Instead, Goode sees his purpose as building a dashboard that will help business owners manage all that &#8212; with up to 80 different services currently available &#8212; and more, from a single place, and with minimum need for technical skills and time spent learning the ropes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is definitely huge demand from small businesses for help and something like GoSite can do that,&#8221; Goode said. &#8220;The space is very fragmented and noisy and they don’t even know where to start.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, combined with GoSite&#8217;s growth and relevance to the current market, is partly what attracted investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opportunity we are betting on here is the all-in-one solution,&#8221; said Vinny Pujji, partner at Left Lane. &#8220;If you are a carpet cleaner or house painter, you don’t have the capacity to understand or work with five or six different pieces of software. We spoke with thousands of SMBs when looking at this, and this was the answer we heard.&#8221; He said the other important thing is that GoSite has a customer service team and for SMBs that use it, they like that when they call, &#8220;GoSite picks up the phone.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Latvian <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aax-b20d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aax-b20d">fintech <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> startup <a href="https://nordigen.com/en/">Nordigen</a> is switching to a freemium model thanks to a free open banking API. Open banking was supposed to democratize access to banking information, but the company believes banking aggregation APIs from Tink or Plaid are too expensive. Instead, Nordigen thinks it can provide a free API to access account information and paid services for analytics and insights services.</p>
<p>Open banking is a broad term and means different things, from account aggregation to verifying account ownership and payment initiation. The most basic layer of open banking is the ability to view data from third-party financial institutions. For instance, some banks let you connect to other bank accounts so that you can view all your bank accounts from a single interface.</p>
<p>There are two ways to connect to a bank. Some banks provide an application programming interface (API), which means that you can send requests to the bank’s servers and receive data in return.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While all financial institutions should have an open API due to the European PSD2 directive, many banks are still dragging their feet. That’s why open banking API companies usually rely on screen scraping. They mimic web browser interactions, which means that it’s slow, it requires a ton of server resources and it can break.</p>
<p>“If you’re wondering how we’d be able to afford it, our free banking data API was designed purely with PSD2 in mind, meaning it’s lightweight in strong contrast to that of incumbents. So it wouldn’t significantly increase our costs to scale free users,” Nordigen co-founder and CEO Rolands Mesters told me.</p>
<p>So you don’t get total coverage with Nordigen’s API. The startup currently supports 300 European banks, which covers 60 to 90% of the population in each country. But it’s hard to complain when it’s a free product anyway.</p>
<p>Some Nordigen customers will probably want more information. Nordigen provides financial data analytics. It can be particularly useful if you’re a lending company trying to calculate a credit score, if you’re a financial company with minimum income requirements and more.</p>
<p>For those additional services, you’ll have to pay. Nordigen currently has 50 clients and expects to attract more customers with its new freemium strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vivenu.com/">vivenu</a>, a ticketing platform that offers an API for venues and promoters to customize to their needs, has closed a $15 million (€12.6 million) in Series A funding led by Balderton Capital. Previous investor Redalpine also participated.</p>
<p>Historically-speaking, most ticketing platform startups took a direct to consumer approach, or have provided turnkey solutions to big event promoters. But in this day and age, most events require a great deal more flexibility, not least because of the pandemic. So, by offering an <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/api-755a" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="api-755a">API <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and allowing promoters that flexibility, Vivenu managed to gain traction.</p>
<p>Venues and event owners get a full-featured ticketing, out-of-the-box platform with full real-time dynamic control over all aspects of selling tickets including configuring prices and seating plans, leveraging customer data and insights and mastering a branded look and feel across their sales channels. It has exposed APIs enabling many different custom use cases for large international ticket sellers. Since its Seed funding in March, the company says it has sold over 2 million tickets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Simon Hennes, CEO and co-founder of vivenu said in a statement: &#8220;We created vivenu to address the need of ticket sellers for a user-centric ticketing platform. Event organizers were stuck with solutions that heavily depend on manual processes, causing high costs, dependencies, and frustration on various levels.”</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/daniel-waterhouse" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="daniel-waterhouse">Daniel Waterhouse, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Partner at Balderton said: “Vivenu has built a sophisticated product and set of APIs that gives event organisers full control of their ticketing operations.”</p>
<p>vivenu is also the first European investment of Aurum Fund LLC, the fund associated with the San Francisco 49ers. Also investing in the round are Angels including Sascha Konietzke (<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/founder" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="founder">Founder <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> at Contentful), Chris Schagen (former CMO at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/contentful" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="contentful">Contentful), <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/sujay-tyle" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="sujay-tyle">Sujay Tyle <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (Founder at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/frontier-cars-group" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="frontier-cars-group">Frontier Car Group) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Tiny VC.</p>
<p>In March 2020, vivenu secured €1.4 million in seed funding, bringing its total funding to €14 million. Previous investors include early-stage venture capital investor <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/redalpine-venture-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="redalpine-venture-partners">Redalpine, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> GE32 Capital and Hansel LLC (associated with the founders of Loft).</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch Hennes said: “You have to send your seat map to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ticketmaster" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ticketmaster">Ticketmaster, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and then the account manager comes back to you with a sitemap. This goes back and forth and takes ages. With us you have a seating chart designer basically integrated into the software which you can simply change yourself.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DevOps continues to get a lot of attention as a wave of companies develop more sophisticated tools to help developers manage increasingly complex architectures and workloads. In the latest development, <a href="http://databand.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Databand</a> &#8212; an AI-based observability platform for data pipelines, specifically to detect when something is going wrong with a datasource when an engineer is using a disparate set of data management tools &#8212; has closed a round of $14.5 million.</p>
<p>Josh Benamram, the CEO who co-founded the company with Victor Shafran and Evgeny Shulman, said that Databand plans include more hiring; to continue adding customers for its existing product; to expand the library of tools that its providing to users to cover an ever-increasing landscape of DevOps software, where it is a big supporter of <a href="https://databand.ai/open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source resources</a>; as well as to invest in the next steps of its own commercial product. That will include more remediation once problems are identified: that is, in addition to identifying issues, engineers will be able to start automatically fixing them, too.</p>
<p>The Series A is being led by Accel with participation from Blumberg Capital, Lerer Hippeau, Ubiquity Ventures, Differential Ventures, and Bessemer Venture Partners. Blumberg led the company&#8217;s seed round in 2018. It has now raised around $18.5 million and is not disclosing valuation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problem that Databand is solving is one that is getting more urgent and problematic by the day (as evidenced by this <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exponential yearly rise in zettabytes of data globally</a>). And as data workloads continue to grow in size and use, they continue to become ever more complex.</p>
<p>On top of that, today there are a wide range of applications and platforms that a typical organization will use to manage source material, storage, usage and so on. That means when there are glitches in any one data source, it can be a challenge to identify where and what the issue can be. Doing so manually can be time-consuming, if not impossible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our users were in a constant battle with ETL (extract transform load) logic,&#8221; said Benamram, who spoke to me from New York (the company is based both there and in Tel Aviv, and also has developers and operations in Kiev). &#8220;Users didn’t know how to organize their tools and systems to produce reliable data products.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is really hard to focus attention on failures, he said, when engineers are balancing analytics dashboards, how machine models are performing, and other demands on their time; and that&#8217;s before considering when and if a data supplier might have changed an API at some point, which might also throw the data source completely off.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;ve ever been on the receiving end of that data, you know how frustrating (and perhaps more seriously, disastrous) bad data can be. Benamram said that it&#8217;s not uncommon for engineers to completely miss anomalies and for them to only have been brought to their attention by &#8220;CEO&#8217;s looking at their dashboards and suddenly thinking something is off.&#8221; Not a great scenario.</p>
<p>Databand&#8217;s approach is to use big data to better handle big data: it crunches various pieces of information, including pipeline metadata like logs, runtime info, and data profiles, along with information from Airflow, Spark, Snowflake, and other sources, and puts the resulting data into a single platform, to give engineers a single view of what&#8217;s happening better see where bottlenecks or anomalies are appearing, and why.</p>
<p>There are a number of other companies building data observability tools &#8212; Splunk perhaps is one of the most obvious, but also smaller players like <a href="https://www.thundra.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thundra</a> and <a href="https://rivery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rivery</a>. These companies might step further into the area that Databand has identified and is fixing, but for now Databand&#8217;s focus specifically on identifying and helping engineers fix anomalies has given it a strong profile and position.</p>
<p>Accel partner Seth Pierrepont said that Databand came to the VC&#8217;s attention in perhaps the best way it could: Accel needed a solution like it for its own internal work.</p>
<p>“Data pipeline observability is a challenge that our internal data team at Accel was struggling with. Even at our relatively small scale, we were having issues with the reliability of our data outputs on a weekly basis, and our team found Databand as a solution,&#8221; he said. “As companies in all industries seek to become more data driven, Databand delivers an essential product that ensures the reliable delivery of high quality data for businesses. Josh, Victor and Evgeny have a wealth of experience in this area, and we’ve been impressed with their thoughtful and open approach to helping data engineers better manage their data pipelines with Databand.”</p>
<p>The company is also used by data teams from both large Fortune 500 enterprises to smaller startups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whatsapp">WhatsApp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is finally upping its wallpapers and stickers game, delivering some much-awaited aesthetics updates to the popular app that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/">over 2 billion people use</a>.</p>
<p>The instant messaging service said on Tuesday that it will now allow users to set custom wallpapers for different chats in a bid to make it easier for users to easily distinguish the dozens or hundreds of chats they are simultaneously engaging with. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">There’s no limit on how many custom wallpapers a user could choose to assign to different chats, it said.</span></p>
<p>“Make your chats personal and distinguishable by using a custom wallpaper for your most important chats and favorite people, and you never need worry about sending the wrong message in the wrong chat ever again,” the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-owned service said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>WhatsApp is also rolling out doodle wallpaper &#8212; the default wallpaper currently &#8212; in more colors, and is bulking up the selection of wallpapers with more images of nature and architecture from around the world, it said. Additionally, users can now also set a separate wallpaper which activates when their phone switches from light to dark mode.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2080842" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatsapp-wallpapers-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="469" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatsapp-wallpapers-1.jpg 1113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatsapp-wallpapers-1.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatsapp-wallpapers-1.jpg?resize=300,137 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatsapp-wallpapers-1.jpg?resize=768,352 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatsapp-wallpapers-1.jpg?resize=680,312 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatsapp-wallpapers-1.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Moving on from wallpapers, the messaging app said it is also making it easier for users to quickly search and find stickers with text or emoji, or browse through common categories.</p>
<p>The firm urged sticker creators to tag their stickers with emojis moving forward so that their stickers become more easily searchable for WhatsApp users. A company spokesperson declined to share the kind of traction stickers have received on WhatsApp, or how many sticker creators have contributed.</p>
<p>But if stickers are something you enjoy, there are some additional ones you will spot today. The World&#8217;s Health Organization&#8217;s &#8220;Together at Home&#8221; sticker pack is now available as animated stickers. (The two began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/whatsapp-and-who-launch-stickers-to-help-people-get-through-these-tough-times/">collaborating earlier this year</a> to raise more awareness about the coronavirus pandemic.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Together at Home has been one of the most popular sticker packs across WhatsApp, and will now be even more expressive and useful in its animated form. The &#8216;Together at Home&#8217; sticker pack is available within WhatsApp, including with text localized for 9 languages &#8211; Arabic, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Turkish,&#8221; WhatsApp said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Continuing its annual tradition, Google today <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/best-of-2020-winners/">announced</a> its <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/best-of-2020/">Best of 2020 awards</a> &#8212; the company&#8217;s list of the best apps, games, movies and books for the year. Not surprisingly, the top apps picked by both Google Play users and editors reflect the stressful year that 2020 has been, with a top sleep app, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.loona">Loóna</a>, winning the title of &#8220;Best App&#8221; of 2020. Meanwhile, Google Play users picked streaming service <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.disney.disneyplus">Disney+</a> as their choice.</p>
<p>Loóna is a fitting app to win the award this year. The sleep aid promises a mood-altering experience that helps its users deal with the negative emotions that accumulate during the day and are then processed during sleep. As anxiety and stress grow, people&#8217;s sleep patterns and REM sleep be disrupted, Loóna explains. To combat this, its app offers nightly &#8220;sleepscapes,&#8221; that combined activity-based relaxation, storytelling and sounds to help people shut out their stress and relax.</p>
<p>Unlike other sleep or meditation apps where users close their eyes and drift off, Loóna is intended to help people wind down while still on their phones. Users tap to color images while the sleep story plays. The company also this year introduced music playlists, called soundscapes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2079362" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2079362" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2079362" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7bWM0D4Q.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="679" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7bWM0D4Q.jpeg 2592w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7bWM0D4Q.jpeg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7bWM0D4Q.jpeg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7bWM0D4Q.jpeg?resize=768,509 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7bWM0D4Q.jpeg?resize=680,451 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7bWM0D4Q.jpeg?resize=1536,1019 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7bWM0D4Q.jpeg?resize=2048,1358 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7bWM0D4Q.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2079362" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Loóna</p></div></p>
<p>In October, the company reported its app &#8212; which is also available on iOS &#8212; was seeing daily average time spent of 34 minutes from its subscribers. And its average conversion rate from trial to paid subscriber was 52.5%. Today, Loóna says it has reached 500,000 users and people have spent over 35 million total mindful minutes with its product to date. With version 2.0, Loóna plans to reposition its app from being solely focused on bedtime relaxation to become a broader mood management app that also covers the sleep to wake up cycle, among other things. It also plans to add personalized content recommendations.</p>
<p>In addition to Loóna, Google Play editors selected the free-to-play action role-playing game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact">Genshin Impact</a> as the year&#8217;s best game for giving players a &#8220;wondrous world to explore&#8221; while unraveling mysteries. The game, <a href="https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en">miHoYo&#8217;s</a> first-ever open-world game, features battles with elemental magic, character switching, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game">gacha game monetization</a> for obtaining new characters, weapons, and other additions.</p>
<p>Google Play users, however, selected <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tiltingpoint.spongebob">SpongeBob: Krusty Cook-Off</a> as the year&#8217;s best game.</p>
<p>Another app that benefitted from coronavirus lockdowns was Disney+, which won this year&#8217;s User&#8217;s Choice award for Best App. The streaming service helped families stuck at home to keep their kids entertained. Plus, with new shows like the &#8220;The Mandalorian,&#8221; the service has been a hit for adults in the family, too.</p>
<p>In addition to the top winners, Google gave a shout-out to a few other notable titles in its announcement, including Chris Hemsworth&#8217;s training app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.centr.app&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Centr</a>, behavioral modification app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.intellect.app&amp;hl=en_CA&amp;gl=US">Intellect</a>, as well as games like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thevoxelagents.thegardensbetween&amp;hl=en_CA&amp;gl=US">The Gardens Between</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zynga.pottermatch&amp;hl=en_CA&amp;gl=US">Harry Potter: Puzzles &amp; Spells</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tgc.sky.android&amp;hl=en_CA&amp;gl=US">Sky: Children of the Light</a>.</p>
<p>The Play Store also awarded various <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/editorial_collection/promotion_topic_bestof2020_games_hub">gaming subgenres with awards of their own</a>, like best competitive games, best indies, best pick up and play, and best game changers.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.ankorstore.com">Ankorstore</a> has raised a $29.9 million Series A round (€25 million) with Index Ventures leading the round. Existing investors GFC, Alven and Aglaé are also participating.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ankorstore" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ankorstore">Ankorstore <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is building a wholesale marketplace that connects independent shop owners with brands selling household supplies, maple syrup, headbands, bath salts, stationery items and a lot more. That list alone should remind you of neighborhood stores that sell a ton of cutesy stuff that you don’t necessarily need but that tend to be popular.</p>
<p>The company works with 2,000 brands and 15,000 shops. And the startup isn’t just connecting buyers and sellers as it has a clear set of rules. For instance, the minimum first order is €100, which means that you can try out new products without ordering hundreds of items at once.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By default, Ankorstore withdraws the money 60 days after placing an order. Brands get paid upon delivery. And of course, buying from several brands through Ankorstore should simplify your admin tasks.</p>
<p>Ankorstore is currently live in eight countries — France, Spain, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland and Luxembourg. France is the biggest market followed by Germany. Up next, the startup plans to launch in the U.K. in 2021.</p>
<p>In many ways, Ankorstore reminds me of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/distinguished-vcs-back-wholesale-marketplace-faire-with-100m-at-a-535m-valuation/">Faire</a>, the wholesale marketplace that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in the U.S.</p>
<p>“There are a number of different retail marketplaces connecting retailers with makers and brands. Where we believe we differ is in our clear focus on the independent shop owner, offering the tools and the terms that make it really easy and cost-effective to discover and access some of the most desirable up-and-coming brands,” Ankorstore co-founder Pierre-Louis Lacoste said.</p>
<p>Given that the startup is working with small suppliers, chances are they’re only selling their products in Europe. So there should be enough room for a European leader in that space that I would describe as wholesale Etsy-style marketplaces with a strong focus on curation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.intellect.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intellect</a>, a Singapore-based startup that wants to lower barriers to mental health care in Asia, says it has reached more than one million users just six months after launching. Google also announced today that the startup’s consumer app, also called Intellect, is <a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/11/30/google-best-android-apps-2020">one of its picks for best personal growth apps of 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The company recently closed an undisclosed seed round led by Insignia Ventures Partners. Angel investors including e-commerce platform Carousell co-founder and chief executive officer Quek Siu Rui; former Sequoia partner Tim Lee; and startup consultancy xto10x’s Southeast Asia CEO J.J. Chai also participated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, Insignia Ventures Partners principal Samir Chaibi said, &#8220;In Intellect, we see a fast-scaling platform addressing a pain that has become very obvious amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that pairing clinically-backed protocols with an efficient mobile-first delivery is the key to break down the barriers to access for millions of patients globally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer Theodoric Chew launched Intellect earlier this year because while there is a growing pool of mental wellness apps in the United States and Europe that have<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/funding-for-mental-health-focused-startups-rises-in-2020/"> attracted more funding during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, the space is still very young in Asia. Intellect’s goal is encourage more people to incorporate mental health care into their daily routines by lowering barriers like high costs and social stigma.</p>

<p>Intellect offers two products. One is a consumer app with self-guided programs based on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques that center on issues like anxiety, self-esteem or relationship issues.</p>
<p>The other is a mental health platform for employers to offer as a benefit and includes a recently launched telehealth service called Behavioural Health Coaching that connects users with mental health professionals. The service, which includes one-on-one video sessions and unlimited text messaging, is now a core part of Intellect’s services, Chew told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Intellect’s enterprise product now reaches 10,000 employees, and its clients include tech companies, regional operations for multinational corporations and hospitals. Most are located in Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia and India, and range in size from 100 to more than 3,000 employees.</p>
<p>For many small- to mid-sized employers, Intellect is often the first mental health benefit they have offered. Larger clients may already have EAP (employee assistance programs), but Chew said those are often underutilized, with an average adoption rate of 1% to 2%. On the other hand, he said Intellect’s employee benefit program sees an average adoption rate of 30% in the first month after it is rolled out at a company.</p>
<p>Chew added that the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted more companies to address burnout and other mental health issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of larger trends, we’ve seen a huge spike in companies across the region having mental health and wellbeing of their employees being prioritized on their agenda,&#8221; said Chew. &#8220;In terms of user trends, we see a significantly higher utilization in work stress and burnout, anxiety and relationship-related programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Intellect&#8217;s seed round will be used to expand in Asian markets and to help fund clinical research studies it is currently conducting with universities and organizations in Singapore, Australia and the United Kingdom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly all of China&#8217;s largest internet firms have established a presence in online grocery. Just this week, news arrived that Alibaba co-led<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/OjZl0DKkCuaUAB2mixTXKw"> the $196 million C3 funding round of Nice Tuan</a>, the two-year-old grocery group-buying firm&#8217;s fourth round year to date.</p>
<p>People in China shop online for almost everything, including groceries. At first, grocery e-commerce appears to have caught on mainly among the digitally-savvy who have grown reliant on the convenience of e-commerce and don&#8217;t mind paying a bit more for delivery. Many elderly shoppers, on the other hand, still prefer visiting traditional wet markets where ingredients are generally cheaper.</p>
<p>Now tech companies in China are scrambling to capture grocery shoppers of all ages. A new business model that&#8217;s getting a lot of funding is that of Nice Tuan, the so-called community group buying.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In conventional grocery e-commerce, an intermediary platform like Alibaba normally connects individual shoppers to an array of merchants and offers doorstep delivery, which arrives normally within an hour in China.</p>
<p>A community group-buying, in comparison, relies on an army of neighborhood-based managers &#8212; often housewives looking for part-time work &#8212; to promote products amongst neighbors and tally their orders in group chats, normally through the popular <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/we-chat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="we-chat">WeChat <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> messenger. The managers then place the group orders with suppliers and have the items delivered to pick-up spots in the community, such as a local convenience store.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon to see piles of grocery bags at corner stores wating to be fetched these days, and the model has inspired overseas Chinese entrepreneurs to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/weee-profile/">follow suit in America</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="U1hoUhdT0e"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/weee-profile/">What grocery startup Weee! learned from China&#8217;s tech giants</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What grocery startup Weee! learned from China&#8217;s tech giants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/weee-profile/embed/#?secret=U1hoUhdT0e" data-secret="U1hoUhdT0e" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Even in China where e-commerce is ubiquitous, the majority of grocery shopping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/31/meituan-grocery-delivery/">still happens offline</a>. That&#8217;s changing quickly. The fledgling area of grocery group-buying is growing at over 100% year-over-year in 2020 and expected to reach 72 billion yuan ($11 billion) in market size, according to research firm <a href="https://www.iimedia.cn/c400/74181.html">iiMedia</a>.</p>
<p>It sounds as if grocery group-buying and self-pickup is a step back in a world where doorstep convenience is the norm. But the model has its appeal. Texting orders in a group chat is in a way more accessible for the elderly, who may find Chinese e-commerce apps, often overlaid with busy buttons and tricky sales rules, unfriendly. With bulk orders, sales managers might get better bargains from suppliers. If a group-buying company is ambitious, it can always add last-mile delivery to its offering.</p>
<p>Chinese tech giants are clearly bullish about online grocery and diversifying their portfolios to make sure they have a skin in the game. Tencent is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-29/tencent-primavera-said-to-fund-grocery-app-at-3-billion-value">an investor in Xingsheng Youxuan</a>, Nice Tuan&#8217;s major competitor. Food delivery service Meituan<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/31/meituan-grocery-delivery/"> has its own grocery arm</a>, offering both the traditional digital grocer as well as the WeChat-based group-buy model. E-commerce upstart Pinduoduo <a href="https://investor.pinduoduo.com/static-files/0d0c22e7-188a-4a4f-9692-a1c0c452c474">similarly supports grocery group purchases</a>. Alibaba itself already operates the Hema supermarket, which operates both online and offline markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AWS today opened its re:Invent conference with a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-mac-instances-to-build-test-macos-ios-ipados-tvos-and-watchos-apps/">surprise announcement</a>: the company is bringing the Mac mini to its cloud. These new EC2 Mac instances, as AWS calls them, are now available in preview. They won&#8217;t come cheap, though.</p>
<p>The target audience here &#8212; and the only one AWS is targeting for now &#8212; is developers who want cloud-based build and testing environments for their Mac and iOS apps. But it&#8217;s worth noting that with remote access, you get a fully-featured Mac mini in the cloud, and I&#8217;m sure developers will find all kinds of other use cases for this as well.</p>
<p>Given the recent launch of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/the-new-mac-mini-the-revival-of-the-no-compromise-low-cost-mac/">M1 Mac minis</a>, it&#8217;s worth pointing out that the hardware AWS is using &#8212; at least for the time being &#8212; are i7 machines with six physical and 12 logical cores and 32 GB of memory. Using the Mac&#8217;s built-in networking options, AWS connects them to its Nitro System for fast network and storage access. This means you&#8217;ll also be able to attach AWS block storage to these instances, for example.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the AWS team is also working on bringing <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> new M1 Mac minis into its data centers. The current plan is to roll this out &#8220;early next year,&#8221; AWS tells me, and definitely within the first half of 2021. Both AWS and Apple believe that the need for Intel-powered machines won&#8217;t go away anytime soon, though, especially given that a lot of developers will want to continue to run their tests on Intel machines for the foreseeable future.</p>

AWS only turned off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It helps, Brown said, that the minis fit nicely into a 1U rack.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t really stack them on shelves &#8212; you want to put them in some sort of service sled [and] it fits very well into a service sled and then our cards and all the various things we have to worry about, from an integration point of view, fit around it and just plug into the Mac mini through the ports that it provides,&#8221; Brown explained. He admitted that this was obviously a new challenge for AWS. The only way to offer this kind of service is to use Apple&#8217;s hardware, after all.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2080812" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1_desktop_2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2080812" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2080812" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1_desktop_2.png" alt="" width="900" height="614" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1_desktop_2.png 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1_desktop_2.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1_desktop_2.png?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1_desktop_2.png?resize=768,524 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1_desktop_2.png?resize=680,464 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1_desktop_2.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2080812" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> AWS</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that AWS is not virtualizing the hardware. What you&#8217;re getting here is full access to your own device that you&#8217;re not sharing with anybody else. &#8220;We wanted to make sure that we support the Mac Mini that you would get if you went to the Apple store and you bought a Mac mini,&#8221; Brown said.</p>
<p>Unlike with other EC2 instances, whenever you spin up a new Mac instance, you have to pre-pay for the first 24 hours to get started. After those first 24 hours, prices are by the second, just like with any other instance type AWS offers today.</p>
<p>AWS will charge $1.083 per hour, billed by the second. That&#8217;s just under $26 to spin up a machine and run it for 24 hours. That&#8217;s quite a lot more than what some of the small Mac mini cloud providers are charging (we&#8217;re generally talking about $60 or less per month for their entry-level offerings and around two to three times as much for a comparable i7 machine with 32GB of RAM).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1926389" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AWSLogo.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1926389" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1926389" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AWSLogo.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="629" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AWSLogo.jpg 3676w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AWSLogo.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AWSLogo.jpg?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AWSLogo.jpg?resize=768,472 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AWSLogo.jpg?resize=680,418 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AWSLogo.jpg?resize=1536,943 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AWSLogo.jpg?resize=2048,1258 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AWSLogo.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1926389" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ron Miller/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Until now, Mac mini hosting was a small niche in the hosting market, though it has its fair number of players, with the likes of MacStadium, MacinCloud, MacWeb and Mac Mini Vault vying for their share of the market.</p>
<p>With this new offering from AWS, they are now facing a formidable competitor, though they can still compete on price. AWS, however, argues that it can give developers access to all of the additional cloud services in its portfolio, which sets it apart from all of the smaller players.</p>
<p>&#8220;The speed that things happen at [other Mac mini cloud providers] and the granularity that you can use those services at is not as fine as you get with a large cloud provider like AWS,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;So if you want to launch a machine, it takes a few days to provision and somebody puts a machine in a rack for you and gives you an IP address to get to it and you manage the OS. And normally, you&#8217;re paying for at least a month &#8212; or a longer period of time to get a discount. What we&#8217;ve done is you can literally launch these machines in minutes and have a working machine available to you. If you decide you want 100 of them, 500 of them, you just ask us for that and we&#8217;ll make them available. The other thing is the ecosystem. All those other 200-plus AWS services that you&#8217;re now able to utilize together with the Mac mini is the other big difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown also stressed that Amazon makes it easy for developers to use different machine images, with the company currently offering images for macOS Mojave and Catalina, with Big Sure support coming &#8220;at some point in the future.&#8221; And developers can obviously create their own images with all of the software they need so they can reuse them whenever they spin up a new machine.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pn3miC_tTH0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty much every one of our customers today has some need to support an Apple product and the Apple ecosystem, whether it&#8217;s iPhone, iPad or  Apple TV, whatever it might be. They&#8217;re looking for that bold use case,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;And so the problem we&#8217;ve really been focused on solving is customers that say, &#8216;hey, I&#8217;ve moved all my server-side workloads to AWS, I&#8217;d love to be able to move some of these build workflows, because I still have some Mac minis in a data center or in my office that I have to maintain. I&#8217;d love that just to be on AWS.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>AWS&#8217;s marquee launch customers for the new service are Intuit, Ring and mobile camera app FiLMiC.</p>
<p>&#8220;EC2 Mac instances, with their familiar EC2 interfaces and APIs, have enabled us to seamlessly migrate our existing iOS and macOS build-and-test pipelines to <span class="il">AWS</span>, further improving developer productivity,&#8221; said Pratik Wadher, vice president of Product Development at Intuit. &#8220;We‘re experiencing up to 30% better performance over our data center infrastructure, thanks to elastic capacity expansion, and a high availability setup leveraging multiple zones. We’re now running around 80% of our production builds on EC2 Mac instances, and are excited to see what the future holds for <span class="il">AWS</span> innovation in this space.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new Mac instances are now available in a number of AWS regions. These include US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Europe (Ireland) and Asia Pacific (Singapore), with other regions to follow soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has made it all but impossible for a retail company without an online presence to survive. Yet while companies heavily dependent on foot traffic like J.Crew and Sur la Table have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/business/j-crew-bankruptcy-coronavirus.html">filed for bankruptcy</a> this year, companies that are expert in e-commerce have thrived, including Target and Walmart. Amazon alone now attracts <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2020/11/03/amazons-share-of-us-online-retail-revenue-dips-slightly-in-q3/">roughly one quarter</a> of all dollars spent online by U.S. shoppers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as more shopping moves online, fraud is exploding, too. The problem is such that startups working with enterprises &#8212; flagging transactions for banks, for example &#8212; are raising <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/11/19/forter-raises-125-million-at-a-1-3-billion-valuation-to-combat-ecommerce-fraud-with-ai/">buckets</a> of <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/10/ns8-raises-123-million-to-thwart-ecommerce-fraud-using-behavioral-analytics/">funding</a>. Meanwhile, one <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">New York-based startup, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.fakespot.com/">Fakespot</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, is taking a different approach. It&#8217;s using AI to notify online shoppers when the products they&#8217;re looking to buy are fake listings or when reviews they&#8217;re reading on marketplaces like Amazon or eBay are a fiction.</span></p>
<p>We talked earlier today with Kuwaiti immigrant Saoud Khalifah about the four-year-old business, which got started in his <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/">dorm room</a> after his own frustrating experience in trying to buy nutritional supplements from Amazon. After he&#8217;d nabbed his master&#8217;s degree in software engineering, he launched the company in earnest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like many other startups, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fakespot" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fakespot">Fakespot <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was originally focused on helping enterprise customers identify counterfeit outfits and fake reviews. When the pandemic struck, company spied an &#8220;opening crack on the internet,&#8221; as Khalifah describes it, and instead began catering to consumers who use platforms that are struggling to keep up (and which are often more focused on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fraud-detector/">protecting sellers from buyers</a> and not the other way around).</p>
<p>The pivot seems to be working. Fakespot just closed on $4 million in Series A funding led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bullpen-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bullpen-capital">Bullpen Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which was joined by SRI Capital, Faith Capital and 500 Startups among others in a round that brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $7 million.</p>
<p>The company is gaining more attention from shoppers, too. Khalifah says that a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fakespot-fake-amazon-revi/nakplnnackehceedgkgkokbgbmfghain?hl=en">Chrome browser extension</a> introduced earlier this year has now been downloaded 300,000 times &#8212; and this on the heels of &#8220;millions of users&#8221; who have separately <a href="https://www.fakespot.com/analyzer">visited Fakespot&#8217;s site</a>, typed in a URL of a product review, and through its &#8220;Fakespot analyzer,&#8221; been provided with free data to help inform their buying decisions.</p>
<p>Indeed, according to Khalifah, since Fakespot&#8217;s official founding it has amassed a database of more than 8 billion reviews &#8212; around 10 times as many as the popular travel site Tripadvisor &#8212; from which its AI has learned. He says the tech is sophisticated enough at this point to identify AI-generated text; as for the &#8220;lowest-hanging fruit,&#8221; he says it can easily spot when reviews or positive sentiments about a company are posted in an inorganic way, presumably published by click farms. (It also tracks fake upvotes.)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious where shoppers can use the chrome extension, Fakespot currently scours all the largest marketplaces, including Amazon, eBay, Best Buy, Walmart, and Sephora. Soon, says Khalifah, users will also be able to use the technology to assess the quality of products being sold through Shopify, the software platform that is home to hundreds of thousands of online stores. (Last year, it surpassed eBay to become the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/magazine/shopify.html">No. 2 e-commerce destination in the U.S.</a>, according to Shopify.)</p>
<p>Right now, Fakespot is free to use, including because every review a consumer enters into its database helps train its AI further. Down the road, the company expects to make money by adding a suite of tools atop its free offering. It may also strike lead-generation deals with companies whose products and reviews it has already verified as legitimate.</p>
<p>The question, of course, is how reliably the technology works in the meantime. While Khalifah understandably sings Fakespot&#8217;s praises, a visit to the Google Play store, for example, paints a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fakespot.fakespot&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">mixed picture</a>, with many enthusiastic reviews and some that are, well, less enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Khalifah readily concedes that Fakespot&#8217;s mobile apps need more attention. Though Fakespot has been focused predominately on the desktop experience, Khalifah notes that <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/249863/us-mobile-retail-commerce-sales-as-percentage-of-e-commerce-sales/">more than half</a> of online shopping is expected to be conducted over mobile phones by some time next year, a shift that isn&#8217;t lost on him, even while it hinges a bit on the pandemic being brought effectively to an end (and consumers finding themselves on the run again).</p>
<p>Still, he says that &#8220;ironically, a lot of [bad] reviews are from sellers who are angry that we&#8217;ve given them F grades. They&#8217;re often mad that we revealed that their product is filled with fake reviews.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for how Fakespot moves past these to improve its own rating, Khalifah suggests that the best strategy is actually pretty simple. &#8220;We hope we&#8217;ll have many more satisfied users,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;No one else really has consumers’ backs.&#8221;</p>
