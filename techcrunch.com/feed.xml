					<description><![CDATA[Eucalyptus is serving more than 200,000 patients across four demographic-focused brands: contraception and fertility, skincare, men’s health and sexual wellness.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Telehealth platform Eucalyptus raised a $22.3 million Series B round of funding to build a digital health portfolio for primary care in Australia.</p>
<p>NewView Capital led the round with participation from existing investors Blackbird Ventures and W23, and new investor AirTree Ventures. As part of the investment, Ravi Viswanathan, NewView founder and managing partner, will be joining the Eucalyptus board.</p>
<p>The new round gives the Sydney-based company a total of $32.8 million raised since it was founded in 2019 by Tim Doyle, Benny Kleist, Alexey Mitko and Charlie Gearside.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Australia’s healthcare system is a two-payer model, where most of the care is paid for by the government, and there is a smaller insurance coverage that is owned by individuals. Eucalyptus fits into these models as a private-pay option selling directly to consumers. In some cases, the company is able to charge lower copays for care than the average $25 per doctor visit, Doyle told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>He touts the company as the “largest vertically integrated telehealth platform in Australia,” serving more than 200,000 patients across four demographic-focused brands: contraception and fertility, skincare, men’s health and sexual wellness. Each brand has its own core platform of healthcare providers, patient data repository, remote monitoring tools and partnerships with pathology labs and pharmacies.</p>
<p>All of that results in a higher touch and higher quality relationship between doctor and patient, Doyle said.</p>
<p>“We are seeing an opportunity to shorten the amount of time between identification of a condition and diagnosis,” he added. “We also want to go more in-depth into diabetes, heart conditions and mental health. People are dropping out of diabetes and mental care because there are not enough touch points that are easy to use. If we can build a hub, it will make it easier to treat those conditions.”</p>
<p>In addition to product development, the new funding enables Eucalyptus to build toward being a major player in the telehealth industry. The company will introduce new brands in the next year around chronic care like behavioral health, weight management and diabetes.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus grew its revenue between 200% to 300% year over year since 2019, Doyle said. This is not unlike other startups in the digital health sector, where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/8-vcs-agree-behavioral-support-and-remote-visits-make-digital-health-a-strong-bet-for-2021/">2020 saw another record year for venture capital investment</a>. He expects similar growth in 2021, including adding about 20 employees to be over 100 by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Doyle said he is excited to work with NewView, especially with Viswanathan and associate Christina Fa, who said Eucalyptus is proving that Australia can lead in digital healthcare.</p>
<p>“The team is impressive in terms of clarity of vision and execution, especially in the way they brought in people to manage the brands,” she told TechCrunch. “It is unique being based in Australia where they don’t have the Teledocs and other digital health companies. Instead, Eucalyptus had to build all of that in-house and do the hard work upfront. In addition, they curated a network of health providers and four brands, each with their own personalities that can be fully vertically integrated and own the customer journey.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Reliance on a single technology as a lifeline is a futile battle now. When simple automation no longer does the trick, delivering end-to-end automation needs a combination of complementary technologies that can give a facelift to business processes: the digital operations toolbox.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/unlocking-success-in-digital-transformations#">a McKinsey survey</a>, enterprises that have likely been successful with digital transformation efforts adopted sophisticated technologies such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things or machine learning. Enterprises can achieve hyperautomation with the digital ops toolbox, the hub for your digital operations.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The hyperautomation market is burgeoning: Analysts predict that by 2025, it will reach around $860 billion.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The toolbox is a synchronous medley of intelligent business process management (iBPM), robotic process automation (RPA), process mining, low code, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and a rules engine. The technologies can be optimally combined to achieve the organization’s key performance indicator (KPI) through hyperautomation.</p>
<p>The hyperautomation market is burgeoning: Analysts predict that by 2025, it will reach <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/05/13/hyperautomation-expected-to-reach-up-to-860-billion-by-2025-does-your-company-need-a-cao/?sh=4a1da23b5fd8">around $860 billion</a>. Let’s see why.</p>
<h2>The purpose of a digital ops toolbox</h2>
<p>The toolbox, the treasure chest of technologies it is, helps with three crucial aspects: process automation, orchestration and intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Process automation</strong>: A hyperautomation mindset introduces the world of “automating anything that can be,” whether that’s a process or a task. If something can be handled by bots or other technologies, it should be.</p>
<p><strong>Orchestration</strong>: Hyperautomation, per se, adds an orchestration layer to simple automation. Technologies like intelligent business process management orchestrate the entire process.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligence</strong>: Machines can automate repetitive tasks, but they lack the decision-making capabilities of humans. And, to achieve a perfect harmony where machines are made to “think and act,” or attain cognitive skills, we need AI. Combining AI, ML and natural language processing algorithms with analytics propels simple automation to become more cognitive. Instead of just following if-then rules, the technologies help gather insights from the data. The decision-making capabilities enable bots to make decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Simple automation versus hyperautomation</h2>
<p>Here’s a story of evolving from simple automation to hyperautomation with an example: an order-to-cash process.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 13, 2021. Have you gotten into the fake meat craze yet? Or are you sitting on the sidelines still, holding a turkey leg in one hand and a bacon sandwich in the other? The good news for primitive humans like you and me is that more fake meat is cropping up in more places. Like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/panda-express-is-piloting-beyond-meat-orange-chicken-in-select-locations/">Beyond Meat’s fake chicken at Panda Express</a>.</p>
<p>Look, I love to be a carnivore. But I don’t love the carbon footprint. Maybe tech companies will chart a more sustainable path for the rest of us. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/apple-introduces-a-99-magsafe-battery-pack-for-the-iphone-12/">Apple gets into the external battery game:</a> </strong>If you’re anything like me, your mobile phone is usually about to die. If you own an iPhone, there’s good news today in the form of Apple announcing a $99 battery pack that will provide wireless juice to your handset. It snaps to the back of the phone. Frankly, I am irked that I need this, but I do.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investors-dont-expect-the-us-startup-funding-market-to-slow-down/">There have never been so many great startups:</a> </strong>That’s what TechCrunch learned today from investors. The U.S. venture class said that high prices weren’t keeping them on the sidelines, and that you essentially have to pay up to stay in the game. So if you are a founder with a good growth story, congratulations on your salad days.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">For example, Zomato just raised more money before its IPO:</a> </strong>The Indian food delivery startup is looking to list this week at the high end of its range, with 45% of the $1.3 billion it plans to raise coming from its anchor investors. That’s some hot demand.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>First up from our startup digest today is a piece from our own <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny Crichton</a> announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/the-techcrunch-list-is-dead-long-live-commodity-capital/">the winding down of The TechCrunch List</a>. The original idea was simple: “A curated directory of venture capitalists designed to guide founders to the VCs most relevant to their startups.”</p>
<p>But after reading thousands of entries and building out a huge database, the experiment went a bit stale. Here’s Danny on what happened: “The venture capital industry has radically changed over the past year, and the central thesis we used in constructing the list no longer applies.” Why? Because the venture capital world has become more competitive, quicker and geographically flatter. So terms and pricing matter more, we’re told, than expertise.</p>
<p>Consider that fact duly noted. Now, our usual rundown of funding events, from smallest to largest:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/breach-simulation-startup-attackiq-raises-44m-to-fuel-expansion/"><strong>AttackIQ raises $44M to help companies manage breaches:</strong></a> It does so in an interesting manner, by simulating attacks themselves. It’s a bit like having a scrimmage match against yourself. The latest AttackIQ deal underscores just how valuable cybersecurity startups have proven to be in recent months.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/marco-financial-raises-82m-seed-round-to-support-small-latin-american-exporters/">Marco Financial raises $82M to fund LatAm exporters:</a> </strong>The Miami-based, trade-focused startup raised $7 million in cash and $75 million in credit to help grow its business. Marco Financial uses a “tech-enabled risk assessment platform” to determine creditworthiness, which is neat. Anything to provide more capital access to more people in more places.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/amperity-raises-100m-on-a-1b-valuation-to-help-companys-build-better-profiles-of-their-customers/"><strong>Amperity raises $100M, becomes unicorn:</strong></a> What does it do? The startup built a customer data platform to help big companies better understand to whom they sell. As our own Ingrid Lunden reports, the startup is working in a world where some traditional methods of tracking customers &#8212; like browser cookies &#8212; are fading from our shared reality.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/"><strong>Sourcegraph raises $125M for its code-search tool:</strong></a> This is an interesting one. Now worth $2.625 billion &#8212; up 3x from its December round &#8212; Sourcegraph is on fire. Other reporting <a href="https://twitter.com/EricNewcomer/status/1414986109885554688">indicates</a> that the company could be at around a $10 million annual run rate. That’s, ahem, a healthy multiple.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5 advanced-ish SEO tactics to win in 2021</h2>
<p>The days of gaming search engines to drive traffic are long gone. Startups that want to be noticed must invest in producing high-quality content that accurately describes their products and services.</p>
<p>Beyond the basic best practices you&#8217;ll find on SEO blogs and newsletters, Mark Spera, head of growth marketing at Minted, offers five &#8220;advanced-ish&#8221; tactics &#8220;to increase your SEO throughput and capitalize on some of the arbitrage still left in organic search.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strategy No. 1? Start out by using content-generation tools to automate tasks like creating search-friendly headlines, titles and blog outlines.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been able to bring our article-writing process down from four hours per article to around 90 minutes,&#8221; writes Spera. &#8220;Imagine what you could do with all that time!&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Yes, there was other Big Tech news apart from Apple’s battery pack today. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/discord-buys-sentropy/"><strong>Discord buys Sentropy:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Discord is a big company today, with lots of staff, lots of users and a big valuation. And it just bought Sentropy, a startup that TechCrunch wrote “makes AI-powered software to detect and remove online harassment and hate.” Given that some loathsome groups use Discord here and there, the buy makes sense.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/facebook-adds-a-payout-time-bonus-to-help-retain-bug-bounty-hunters/"><strong>Facebook wants to pay bug hunters more:</strong></a><strong> </strong>A new Facebook program called the “Payout Time Bonus” may boost fees paid to bug hunters in the social network’s world. The company pays out less per year than some other megacorps, but the gap could tighten thanks to the new effort.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zoominfo-drops-575m-on-chorus-ai-as-ai-shakes-up-the-sales-market/">ZoomInfo buys Chorus.ai for $575M:</a> </strong>Early today news broke that ZoomInfo, a public company, will drop more than half a billy on Chrous.ai, a company that provides sales intelligence tools focused on conversations. It’s related to what Gong.io is building, though Gong remains independent and worth around 13 times as much.</li>
</ul>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If you’ve done any online shopping in the last little while, there’s a good chance you’ve run into services like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-23-affirm-s-app-lends-you-money-to-buy-things-online.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">Affirm</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/for-you/pay-in-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">PayPal’s Pay in 4</a>. They allow you to purchase something and pay for it later by splitting up the total cost of the item into several installments.</p>
<p>By the looks of things, Apple could soon offer a similar option to Apple Pay users. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-13/apple-goldman-plan-buy-now-pay-later-service-to-rival-paypal?sref=4wt71Nx9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>, the company is working with Goldman Sachs on a service called “Apple Pay Later” that will allow those with its devices to settle purchases over time, including ones they make at physical shops.</p>
<p>When using the service, the outlet says you’ll have two ways of paying for your purchase. If you pick the “Apple Pay in 4” option, you’ll need to make four interest-free payments across two months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other option is to extend the payment period over multiple months, though in that case interest comes into play. <em>Bloomberg</em> says it wasn’t able to determine how much interest Apple plans to charge or when the company will roll out the service.</p>
<p>We’ve reached out to Apple for comment on the report, and we’ll update this article when we hear back from the company. But in many ways, Apple Pay Later sounds like a logical extension of what the company is already doing with Apple Card, where one of the perks it offers is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-card-installment-plans-151259919.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">installment plans for Mac and iPad purchases</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The next time you&#8217;re on a plane, searching for a Wi-Fi connection while soaring thousands of feet above the ground, don&#8217;t look for the Gogo name. The longstanding standard of in-flight internet, Gogo Commercial Aviation, has been rebranded to Intelsat.</p>
<p>Intelsat, an international satellite communications provider, purchased Gogo Commercial Aviation <a href="https://www.intelsat.com/newsroom/intelsat-completes-acquisition-of-gogo-commercial-aviation-announces-leadership-appointments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">in December 2020</a>. It was a cash deal valued at $400 million. Gogo still exists and focuses on business aviation services.<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span></p>
<p>Gogo has been a staple of in-flight entertainment for the past decade, partnering with 17 major airlines. The service is as impressive as it is frustrating, though it&#8217;s improved with time. In 2019, Gogo announced plans to roll out 5G in-flight services this year, and it began <a href="https://www.aviationtoday.com/2021/06/22/gogo-starts-flight-testing-5g-antennas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">testing those antennas in June</a>. As Intelsat, 5G is still the goal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“This name change is happening while Intelsat is leveraging its unparalleled global orbital and spectrum rights, scale and partnerships to build the world’s first global 5G satellite-based software-defined network of networks,” Intelsat CEO Stephen Spengler said in <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210713005756/en/Gogo-Commercial-Aviation-is-Now-Intelsat" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">a press release</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Masten Space Systems, a startup that’s aiming to send a lander to the moon in 2023, will develop a lunar navigation and positioning system not unlike GPS here on Earth.</p>
<p>Masten’s prototype is being developed as part of a contract awarded through the Air Force Research Laboratory’s AFWERX program. Once deployed, it&#8217;ll be a first-of-its-kind off-world navigational system.</p>
<p>Up until this point, spacecraft heading to the moon must carry equipment onboard to detect hazards and assist with navigation. To some extent, it makes sense that a shared navigation network has never been established: Humans have only landed on the moon a handful of times, and while there have been many more uncrewed landings, lunar missions still haven’t exactly been a regular occurrence.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But as the costs of going to orbit and beyond have drastically decreased, thanks in part to innovations in launch technology by companies like SpaceX, space is likely to get a lot busier. Many private companies and national space divisions have set their sights on the moon in particular. <a href="https://masten.aero/">Masten</a> is one of them: It was chosen by NASA to deliver commercial and private payloads to a site near the Haworth Crater at the lunar south pole. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/spacex-will-launch-mastens-first-lander-to-the-moon-in-2022/">That mission</a>, originally scheduled for December 2022, was pushed back to November 2023.</p>
<p>Other entities are also looking to go to the moon. Chief amongst them is NASA with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/artemis/">Artemis program</a>, which will send two astronauts to the lunar surface in 2024. These missions will likely only increase in the coming decades, making a common navigation network more of a necessity.</p>
<p>“Unlike Earth, the moon isn’t equipped with GPS so lunar spacecraft and orbital assets are essentially operating in the dark,” Masten’s VP of research and development Matthew Kuhns explained in a statement.</p>
<p>The system will work like this: Spacecraft will deploy position, navigation and timing (PNT) beacons onto the lunar surface. The PNT beacons will enable a surface-based network that broadcasts a radio signal, allowing spacecraft and other orbital assets to wirelessly connect for navigation, timing and location tracking.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177139" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177139" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2177139" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/XL1-Landing-Moon.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/XL1-Landing-Moon.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/XL1-Landing-Moon.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/XL1-Landing-Moon.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/XL1-Landing-Moon.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/XL1-Landing-Moon.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/XL1-Landing-Moon.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/XL1-Landing-Moon.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/XL1-Landing-Moon.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2177139" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://masten.aero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Masten Space Systems <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The company already concluded Phase I of the project, which involved completing the concept design for the PNT beacons. The bulk of the engineering challenge will come in Phase II, when Masten will develop the PNT beacons. They must be able to withstand harsh lunar conditions, so Masten is partnering with defense and technology company Leidos to build shock-proof beacon enclosures. The aim is to complete the second phase in 2023.</p>
<p>“By establishing a shared navigation network on the moon, we can lower spacecraft costs by millions of dollars, increase payload capacity and improve landing accuracy near the most resource-rich sites on the moon,” Kuhns said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish electric aviation startup Heart Aerospace has received its biggest order to date: 200 of its inaugural ES-19 electric aircraft from aviation giant United Airlines and its regional airline partner Mesa Air Group.</p>
<p>The deal, which includes an option of purchasing up to 100 additional aircraft, was announced together with a $35 million Series A funding round. Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, United’s venture arm and Mesa led the round. Seed investors EQT Ventures and Lowercarbon Capital also participated.</p>
<p>The ES-19 is a regional airplane that seats 19 and runs on batteries and electric motors instead of traditional jet fuel. The startup says it will deliver the first aircraft for commercial use by 2026. These aircraft will be designed for flights of up to 250 miles based on today’s battery technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Heart has made a full-scale prototype of its electric propulsion system, the core of its technical innovation. But the company still has to complete many steps along the way to its proposed date of commercial operations. Chief amongst these is actually assembling a prototype of the full aircraft, testing it and getting it certified with relevant authorities in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>Heart’s founder, aerospace engineer Anders Forslund, said this recent funding round will go toward working with suppliers to validate the safety and reliability of the myriad other systems that need to go in the aircraft, like the avionics system, flight control and even the all-important de-icing system. The company’s talking with around 50 suppliers for these remaining parts, he said. The aviation startup is also building a massive test facility to assemble and demonstrate the full prototype ES-19.</p>
<p>Heart’s in a relativity advantageous position compared to electric air taxis, at least with regard to regulators, because it intends to slot in with existing aviation infrastructure (no special vertiports for the ES-19). Besides the electric propulsion system, which is admittedly a major innovation, the company will be relying on existing technology for other individual systems.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2176966" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2176966" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2176966" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Propulsion-4.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Propulsion-4.jpg 3457w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Propulsion-4.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Propulsion-4.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Propulsion-4.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Propulsion-4.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Propulsion-4.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Propulsion-4.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Propulsion-4.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2176966" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Heart Aerospace</p></div></p>
<p>Forslund noted in an interview with TechCrunch that the 2026 launch date is “not just something that we have as a lofty goal that we&#8217;d like to parade around on the internet, but it&#8217;s what our suppliers are working toward, what our certifying authorities are working toward as well.”</p>
<p>Although the company is based in Sweden, it’s likely that final assembly of at least some of the aircraft will take place in North America to fulfill orders with companies in those countries, Forslund added.</p>
<p>The agreement with Heart is the latest electric aviation wager made by United this year. The airline also put in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/">$1 billion order</a> and invested in air taxi startup Archer Aviation in February (Forslund declined to specify the financial amount of United’s order). Both the Archer and Heart orders are conditional on certain safety and operational standards, and both companies are at least a handful of years away from going to market. The investments mark the beginning of a sea change in aviation — one already well underway in personal vehicle transportation — toward lower- and zero-emissions technologies.</p>
<p>The deal may also revitalize the 19-seat plane, once a mainstay of regional air travel. The plane type has fallen victim to unprofitable margins resulting in the retirement of more than 1,500 of the aircraft over the past 30 years. Regional air travel has also steadily declined in the United States since the 1990s. Mesa was at one point the largest operator of the 19-seater.</p>
<p>On its website, Heart points out that the smaller conventional planes are no longer economical when the engine cost of ownership is equivalent for a 19- or 70-seater. But it says that its electric aircraft will change the equation. The ES-19 electric motor is 20 times less expensive than an equivalent turboprop and maintenance costs will be reduced by 100-fold, Heart claims.</p>
<p>Heart was founded in 2018 after being spun out of a research project at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. The company joined Y Combinator’s winter 2019 cohort after closing its $2.2 million seed in May of that year. Heart’s grown to around fifty employees and shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>“Aviation is difficult, and we want to build a plane that doesn&#8217;t reinvent the wheel,” Forslund said. “[We’re] just focusing on building an aircraft that&#8217;s electric, that&#8217;s safe, that&#8217;s efficient, and that&#8217;s reliable and it&#8217;s something that airlines can find profitable in operating.”</p>

<p>Starting today, anyone on Twitter will be able to adjust who can reply to individual tweets after they&#8217;ve been sent. Previously, you could limit who could reply to tweets when they were created, but you couldn&#8217;t go in and change your selection after the fact.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your Tweets = Your space. Now you can change who can reply to you even after you Tweet. <a href="https://t.co/rNWJk6zWTr">https://t.co/rNWJk6zWTr</a> <a href="https://t.co/3HFSjAotg7">pic.twitter.com/3HFSjAotg7</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>On Twitter, you don&#8217;t always have a sense of what kind of tweets will attract unwanted attention until it&#8217;s too late. The new feature makes the option to limit replies to people you follow or only people mentioned in a tweet much more useful, particularly because the mute button doesn&#8217;t always cut it.</p>
<p>Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/twitter-now-lets-everyone-limit-replies-to-their-tweets/">added the option to limit replies last August</a> to boost &#8220;meaningful conversations&#8221; on the social network and to help people feel safer from harassment when they tweet. Product researcher Jane Manchun Wong <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1401009028331839491">first spotted the feature&#8217;s expansion in June</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/how-retail-ziplines-series-a-pitch-deck-ticked-every-box-for-emergence-capital/">On a recent episode of Extra Crunch Live</a>, Retail Zipline founder Melissa Wong and Emergence Capital investor Lotti Siniscalco joined Managing Editor Jordan Crook to walk attendees through Zipline&#8217;s Series A deck.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the conversation revealed that Wong declined an invitation to do a virtual pitch and insisted on an in-person meeting.</p>
<p>“She was one of the few or maybe the only CEO who ever stood up to pitch the entire team,” said Siniscalco.</p>
<p>“She pointed to the screen projected behind her to help us stay on the most relevant piece of information. The way she did it really made us stay with her. Like, we couldn’t break eye contact.”</p>

<hr />
<p>Beyond Wong&#8217;s pitch technique, this post also examines some of the key &#8220;customer love&#8221; metrics that helped Zipline win the day, such as CAC, churn rates and net promoter score.</p>
<p>“In retrospect, I really underestimated the competitive advantage of coming from the industry,&#8221; said Wong. &#8220;But it resulted in the numbers in our deck, because I know what customers want, what they want to buy next, how to keep them happy and I was able to be way more capital-efficient.”</p>

<p>Global venture capital reached $156 billion in Q2 2021, a YOY increase of 157%. A record number of unicorns found their feet during the same period and valuations rose across the board, report Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm in today&#8217;s edition of The Exchange.</p>
<p>Even if round counts didn&#8217;t set all-time highs, &#8220;the general vibe of Q2 venture capital data was clear: It’s a great time for startups looking to raise capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anna and Alex are interviewing VCs in different regions to find out why they&#8217;re feeling so generous and optimistic. Today, they started with the following U.S.-based investors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amy Cheetham, principal, Costanoa Ventures</li>
<li>Marlon Nichols, founding managing partner, MaC Venture Capital</li>
<li>Vanessa Larco, partner, New Enterprise Associates</li>
<li>Jeff Grabow, venture capital leader, EY US</li>

<p>The construction industry might seem like a sector wanting innovation, Safe Site Check In CEO and founder David Ward writes in a guest column, but there are unique challenges that make construction firms slow to adapt to new technology.</p>
<p>From the way construction projects are funded to complicated local regulations, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for the construction industry’s tech problems.</p>
<p>Construction tech might be appealing to investors, Ward writes, but it must be “easy to use, easy to deploy or access while on a job site, and improve productivity almost immediately.”</p>

<p>Now that he&#8217;s stepping away from AWS and taking over for Jeff Bezos, what are the biggest challenges facing incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy?</p>
<p>Enterprise reporter Ron Miller reached out to three analysts to get their take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robin Ody, Canalys</li>
<li>Sucharita Kodali, Forrester</li>
<li>Ed Anderson, Gartner</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon is listed second in the Fortune 500, but it&#8217;s not all sunshine and roses — maintaining growth, unionization, and the potential for antitrust regulation at home and abroad are just a few of his responsibilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the biggest to-do is to just continue that momentum that the company has had for the last several years,&#8221; Kodali says. &#8220;He has to make sure that they don’t lose that. If he does that, I mean, he will win.”</p>

<p>Publishing an API isn&#8217;t enough for any startup: Once it&#8217;s released, the hard work of cultivating a developer base begins.</p>
<p>Postman&#8217;s head of developer relations, Joyce Lin, wrote a guest post for Extra Crunch based on the findings of a study aimed at increasing adoption of APIs that utilize a public workspace.</p>
<p>Lin found that the most important metric for a public API is time to first call (TTFC). It makes sense — faster TTFC allows developers to begin using new tools quickly. As a result, &#8220;legitimately streamlining TTFC results in a larger market potential of better-educated users for the later stages of your developer journey,&#8221; writes Lin.</p>
<p>This post isn&#8217;t just for the developers in our audience: TTFC is a metric that product and growth teams should also keep top of mind, they suggest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if your market is defined as a limited subset of the developer community, any enhancements you make to TTFC equate to a larger available market.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark Spera, the head of growth marketing at Minted, offers SEO tips to help smaller sites stand out.</p>
<p>He writes in a guest column that Google’s algorithm “errs on the side of caution,” which leads the search engine to favor larger, more established websites.</p>
<p>“The cards aren’t in your favor, so you need to be even more strategic than the big guys,” he writes. “This means executing on some cutting-edge hacks to increase your SEO throughput and capitalize on some of the arbitrage still left in organic search. I call these five tactics ‘advanced-ish,’ because none of them are complicated, but all of them are supremely important for search marketers in 2021.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the great things about editing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec1/">all of our deep-dive EC-1 startup profiles</a> is that you start to notice patterns across successful companies. While origin stories and trajectories can vary widely, the best companies seem to come from similar places and are conceived around very peculiar themes.</p>
<p>To wit, one common theme that came from our recent profiles of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/">Expensify</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1/">NS1</a> is the centrality of file sharing (or, <i>illegal</i> file sharing if you are on that side of the fence) and internet infrastructure in the origin stories of the two companies. That’s peculiar, because the duo honestly couldn’t be more different. Expensify is an SF-founded (now Portland-based), decentralized startup focused on building <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/expensify-ec1-business/">expense reporting and analytics software for companies and CFOs</a>. New York-based NS1 designs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-product/">highly redundant DNS and internet traffic performance tools</a> for web applications.</p>
<p>Yet, take a look at how the two companies were founded. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">Anna Heim on the origins of Expensify</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To truly understand Expensify, you first need to take a close look at a unique, short-lived, P2P file-sharing company called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Swoosh">Red Swoosh</a>, which was Travis Kalanick’s startup before he founded Uber. Framed by Kalanick as his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QrX5jsiico">“revenge business”</a> after his previous P2P startup <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scour_Inc.">Scour</a> was <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/scour-sued-over-downloaded-movies/">sued</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2000/12/scour-going-going-gone/">into oblivion</a> for copyright infringement, Red Swoosh would be the precursor for Expensify’s future culture and ethos. In fact, many of Expensify’s initial team actually met at Red Swoosh, which was eventually acquired by Akamai Technologies in 2007 for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2007/04/12/payday-for-red-swoosh-15-million-from-akamai/">$18.7 million</a>.</p>
<p>[Expensify founder and CEO David] Barrett, a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/david-barrett">self-proclaimed alpha geek</a> and lifelong software engineer, was actually Red Swoosh’s last engineering manager, hired after the failure of his first project, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070122173504/http://www.iglance.com/faq.html">iGlance.com</a>, a P2P push-to-talk program that couldn’t compete against Skype. “While I was licking my wounds from that experience, I was approached by Travis Kalanick who was running a startup called Red Swoosh,” he <a href="https://www.sramanamitra.com/2014/08/24/building-a-profitable-steady-growth-subscription-business-expensify-ceo-david-barrett-part-1/">recalled</a> in an interview.</p></blockquote>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How a band of P2P hackers planted the seeds of a unique expense management giant&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/embed/#?secret=DAg4LkXylO" data-secret="DAg4LkXylO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Then you head over to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">Sean Michael Kerner’s story on how NS1 came together</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>NS1’s story begins back at the turn of the millennium, when [NS1 co-founder and CEO Kris] Beevers was an undergrad at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in upstate New York and found himself employed at a small file-sharing startup called Aimster with some friends from RPI. Aimster was his first taste of life at an internet startup in the heady days of the dot-com boom and bust, and also where he met an enterprising young engineer by the name of Raj Dutt, who would become a key relationship over the next two decades.</p>
<p>By 2007, Beevers had completed his Ph.D. in robotic mapping at RPI and tried his hand at co-founding and running an engineered-wood-product company named SolidJoint Research, Inc. for 10 months. But he soon boomeranged back to the internet world, joining some of his former co-workers from Aimster at a company called Voxel that had been founded by Dutt.</p>
<p>The startup provided a cornucopia of services including basic web hosting, server co-location, content delivery and DNS services. “Voxel was one of those companies where you learn a lot because you’re doing way more than you rightfully should,” Beevers said. “It was a business sort of built out of love for the tech, and love for solving problems.”</p>
<p>The New York City-based company peaked at some 60 employees before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/03/internap-buys-hosting-cloud-services-company-voxel-for-up-to-35-million/">it was acquired in December 2011 by Internap Network Services</a> for $35 million.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YqrxDwntzr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">1 napkin and 22 lines of code, or how NS1 rewrote the rules of internet infrastructure</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;1 napkin and 22 lines of code, or how NS1 rewrote the rules of internet infrastructure&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/embed/#?secret=YqrxDwntzr" data-secret="YqrxDwntzr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Note some of the similarities here. First, these wildly different founders ended up both working on key internet plumbing. Which makes sense of course, since two decades ago, building out the networking and compute capacity of the internet was one of the major engineering challenges of that period in the web’s history.</p>
<p>Additionally in both cases, the founding teams met at little-known companies defined by their engineering cultures and which sold to larger internet infrastructure conglomerates for relatively small amounts of money. And those acquirers ended up being laboratories for all kinds of innovation, even as few people really remember Akamai or Internap these days (both companies are still around today mind you).</p>
<p>The cohort of founders is fascinating. Obviously, you have Travis Kalanick, who would later go on to found Uber. But the Voxel network that went to Internap is hardly a slouch:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dutt would leave Internap to start Grafana, an open-source data visualization vendor that has raised over $75 million to date. Voxel COO Zachary Smith went on to found bare metal cloud provider, Packet, in 2013, which he ran as CEO until <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/equinix-is-acquiring-bare-metal-cloud-provider-packet/">the company was acquired by Equinix in March 2020</a> for $335 million. Meanwhile, Justin Biegel, who spent time at Voxel in operations, has raised nearly $62 million for his startup Kentik. And of course, NS1 was birthed from the same alumni network.</p></blockquote>
<p>What’s interesting to me with these two companies (and some others in our set of stories) is how often founders worked on other problems before starting the companies that would make them famous. They learned the trade, built networks of hyperintelligent present and future colleagues, understood business development and growth, and started to create a flywheel of innovation amidst their friends. They also got a taste of an exit without really getting the whole meal, if you will.</p>
<p>In particular with file sharing, what’s interesting is the rebellious and democratic ethos that came with that world back at the turn of the millennium. To work in file sharing in that era meant fighting the big music labels, overturning the economics of entire industries, and breaking down barriers to allow the internet economy to flourish. It attracted a weird bunch of folks — the exact kind of weirdness that happens to make good startup founders, apparently. It echos one of the key arguments of Fred Turner’s book, “<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo3773600.html">From Counterculture to Cyberculture</a>.”</p>
<p>Which begs the question then: What are the “file-sharing” markets today that these sorts of individuals congregate around? One that seems obvious to me is blockchain, which has precisely that balance of rebelliousness, democratization and technical excellence. (Well, at least some of the time!) And then there are the modern-day “pirates” today such as Alexandra Elbakyan who invented and has operated Sci-Hub to make the world’s research and knowledge democratized.</p>
<p>It’s maybe not the current batch of companies that we see that will become the next extraordinary unicorns. But watch the people who show up in the interesting places — because their next projects often seem to hit gold.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian food-delivery startup Zomato said on Tuesday evening that it has raised $562.3 million from its anchor investors ahead of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/zomato-ipo/">IPO opening on Wednesday</a>.</p>
<p>Zomato has already secured nearly 45% of the $1.3 billion it plans to raise through the IPO, the 12-year-old Gurgaon-headquartered startup <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/markets/MarketInfo/DispNoticesNCirculars.aspx?page=20210713-45">revealed</a> in a filing to local stock exchanges. The public share sale will open on Wednesday and close Friday.</p>
<p>Tiger Global, Fidelity, New World, Baillie Gifford, Government of Singapore, Canada Pension Plan, Mirae Asset, T. Rowe Price, and Steadview are among the investors that are backing the startup in the public markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The investors have subscribed the shares at Rs 76 ($1) &#8212; the upper end of the price range for Zomato&#8217; shares &#8212; giving the Indian startup an implied valuation of $8.6 billion, up from $5.4 billion in February this year.</p>
<p>The oversubscription illustrates the confidence high-profile investors are placing in the world’s second-largest internet market’s first real consumer internet offering.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a virtual press conference last week, Zomato executives said the startup, which has search and discovery in nearly two dozen markets, will focus largely on India and will explore categories such as online grocery delivery in the future.</p>
<p>The executives also dismissed Amazon as a serious competitor for now. “There’s no major impact on market share from Amazon so far,” the company’s chief financial officer said. Amazon entered the food-delivery market last year and is operational in just Bangalore for now. Swiggy, backed by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Prosus Ventures, is Zomato&#8217;s chief rival in India.</p>
<p>For the financial year that ended in March this year, its revenue was down 23% to $283 million, and it also shrank its losses to $110 million, down 66% from the same period a year ago.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Technology plays a huge role in nearly every aspect of financial services today. As the world moved online, tools and infrastructure to help people manage their money and make payments have burgeoned the world over in the past decade.</p>
<p>With much of the finance world now leveraging technology to conduct business, predict trends and deliver services, financial services regulators are also developing new technologies to monitor markets, supervise financial institutions and conduct other administrative activities. The emergence of purpose-built technologies to facilitate regulator oversight has, over the past few years, garnered its own moniker of supervisory technology, or suptech.</p>
<p>Interest in suptech is proliferating across the globe thanks to a diverse set of prudential and conduct regulators. A sampling of regulators developing suptech include the FDIC, CFPB, FINRA and Federal Reserve in the U.S.; the U.K.’s FCA and Bank of England; the National Bank of Rwanda in Africa; as well as the ASIC, HKMA and MAS in Asia. Several &#8220;super regulators&#8221; are also engaged in suptech efforts such as the Bank of International Settlements, the Financial Stability Board and the World Bank.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The strides in suptech demonstrate that creative thinking coupled with experimentation and scalable, easily accessible technologies are jump-starting a new approach to regulation.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll examine a few core suptech use cases, consider its future and explore the challenges facing regulators as the market matures. The uses are diverse, so we’ll focus on three key areas: regulatory reporting, machine-readable regulation, and market and conduct oversight.</p>
<p>A quick general note: Nearly every financial services regulator is engaged in some type of suptech activity and the use cases discussed in this article are intended as a sample, not a comprehensive list.</p>
<h2>But what exactly is suptech?</h2>
<p>As a preliminary matter, we should quickly survey a few definitions of suptech to frame our understanding. Both the World Bank and BIS have offered definitions that provide useful outlines for this discussion. The World Bank <a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/735871616428497205/the-next-wave-of-suptech-innovation-suptech-solutions-for-market-conduct-supervision">states</a> that suptech &#8220;refers to the use of technology to facilitate and enhance supervisory processes from the perspective of supervisory authorities.&#8221; It&#8217;s a little circular, but helpful.</p>
<p>The BIS <a href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/suptech_regtech.htm">defines</a> suptech as &#8220;the use of technology for regulatory, supervisory and oversight purposes.&#8221; This is a similarly loose definition that describes the broader scope better.</p>
<p>Regardless of differences on the margins, the &#8220;sup&#8221; in these suptech definitions acknowledges the primacy of the idea that regulators&#8217; objectives are to oversee the conduct, structure, and health of the financial system. Suptech technologies facilitate related regulatory supervision and enforcement processes.</p>
<h2>Regulatory reporting</h2>
<p>Regulatory reporting refers to a broad swath of activities such as financial firms providing trading data to regulatory authorities and regulators’ analysis of financial data or corporate information to determine the projected health or potential risks facing an institution or the market.</p>
<p>The MAS and FDIC are incorporating transactional and financial data reported by firms as a means to assess their financial viability. The MAS, in conjunction with BIS, has run <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2020/mas-supports-inaugural-cloud-based-g20-techsprint">tech sprints</a> soliciting new ideas relating to regulatory reporting, while the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2020/pr20109.html">FDIC</a> has &#8220;a <a href="https://www.bis.org/fsi/publ/insights29.htm">regulatory reporting solution</a> that would allow ‘on-demand’ monitoring of banks as opposed to being constrained by ‘point-in-time’ reporting. This project is particularly targeted at smaller, community banks that provide only aggregated data on their financial health on a quarterly basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The HKMA recently <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-information/guidelines-and-circular/2021/20210617e1a1.pdf">outlined its three-year plan</a> for the development of suptech, which includes developing an approach to &#8220;network analysis.&#8221; The HKMA will analyze reporting data related to corporate shareholding and financial exposure to bring them &#8220;to life as network diagrams, so that the relationships between different entities become more apparent. Greater transparency of the connections and dependencies between banks and their customers will enable HKMA supervisors to detect early warning signals within the entire credit network.&#8221;</p>
<p>These reporting initiatives touch on a theme regulators have continuously struggled with: How to regulate markets and firms based on a reactive approach to historical data. Regulation and enforcement are often retrospective activities — examining past behavior and data to decide how to sanction an organization or develop a regulatory framework to govern a particular type of activity or financial product. This can result in an approach to regulation too rooted in past failures, which might lack the flexibility to anticipate or adapt to emerging risks or financial products.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The online chat platform Discord is buying Sentropy, a company that makes AI-powered software to detect and remove online harassment and hate.</p>
<p>Discord currently uses a &#8220;multilevel&#8221; approach to moderation, relying on an in-house human moderation team as well as volunteer mods and admins to create ground rules for individual servers. A Trust and Safety team dedicated to protecting users and shaping content moderation policies comprised 15% of Discord&#8217;s workforce as of May 2020.</p>
<p>Discord plans to integrate Sentropy&#8217;s own products into its existing toolkit and the company will also bring the smaller company&#8217;s leadership group aboard. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the acquisition is a sign that taking toxic content and harassment seriously isn&#8217;t just the right thing to do — it&#8217;s good business too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;T&amp;S tech and processes should not be used as a competitive advantage,&#8221; Sentropy CEO John Redgrave said in a <a href="https://medium.com/sentropy/sentropy-x-discord-1ed5c4269896">blog post on the announcement</a>. &#8220;We all deserve digital and physical safety, and moderators deserve better tooling to help them do one of the hardest jobs online more effectively and with fewer harmful impacts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Discord hasn&#8217;t always had a reputation for taking dangerous content seriously. Far-right groups with ties to real-world violence previously thrived on the platform. Discord cracked down on hate and extremism following the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, which left anti-racist protester Heather Heyer dead.</p>
<p>By February of 2018, the company was<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/28/17061774/discord-alt-right-atomwaffen-ban-centipede-central-nordic-resistance-movement"> purging white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups</a>, cleaning up the platform on its journey to transcend its gaming roots and grow into a mainstream social network. Now, Discord boasts 150 million monthly active users and is positioning itself as a comfy home for all kinds of communities while holding onto its core user base of gamers.</p>
<p>In a blog post, Redgrave elaborated on the company&#8217;s natural connection with Discord:</p>
<blockquote><p>Discord represents the next generation of social companies — a generation where users are not the product to be sold, but the engine of connectivity, creativity, and growth. In this model, user privacy and user safety are essential product features, not an afterthought. The success of this model depends upon building next-generation Trust and Safety into every product. We don’t take this responsibility lightly and are humbled to work at the scale of Discord and with Discord’s resources to increase the depth of our impact.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sentropy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/sentropy-emerges-from-stealth-with-an-ai-platform-to-tackle-online-abuse-backed-by-13m-from-initialized-and-more/">launched out of stealth last summer</a> with an AI system designed to detect, track and cleanse platforms of online harassment and abuse. The company emerged then with $13 million in funding from notable backers including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and his VC firm Initialized Capital, King River Capital, Horizons Ventures and Playground Global.</p>
<p>Sentropy will offer existing enterprise customers who use its software products Detect and Defend service through the end of September. The company shut down its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/sentropy-launches-tool-for-people-to-protect-themselves-from-social-media-abuse-starting-with-twitter/">free consumer dashboard, Sentropy Protect</a>, earlier this month.</p>
<p>Sentropy&#8217;s products were conceived as social network-agnostic tools rather than as platform-specific solutions. It sounds like even under Discord&#8217;s wing, the team plans to share insights on building safer online spaces with the internet at large.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to help Discord decide how we can most effectively share with the rest of the Internet the best practices, technology, and tools that we’ve developed to protect our own communities,&#8221; Redgrave said.</p>
<p>Discord&#8217;s future is looking bright. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/discord-ipo-microsoft-deal/">walked away</a> from a possible acquisition by Microsoft earlier this year that reportedly valued it at around $10 billion. Discord looks content to remain independent for now and could <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/discord-ends-deal-talks-with-microsoft-11618938806?st=566xw655qf2bo0d&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share">chart a path toward an IPO</a> in the not-too-distant future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just under a week after Beyond Meat announced that it will be releasing a reworked version of its plant-based Chicken Tenders at restaurants in the U.S., the faux meat company has returned with a potentially sizable restaurant partnership.</p>
<p>Starting July 26, select Panda Express restaurants in Southern California and New York City will offer an orange chicken dish using Beyond’s chicken product. It’s a big potential partnership for Beyond, as the Asian American fast food chain currently has 2,200 locations, largely in food courts and other high-traffic spots.</p>
<p>It could also be a big step for Panda Express, which has traditionally had fairly limited vegetarian options. You know it’s a bit dire for veggies when the press release lists “steamed white and brown rice” as two of its six “plant-based dishes.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2176943" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2176943" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2176943 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2176943" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Beyond Meat</p></div></p>
<p>Beyond Meat isn’t calling it a pilot, exactly, but notes in an email to TechCrunch, “we are confident that people will love the new menu item and we will keep our guests updated with information on additional rollouts.” One assumes a larger rollout depends on early feedback and perceived consumer demand for a non-meat-based main dish.</p>
<p>“Beyond The Original Orange Chicken is the next step in the brand’s journey to offer more diverse and plant-based options, while still delivering comfort and crave-ability in innovative ways,” Panda Express’  chef Jimmy Wang said in a release tied to the soft launch. “Creating a fresh new take on a classic favorite is a great and accessible way to introduce plant-based proteins to our guests and perhaps even drawing a new audience for Panda.”</p>
<p>Baby steps, but anything that helps reduce meat consumption is probably a net positive. . Beyond also has deals with  Pizza Hut, KFC, Denny’s and Dunkin&#8217; for its various plant-based meat substitutes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investors are buying into a creator-led future, and<a href="https://nasacademy.com/"> Nas Academy</a> wants to turn that creator influence into a broad network of &#8220;virtual universities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Singapore startup is building out a platform for creators to monetize their knowledge, giving them the tools to create their own classes and academies that fans can attend online. The platform is founded and led by Nuseir Yassin, a video blogger and influencer whose Nas Daily social media accounts boast tens of millions of followers across platforms.</p>
<p>Nas Academy has closed an $11 million Series A led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with additional backing from Balaji Srinivasan, Emilie Choi, TechAviv Founder Partners, 500 Startups and Metapurse, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The platform can help creators build on-demand class portfolios or live courses, while the marketplace allows users to navigate and shop around for courses that appeal to them. Yassin hopes the platform can bring some predictability to consumers who are interested in signing up for online courses, but are wary of scams and half-baked offerings. &#8220;This market needs to have some trusted brands and quality assurances,&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> he says.</span></p>
<p>At the moment, a good chunk of the courses skew towards the business of online influence, with classes on video editing, content marketing and entrepreneurship. It&#8217;s also a pretty wide range of price points with costs for courses live on the platform now ranging from $29 to $499. Users can also pay for a bundle of courses, and Yassin says the platform has plans for a subscription offering down the road.</p>
<p>Nas Academy will monetize by taking a cut of these revenues, which may vary a bit, especially right now as the platform is invite-only for creators. As the platform opens up further, Yassin wants it to be a way for creators to find new audiences too. Course operators will have access to emails of their audience and be able to reach out to them directly outside the platform if they so desire.</p>
<p>Investors have been increasingly signing on to back startups building products in the creator economy vertical, especially in the past year. Creator platform Patreon recently raised at a $4 billion valuation. Yassin sees a massive opportunity in not only facilitating closer relationships between creators and fans but serving as an on-ramp for aspiring creators coming to their platform to learn.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think there are another 100,000 creators who will never get asked to make a Masterclass,&#8221; Yassin tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Internet skills are low in supply and high in demand.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zero Motorcycles has been around for over a decade and in that time it’s consistently improved its fleet of electric bikes. With the new FXE, the northern California company has taken the thoroughly enjoyable FXS supermoto and transformed it into something a bit more futuristic looking with a new easier-to-parse display.</p>
<p>The FXE likely isn’t a great pick for two-wheeled beginners or for folks that want a weekend cruiser, but for the experienced rider who needs a daily commuter that packs agility and power into a fun package, the 100-mile range FXE might be the best way to get to and from work. Watch our first ride video for the full story.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the past year, many of the conversations around autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been dominated by the same question: When will self-driving cars be the norm on public roads?</p>
<p>While industry leaders talked a big game on AVs monopolizing our roads <a href="https://mashable.com/article/autonomous-car-timeline-and-tech">back in 2016</a>, today some experts have put widespread <a href="http://workofthefuture.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-Research-Brief-Leonard-Mindell-Stayton3.pdf">Level 4 adoption over a decade away</a>. However, even that timeline only works if automakers overcome significant barriers — both technical and behavioral. The challenge of bringing AVs to consumers will be tougher than anticipated, with a central part of the effort being focused on earning the public’s trust.</p>
<p>Consumer confidence and mass adoption of AVs go hand in hand. To meet the projected timelines and start building this critical trust today, automakers should accelerate the adoption of autonomous capabilities into advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The challenges facing current ADAS technologies</h2>
<p>The truth is that consumers do not yet trust the ADAS capabilities in their vehicles. A 2021 <a href="https://aaafoundation.org/users-trust-in-and-concerns-about-automated-driving-systems/">AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety survey</a> found that 80% of drivers wanted current vehicle safety systems, like automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping assistance, to work better, noting the lack of confidence consumers feel around current offerings.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			While consumers seem to be aware that AV technologies are advancing quickly, this lack of trust from users will be a major barrier to full adoption and can pose a threat to the industry — no matter how far along the technology develops.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Despite significant recent advancements in the industry, including announcements from Cruise <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M387/K064/387064893.PDF">gaining permission</a> to give rides in driverless test vehicles to passengers in California, AAA <a href="https://aaafoundation.org/users-trust-in-and-concerns-about-automated-driving-systems/">studies</a> indicate that still only one in 10 drivers would be comfortable riding in a self-driving car. While consumers seem to be aware that AV technologies are advancing quickly, this lack of trust from users will be a major barrier to full adoption and can pose a threat to the industry — no matter how far along the technology develops.</p>
<p>To aid in building the public’s confidence, the industry must focus today on more advanced and reliable ADAS to meet consumer demands. However, current offerings face major challenges that must be resolved before the majority of consumers will get on board:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lack of reliability in common adverse conditions: </strong>Technologies including lidar and camera are limited to what they can “see” around them. These systems can be easily obstructed by snow, dirt and debris covering the vehicle’s sensors. Additionally, without clear, crisp lane markings — in the event of snow, heavy rainfall or off-road conditions — or strong GPS signals, the typical sensors tracking vehicle location will not function properly.</li>
<li><strong>Poor detection: </strong>There have been several cases where ADAS technologies have been unable to detect degraded lane markings, pedestrians, other vehicles or common on-road objects, resulting in injury and even death for drivers and pedestrians.</li>
<li><strong>Low understanding by the general public: </strong>While some ADAS features are designed to operate independently, there is still a consistent lack of public knowledge when it comes to understanding how to best utilize the systems’ abilities to maximize safety. This lack of awareness poses an unnecessary threat to drivers who inadvertently misuse the technology as well as to those with whom they share the roads.</li>
</ol>
<p>Addressing these challenges and creating better automated driving experiences for consumers is a critical step to mass adoption of future AV technology. The most immediate opportunity to move the needle with consumer acceptance in this area is to target improving reliability and user experience — especially with dynamic vehicle safety systems. To do so, automated and autonomous vehicles need improved sensors and software that enhance today’s systems and, as a result, boost consumer confidence in the safety of automated capabilities.</p>
<h2>A fresh perspective on vehicle positioning</h2>
<p>In the last decade, the industry has made various advancements in positioning systems, which locate a vehicle to the centimeter on roadways and are critical additions to traditional hardware stacks. As a result, experts have been placing bets on technologies such as ground-penetrating radar and novel mapping techniques as the final missing piece to robust vehicle positioning due to their ability to operate in adverse driving conditions and navigate highly dynamic environments.</p>
<p>While it is clear there are different avenues AVs can take to increase their reliability on the road, automakers are still trying to determine which approach can unlock the change in performance required for broad adoption.</p>
<p>When taking a closer look at the differentiators that make these technologies stand out, a common thread is how they address three critical issues: the absence of roadside features such as on open highways, within parking lots or when a car is boxed in by trucks and vision is limited; the reliance of camera-based systems on clear, consistent lane markings; and quickly changing environments in which the scene on the surface looks different from one moment to the next and HD maps quickly become unusable. These common challenges have left consumers frustrated with inconsistent and unreliable ADAS features.</p>
<p>One way to overcome these critical gaps is to explore other avenues for reliable vehicle positioning such as ground-penetrating radar — which allows vehicles to determine their precise location in adverse weather or in rough terrain, amid poor GPS availability and other common barriers faced by automated systems today — to show improved autonomy is possible. By adding these novel approaches into vehicles, automakers can create more reliable and accurate ADAS features — safeguarding the automated driving experience.</p>
<h2>Leaning on ADAS as a vehicle for consumer confidence and mass AV adoption</h2>
<p>A recent study from Partners for Automated Vehicle Education (PAVE) found that consumers familiar with ADAS technology were more likely to feel positive about autonomous cars and that 75% who currently own a vehicle with ADAS features say they are excited about future safety technology. This shows consumer engagement in today’s ADAS features can lead to more positive attitudes on tomorrow’s AV adoption.</p>
<p>As an industry, where do we go from here? Many are finding that there is a unique opportunity to resolve the future issues of autonomous vehicle operations by attacking them head-on in present-day ADAS systems &#8212; where they will otherwise be a future problem that will block mass adoption.</p>
<p>We need to address these critical issues with ADAS technologies and create better driving experiences to earn the public&#8217;s trust. By using higher-performing ADAS as a pathway to mass AV adoption, we can arrive at the destination safely.</p>
<p>The industry, along with consumers, can build a safe autonomous future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electrify America, the entity set up by Volkswagen as part of its settlement with U.S. regulators over its diesel emissions cheating scandal, said it will double the number of its electric vehicle fast charging stations in the United States and Canada by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The commitment, if successful, means 1,800 fast charging stations — or 10,000 individual chargers — will be installed and operational by that time. The vast majority (some 1,700 stations) will be installed in the United States, with the remainder in Canada. This will build off of EA&#8217;s plans to have about 800 charging stations and about 3,500 individual chargers in the U.S. by the end of 2021. As of today, Electrify America has installed 635 charging stations in the United States.</p>
<p>The plan is part of parent company VW Group&#8217;s announcement Monday to increase public charging infrastructure in North America, Asia and Europe. The expansion aims to increase the number of 150 and 350 kilowatt chargers, or fast chargers. VW nor EA disclosed how much money would be spent to meet this new plan. However, an EA spokesperson did confirm that the company would be spending more than the $2 billion it previously committed to invest into clean energy infrastructure over a 10-year period that kicked off in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The decision to double its charging infrastructure in North America was prompted by the rapid growth expected of electric vehicles by virtually all the auto manufacturers, according to a statement by Electrify America president and CEO Giovanni Palazzo.</p>
<p>The EV market was once the primary domain of Tesla, the Nissan Leaf and GM&#8217;s Chevrolet Bolt EV. And while the majority of vehicles on the road today are gas- and diesel-powered, an increasing number of other EV models have, or are about to, come to market, including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Porsche Taycan and the Cross Turismo variant, Hyundai Kona Electric, Jaguar I-Pace, Rivian R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV and the VW ID. 4.</p>
<p>Electrify America&#8217;s initial plan was to invest more than $2 billion into clean energy infrastructure and education over a 10-year period. Of that funding, some $800 million was earmarked for California, the largest EV market in North America. This latest boost will be used to increase chargers in established EV regions in the U.S., such as California, as well as push into new states, including Hawaii, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wyoming and Vermont.</p>
<p>The company is also adding chargers to a stretch of highway in the upper Midwest, following similar efforts to promote cross-country travel. The subsidiary Electrify Canada will expand its network to nine provinces, including Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Electrify Canada will also add more stations to British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, the four provinces where it already has a presence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The addition of MagSafe to the iPhone 12 line introduced all manner of fun avenues for accessory makers, but there’s a strong case (so to speak) to be made that a snap-on battery pack might be the most useful of all. A number of third-parties (notably Anker and Mophie) have introduced their own versions, and now <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJWY3AM/A/magsafe-battery-pack">Apple’s getting in on the action</a>.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2176873,2176872,2176871,2176870"]</p>
<p>The simply named MagSafe Battery Pack went up for pre-order on Apple’s site today for $99, with an estimated arrival of July 19. The new pack comes in white (with a subtly gray Apple logo on the back to let people know you went first-party) and provides up to 15W of wireless charging, per the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other details are scarce at the moment, including precisely how many phone charges you’ll get out of the pack. Eagle-eyed viewers noticed on the rear of the device, fine-print noting the 1,460 mAh size. The pack itself charges via Lightning port, and users can plug it in with the phone attached to get a quicker charge to both the pack and battery at once.</p>
<p>The price is a premium, compared to Anker and Mophie’s products, which run around the $45-50 range for a 5,000 mAh battery.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There’s a reason startup compensation packages usually include equity, or stock options. For one, it’s a way for startups to remain competitive in the job market and attract top talent. But it’s also a way to reward those employees who join early and give them a tangible reason to stay incentivized to grow the company.</p>
<p>The problem is that while many employees do understand that their equity compensation could mean a big payday in the future — and, in 2021, that’s more likely than ever — they don’t often understand the inevitable complexities of their stock options. That puts employees at risk of not getting the most value after an IPO or, worse, losing them.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever been confused about your equity, or haven’t thought much about it, you’re not alone. That’s why I’m going to share three things all employees joining a startup should do with their equity:</p>

<p>While many startups are getting better at proactively communicating the value of your equity package upfront, some are still figuring out the best way to do it. That’s because, unlike the more straightforward number of a salary, stock options are more nuanced — they’re a living, breathing type of compensation.</p>
<p>The most important pieces of information to pay attention to are your 409A valuation, your strike price, the type of options you were granted and the preferred share price.</p>
<p>The 409A valuation is based on your company’s valuation. This is also referred to as the fair market value (FMV). The 409A valuation can, and does, often change &#8212; they have to be updated at least once a year by a third-party valuator in order to meet tax rules. The 409A also changes during a fundraising event. Investors involved in the funding round determine how they value the company and are given options, at that valuation, in exchange for cash.</p>

<p>Since the company has now been valued higher, the 409A changes for everyone. It’s also possible for the 409A to go down if, for any reason, the company is now valued at a lower amount. This is known as a “down round.” Airbnb had a notable down round during the pandemic, though it eventually recovered and went public.</p>
<p>Your strike price is the price at which you can buy your stock options (also known as exercising). Yes, buy. You are given the option to buy them, which is why they are called stock options. But know that your strike price will likely never change. However, if you’re ever given more stock options (perhaps as a future bonus), this would be a separate grant and the strike price could be different. Companies are legally required to issue stock options at the most recent 409A price (or higher).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
