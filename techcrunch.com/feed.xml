										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.anybotics.com">ANYbotics</a>, the creators of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/27/watch-the-anymal-quadrupedal-robot-go-for-an-adventure-in-the-sewers-of-zurich/">ANYmal</a>, a four-legged autonomous robot platform intended for a variety of industrial uses, has raised a $22.3M Swiss Franc (~$20M) round A to continue developing and scaling the business. With similar robots just beginning to break into the mainstream, the market seems ready to take off.</p>
<p>The company spun out of ETH Zurich in 2016, at which point the robot was already well into development. ANYmal is superficially similar to Spot, the familiar quadrupedal robot from Boston Dynamics, but the comparison mustn&#8217;t be taken too far. A four-legged robot is a natural form for navigating and interacting with environments build for humans.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/anybotics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="anybotics">ANYbotics <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is on the third generation of the robot, which has progressively integrated computing units and sensors of increasing sophistication.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our current ANYmal C model features three built-in high-end Intel i7 computers that power the robot and customer-applications such as automated inspection tasks,&#8221; explained co-founder and CEO Péter Fankhauser in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;The availability of smaller and more performant sensors, propelled by AR/VR and autonomous driving applications, has enabled us to equip the latest ANYmal model with 360-degree situational awareness and long-range scanning capabilities. Where commercially available components are not satisfactory, we invest in our proprietary technologies, which have resulted in core components such as custom motors, docking stations, and inspection payload units.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8S51kw1MUY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/27/watch-the-anymal-quadrupedal-robot-go-for-an-adventure-in-the-sewers-of-zurich/">Watch the ANYmal quadrupedal robot go for an adventure in the sewers of Zurich</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Watch the ANYmal quadrupedal robot go for an adventure in the sewers of Zurich&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/27/watch-the-anymal-quadrupedal-robot-go-for-an-adventure-in-the-sewers-of-zurich/embed/#?secret=8S51kw1MUY" data-secret="8S51kw1MUY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The most obvious application for robots like ANYmal is inspection of facilities that would normally involve a human. If a robot can traverse the same paths, climb stairs, open doors and so on, it can do so more frequently and regularly than its human counterparts, who tire and take breaks. It can also monitor and relay its surroundings in detail, using lidar and RGB cameras, among other tools. Humans can then perform the more difficult (and human) work of integrating that information and making decisions based on it. An ANYmal at a factory, power plant, or datacenter could save costs and shoe leather.</p>
<p>Of course, that&#8217;s no use if the bot is fragile; fortunately, that&#8217;s not the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of mobility, we have focused on what matters most to our industrial customers: Operational reliability and robustness to harsh environmental conditions,&#8221; Fankhauser said. &#8220;For example, we design and test ANYmal for day and night usage in indoor and outdoor locations, including offshore platforms with salty air and large temperature ranges. It&#8217;s less about agility in these environments but more about reliably and safely performing the tasks multiple times a day over many months without human intervention.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MK2sOahdsIQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Swisscom Ventures leads the round, and partner Alexander Schläpfer said that good roots (ETHZ is of course highly respected) and good results from early commercial partnerships more than justified their investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over ten years ago, some of our co-founders developed their first walking robots during their studies at ETH Zurich,&#8221; said Fankhauser. &#8220;Today, the industries are ready to adopt this technology, and we are deploying our robots to our early customers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital health startup Everlywell has raised a $175 million Series D funding round, following relatively fast on the heels of a $25 million Series C round it closed in February of this year. The Series D included a host of new investors, including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/blackrock" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="blackrock">BlackRock, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> The Chernin Group (TCG), Foresite Capital, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/greenspring-associates" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="greenspring-associates">Greenspring Associates, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Morningside Ventures and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/portfolio-2cf9" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="portfolio-2cf9">Portfolio, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> along with existing investors including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/highland-capital-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="highland-capital-partners">Highland Capital Partners, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which led the Series C round. The startup has now raised over $250 million to date.</p>
<p>Everlywell, which launched to the public at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016 as a participant in Startup Battlefield, specializes in home health care, and specifically on home health care tests supported by their digital platform for providing customers with their results and helping them understand the diagnostics, and how to seek the right follow-on care and expert medical advice.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Everlywell launched an at-home COVID-19 test collection kit – the first of this type of test to receive an emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its use that allowed cooperation with multiple lab service providers over time. The COVID-19 test kit joins its many other offerings, which include tests for thyroid hormone levels, food and allergen sensitivity, women&#8217;s health and fertility, vitamin D deficiency and more. I spoke to Everlywell CEO and founder Julia Cheek about the raise, and she acknowledged that the COVID-19 pandemic was definitely behind the decision to raise such a large amount so quickly again after the close of the Series C, since the company saw a sharp increase in demand coming out of the coronavirus crisis – not only for its COVID-19 test kit, but for at-home digital health care options in general.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Everlywell gains first FDA authorization for a standalone, at-home, COVID-19 test sample collection kit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/16/everylwell-gains-first-fda-authorization-for-a-standalone-at-home-covid-19-test-sample-collection-kit/embed/#?secret=dnlQCHdl83" data-secret="dnlQCHdl83" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We obviously have a very successful COVID-19 test,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve also seen three-fourths of our test menu just explode at well over 100% year-over-year growth, and several of our tests are at 4x or 5x growth. That is really representative of this shift in consumer health behavior that will continue in a big way in many different verticals that include testing, and making things more convenient, digitally-enabled, and in the home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like other companies built on solving for a shift to more remote and virtual care options, Cheek said that Everlywell had already anticipated this kind of consumer demand – but COVID-19 has dramatically accelerated the pace of change, which is why the startup put together this round, at this size, this quickly (she says they started the process of putting together the Series D just in September).</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been talking about the digital health movement, and the consumer-directed movement probably for a decade now,&#8221; she told me. &#8220;I do believe that this will be the watershed moment, unfortunately. But hopefully, we will come out on the other side of the pandemic and say, &#8216;There are some good things that happened broadly for healthcare.&#8217; That is the hope of what we lean into everyday, and  fundamentally, why we went out and raised this amount of capital in this tremendous growth year.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everlywell has also expanded availability of its products this year, with distribution in over 10,000 retail locations across <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/target" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="target">Target, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Walgreens, CVS and Kroger stores across the U.S. The company also landed a number of new partnerships on the diagnostic lab and insurance payer side, as well as with major employers – a key customer group since employers shoulder the largest share of healthcare spending in the U.S. due to employee benefit plans. Cheek says that despite their commercial and enterprise customer wins, the focus remains squarely on consumer satisfaction, which is what distinguishes their offering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our COVID-19 test is 75% new people buying our product, and it has an NPS [net promoter score] of 75,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And then it&#8217;s the most highly-referred product, and also one of our top tests where people buy other tests. Experience matters here – we know that if someone is a promoter of Everlywell, if they rate us a nine or a 10, on NPS, they are five times more likely to purchase again on the platform.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KrUca7Ueg3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/everlywell-brings-lab-tests-home-personalized-health-data-online/">EverlyWell brings lab tests home, personalized health data online</a></p></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s not new for Everlywell, according to Cheek – customers have always had a high degree of satisfaction with the company&#8217;s products. But what is new is the expanded reach, and the realization among many Americans that virtual care and at-home options are available, and are effective.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you have is this lightbulb moment for Americans in a new way that care can be delivered where then they definitely don&#8217;t want to go back,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just for Everlywell. This is all of these verticals, that have really shifted consumer behavior around healthcare in the home, and I think that will be somewhat permanent. That is the main driver here, and is what we&#8217;re seeing, and it&#8217;s why Everlywell has resonated so well with so many Americans.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Realizing that modern, complex businesses can no longer be adequately managed using spreadsheet-style programs, the founders of <a href="https://gopigment.com/">Pigment</a> decided there had to be a better solution. Their business forecasting platform has now raised a substantial Series A of $25.9 million, led by Blossom Capital. Also participating was New York-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/firstmark-capital-2135">FirstMark Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/frst-d3d4">Frst</a>, as well as angel investors including Paul Melchiorre, former CEO of business planning giant Anaplan, and David Clarke, the ex-CTO of Workday, another business planning incumbent.</p>
<p>Those last two investors are significant because Paris-based Pigment <em>competes</em> with both Anaplan and Workday. Also of note is the fact that another planning product, Adaptive Insights, was sold to Workday for $1.6bn.</p>
<p>Pigment has so far secured large-scale enterprise and pre-IPO start-up clients for its beta product, including a major European bank &#8211; although it declines to name any of its clients so far.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pigment says it aims to overhaul the painful experience of using error-prone spreadsheets and inflexible software to do business forecast forecasting, instead presenting a dashboard-like approach in real-time through charts, simulations and continuous modeling.</p>
<p>Eléonore Crespo, co-founder and co-CEO of Pigment said in a statement: &#8220;We’re a bit like Minecraft for business strategy – with that kind of creative, organic potential for the user. Standard planning solutions are basically mechanical, treating a business like a machine with levers that you just push and pull.”</p>
<p>Ophelia Brown, partner at Blossom Capital, said: ‘Existing planning software was built around 20th-century models of how to do business. Pigment is a 21-st century platform that reflects the way successful companies need to work today – socially and environmentally conscious, proactively scanning the horizon for risks and opportunities, and capable of unlocking new opportunities in an increasingly complex and uncertain world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pigment was founded in 2019 by Crespo, a former data analyst at Google and investor at Index Ventures, and Romain Niccoli, the former CTO and co-founder of Criteo – the ad-tech company which IPO’d on NASDAQ in 2013.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">San Francisco-based construction startup Versatile is announcing today that it has raised a $20 million Series A. The round was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/insight-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="insight-partners">Insight Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Entree Capital, along with existing investors Robert Bosch Venture Capital GmbH, Root Ventures and Conductive Ventures.</p>
<p>The round follows $8.5 million in funding, including a $5.5 million seed round that arrived in August of last year.</p>
<p>The URBAN-X accelerator alum has developed a piece of hardware designed to be mounted to a crane. From that vantage point, it’s capable of capturing and analyzing data across the construction site.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;You can only improve what you can measure, and at Versatile we are just scratching the surface of what we can do to create value for our users and use data to turn job sites into controlled manufacturing with fast feedback loops,” co-founder and CEO Meirav Oren said in a release tied to the news.</p>
<p>The company says it’s able to use that information to provide a picture of construction progress, with additional information on site materials, while targeting any potential redundancy in the space.</p>
<p>With around $10 trillion currently spent on construction each year, the industry is prime for some big-ticket investments. Particularly those startups that can promise more efficiency in the space.</p>
<p>The company says the round will be spent on accelerating the availability of its technology and developing additional AI components for users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.bizay.co.uk">Bizay</a>, a marketplace for small-to-medium-sized businesses allowing them to create highly customized products (such as merchandise), has raised a $38.6 million (€32 million) funding round. The Series C financing round was co-led by investors <a href="https://www.indicocapital.com/">Indico Capital</a> and the European Investment Bank, with “strong support&#8221; from <a href="https://iberiscapital.com/">Iberis Capital</a> and existing investors including <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/leadx-capital-partners">LeadX Capital Partners</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/omnes-capital">Omnes Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pathena">Pathena</a>.</p>
<p>This means Bizay has now raised a total of more than €54 million. The company previously raised a Series B financing round of €22 million. This new round will accelerate the development of further product expansion targeted at SMBs and reinforce Bizay´s operation supplying more than one million SMBs in 21 countries across Europe and America.</p>
<p>Bizay’s ideas is to become the &#8216;<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon&#8217; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for SMBs in terms of merchandising, packaging, consumables, business essentials, decorations and uniforms, with good quality, at a fraction of the normal costs associated with these items.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bizay´s CEO, José Salgado, said: “The current health crisis accelerated the shift to online ordering of customizable products at reduced prices. Our platform will be a key facilitator for businesses to recover at a faster pace. We are totally confident in achieving the goals that will allow us to enter a new level of global ambition”.</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch Salgado added: &#8220;We are a software company, and our technology enables us to connect to industrial manufacturers that would usually work only for large corporations. We have no stock, we have no machines,  no production. Using AI we aggregate multiple orders, and supply those orders using the network of industrial producers that we have in our marketplace. So we are able to offer these SMBs competitive prices for small individual orders. These industrial manufacturers would never normally supply SMBs because they are just too small.”</p>
<p>Stephan Morais, Managing General Partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/indico-capital-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="indico-capital-partners">Indico Capital Partners, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said: “Bizay is entering a new growth phase and this round will consolidate their presence across Europe and enable them to capture the opportunity that stems from the shift towards online ordering of personalized products for SMBs.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ultimate.ai">Ultimate.ai</a>, a virtual customer service agent builder, has closed a $20 million Series A round of funding, led by Omers Ventures with participation from Felicis Ventures and existing investors HV Capital, and <a href="http://maki.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://maki.vc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606895197617000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGmQSIWL-KZxtvA5JCNL0EhZ-yLPw">Maki.vc</a> &#8212; bringing its total raised to date to $25M+.</p>
<p>The European startup&#8217;s flagship claim for the data-ingesting bot-builder platform is it&#8217;s capable of automating up to 80% of customer support interactions.</p>
<p>The focus, as tends to be the case for all these customer service conversational <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ai">AI <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> plays, is freeing (human) support agents from dealing with dull, repetitive stuff &#8212; so they can apply their (less limited) skills to more complex, consultative or emotionally demanding customer queries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When we last spoke to the Helsinki- and Berlin-based startup, back in 2018 for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/18/ultimate-ai-nabs-1-3m-for-a-customer-service-ai-focused-on-non-english-markets/">$1.3M seed round</a>, it described itself as a &#8220;language-agnostic&#8221; conversational AI &#8212; having started out with the hard (linguistic) challenge of Finnish &#8212; claiming that gave it an edge in a competitive space with customers in non-English speaking markets. (Though it did also tackle English too.)</p>
<p>Two years on the startup&#8217;s marketing focus is broader; today it talks about its customer service automation platform as an &#8220;AI-first&#8221; &#8216;no code&#8217; tool &#8212; sating it wants to empower b2c users to get the most out of AI by helping them design virtual agents that can usefully handle complex customer interactions.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ultimate-ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ultimate-ai">ultimate.ai <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will hand-hold you through the process of building a super savvy customer service robot, is the pitch.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Reetu Kainulainen claims it&#8217;s always been &#8220;no code and intuitive&#8221; &#8212; though there&#8217;s now a handy reference label to align what it&#8217;s doing with a wider b2b trend. (&#8216;No code&#8217; or &#8216;low code&#8217; referring to a digital tool-building movement that aims to widen access to powerful technologies like AI without the need for the user to possess deep technical know-how in order to make useful use of them.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tracking the growth of low-code, no-code startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/tracking-the-growth-of-low-code-no-code-startups/embed/#?secret=I01kYRPTFj" data-secret="I01kYRPTFj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything we build is to guide users to creating the best virtual agents. The whole user journey &#8212; discovery, design, expansion &#8212; is all within <a href="http://ultimate.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ultimate.ai/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606934261526000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH8YqXViWtZ2iT80srV7JjLdUt1BA">ultimate.ai</a>,&#8221; Kainulainen tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past two years, we have been laser focused on building a very deep customer service automation platform &#8212; one that goes beyond simple FAQ answers in chat &#8212; and enables brands to design complex, personalized workflows that can be deployed across all digital support channels.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that customer service automation will be its own category in the future and so we are working hard to define what that means today.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an example, Kainulainen points to &#8220;one click&#8221; integration with &#8220;any major CRM&#8221; (including Salesforce and Zendesk) &#8212; which lets customers quickly import existing customer support logs so ultimate.ai&#8217;s platform can analyze the data to help them build a useful bot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Immediately, you are shown a breakdown of your most common customer service cases and the impact automation can have for your business,&#8221; he goes on, saying the platform shows templates and &#8220;best practices&#8221; to help the customer design their automation workflows &#8212; &#8220;tailored for your cases and industry&#8221;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once a virtual agent is live users can run A/B tests via the platform to check and optimize performance &#8212; and, here too, the promise is further hand-holding, with Kainulainen saying it will &#8220;proactively suggests new cases and data to improve your virtual agent&#8221;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Where we are very strong is in large-scale customer support organizations, who are looking for a holistic, advanced automation platform that can be managed and implemented by non-technical users,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The bigger picture is that each of our competitors views the opportunity more narrowly than <a href="http://ultimate.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ultimate.ai/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606934261526000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH8YqXViWtZ2iT80srV7JjLdUt1BA">ultimate.ai</a> does: Our best competitors are either focused on chatbots only, or otherwise limited to the ecosystem of their mother company. Our vision has always been the big picture: Of automation becoming one of the primary means of providing customer service.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Having multilingual smarts remains an advantage, with ultimate.ai&#8217;s virtual agents able to handle interactions in over 20 languages at this point.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Our market &#8212; the customer service automation market &#8212; has a lot of players,&#8221; Kainulainen goes on, name-checking the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/ada-nets-19-million-series-a-to-grow-its-customer-service-chatbot/">Ada Support</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/28/salesforce-makes-some-einstein-ai-algorithms-available-to-third-party-developers/">Einstein Bots</a> (Salesforce’s own solution) as key competitors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;This is because it is new and, until recently, solutions were so early that there were virtually no barriers to entry. But the market has changed a lot in the last four years. There are now only a handful of players globally that are worth paying attention to and we are one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 2016-founded startup is hitting the nail on the head for a growing number of customers &#8212; with close to 100 signed up to its platform at this point, including the likes of Deezer, Telia, Footasylum, and Finnair. Per Kainulainen, it works best for &#8220;b2c brands with large (and often repetitive) customer service volumes&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is where automation can provide a huge impact from day one and really free up people to take on more creative and challenging work. We have a broad customer base of close to 100 great brands&#8230; and do particularly well in industries like retail/ecommerce, telecommunications and travel,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s enjoyed a major growth spurt this year, as businesses of all stripes were forced to ramp up their attention to online customer interactions as the coronavirus pandemic became an engine for digital activity.</p>
<p>Customer retention has also risen in priority for many businesses, as a highly contagious virus and public health safety measures put in place to reduce its spread, flipped markets into recession &#8212; which Kainulainen points to as another growth driver.</p>
<p>Overall, he says it&#8217;s tripled ARR over the last 12 months (albeit, it was the same growth story last year too). Plus it&#8217;s tripled headcount to deal with the COVID-19 effect.</p>
<p>Now ultimate.ai is gearing up for fresh growth &#8212; saying it&#8217;s expecting major developments next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;COVID-19 has&#8230; prompted one of the most accelerated periods of change in the customer service industry,&#8221; says Kainulainen, predicting 2021 will bring &#8220;immense innovation&#8221; in the space &#8212; and that &#8220;booming&#8221; automation technologies will take &#8220;center stage&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s a convenient narrative for a customer service chatbot maker to tell.</p>
<p>But COVID-19 is clearly accelerating digital transformation of consumer focused businesses &#8212; a movement that, logically, pumps demand for smarter tools to handle online customer support. So those positioned to harness new momentum for customer service automation &#8212; by being able to offer an accessible, scalable and effective product (as ultimate.ai claims it does) &#8212; are sitting pretty in the middle of a pandemic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We believe that the best product will win this market,&#8221; adds Kainulainen. &#8220;We have a big vision for what we want <a href="http://ultimate.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ultimate.ai/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606934261525000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQAmj-YBWsjt_0IRW7U5fUHRE1dA">ultimate.ai</a> to be. Market maturity for our technology has accelerated massively in 2020, achieving in one year what could have probably taken five. We will capitalize on that by building more, faster.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Series A funding will go on sales and marketing, with a planned market push in North America and a desire to go deeper throughout Europe, as well as being ploughed into further product development.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And while &#8212; clearly &#8212; not every potential b2c customer will be able to &#8216;automagic&#8217; away 80% of their customer support pings, Kainulainen argues ultimate.ai can still offer a compelling sales pitch to businesses with more &#8220;consultative&#8221; customer support needs, where automation will only be able to play a far more limited role.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;There&#8217;s often a strong correlation between how consultative a customer service organization needs to be and how highly trained and experienced their team is. In other words, it is often the case that organizations with ‘lower bound’ automation potential also only need 10% automation to still drive a huge ROI,&#8221; he suggests.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;For example, one of our customers is a large national pharmacy group, where customer service agents are qualified pharmacists who provide prescription medical advice. Here, the goal isn’t to achieve a very high automation rate but rather to automate basic, repetitive processes to free up the pharmacists for more challenging tasks that better use their capabilities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;For this customer, in addition to the automation of simple requests (which alone provides a huge value) our real-time answer recommendations help pharmacists respond faster and easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the Series A in a statement, Omers Ventures managing partner, Jambu Palaniappan, dubbed the startup&#8217;s growth &#8220;truly spectacular&#8221;, as well as lauding its &#8220;world-class team&#8221; and founders &#8220;with a strong vision and unrivalled knowledge of AI&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are numerous chatbot companies out there but ultimate.ai represents something much bigger because at its core is an automation company with massive potential,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We look forward to working with Sarah, Reetu, Jaakko, and Markus as they expand internationally and advance their deep product capabilities even further.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The customer service industry is undergoing an automation revolution. In ultimate.ai, we saw a vision that’s bold enough to lead the way,&#8221; added Aydin Senkut, founder and managing partner of Felicis Ventures, in another supporting statement. &#8220;We believe that, just in the same way that category leaders have defined marketing and sales automation, ultimate.ai will do the same for customer service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jambu Palaniappan, managing partner at Omers Ventures, will join the ultimate.ai board. Aydin Senkut, founder and managing partner of Felicis Ventures, will join as an investor, alongside former head of Airbnb for Business Mark McCabe, and former EVP global sales of payment giant Adyen, Thijn Lamers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/business/china-vaccine-diplomacy.html">pledged</a> that it would be sharing its COVID-19 vaccines with other countries, especially those with which it <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02807-2">has close ties</a>. While the country is not ready to deploy its vaccines internationally, it is gearing up the infrastructure for mass distribution.</p>
<p>This week, Alibaba&#8217;s logistics arm Cainiao, announced that it has struck a partnership with Ethiopian Airlines to introduce a cold chain capable of transporting temperature-sensitive medicines from China to the rest of the world. The air freight will depart from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shenzhen-eb7c" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shenzhen-eb7c">Shenzhen <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Airport, which Alibaba says houses China&#8217;s first cross-border medical cold chain facility, twice a week to countries via Dubai and Addis Ababa.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as the vaccines are ready, we will have the capabilities to transport them,&#8221; a Cainiao spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shenzhen is the home base of SF Express, another major logistics operator in China that has also been <a href="https://www.sf-express.com/cn/en/case_share/detail/SF-Pharmaceuticals-Made-New-Breakthroughs-in-Vaccine-Supply-Chain-End-to-end-Service-Mode-and-Cooperated-with-A-Vaccine-Benchmark-Enterprise/">working on storing and shipping vaccines</a>.</p>
<p>The route is carried out by Cainiao, which operates in over 200 countries and regions. It&#8217;s certified by the<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/cargo/pharma/ceiv-pharma/"> International Air Transport Association</a> <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">to fly Covid-19 vaccines, which normally need to be stored at low temperatures. Cabins will contain temperature-controlled monitors, for instance, and Ethiopia&#8217;s cargo terminal comes with facilities that can be adjusted between -23°C and 25°C, or -9.4°F and 77°F.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The launch of the cold chain air freight has further bolstered our global logistics capabilities and allow us to offer a one-stop solution for the global distribution of medical products such as the COVID-19 vaccines,&#8221; said James Zhao, general manager of Cainiao&#8217;s international supply chain unit.</p>
<p>China is a<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/china-dominates-the-pandemic-ppe-market-what-does-that-mean-for-u-s-as-virus-surges"> major exporter</a> of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic and the country&#8217;s logistics giants, from Cainiao to SF Express, all promptly introduced programs specifically for shipping medical relief items.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://websummit.com/">Web Summit </a>announced today that it will revive <a href="https://riseconf.com/">RISE</a>, one of Asia’s largest tech conferences, in March 2022, moving it to Kuala Lumpur after five years in Hong Kong. It also announced a new event, called Web Summit Tokyo, that will launch in 2022, too.</p>
<p>The flagship <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/the-summit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="the-summit">Web Summit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> event is currently taking place as an online conference.</p>
<p>In November 2019, Web Summit announced it was postponing RISE to 2021 amid the pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong. But the 2021 event won&#8217;t be held, with RISE resuming with its 2022 Kuala Lumpur event instead. Of course, this year has seen a series of other major event cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Web Summit is planning for the 2022 edition of RISE to be in-person, and has agreed to a three-year partnership with Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) to host the event.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Web Summit and RISE co-founder and chief executive officer Paddy Cosgrave said, &#8220;This is not a goodbye to Hong Kong. We hope to return to the city in the future with a brand new event.&#8221;</p>
<p>Web Summit Tokyo, which will take place in September 2022, as part of its global expansion, which will also include an event in Brazil Rio de Janeiro or Porto Alegre are currently being considered as the location.</p>
<p>Web Summit has already announced plans to hold its flagship event as an in-person conference in November 2021 in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://bolt.eu/en/">Bolt</a> is better known for its ride-hailing service. But the company also operates an <a href="https://bolt.eu/en/scooters/">electric scooter service</a> in 45 cities across Europe. Designed by the company’s in-house hardware team, the new model focuses on safety.</p>
<p>As you can see on the photo, it’s a big scooter that weighs 19kg — that’s more than an average bike. It has a battery with a 40km range and it is primarily made of aluminum.</p>
<p>The company says it should last up to 60 months thanks to a modular design. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mtakso" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mtakso">Bolt <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> can replace parts without having to replace the scooter altogether.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Behind the scenes, you’ll find built-in sensors to detect accidents and unsafe riding. If you fall or if you brake sharply, Bolt can be alerted. The scooter also recognizes unsafe riding patterns. Combined with audio and visual warnings, it should educate riders about what you’re supposed to do and not do.</p>
<p>On the integrated dashboard, you can receive alerts telling you that you’re riding in a pedestrian area, or in a low-speed area. You can also see if you’re allowed to park in this area. Bolt plans to turn on front light blinking when you enter a pedestrian or low-speed area.</p>
<p>Like most modern e-scooter models, Bolt can swap the battery without having to move the entire scooter. It is much more efficient to recharge detachable batteries than scooters themselves.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Bolt unveiled plans to double-down on scooters. It plans to operate a scooter service in more than 100 cities in 2021. There could be as many as 130,000 electric scooters and electric bikes in European cities. Let’s see if the company delivers on its ambitious 2021 roadmap.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/phonepe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="phonepe">PhonePe, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the crown jewel in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/20/walmart-flipkart-deal-done/">Flipkart’s acquisition by Walmart</a>, is &#8220;partially&#8221; spinning off, the Bangalore-based financial services firm said on Thursday. To kick off its new journey, the firm said it has secured $700 million in a new financing round.</p>
<p>This round, the name of which was not disclosed, was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/walmart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="walmart">Walmart <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from some existing investors, PhonePe said. The new round gave PhonePe, which was founded by three former <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/flipkart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="flipkart">Flipkart <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> employees, a post-money valuation of $5.5 billion.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement is a big boost to the confidence investors are showing on PhonePe. The startup had been engaging with investors for new capital for several quarters and, in at least one instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/google-and-walmarts-phonepe-establish-dominance-in-indias-mobile-payments-market-as-whatsapp-pay-struggles-to-launch/">struggled to raise funds at a $3 billion valuation earlier this year</a>, TechCrunch reported earlier. It had hoped to raise about $1 billion at a valuation as high as $10 billion last year, however, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The partial spin-off, which had been in the works for more than a year, means that Flipkart&#8217;s stake in PhonePe will reduce from 100% to 87%. &#8220;This partial spin-off gives PhonePe access to dedicated long-term capital to pursue our vision of providing financial inclusion to a billion Indians,&#8221; said Sameer Nigam, founder and chief executive of PhonePe, in a statement.</p>
<p>Flipkart will remain PhonePe’s majority shareholder, and the &#8220;two businesses will retain their close collaboration,&#8221; PhonePe said.</p>
<p>PhonePe, which means &#8220;on the phone&#8221; in Hindi, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/walmarts-phonepe-zips-past-google-pay-in-india-as-upi-tops-2-billion-monthly-transactions/">currently leads the mobile payments market in India</a>, by some metrics. In October, it surpassed Google Pay to become the top UPI payments app. UPI is a four-year-old payments infrastructure built by India’s largest banks. It is the most popular way people transact money digitally in India. PhonePe reported 835 million UPI transactions in October, ahead of Google Pay, which processed about 820 million transactions that month.</p>
<p>“As Flipkart Commerce continues to grow strongly serving the needs of Indian customers, we are excited at the future prospects of the group. This move will help PhonePe maximize its potential as it moves to the next phase of its development, and it will also maximize value creation for Flipkart and our shareholders,” said Kalyan Krishnamurthy, CEO of Flipkart Group, in a statement.</p>
<p>In a recent report to clients, analysts at Bernstein identified PhonePe as one of the startups in India that could file for an IPO in within three years. PhonePe&#8217;s &#8220;reliance on parent Flipkart has shrunk, from 50% of monthly transactions to less than 1% today. PhonePe was first to launch on UPI and has extended into new use cases including travel booking, bill payments, financial services etc. The company has also launched Switch which allows users to switch between PhonePe and other apps like food, grocery delivery etc. (Super App),&#8221; they wrote.</p>
<p>PhonePe, which has amassed over 100 million monthly active users, could look to expand outside of India, the analysts wrote in the report, which was obtained by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>PhonePe and Google Pay today also compete with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paytm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="paytm">Paytm, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which is backed by SoftBank and Alibaba. Paytm, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">privately valued at $16 billion last year when it raised $1 billion</a>, has shifted its attention to cater to merchants in recent quarters as UPI currently offers no way for companies to make any money on its platform.</p>
<p>At an event in Bangalore late last year, Sajith Sivanandan, managing director and business head of Google Pay and Next Billion User Initiatives, said current local rules in India have forced Google Pay to operate without a clear business model in the country.</p>
<p>If that wasn&#8217;t a challenge enough, WhatsApp, which is the most popular smartphone app in India with over 400 million users in the world&#8217;s second largest market, began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-receives-approval-to-expand-its-payments-service-in-india/">rolling out its payments service in the country last month</a>. At stake is India’s mobile payments market, which is estimated to reach $1 trillion by 2023, according to Credit Suisse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week I witnessed for myself how a new kind of robot really could — as sci-fi has been telling us for many years — create and serve us food. Today, <a href="https://karakuri.com/">Karakuri</a>, a food robotics startup, unveils its first automated canteen to make meals: the &#8220;DK-One” robot. It’s also revealing a $8.4 million (£6.3million) investment, led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/firstminute-capital">firstminute capital</a>, which includes funding from Hoxton Ventures, Taylor Brothers, Ocado Group and the UK’s government-backed Future Fund. It has now closed a total of £13.5m in funding.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/karakuri" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="karakuri">Karakuri’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> robotic system has been initially designed to make breakfast bowls. But the technology will end up being employed in a large array of scenarios, including restaurants, canteens, buffets, hotels and supermarkets. Posibly even tending vertical farms. It’s particular strength is in being able to create extremely tailor-made combinations of food, putting &#8216;personalized nutrition’ within practical reach. Remember those movies where the food is tailored by a robot? That.</p>
<p>The post-Covid world is also highly likely to embrace this technology due to the robot&#8217;s inherent cleanliness and efficiency, compared to human-made food. That said, Karakuri is not positioned to replace humans but to augment them, taking on the boring and repetitive tasks which typically see kitchen staff have far more itinerant careers due to the sheer pressure of low-level jobs where a robot would be far more suitable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The DK-One robot is Karakuri’s first pre-production machine which uses the latest in robotics, sensing and control technologies. It’s capable of creating high quality hot and cold meals, which maximize nutritional benefits, restaurant performance and minimize food waste.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Vesx0iFc5U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Post-COVID restrictions, further on-customer-site trials of the DK-One are expected to take place in the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>The DK-One robot zips around a circular enclosure at a rate of knots, each time measuring accurate portion sizes as determined by an app, where the customer can tailor to their tastes. It means anyone ordering something would be able to track the ingredients, nutrients, calories, and quantity of literally every meal.</p>
<p>Up to 18 ingredients can be dispensed per installation, with each ingredient temperature controlled. It will dispense of any ingredient type including wet, dry, soft, or hard food onto plates, bowls, or a range of meal containers</p>
<p>Because it’s so accurate it, therefore, reduces food waste around portions and allows for real-time data on ingredients. The thin margins restaurateurs typically have could be improved by using such a robot in repetitive tasks, and means employees can be tasked with more complex and fruitful and fulfilling work. It’s also easily integrated into existing commercial kitchens.</p>
<p>Barney Wragg, CEO and co-founder of Karakuri, said in a statement: “This will be the first time we can use a pre-production machine to demonstrate the DK-One’s commercial and nutritional benefits in the real world and thus demonstrate our vision for the future of food.”</p>
<p>Karakuri was founded by Simon Watt and Wragg, two longtime friends and colleagues who previously worked together at ARM. In April 2018 the Founders Factory venture studio invested in Karakuri and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/brent-hoberman" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="brent-hoberman">Brent Hoberman <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> joined the board as Chairman and is also listed as a co-founder.</p>

<p>The milestone came just five months after AutoX <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/autonomous-vehicle-startup-autox-lands-driverless-testing-permit-in-california/">landed a permit from California</a> to start driverless tests, following in the footsteps of Waymo and Nuro.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It also indicates that China wants to bring its smart driving industry on par with the U.S. Cities from Shenzhen to Shanghai are competing to attract autonomous driving upstarts by clearing regulatory hurdles, touting subsidies and putting up 5G infrastructure.</p>
<p>As a result, each city ends up with its own poster child in the space: AutoX and Deeproute.ai in Shenzhen, Pony.ai and WeRide in Guangzhou, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/momenta-ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="momenta-ai">Momenta <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in Suzhou, Baidu&#8217;s Apollo fleet in Beijing, to name a few. The autonomous driving companies, in turn, work closely with traditional carmakers to make their vehicles smarter and more suitable for future transportation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have obtained support from the local government. Shenzhen is making a lot of rapid progress on legislation for self-driving cars,&#8221; said the AutoX representative.</p>
<p>The decision to remove drivers from the front <em>and</em> operators from a remote center appears a bold move in one of China&#8217;s most populated cities. AutoX equips its vehicles with its proprietary vehicle control unit called XCU, which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/autox-and-fiat-chrysler-are-teaming-up-on-a-robotaxi-for-china/">claims</a> has faster processing speed and more computational capability to handle the complex road scenarios in China’s cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The XCU] provides multiple layers of redundancy to handle this kind of situation,&#8221; said AutoX when asked how its vehicles will respond should the machines ever go rogue.</p>
<p>The company also stressed the experience it learned from &#8220;millions of miles&#8221; driven in China&#8217;s densest city centers through its 100 robotaxis in the past few years. Its rivals are also aggressively accumulating mileage to train their self-driving algorithms while banking sizable investments to fund R&amp;D and pilot tests. AutoX itself, for instance, has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/autox-ac12">more than $160 million</a> to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The National Labor Relations Board today issued a complaint against <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> after investigating the firing of several employees last November. The complaint alleges Google violated parts of the National Labor Relations Act by surveilling employees, and generally interfered with, restrained and coerced employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed by <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/interfering-with-employee-rights-section-7-8a1">Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act</a>.</p>
<p>The NLRB also alleges Google discouraged &#8220;its employees from forming, joining, assisting a union or engaging in other protected, concerted activities,&#8221; the complaint states.</p>
<p>&#8220;This complaint makes clear that workers have the right to speak to issues of ethical business and the composition of management,&#8221; Laurence Berland, one of the fired Google employees, said in a statement. &#8220;This is a significant finding at a time when we’re seeing the power of a handful of tech billionaires consolidate control over our lives and our society. Workers have the right to speak out about and organize, as the NLRB is affirming, but we also know that we should not, and cannot, cleave off ethical concerns about the role management wants to play in that society.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ex-Googlers Berland and Kathryn Spiers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/fired-google-workers-will-file-federal-complaint-alleging-the-company-wrongfully-terminated-them/">previously filed a federal complaint with the NLRB arguing</a> Google fired them for organizing, which is a protected activity. They had organized around a variety of topics, including Google’s treatment of its temporary, vendor and contractor workers, Google’s alleged retaliation against employees who organized, the company’s work with Customs and Border Protection and more.</p>
<p>Additionally, in November 2019, Google put Rebecca Rivers and Berland on leave for allegedly violating company policies. At the time, Google said one had searched for and shared confidential documents that were not pertinent to their job, and one had looked at the individual calendars of some staffers. Following a protest in support of the two, Rivers, Berland, Duke and Waldman were fired.</p>
<div dir="ltr">
<div>&#8220;Google has always worked to support a culture of internal discussion, and we place immense trust in our employees,&#8221; a Google spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;Of course employees have protected labor rights that we strongly support, but we have always taken information security very seriously. We’re confident in our decision and legal position. Actions undertaken by the employees at issue were a serious violation of our policies and an unacceptable breach of a trusted responsibility.”</div>
</div>
<p>This comes shortly after the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3zav5/google-contractors-say-their-work-is-being-shipped-to-poland-after-unionizing">NLRB issued a formal complaint against Google contractor HCL</a>, alleging the company repeatedly violated the rights of unionized workers. Moving forward, Berland and Spiers are hoping the NLRB prosecutes the case against Google and seeks reinstatement and damages for them. But the next step is for the complaint to head to the desk of an administrative judge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are now about <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia">50 million people with dementia globally</a>, a number the World Health Organization expects to triple by 2050. Alzheimer’s is the leading cause of dementia and caregivers are often overwhelmed, without enough support.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.neuroglee.com/">Neuroglee</a>, a Singapore-based health tech startup, wants to help with a digital therapeutic platform created to treat patients in the early stages of the disease. Founded this year to focus on neurodegenerative diseases, Neuroglee announced today it has raised $2.3 million in pre-seed funding.</p>
<p>The round was led by Eisai Co., one of Japan’s largest pharmaceutical companies, and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/kuldeep-singh-rajput" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="kuldeep-singh-rajput">Kuldeep Singh Rajput, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the founder and chief executive officer of predictive healthcare startup Biofourmis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Neuroglee’s prescription digital therapy software for Alzheimer’s, called NG-001, is its main product. The company plans to start clinical trials next year. NG-001 is meant to complement medication and other treatments, and once it is prescribed by a clinician, patients can access its cognitive exercises and tasks through a tablet.</p>
<p>Neuroglee founder and CEO Aniket Singh Rajput (brother of Kuldeep) told TechCrunch that its first target markets for NG-001 are the United States and Singapore, followed by Japan. NG-001 needs to gain regulatory approval in each country, and it will start by seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance.</p>
<p>Once it launches, clinicians will have two ways to prescribe NG-001, through their healthcare provider platform or an electronic prescription tool. A platform called Neuroglee Connect will give clinicians, caregivers and patients access to support and features for reimbursement and coverage.</p>
<p>The software tracks patients’ progress, such as the speed of their fingers and the time it takes to complete an exercise, and delivers personalized treatment programs. It also has features to address the mental health of patients, including one that shows images that can bring up positive memories, which in turn can help alleviate depression and anxiety when used in tandem with other cognitive behavioral therapy techniques.</p>
<p>For caregivers and clinicians, NG-001 helps them track patient progress and their compliance with other treatments, like medications. This means that healthcare providers can work closely with patients even remotely, which is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is almost running out of AR/VR projects to kill off.</p>
<p>The company announced today in an email to <a href="https://poly.google.com/">Poly</a> users that they will be shutting down the 3D-object creation and library platform &#8220;forever&#8221; next year. The service will shut down on June 30, 2021 and users won&#8217;t be able to upload 3D models to the site starting April 30, 2021.</p>
<p>Poly was introduced as a 3D creation tool optimized for virtual reality. Users could easily create low-poly objects with in-VR tools. The software was designed to serve as a lightweight way to create and view 3D assets that could in turn end up in games and experiences, compared to more art and sculpting-focused VR tools like Google&#8217;s Tilt Brush and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (now Adobe&#8217;s) Medium software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google has already discontinued most of the company&#8217;s AR/VR plays, including most notably their Daydream mobile VR platform.</p>

<p>The AR/VR industry&#8217;s initial rise prompted plenty of 3D-centric startups to bet big on creating or hosting a library of digital objects. As investor enthusiasm has largely faded and tech platforms hosting AR/VR content have shuttered those products, it&#8217;s less clear where the market is for this 3D content for the time being.</p>
<p>Users that have uploaded objects to Poly will be able to download their data and models ahead of the shutdown.</p>

The co-viewing feature was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/hulu-launches-a-new-watch-party-feature-for-virtual-viewing-parties-and-chat/">introduced</a> during the earlier days of the pandemic in 2020, allowing Hulu users to watch shows together from different locations, as well as chat and react to what they&#8217;re watching in a group chat interface on the side of the screen.</p>
<p>Initially, the feature was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/hulu-launches-a-new-watch-party-feature-for-virtual-viewing-parties-and-chat/">only made available to Hulu&#8217;s &#8220;No Ads&#8221; subscribers</a> before being tested with Hulu&#8217;s ad-supported subscribers in a more limited capacity. To celebrate the Season 2 premiere of Hulu Original &#8220;Pen15,&#8221; the company had offered the Watch Party experience to its ad-supported customers for 10 days, starting on September 18.</p>
<p>In November, Hulu began testing the Watch Party feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/hulu-tests-its-social-viewing-feature-watch-party-with-election-news-live-streams/">with election news live streams</a> &#8212; the first time it had offered co-viewing with its live content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Today, Hulu says Watch Party is no longer in a &#8220;test&#8221; phase, and is now officially available to both sets of on-demand customers, including those on its commercial-free and ad-supported plans alike.</p>
<p>At launch, Watch Party works across thousands of on-demand titles from Hulu&#8217;s library. This includes not only Hulu&#8217;s own original content but also other licensed and broadcast programs like &#8220;The Golden Girls,&#8221; &#8220;This Is Us,&#8221; &#8220;Family Guy&#8221; and &#8220;The Bachelorette&#8221; &#8212; all of which Hulu said had been popular titles for Watch Party during the testing period.</p>
<p>To use Watch Party, you&#8217;ll look for the new Watch Party icon that appears on a title&#8217;s detail page on Hulu.com. This will provide a link that you can then share with up to seven other Hulu subscribers, age 18 or older. The experience doesn&#8217;t require a browser plugin, but works directly on the Hulu website itself.</p>
<p>As the program plays, users can chat and react with emoji in the group chat window, or even pause the viewing experience if they need to take a quick break. This won&#8217;t pause the stream for other viewers, as with some other co-watching experiences &#8212; instead, the user can rejoin the group and stay behind others or they can use a &#8220;Click to Catch Up&#8221; button in the chat window to get back in sync.</p>
<p>Co-watching has been a popular pandemic activity as people looked for ways to stay connected with friends and family when they couldn&#8217;t spend time in person. In addition to Hulu, Amazon Prime Video <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/amazon-prime-video-introduces-watch-party-a-social-coviewing-experience-included-with-prime/">launched</a> co-viewing and <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/twitch-watch-parties-amazon-prime-video-titles-1234576194/">Twitch launched </a>its own Watch Parties. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/scener-now-lets-you-co-watch-hbo-or-netflix-in-a-virtual-theater-with-up-to-20-people/">HBO teamed up with Scener</a>, Plex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/plex-launches-a-co-watching-experience-for-its-on-demand-library-and-users-personal-media/">launched</a> Watch Together and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/how-instagram-co-watching-works/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/facebook-introduces-a-co-viewing-experience-in-messenger-watch-together/">Facebook</a> rolled out co-viewing too. Netflix users still have to use third-party tools, however.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> traded lower today, despite the company hosting a multi-hour keynote that included a buffet of Marc Benioff.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on? Essentially, since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">the Salesforce-Slack deal</a> reached <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/">the ears of the public</a>, shares of the CRM giant have fallen, while shares of the enterprise social upstart have risen sharply.</p>
<p>That <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> did well since news of the deal broke is not a surprise. Salesforce is paying more for the company than it had been worth, the premium to its prior value constituting its argument that Slack&#8217;s investors should approve the deal. This is standard in corporate takeovers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AJ4OizvH0n"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/embed/#?secret=AJ4OizvH0n" data-secret="AJ4OizvH0n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But what to make of Salesforce&#8217;s value declines? Let&#8217;s first calculate how much ground the company has lost on the stock market.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened to Salesforce&#8217;s stock from November 25th, when the deal initially leaked during the day, to today. We&#8217;re calculating the daily change between the preceding day&#8217;s close and the listed day&#8217;s final price:</p>
<ul>
<li>November 25: -5.4% (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/">deal leaks midday</a>)</li>
<li>November 27: +0.33%</li>
<li>November 30: -0.74%</li>
<li>December 1: -1.8% (deal is announced after-hours)</li>
<li>December 2: -8.52%</li>
</ul>
<p>Salesforce saw its share price fall from around $264 before the deal became known to $220.78 at the end of regular trading today. The loss in value works out to 16.5%. From a different perspective, Salesforce lost around $18.7 billion in value today alone.</p>
<p>Those swings constitute a summary rejection of the deal by investors, I&#8217;d say, or of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-beats-growth-expectations-as-investors-digest-the-slack-acquisition/">Salesforce&#8217;s recently stated guidance</a>, which was inclusive of the deal. Salesforce has lost more value than the transaction is worth, which feels notable.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u0bFG4f7A1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-beats-growth-expectations-as-investors-digest-the-slack-acquisition/">Salesforce beats growth expectations as investors digest the Slack acquisition</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce beats growth expectations as investors digest the Slack acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-beats-growth-expectations-as-investors-digest-the-slack-acquisition/embed/#?secret=u0bFG4f7A1" data-secret="u0bFG4f7A1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>My gut says that investors are worried that Salesforce is overpaying for Slack, and that potential synergies between the two won&#8217;t amount to as much as the two companies&#8217; CEOs imagine. But I wanted to ask my colleague Ron Miller about the situation, to see if he could add anything to the <em>why isn&#8217;t Wall Street liking this combo more</em> question. Here is his take:</p>
<p>While Wall Street appears to be taking an initial dislike to the deal &#8212; it is a big gaudy number &#8212; over time I think they should come to understand it better. Slack will give Salesforce the social piece it has been longing for since the days of Enterprise 2.0. They initially tried to build it themselves with Chatter, but that never quite caught on. Ten years later, they finally have their social component.</p>
<p>Benioff&#8217;s instincts about what his company needs are usually on target, and while he may have overpaid for this bauble, the ability to tie his company&#8217;s products together under Slack&#8217;s communications and work integration umbrella proved too attractive to resist.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget in spite of the fact that Microsoft Teams is making headway, mostly by giving it away for free with Office 365 subscriptions, Slack remains the darling of the developer class. And as long as Salesforce finds a way for it to maintain its independence, the marriage could work out. At the very least, it deserves a chance to prove that it can.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce-Slack deal was officially announced</a> on Tuesday afternoon, and the number appeared, it was kind of hard to believe. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> had shelled out more than $27 billion to buy Slack and bring it into the Salesforce family of products. The company sees a key missing piece in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and that could explain why it was willing to spend such an astonishing amount of money to get it.</p>
<p>With Slack, Salesforce now has what CEO Marc Benioff called the interface to everything, something he says that the company has thought about for years. In 2010, they tried building it themselves with Chatter, a social tool that never really caught on in a big way. With Slack they finally have it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always had the vision of the social enterprise at Salesforce for more than a decade. Oh, we&#8217;ve had Dreamforces entirely dedicated to the vision of what a collaborative interface, a high production interface with applications and an ecosystem would look like wrapped on top of our Customer 360,&#8221; Benioff said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He added that ironically in a building right next door to Salesforce Park you&#8217;ll find Slack headquarters. They won&#8217;t have to go far to collaborate (or you know, they can just use Slack).</p>
<h2>From Chatter to Slack</h2>
<p>Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures, says that Benioff has had an interest in enterprise social going back years, and this is his way of finally delivering. &#8220;Remember Chatter? Benioff was dead on with this trend. He <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/25/its-official-microsoft-confirms-it-has-acquired-yammer-for-1-2-billion-in-cash/">lost Yammer to Microsoft</a> (when Microsoft acquired it for $1.2 billion) about 7-8 years ago, and then launched Chatter. It was a huge bet, but didn’t work. Slack is really Chatter 2.0,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Chuck Ganapathi, CEO and co-founder at Tact.ai, was product lead on the Chatter product at Salesforce in the 2009 time frame. He wrote in a soon-to-be-published blog post he shared with TechCrunch that it failed for a lot of reasons, but mostly because at its core, Salesforce was still a bunch of database guys and enterprise social was a very different animal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the issues were technical &#8212; Salesforce is a database-centric company, founded by Oracle alums on a relational DB foundation. DB applications and unstructured communication applications like Chatter or Slack represent completely different branches of computer science with little overlap,&#8221; he wrote. Because of that, he felt that they lacked the expertise to build the application correctly, and it never really caught on, with so many similar products in the market at the time.</p>
<p>But Benioff never lost interest in the concept of incorporating social into the Salesforce platform. It just took another 10 years or so and a bushel of money to make it happen.</p>
<h2>A good match or not?</h2>
<p>Leyla Seka, a partner at Operator Capital, who formerly ran the AppExchange at Salesforce, sees good things ahead with a combined Slack and Salesforce. &#8220;Salesforce and Slack together will offer a powerful duo of applications that will help companies work more effectively together. I think that COVID-19 has shown us how critical it is to get employees the data they need to do their job, but also the community they need to thrive at their job. The marriage of Salesforce and Slack promises to do just that,&#8221; Seka told me.</p>

<p>Brent Leary, principal analyst at CRM Essentials, was knocked out by the price tag, but says it shows that Salesforce is not afraid to go after what it wants, even if it has to pay a hefty price to get it. &#8220;This goes to show Salesforce has absolutely no fear in them when it comes to this deal. They are willing to throw down the big bucks on this acquisition because they see a huge payoff by adding this piece into their platform,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As for Slack, he sees it as a way for them to take the fast track to the enterprise big leagues. &#8220;And for Slack they go from competing with AMOSS (Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Salesforce) to joining one of them, and the company that really made the most sense for them to team up with,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Laurie McCabe, an analyst and founder at SMB Group, agrees with Leary&#8217;s take, saying Salesforce doesn&#8217;t hesitate when it thinks the value is there. &#8220;In this case, Slack gives them a strong collaboration offering that will help them compete more effectively against Microsoft’s growing cloud portfolio, which of course includes CRM and Teams,&#8221; she said.</p>
<h2>Show me the money</h2>
<p>Battery&#8217;s Agrawal believes this deal is all about generating revenue, and it was willing to pay a premium to move the needle in billion-dollar chunks. The end game he believes is about catching Microsoft, or at the very least getting to $1 trillion (with a T, folks) in market cap.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that investors are not showing signs, initially at least, of liking this deal, with the stock down over 8% today and 16.5% since the rumor of Salesforce&#8217;s interest in Slack surfaced last week before the Thanksgiving holiday. That translates into more than $18 billion in lost market cap &#8212; probably not the reaction they were hoping for. But Salesforce is big enough that it can afford to play a long game, and reach its financial goals with the help of Slack.</p>

<p>&#8220;To get to a market cap of $1 trillion, Salesforce now has to take MSFT head on. Until now, the company has mostly been able to stay in its own swim lane in terms of products. [&#8230;] To get to a trillion dollars in market cap, Salesforce needs to try to grow in two massive markets,&#8221; Agrawal said. Those would be either knowledge worker/desktop (see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m/">the 2016 Quip acquisition</a>) or cloud (see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/with-hyperforce-salesforce-lets-you-move-your-data-to-any-public-cloud/">the Hyperforce announcement</a>). Agrawal says chances are the company&#8217;s best bet is the former, and it was willing to pay top dollar to get it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The deal will help Salesforce maintain a 20%+ growth rate over the next few years,&#8221; he said. Ultimately, he sees it moving the revenue needle, which should eventually drive market cap higher and help achieve those goals.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Salesforce president and CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/bret-taylor" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="bret-taylor">Bret Taylor <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said while they intend to integrate Slack deeply into the Salesforce product family, they recognize the power and utility of Slack as a standalone product and they don&#8217;t intend to do anything that would mess with that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, we want to make sure that Slack remains as a kind of technology-agnostic platform. We know that Slack is used by millions and millions of people every day to connect every tool under the sun. The most remarkable thing is just how many customers have also just integrated their own custom internal tools as well into this is really kind of the central nervous system for the teams that use it, and we would never want to change that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to judge a deal this large until we have some hindsight and see how well the two companies have meshed, how well they can incorporate Slack into the Salesforce ecosystem, while allowing that independence Taylor alluded to. If they can find a way to walk that line and Slack becomes that wrapper, that operating system, that glue that holds the Salesforce ecosystem together, it will be a good deal, but if Slack stops innovating and withers under the weight of its corporate overlords, then it might not be money well spent.</p>
<p>Time will tell which is the case.</p>
