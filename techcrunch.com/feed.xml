										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has started making deliveries to customers in Los Angeles using electric vans designed and built by Rivian.</p>
<p>The electric vans, which are part of Amazon&#8217;s 2040 climate pledge, won&#8217;t go into series production until the end of the year, <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/amazons-custom-electric-delivery-vehicles-are-starting-to-hit-the-road">according to an update</a> Wednesday by the company. Amazon declined to reveal how many electric vans were in the test fleet.</p>
<p>The customer deliveries are part of continuous testing being conducted by Amazon and Rivian to measure performance as well as safety durability in various climates and geographies. Road tests first started more than four months ago. The current fleet of vehicles was built at Rivian&#8217;s headquarters in Plymouth, Michigan and can drive up to 150 miles on a single charge. Rivian engineers will continue to refine the vehicles for the start of production at its Normal, Illinois factory.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In the meantime, these electric vehicles will continue to pop up on delivery routes in up to 15 additional cities in 2021. Eventually, Amazon plans to deploy at least 100,000 electric vans — the size of its order with Rivian — over the next several years.</p>
<p>Amazon and Rivian began testing vehicles four months prior to making customer deliveries, as part of the testing and development process. Amazon is also starting to modify its buildings to accommodate the new fleet of vehicles and has installed thousands of electric vehicle charging stations at its delivery stations across North America and Europe, the company said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re loving the enthusiasm from customers so far&#8211;from the photos we see online to the car fans who stop our drivers for a first-hand look at the vehicle,&#8221; Ross Rachey, director of Amazon&#8217;s global Fleet and products, said in a statement. &#8220;From what we&#8217;ve seen, this is one of the fastest modern commercial electrification programs, and we&#8217;re incredibly proud of that.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://scratchpad.com/">Scratchpad</a> is an early stage startup that wants to make it easier for sales people to get information into Salesforce by placing a notation layer on top of it. Today, it announced a $13 million Series A led by Craft Ventures with participation from Accel.</p>
<p>The company has now raised a total of $16.6 million including<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/scratchpad-announces-3-6m-seed-to-put-work-space-on-top-of-salesforce/"> the $3.6 million seed round</a> we covered in October. Co-founder and CEO Pouyan Salehi says that he wasn&#8217;t really looking to add capital, but the investors understood his vision and the money will help accelerate the product roadmap.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be honest, it actually wasn&#8217;t on our radar to raise again so soon after we raised what I consider a substantial seed. We had plenty of runway, but we started to see a lot of bottom-up user growth, this bottom-up motion just really started to take hold,&#8221; Salehi told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that lead investor David Sacks, who has built some successful startups himself, really got what they were trying to do, and the deal came together fairly easily. In fact, the company caught the attention of Craft because they were hearing about Scratchpad from their portfolio companies.</p>
<p>The bottoms up approach is certainly something we have seen with developer tools and with software for knowledge workers, but companies often take aim at sales through the sales manager, rather than trying directly to get salespeople to use a particular tool. This approach of getting the end users involved early allows them to gain traction with members of the sales team before approaching management about paid versions.</p>
<p>Traditionally, sales teams don&#8217;t like the tools that are thrust upon them. They are essentially databases and even with a visual interface, it doesn&#8217;t really match up with the way they work. Scratchpad gives them an interface like a spreadsheet or notes application that they are typically using to hack together a workflow, but with a direct connection to Salesforce.</p>
<p>What the paid tiers provide is a way to bring all this data together and get a bigger picture view of what&#8217;s happening on the sales team, and it helps ensure that people are using Salesforce because the data in Scratchpad links to the Salesforce database automatically.</p>
<p>The company has completed the initial work of building the individual salesperson&#8217;s workspace, but the next phase, and part of what this capital is going to fund, is building the team workspace and seeing how this data can flow from individuals to a team view to give management more insight into what their individual reps are doing. This includes notes, which usually don&#8217;t make it into Salesforce, but provide a lot of context about interactions with customers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s resonating with thousands of users (although Salehi didn&#8217;t want to share an exact customer number just yet). Customers include Autodesk, Brex, Lacework, Snowflake and Twilio.</p>
<p>Sacks says that he liked the viral way the product has been spreading. &#8220;Once a rep starts using Scratchpad, two things tend to happen: it becomes a daily habit, and they share it with their teammates. This phenomena of viral spread is rare and indicates a very strong product-market fit,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Training AIs is essential to today&#8217;s tech sector, but handling the amount of data needed to do so is intrinsically dangerous. DARPA hopes to change that by tapping the encryption experts at <a href="https://dualitytech.com/">Duality</a> to create a hardware-accelerated method of using large quantities of data without decrypting it — a $14.5 million contract.</p>
<p>Duality specializes in what&#8217;s called fully homomorphic encryption. Without descending into the technical details, the main issue with everyday encryption methods — though it&#8217;s also sort of the point of them — is that they render the encrypted data totally unreadable, essentially noise unless you have the key to reverse the process. Doing that is computationally expensive with large datasets, and of course once the data is in the clear, it&#8217;s vulnerable to hackers, abuse, and other dangers.</p>
<p>There are methods, however, of encrypting data such that it can be analyzed and manipulated without decrypting it, and one of those is fully homomorphic encryption. Unfortunately FHE is even more computationally intense than ordinary encryption, ruling it out for applications where gigabytes or terabytes of data are called for. There are other methods of accomplishing the same ends but no one would cry if FHE suddenly became ten times easier.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DataFleets keeps private data useful and useful data private with federated learning and $4.5M seed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/datafleets-keeps-private-data-useful-and-useful-data-private-with-federated-learning-and-4-5m-seed/embed/#?secret=myHUquFwXj" data-secret="myHUquFwXj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>DARPA is as interested as anyone else in this field, though it has considerably deeper pockets than your garden variety encryption wonk. This contract is part of a <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2020-03-02">broader effort called DPRIVE</a>, or Data Protection in Virtual Environments, and the stated goal is to develop a special purpose chip — an ASIC pre-assigned the code name TREBUCHET — to accelerate FHE by, hopefully, an order of magnitude or more.</p>
<p>The Duality team will bring in experts from USC, NYU, CMU, SpiralGen, Drexel University, and TwoSix Labs. The company has been in the game for a long time and has actually worked with DARPA before, so this is not new territory for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span lang="en-IL">Duality team members have been supporting DARPA-funded innovation and application of FHE for over a decade. Some members of our team developed the first ever prototype HE hardware accelerators under the DARPA PROCEED program starting in 2010 and are lead developers for the PALISADE open source FHE library, first developed for the DARPA SAFEWARE program in 2015,&#8221; said Duality Labs director and principal investigator for the contract, David Bruce Cousins, in a press release.</span></p>
<p>As you can see, they&#8217;re not short on acronyms either.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not totally clear what the timeline is on this, but considering the state of the technologies involved I wouldn&#8217;t expect results before at least two or three years from now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is facing calls to beef up enforcement against fake reviews and rating scams after a developer took to <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011069395755009">social media</a> to shine a light on unfair practices he&#8217;s forced to compete with as a result of fraudulent activity on the App Store not being rooted out by the tech giant.</p>
<p>Kosta Eleftheriou, one of the founders of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fleksy/">Fleksy</a> keyboard app (who was acquihired by Pinterest in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/15/pinterest-acquires-the-team-behind-fleksy-a-custom-ios-and-android-keyboard/">2016</a>), has &#8212; since March 2018 &#8212; been applying his expertise in autocorrect algorithms to make typing on the Apple Watch&#8217;s tiny screen not only possible but &#8220;simple, enjoyable and highly effective&#8221;, as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2019/03/02/apple-watch-flicktype-gesture-keyboard-app-makes-typing-a-breeze-is-it-any-good/">Forbes&#8217; reviewer put it</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The App Store has a big problem<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You: an honest developer, working hard to improve your IAP conversions.<br />Your competitor: a $2M/year scam running rampant.</p>
<p>1/<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&mdash; Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011069395755009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>His app, FlickType, has also been described by app reviewers as &#8220;astonishingly accurate&#8221;, a &#8220;fundamentally better keyboard&#8221; and &#8220;way faster&#8221; than the letter-by-letter scribble method Apple supports natively.</p>
<p>User reviews also include a large amount of glowing five-star ratings. The overall rating from users currently is 3.5 because a number of lower scores have pulled down the average. But if you take the time to dig in the developer can be seen responding consistently and constructively to issues being raised by users who leave lower scores.</p>
<p>Sometimes complaints are related to Watch platform issues outside his control (as Apple limits how third party text input can be accessed). Missing features are another common issue &#8212; and in many responses Eleftheriou responds by saying he&#8217;s added the setting the person was after (such as the ability to disable Auto-Correction) or highlighting a &#8220;brand new look &amp; feel to make typing even easier&#8221;. Other times he thanks users for raising bugs that he says have now been fixed.</p>
<p>Anyone reading how specifically each complaint is addressed would be confident the developer of FlickType is working hard to make sure the app meets customers expectations. Even though the overall rating means other Watch keyboard apps are &#8216;rated&#8217; higher overall.</p>
<p>The problem for Eleftheriou is all his genuine hard work is being undercut by copycat app makers who are able to leverage weak App Store enforcement to profit unfairly and at his expense.</p>
<p>The scam goes like this: A bunch of Watch keyboard apps are published that purport to have the same slick features as FlickType but instead lock users into paying eye-wateringly high subscription fees for what is, at best, a pale imitation.</p>
<p>You might expect quality to float to the top of the App Store but the trick is sustained by the clones being accompanied by scores of fake reviews/ratings which crowd out any genuine crowdsourced assessment of what&#8217;s being sold.</p>
<p>Fake reviews outnumber the real deal. It&#8217;s only if you take the time to read through the comments that alarm bells might start ringing&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish I read the reviews before buying. I can&#8217;t even get it to work on my watch,&#8221; runs a one-star review of WatchKey, one of the rival apps Eleftheriou has complained about &#8212; which nonetheless has a higher overall rating than his app owing to also having a very large proportion of five-star reviews.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are so sorry for any inconvenienced caused. Please kindly email us to describe more about your scenario so that we can support you as soon as possible,&#8221; is WatchKey&#8217;s generic response to the one-star review.</p>
<p>&#8220;Terrible,&#8221; writes another one-star reviewer. &#8220;I bought this app to use T9 on my watch. I haven’t been able to get T9 to work on my watch, I’ve also reached out to the customer service email that’s listed on the app. But I haven’t gotten a response, I would advise to find a different app.&#8221;</p>
<p>WatchKey&#8217;s response to another abysmal verdict on its software? More platitudes: &#8220;Thank you for your feedback. Unfortunately, we haven&#8217;t received your email yet. Please kindly email us once more via support@vulcanlabs.co to describe more your scenario so we can support you as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pattern repeats across negative reviews. Even one of the &#8216;five&#8217; star reviews warns: &#8220;You need to pay if you want to use the T9. They make you write a review to &#8216;unlock&#8217; and then they ask for a payment.&#8221;</p>
<p>One component of the manipulation involves posting generic platitudes to do the bare minimum required by Apple to manage (genuine) negative reviews. The other is flooding listings with fake five star reviews to ensure the app&#8217;s overall rating remains high. Step 3: Profit.</p>
<p>Eleftheriou&#8217;s Twitter thread highlights some of what he says are &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of fake five star reviews which are being used to drive Watch owners toward downloading the malicious clones &#8212; using wording that refers to non-existent features or references things you&#8217;d be doing on other types of devices (suggesting the text may have been cut and pasted from genuine reviews elsewhere).</p>

<p>A quick Google search for &#8216;buy ios reviews&#8217; returns a staggering 643M results &#8212; including ads for companies touting &#8220;app reviews, installs and ratings [as] the best way to improve the rank of your apps at Appstore and Google Play&#8221; and selling &#8220;high quality iOS app reviews with ratings for $2.5&#8230; from 100% Real Users&#8221;.</p>
<p>Clearly selling fake reviews is a booming business &#8212; which in turn speaks to the woeful lack of effective enforcement.</p>
<p>In an extra fake kicker, Eleftheriou found that one of the scammy competitors had even ripped off his own app promo video &#8212; which was demoing the features offered by FlickType &#8212; and used it in ads targeting app consumers on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>Facebook does have policies against third-party infringement (under section 4 of its prohibited content policy) &#8212; but you might as well whistle for pro-active enforcement from the adtech giant. It only acts when it gets a complaint of infringement so preventing abuse of his marketing materials would require Eleftheriou to spend even more of his time hunting for and reporting the malicious ads ripping off his stuff. (&#8220;I did report and Facebook did eventually take it down. But&#8230; I knew this was not going to be any sort of lasting relief,&#8221; he confirms.)</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Of course the really big kicker here is that Apple&#8217;s rules for developers clearly stipulate that submitting fraudulent reviews is a violation of the developer program licence agreement.</p>
<p>Its App Store review guidelines also warn that developers who attempt to cheat the system (such as by manipulating ratings) may only have their apps removed from the App Store &#8212; and could be expelled from Apple&#8217;s developer program entirely.</p>
<p>So &#8212; to put it politely &#8212; it&#8217;s not a good look for Apple that an indie developer with proven expertise and reputation is having to spend so much resource fighting App Store scams because its own enforcement has failed to stamp them out. To the point where he feels the only path forward is to resort to a public call out on social media to highlight systematic enforcement failures.</p>
<p>Eleftheriou tells TechCrunch he decided to raise the complaint on social media after what he describes as &#8220;simply depressing results&#8221; from engaging with Apple&#8217;s official &#8216;app dispute&#8217; channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;They put you in contact with the other developer in question, and oversee the thread while they hope you will resolve the issue with the other party directly,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;The scammers I complained about in that dispute weren&#8217;t even the bigger scammers I mention in my Twitter thread. Yet, the complaint I had with them barely got addressed, and there was no response from Apple whatsoever on the issue of the fake ratings and reviews. Simply a &#8216;if we don&#8217;t hear back from you very soon we consider the matter resolved&#8217;. We even reached out to Apple privately after that but got no response.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was most impressive to me, was that in the presence of the Apple legal team, the scammers did not feel threatened one bit &#8212; almost as if they know Apple is unlikely to do anything,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;In my view, Apple simply does not devote enough resources on this area.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since raising the issue on Twitter, Eleftheriou has reported a partial win &#8212; in that some of the apps he had complained about have been taken down from the App Store. (At the time of writing Apple has not made any public statement confirming any action.)</p>
<p>However the developer accounts do not appear to have been banned at this time. &#8220;It&#8217;s astounding that even pulling a scam like that, doesn&#8217;t get your developer account revoked!&#8221; Eleftheriou told us. &#8220;I mean if that didn&#8217;t do it, what would??&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>UNREAL! <a href="https://t.co/gU3R45LskO">pic.twitter.com/gU3R45LskO</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356725679102943232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>We reached out to Apple about this issue and it provided some background information related to its developer policies &#8212; which forbid attempts to cheat the system (such as by trying to trick the review process, steal user data, copy another developer’s work, or manipulate ratings or App Store discovery), among other relevant provisions.</p>
<p>We also asked Apple if it&#8217;s considering any policy changes in light of the issues raised by Eleftheriou &#8212; and will update this post with any response.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main issue in my view is not the cloning here. I didn&#8217;t even care that they were using my name, or made their screenshots similar to mine etc. If only there was a system to better prevent fake ratings and reviews, none if this would matter,&#8221; Eleftheriou also told us. &#8220;People would be able to collectively protect themselves through their 1-star &#8216;votes&#8217; but when that system is allowed to get rigged, everything else goes out the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;The promise of ratings and reviews you can trust does not exist any more which erodes consumer trust at an ever accelerating pace,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;I did a Google search to see what those &#8216;companies&#8217; look like, if you want to buy ratings and reviews. These are proper, full blown companies, with support systems, and claims that their ratings won&#8217;t get deleted by Apple, unlike their competitors. It was shocking to see that this is an industry that is thriving.&#8221;</p>
<p>The issue of fake reviews certainly goes far beyond Apple&#8217;s App Store. And is a <a href="https://www.webretailer.com/b/amazon-fake-reviews/">very insidious one</a>.</p>
<p>Fake reviews are pretty much a universal experience across the Internet &#8212; whether you&#8217;re trying to buy stuff on Amazon, looking at places to visit on Tripadvisor or trying to find a local dentist with the help of reviews on Google Maps (in short; don&#8217;t) &#8212; given how many platforms now incorporate user reviews.</p>
<p>But the issue does look especially toxic for Apple.</p>
<p>A core part of the USP for its App Store is the claim that Apple&#8217;s review process sums to a higher quality, more trustworthy experience than alternative marketplaces that aren&#8217;t so carefully overseen.</p>
<p>So a failure to do more to enforce against review scams and rating manipulations risks taking a lot more shine off Apple&#8217;s brand than Cupertino should be comfortable with.</p>
<p>Simply put: Consumers expect a higher standard from Apple. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re willing to pay a premium for its products. Under-resourcing App Store review and enforcement thus looks like a false economy &#8212; not least because it risks driving quality developers like Eleftheriou away.</p>
<p>If a developer with so much pedigree can&#8217;t reliably sell his wares on the App Store what does that say about Apple&#8217;s &#8216;premium&#8217; marketplace?</p>
<p>The issue is also likely to be increasingly on the radar of consumer watchdogs and regulators in the coming years. The European Union, for example, is planning to bake binding transparency and reporting requirements into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">incoming platform regulations</a> &#8212; as it seeks to promote <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/europe-agrees-platform-rules-to-tackle-unfair-business-practices/">fairness and accountability</a> in digital businesses.</p>
<p>While an <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/2161/oj">EU Omnibus Directive</a> that came into force at the start of last year &#8212; with a two year deadline for Member States to transpose it &#8212; aims to beef up consumer rights through enhanced enforcement and transparency requirements &#8212; including directly addressing the issue of fake reviews by placing an obligation on traders to take &#8216;reasonable and proportionate&#8217; steps to ensure reviews are genuine, among other measures.</p>
<p>In the EU platforms will soon start being required to &#8216;justify&#8217; their enforcement failures vis-a-vis fake reviews. And if they can&#8217;t, well, the regime includes tough &#8216;GDPR-level&#8217; fines for breaches of consumer protection law. So the costs won&#8217;t only be reputational, as currently.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority, meanwhile, has also been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/facebook-and-ebay-pledge-to-do-more-to-tackle-trade-in-fake-reviews-after-pressure-from-uk-regulator/">cracking down</a> on the trade in fake reviews &#8212; specifically targeting Facebook, Instagram and eBay in recent years. Further attention to the issue from UK oversight bodies, which are now operating independently of the EU, also seems likely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer payments is by no means a solved problem (I’ll trigger one hundred blockchain people if I say otherwise), but it sure as heck a pretty improved one. Checkout is a breeze with modern tools ranging from Stripe and PayPal to Fast and Rapyd to Apple and Google Pay. If you happen to need financing, on-the-spot lending platforms like Affirm, which recently debuted on NASDAQ and is currently valued at $26 billion, will extend that financing nearly instantaneously.</p>
<p>Then you head over to B2B payments … and you recoil in horror as you migrate away from a utopian future of promise to the ruins of an antiquated past. A mash-mash of payment methods from paper checks to wire transfers get sent against invoices, none of which are automatically synchronized across financial information systems. Financing is complicated and offered by a bank through — gasp — an actual phone call. Shudder, because there probably involves a fax machine somewhere in that loop.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getbalance.com">Balance</a> is looking to modernize all of it, as fast as possible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Balance offers efficient B2B payments that allows merchants to offer a variety of payment methods including ACH and bank wires as well as a variety of payment terms including payment on delivery, net payment terms, and payment by milestone. Behind the scenes, Balance underwrites the terms of those transactions requiring financing by evaluating the risk of the customer, the merchant, and the specific payment terms selected. Balance is built on top of Stripe and offers all of Stripe’s credit card payment options, but then extends far beyond them.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107342" style="width: 525px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107342" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2107342" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Checkout-When-To-Pay.jpeg?w=515" alt="" width="515" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Checkout-When-To-Pay.jpeg 522w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Checkout-When-To-Pay.jpeg?resize=114,150 114w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Checkout-When-To-Pay.jpeg?resize=227,300 227w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Checkout-When-To-Pay.jpeg?resize=515,680 515w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Checkout-When-To-Pay.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2107342" class="wp-caption-text">Balance&#8217;s checkout flow includes options to pick financing terms and means of payment. Photo via Balance.</p></div></p>
<p>Take, for instance, your typical SaaS offering. Typically, employees will buy individual seat licenses to the software with their corporate cards (managed maybe with Brex), a payment facilitated through Stripe or PayPal. As a company spends more and more on that particular software, one of the two parties will reach out and negotiate a comprehensive enterprise rate for single payment. It is here that Balance becomes key. That full payment could be done on Balance, with net 30 payment terms using a bank wire all automatically synced against an invoice offered by the service to the customer.</p>
<p>B2B payments is a massive market measured in the tens of trillions globally, which is perhaps one reason why Balance has an all-star fintech investing syndicate behind its seed round. It raised $5.5 million from Tal Morgenstern of Lightspeed, Stripe and Max Levchin through his SciFi VC. Lightspeed previously backed Levchin’s Affirm. Balance was part of the summer 2020 batch of Y Combinator, although declined to appear at demo day and remained in stealth as its seed round had already been locked in. UpWest Labs, which invests in Israeli companies heading to the U.S. market, also invested.</p>
<p>Balance was founded by Bar Geron and Yoni Shuster in late 2019 to early 2020 and came through their experience working at PayPal together. “PayPal is a key part of the story,” Geron said, describing how the duo learned about the consumer payments world. Shuster stayed on at PayPal, while Geron headed to <a href="https://www.behalf.com">Behalf</a>, a company that also works on B2B financing and cash flow management. Geron said that Behalf was a “pain point solution” to the challenge of offering net payment terms, but that the company didn’t attempt to digitize the mostly analog model of payments. Geron saw an opportunity and linked up with Shuster to take a more expansive approach to the problem.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107340" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107340" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2107340" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Founders-Photo-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Founders-Photo-1.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Founders-Photo-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Founders-Photo-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Founders-Photo-1.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Founders-Photo-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Founders-Photo-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Founders-Photo-1.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Founders-Photo-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2107340" class="wp-caption-text">Balance founders Bar Geron and Yoni Shuster. Photo via Balance.</p></div></p>
<p>Our dream is to “make B2B payments as easy as car payments,” Geron said. “What we wanted to do is to make it as easy as Stripe … take a snippet of code and just put it on your site.” With that in place, Balance’s other features like invoice syncing and financing become instant features.</p>
<p>Through Y Combinator, the team learned that other tech companies constantly confronted these problems, and that they would serve as useful first customers. The critical customers though in Geron’s mind are B2B marketplaces where there are few solutions to synchronize the complexities of marketplace transactions. Geron says that “we have several customers in that space.” Another key customer segment are service providers who work on milestone-based payments, such as 20% upfront and 80% on delivery. “We automated [all that] and put it online,” he said.</p>
<p>Balance makes money on what is known as a “factoring fee” where it pays the merchant ahead of the payment from the customer. Geron noted its 2%, although the actual rate varies based on the risk involved.</p>
<p>The two founders are based in Israel, although like most startups these days, they have a distributed workforce.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://beamapp.co">Beam</a> has raised a $9.5 million Series A round. The company is working on a new web browser that completely rethinks the way you start a web session and browse the web. The startup is founded by Dom Leca and Sébastien Métrot. Dom Leca previously worked on Sparrow, an email app with an opinionated design.</p>
<p><a href="https://pacecapital.com">Pace Capital</a> is leading today’s funding round. Several business angels are also participating, such as Christan Reber, Harry Stebbings and Albert Wenger. Existing investors Spark, Amaranthine, C4V and Alven are also investing once again.</p>
<p>Beam is also announcing that it is acquiring <a href="https://radblock.app">RadBlock</a>, an ad blocker for Safari.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Beam, I encourage you to read <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/beam-is-building-a-web-browser-that-gathers-knowledge-from-your-web-activity/">my previous article</a> on the company — I describe how the product is going to work and the reasoning behind it.</p>
<p>In short, Beam is a web browser focused on knowledge. Many people spend a ton of time mindlessly browsing the web. When you close the last tab, you realize that you didn’t learn much and you don’t have any note.</p>
<p>You can bookmark stuff, but chances are you either don’t use bookmarks or you never check them. And if you want to find something again, you often end up entering a Google query and starting from scratch.</p>
<p>With Beam, every time you search for something, it creates a new session. Each session is represented by a note card. When you’re done browsing, the note card summarizes your findings. Your search query is the title of the card, the most important sites appear near the top of the note. Irrelevant content is listed at the end of the note.</p>
<p>You can then add text, remove links, reorganize stuff and create a full-fledged note. Basically, you end up creating comprehensive notes without even realizing it.</p>
<p>Beam is an ambitious project and the company will have to iterate on that initial idea. But it sounds like a great way to start using the web as a kid. You get to learn more about your passions based on what you do on the web.</p>
<p>Right now, there are seven people working for Beam. The company is going to hire machine learning and natural language processing experts as well as more developers.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The rush of founders and investors from the West Coast to states like Texas and Florida are the precursor for something bigger, a movement decades in the making.</p>
<p>The future of startups is a decentralized, global ecosystem. Where wealth and knowledge isn’t concentrated, but shared and open. Where there aren’t capitals, but networks.</p>
<p>Miami has had a head start.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Let’s set the scene. Miami already <a href="https://startupgenome.com/ecosystems/miami">ranks</a> among the world’s most prominent (nontraditional) startup hubs, and 2020 saw <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/why-miami-is-the-next-hot-tech-hub/">more big names in tech</a> migrate to Florida. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has been spurring on the influx with an extremely popular Twitter campaign.</p>

		<blockquote>
			Miami already ranks among the world’s most prominent (nontraditional) startup hubs, and 2020 saw more big names in tech migrate to Florida.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>These are signs of what globally minded business savvies already know is true. The world is ready for Miami as the pioneer of future tech hubs. Because the city isn’t just a launching pad for U.S. startups with interests in Latin America. It’s a strategic landing pad for global startups who want a presence in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Across the globe, international opportunities for founders are growing: There is greater connectivity and greater potential for emerging market entrepreneurs to produce life-changing products.</p>
<p>Where will those entrepreneurs want to have a presence? At the heart of global investor and entrepreneur networks, in true melting pots, and at crossroads between mature and emerging markets.</p>
<p>That’s why Miami is in focus right now, but it’s only the first of many cities that will soon be a part of this global trend.</p>
<p>Here’s why Miami is spearheading this new global grid of startup ecosystems.</p>
<h2>1. Global tech is no longer concentrated — it’s fragmented across the world</h2>
<p>Two-thirds of the world&#8217;s top startup ecosystems are <a href="https://startupgenome.com/article/state-of-the-global-startup-economy">outside of North America</a>. Not only that, but <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/silicon-valley-exodus-the-majority-of-professionals-said-theyd-follow-tech-leaders-to-emerging-tech-hubs/">70% of professionals</a> believe that technology power is dispersing away from Silicon Valley. The Bloomberg Innovation Index <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/20/texas-silicon-valley-austin-tech-workers">bumped</a> the United States down from top spot in 2013, to No. 9 in 2020. Tech knowledge and power is growing in Europe and Asia, flourishing in cities like Shanghai and Berlin.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/12/28/nine-predictions-of-whats-coming-in-startupland.html">microbusinesses</a> will increase (we’re already seeing a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3cbb0bcd-d7dc-47bb-97d8-e31fe80398fb">surge in new businesses</a> being created around the world), and less of them will have zip codes.</p>
<p>So, when big businesses or VC firms leave/explore outside Silicon Valley, or the United States entirely, they’re not building more of the same, they’re showing us that Silicon Valley is no longer the only M.O. The emerging M.O. is borderless and connected: an inclusive network. It gives investors greater access to more distant business opportunities. It allows entrepreneurs to choose the most convenient place to build a company — and save huge amounts of overhead — while also sharing more expertise.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;8 Miami-area investors assess America&#8217;s southernmost tech ecosystem&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/8-miami-area-investors-assess-americas-southernmost-tech-ecosystem/embed/#?secret=xZmxYZQ1Mf" data-secret="xZmxYZQ1Mf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>2. You can build global companies from emerging hubs</h2>
<p>Startups in emerging markets have always received a mere fraction of the funding available to U.S. startups. Which means that when money dries up across the board, they are under even more pressure to come up with the most innovative solutions just to survive.</p>
<p>Empowering these local entrepreneurs is the fact that today’s problems need local solutions — from health to logistics, these verticals all require inherent knowledge of domestic infrastructure and services.</p>
<p>The potential here is huge. Emerging markets house the greatest world populations — China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria… — and language and connectivity barriers are slowly melting away, with mobile internet use <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/02/05/digital-connectivity-growing-rapidly-in-emerging-economies/">surging</a>.</p>
<p>Investors are <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8bc4a5a0-d5dd-437e-8cea-b737746d57f6">already perking up</a> to the enormous value of emerging markets, from Asia to Latin America, especially as the strength of the U.S. dollar drops. Just in Q4 2020, VC investment in Latin America saw a 93% growth over Q4 2019, according to Pitchbook.</p>
<p>What does this mean for emerging tech hubs? First, there will be more of them, more distributed and with more funding. Second, we’re going to see a stronger flow of emerging market startups serving customers in the United States to offer services with proven traction, rather than vice versa.</p>
<p>The disruptive products these companies develop and test on millions of users back home find fertile markets not only in the United States, but in other emerging markets with similar needs. Many such companies will want to use the United States as a strategic operating base while keeping the engineering teams in their HQs.</p>
<p>That’s because our founders, accelerators, investors and support organizations have historic experience in internationalization, as well as connections across the globe. So where will these foreign companies land — will they be interested in Denver or Austin, or rather a well-connected city that has made a name for itself as an international hub?</p>
<p>Miami is a landing pad where foreign startups can access both the United States and emerging markets with comparable trends. The <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article248220415.html">city has made strides</a> to position itself at the intersection between mature and emerging markets, creating an ecosystem that is inclusive (half of the population is foreign-born), prioritizes collaboration over individualism and encourages the arrival of newcomers. As such, it will be a (working) model for diverse startup cities.</p>
<h2>3. The money will follow</h2>
<p>Amid talks of a Silicon Valley &#8220;exodus,&#8221; some have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/opinion/silicon-valley-exodus.html">quick to point out</a> that the hub has always held strong because of a key feature: access to capital.</p>
<p>But investors will follow the best opportunities. Which means that tech investment will only become more global. Put simply, the concentration of wealth in Silicon Valley is incompatible with the growing demand for tech across the globe. Silicon Valley isn’t going to die, but the pie is getting bigger. And more of that capital is already going to emerging tech hubs.</p>
<p>The symptoms include U.S. VC giants branching into emerging regions — like Sequoia opening its first <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/11/17/vc-firm-sequoia-puts-down-roots-in-europe-startup-scene/?sh=71148aeb5eac">European office</a>, and SoftBank funneling <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190307005336/en/SoftBank-Group-Corp.-Announces-Launch-New-5">billions</a> into Latin America.</p>
<p>This means U.S. investors will favor regions where they can easily connect with global opportunities, like Miami. Last year, VC investment in the Miami region rose to over <a href="https://www.refreshmiami.com/the-year-in-vc-part-2-top-vc-deals-in-2020-for-south-florida-and-more/">$2.2 billion</a>, despite the pandemic (compared to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/hot-or-not-where-european-vc-funding-went-in-2020">$1.4 billion</a> in all of Spain). But not only that — there is a lot of funding coming from investors in emerging markets.</p>
<p>In Latin America, local funders play a huge role in supporting promising companies. In 2019, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/report-vc-funding-in-latin-america-more-than-doubles-to-4-6b-in-2019/">almost 40%</a> of the record-breaking $4.6 billion VC dollars invested in Latin America involved a co-investment with at least one Latin American investor. And from what we&#8217;re seeing, regional investors are increasingly funding U.S.-based organizations.</p>
<p>They — and others like them — will want to find ecosystems where they can connect with local and foreign founders with whom they can foster partnerships across markets.</p>
<p>Places like Miami need to house these kinds of networks. South Florida already has globally minded accelerators and startup programs like <a href="https://www.miami.500.co/">500 Startups</a>, Plug &amp; Play and TheVentureCity; and VC firms with international networks, such as Ocean Azul, Endeavor Catalyst, Starlight Ventures, Level VC and now <a href="https://www.refreshmiami.com/boom-softbank-launching-100m-fund-to-invest-in-miami-startups/">SoftBank</a>.</p>
<h2>4. Miami is better positioned for the future needs of startups</h2>
<p>I’m going to end by underscoring the case for Miami as the U.S. pioneer of international connector startup hubs.</p>
<p>Startups build more with less every five years, and going international from day one, allows them to test their products in more markets straight away. This is feasible given worldwide level of connectivity, and helps to be in an environment that is constantly looking outward, beyond our borders.</p>
<p>It also helps to be in a time zone that is shared by much of South America and is only five hours behind London (San Francisco is only in the same time zone as the rest of the United States and Vancouver).</p>
<p>People who uproot their entire lives to seek success elsewhere want to be welcomed. They appreciate that the mayor of the city is happy to meet them for a “cafecito,” and that other founders are genuinely enthusiastic at their arrival. They don’t want to land in an expensive city where making it big tends to require connections, money and background.</p>
<p>Miami is reflective of the future of global startup hubs. It won’t be the next Silicon Valley, because we don’t need another one. As the entrepreneurial world flourishes in every corner of the globe, emerging market companies will be conquering markets across the United States and Europe, and fortress cities will make way for international networks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Events &#8212; when they haven&#8217;t been cancelled altogether in the last 12 months due to the global health pandemic &#8212; have gone virtual and online, and a wave of startups that are helping people create and participate in those experiences are seeing a surge of attention, and funding.</p>
<p>In the latest development, New York video startup <a href="http://touchcast.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TouchCast</a> &#8212; which has developed a platform aimed at companies to produce lifelike, virtual conferences and other events without much technical heavy-lifting &#8212; has picked up funding of $55 million, money that co-founder and CEO Edo Segal said the startup will use to build out its services and teams after being &#8220;overrun by demand&#8221; in the wake of Covid-19.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by a strategic investor, Accenture Ventures &#8212; the investment arm of the systems integrator and consultancy behemoth &#8212; with Alexander Capital Ventures, Saatchi Invest, Ronald Lauder and other unnamed investors also participating. The startup up to now has been largely self-funded, and while Segal isn&#8217;t disclosing the valuation he said it was definitely in the 9-figures (that is, somewhere in the large region of hundreds of millions of dollars).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Accenture has been using TouchCast&#8217;s technology for its own events, but that is likely just one part of its interest: Accenture also has a lot of corporate customers that tap it to build and implement interactive services, so potentially this could lead to more customers into TouchCast&#8217;s pipeline.</p>
<p>(Case in point: my interview with Segal, over Zoom, found me speaking to him in the middle of a vast aircraft hangar, with a 747 from one of the big airlines of the world &#8212; I won&#8217;t say which &#8212; parked behind him. He said he&#8217;d just come from a business pitch with the airline in question.)</p>
<p>A lot of what we have seen in virtual events, and in particular conferences, has to date has been, effectively, a managed version of a group call on one of the established videoconferencing platforms like Zoom, Google&#8217;s Hangout, Microsoft&#8217;s Teams, Webex, and so on.</p>
<p>You get a screen with participants&#8217; individual video streams presented to you in a grid more reminiscent of the opening credits of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzODEdkypdg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brady Bunch</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW0DNGn3FNY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Squares</a> than an actual stage or venue.</p>
<p>There are some, of course, who are taking a much different route. Witness Apple&#8217;s online events in the last year, productions that have elevated what a virtual event can mean, with more detail and information, and less awkwardness, than an actual live event.</p>
<p>The problem is that not every company is Apple, able to afford much less execute Hollywood-level presentations.</p>
<p>The essence of what TouchCast has built, as Segal describes it, is a platform the combines computer vision, video streaming technology and natural language processing to let other organizations create experiences that are closer to that of the iPhone giant&#8217;s than they are to a game show.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have created a platform so that all companies can create events like Apple&#8217;s,&#8221; Segal said. &#8220;We&#8217;re taking them on a journey beyond people sitting in their home offices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet home office remains the operative phrase: people (the organizers and the on-stage participants) still use basic videoconferencing solutions like Zoom and Teams &#8212; in their homes, even &#8212; but at the back end, TouchCast is taking those videos, using computer vision to trim out the people and place them into virtual &#8220;venues&#8221; so that they appear as if they are on stage in an actual conference.</p>
<p>These venues come from a selection of templates, or the organiser can arrange for a specific venue to be shot and used. In addition to the actual event, TouchCast then also provides tools for audience members to participate with questions and to chat to each other. As the event is progressing, TouchCast also produces transcriptions and summaries of the key points for those who want them.</p>
<p>And while Segal said that TouchCast is not planning to make this a consumer-focused product, not even on the B2B2C side, it&#8217;s preparing a service so that when business conference organisers <em>do</em> want to hold a music segment with a special guest, those can be incorporated, too.</p>
<p>TouchCast&#8217;s growth into a startup serving an audience of hungry event planners has been an interesting pivot that is a reminder to founders (and investors) that the right opportunities might not be the ones you think they are.</p>
<p>You might recall that the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/27/co-founded-by-former-tc-editor-erick-schonfeld-touchcast-aims-to-reinvent-online-video-using-interactive-apps/?_ga=2.84357137.907098425.1612175151-209244718.1579131500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first came out of stealth back in 2013</a>, with former TechCrunch editor Erick Schonfeld one of the co-founders.</p>
<p>Back then, the company&#8217;s concept was to supercharge online video, by making it easier for creators to build in interactive elements and other media into their work, to essentially make videos closer to the kind of interactivity and media mix that we find on webpages themselves.</p>
<p>All that might have been too clever by half. Or, it was simply not the right time for that technology. The service never made many waves at all, and one of my colleagues even assumed it had deadpooled at some point.</p>
<p>Not at all, it turns out. Segal (a serial entrepreneur who also used to work at AOL as VP of emerging platforms &#8212; AOL being the company that acquired TechCrunch and eventually became a part of Verizon) notes that the technology that TouchCast is using for its conferencing solution is essentially the same as what it built for its original video product.</p>
<p>After launching an earlier, less feature-rich version of what it has on the market today, it took the company about six months to retool it, adding in more mixed reality customization via the use of Unreal Engine, to make it what it is today, and to meet the demand it started to see from customers, who approached the startup after attending events held by others using TouchCast.</p>
<p>&#8220;It took us eight years to get to our overnight success story,&#8221; Segal joked.</p>
<p>Figures from Grand View Research cited by TouchCast estimate that virtual events will be a $400 billion business by 2027, and that has made for a pretty large array of companies building out experiences that will make those events worth attending, and putting on.</p>
<p>They include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hopin</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/bizzabo-raises-138m-for-a-platform-that-helps-you-build-and-run-virtual-conferences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bizzabo</a> &#8212; both of which have recently also raised big rounds &#8212; but also more enhanced services from the big, established players in videoconferencing like Zoom, Google, Microsoft, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cisco-acquires-slido-to-improve-qa-polls-and-engagement-in-webex-videoconferencing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cisco</a> and more.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise to see Accenture throwing its hat into that ring as a backer of what it&#8217;s decided is one of the more interesting technology players in that mix. The reason is because many understand and now accept that &#8212; similar to working in general &#8212; it&#8217;s very likely that even when we do return to &#8220;live&#8221; events, the virtual component, and the expectation that it will work well and be compelling enough to watch, is here to stay.</p>
<p>“Digital disruption, distributed workforces, and customer experience are the driving forces behind the need for companies to transform how they do business and move toward the future of work,&#8221; said Tom Lounibos, managing director, Accenture Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;For organizations to harness the power of virtual experiences to deliver business impact, the pandemic has shown that quality interactions and insights are needed. Our investment in Touchcast demonstrates our commitment to identifying the latest technologies that help address our clients’ critical business needs.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re at all interested in wine, chances are you&#8217;ve turned to <a href="https://www.vivino.com/">Vivino</a> at least a few times for recommendations. The app and the company behind it have been helping people enjoy better wine since 2010, and now the startup has raised $155 million with its Series D round – a sum over twice as large as all of its previous funding to date. Spurred by rapid growth that has seen its user base grow from 29 million in 2018, to 50 million currently, Vivino wants to use the large cash injection to significantly boost its core tech and personalized recommendation engine, while also expanding its presence in key growth markets globally.</p>
<p>Vivino is an interesting company for many reasons, but chief among them might be just how similar its vision today is to the one it started out with. Founder and CEO Heini Zachariassen told me in an interview that the app has been remarkably immune to the pivot – something as natural as breathing in the fast-flowing startup world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can look at my slide, from when I pitched this 10 years ago,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;It says, &#8216;Hey, you scan a bottle of wine, then you can buy it.&#8217; That just makes a lot of sense to anybody, so it really hasn&#8217;t changed much.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been very, very difficult to build much – much harder to build than building that slide,&#8221; he joked. But it&#8217;s always been the same – we always knew that was going to be the model.&#8221;</p>
<p>That core value proposition is what leads to a lot of Vivino&#8217;s initial downloads and subsequent usage. The scenario is likely familiar: You&#8217;re sitting in a restaurant and browsing the wine menu, or staring at a crowded shelf in a wine store. For myself, I think I likely searched for something like &#8216;wine recommendation app&#8217; and found Vivino via the App Store, installed it and was snapping photos of labels or menus within minutes. The recommendations provided somewhere to start, and since then the app has grown more personalized as I&#8217;ve provided input about my tastes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107739" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107739" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2107739" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="783" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg 2720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg?resize=300,229 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg?resize=768,587 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg?resize=680,520 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg?resize=1536,1175 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg?resize=2048,1566 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2107739" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vivino</p></div></p>
<p>Vivino&#8217;s marketplace component means you can often buy the wines you find and enjoy directly from the app, via partnerships the company fosters and maintains with merchants large and small around the world. Zachariassen explained that they strive to maintain high standards when it comes to these partners, since the experience a user has with them is largely a reflection on Vivino itself because the app provides the means for the purchase.</p>
<p>Building more relationships with more merchants in more geographies is one part of their expansion goal for addressing their primary growth markets, but the company is also going to put a lot more capital behind improving and extending its recommendation engine. A lot of the building blocks are in place to make big improvements there, not least of which is the wine database that Vivino spent a decade building essentially from zero.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stage one of the hurdles we faced, even before we got commercial, was really building the data,&#8221; Zachariassen told me. &#8220;There is no aggregated data anywhere. So we&#8217;ve basically built this data totally from scratch. So it means taking a picture of bottle of wine, then having people just entering info every single day to fill it. We have 1.5 billion pictures of wine labels right now, so building that mass of data in a good and structured way really is 10 years of work.&#8221;</p>
<p>He adds that wine is a particularly long-tail marketplace, with highly individual tastes and very little indication in the company&#8217;s history that that&#8217;s likely to change in any significant way. Vivino&#8217;s marketplace approach, which is highly local on both the supply and the demand side, is particularly well-suited to addressing the sector&#8217;s needs, and Zachariassen believes Vivino has only really begun to scratch the surface on that thus far. I asked him why now was the right time to take on this sizeable round, given they&#8217;ve been very modest with prior funding amounts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we we&#8217;ve reached sort of a critical mass,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We saw last year massive growth, and actually reaching [&#8230;] like a quarter of a billion dollars in sales, and we&#8217;ve really seen that the unit economics are healthy for us. At the same time, unlike other marketplaces – you know, the order of things when you have a marketplace might be if you&#8217;re like Uber, is that you go into market, you spend money, do marketing, a lot of money to build up the demand, and then you build the supply on top. We&#8217;re a little bit different in the way that demand is already there, because we have 50 million users around the world. So we just follow our demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the hardest thing about that is that we&#8217;re now a 200 person company that sells wine in 17 countries,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Which means we&#8217;re relatively thin in all these markets. So so one of the big things here, is actually to go much deeper in each market and say, okay, we now know it works here, let&#8217;s put more resources in every single market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zachariassen also added that the company spends very little on marketing to date, so it&#8217;s going to begin spending more on that to extend its organic growth. Finally, it wants to really build out product engineering, since he says that while users love the existing app, they really &#8220;want to do so much more with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivino has worked to modernize a product category that has long relied on local expertise and individual storehouses of highly-specific information, with an approach that provides all the benefits of a connected and global marketplace, while retaining regional and particular appeal at the granola level of the individual user. Now, the company is read to tap the rest of the massive submerged demand it has identified, and this fresh fundings would help it do just that.</p>
<p>The $155 million series D round was led by Sweden&#8217;s Kinnevik, and also includes participation by Sprints Capital, GP BullHound, and existing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/12/vivino-raises-1m-from-creandum-for-mobile-wine-cellar/">investor Creandum which led its Series A</a>. This brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $221 million to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Grocery delivery startup <a href="https://www.goodeggs.com/">Good Eggs</a> is announcing that it has raised $100 million in new funding, and that it&#8217;s planning to launch in Southern California in either the summer or fall of this year.</p>
<p>Parts of this story might sound familiar to readers familiar with Good Eggs — when the startup raised its most recent, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/15/good-eggs-funding/">$50 million funding round</a> in 2018, CEO Bentley Hall also mentioned plans for geographic expansion.</p>
<p>It seems, however, that the company has found plenty of opportunity for growth while remaining focused on the San Francisco Bay Area. Good Eggs says that in the past year, revenue has grown to the nine figures (more than $100 million), hired more than 400 employees and nearly doubled its customer base.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hall also noted that the company opened a new, larger warehouse in Oakland just a few days before shelter-in-place orders took effect last March. So the team was busy enough trying to operate a new warehouse, meet increased demand for grocery delivery and keep workers safe in the process.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107602" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107602" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2107602" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Good_Eggs_Box.jpg?w=490" alt="Good Eggs box" width="490" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Good_Eggs_Box.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Good_Eggs_Box.jpg?resize=108,150 108w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Good_Eggs_Box.jpg?resize=216,300 216w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Good_Eggs_Box.jpg?resize=768,1067 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Good_Eggs_Box.jpg?resize=490,680 490w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Good_Eggs_Box.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2107602" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Good Eggs</p></div></p>
<p>And while the grocery delivery market has become increasingly competitive, Hall argued that Good Eggs stands out thanks to the quality and breadth of its products — 70% of its products are locally sourced, and it often delivers them within 48 hours of harvesting.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s lots of people offering groceries, meal kits, prepared meals, alcohol — we do all of that, with a certain sourcing criteria,&#8221; Hall said. As a result, Good Eggs has become the &#8220;primary source&#8221; for many of its consumers, representing 65% to 85% of their home food purchases.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that this represents a bit of a turnaround for the company, after the it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/05/good-eggs-layoffs/">shut down operations</a> in Los Angeles, New York City and New Orleans in 2015, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/01/good-eggs-has-a-new-ceo/">Hall coming on as CEO</a> shortly afterwards. And it sounds like he isn&#8217;t in a rush to launch in a bunch of new markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think of [Southern California] not as one big region, but as several small sub-regions,&#8221; Hall said. &#8220;There&#8217;s the LA region, northern San Diego, Orange County — those areas collectively are the size of two or three Bay Areas. That&#8217;s a meaningful increase in our addressable market.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107605" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107605" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bentley_Hall_1.jpg?w=544" alt="Good Eggs CEO Bentley Hall" width="544" height="680" class="size-large wp-image-2107605" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bentley_Hall_1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bentley_Hall_1.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bentley_Hall_1.jpg?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bentley_Hall_1.jpg?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bentley_Hall_1.jpg?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bentley_Hall_1.jpg?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2107605" class="wp-caption-text">Good Eggs CEO Bentley Hall</p></div></p>
<p>The new funding was led by Glade Brook Capital Partners, with participation from GV, Tao Invest, Finistere Ventures and Rich’s, as well as previous investors Benchmark Partners, Index Ventures, S2G, DNS Capital and Obvious Ventures. Glade Brook&#8217;s J.P. Van Arsdale is joining the company&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The grocery market is undergoing fundamental change and the shift to e-commerce and higher quality products and services is accelerating,&#8221; Van Arsdale said in a statement. &#8220;Good Eggs is experiencing rapid growth with strong unit economics and is well-positioned to become a category-defining leader. We are excited to partner with their team to help drive future growth and expansion.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to geographic expansion, Hall said the money will allow Good Eggs to continue adding new products and to find ways to improve the e-commerce experience.</p>
<p>In addition to the funding, Good Eggs is also announcing that it has hired Vineet Mehra as its chief growth and customer experience officer. Mehra was previously chief marketing officer and chief customer officer at Walgreens Boots Alliance, and before that as executive vice president and global chief marketing and revenue officer at Ancestry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding, and retaining, frontline workers has likely never been as critical as it is in these pandemic days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter </span><a href="http://www.workstep.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WorkStep</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a four-year-old startup that was founded with the mission of helping large supply chain employers do just that. The fully distributed company announced this morning that it has closed on a $10.5 million Series A round, building on top of a previously unannounced $6.7 million seed funding that included equity and a convertible note.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FirstMark Capital led the Series A financing, which included participation from returning backer and strategic partner Prologist Ventures.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Johnston, co-founder and CEO of WorkStep, said the Employee Lifecycle Management (ELM) software platform was designed to not only help large supply chain employers source new frontline employers, but to also onboard, train, and keep them happier with the goal of them staying on board longer. Johnston experienced some of the challenges firsthand  when he managed a warehouse in Portland, Oregon, more than a decade ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has only highlighted the importance of the work frontline employees do – from serving food to delivering packages. But with the increasing dependence on supply chain labor came record turnover, points out Johnston – leaving many companies understaffed and remaining workers stretched thin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WorkStep claims to provide human resources, recruiting and operations leaders “full transparency” across the employee lifecycle to help companies minimize that churn. The company had previously built out its cloud-based Hire<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> offering and then last fall, launched its Retain<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “The pandemic has forced companies of all sizes to prioritize the health, safety and satisfaction of frontline teams,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its customers include hundreds of industrial, logistics, transportation and warehousing employers across North America –– including regional 3PLs (third-party logistics companies) and distribution centers, as well as 16 of the Fortune 500. Customers include grocery chain Kroger, Alpine Food Distributing and TransPak, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WorkStep says it has “reached” 500,000 supply chain workers over the years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WorkStep claims that its Retain offering reduced turnover by up to 29 percent for a Fortune 100 food &amp; beverage company with whom it conducted a <a href="https://www.workstep.com/case-study-fortune-100-fb-company">case study</a>. This saves companies money in replacement and retraining expenses, which can add up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of launching Retain last fall, according to Johnston, WorkStep saw its business more than double in the second half of 2020. This led the company to end the year as “bottom line profitable,&#8221; meaning that its revenue exceeded expenses in the last two months of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while WorkStep did not necessarily need to take on new capital, the company saw an opportunity to double down so it could continue to scale, Johnston said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was an opportunistic round,” he told TechCrunch. “The turnover in this segment has become a core focus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WorkStep plans to use its new funding to more than double the size of its existing team of 14 employees across engineering, product, sales and customer success departments this year and triple it by the end of fiscal year 2022.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FirstMark Capital’s </span><a href="https://firstmarkcap.com/team/adam-nelson/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam Nelson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was in the room with the company during its first whiteboard sessions and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">believes WorkStep is addressing a &#8220;massive&#8221; opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think the real differentiator between WorkStep and the existing solutions in the space is that WorkStep doesn’t see temporary staffing/gig liquidity as a solution,” Nelson told TechCrunch. “They see it as a symptom of a multi-hundred billion dollar deadweight loss that’s created when employers aren’t able to find, train and retain the right people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WorkStep, he added, is addressing the full employee lifecycle and leveraging the data  “to give a voice to frontline workers while also making employers smarter and more proactive.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India has issued a notice to Twitter, warning the American social firm to comply with New Delhi’s order to block accounts and content related to a protest by farmers and not “assume the role of a court and justify non-compliance.” Failure to comply with the order may prompt penal action against Twitter, the notice warns.</p>
<p>The warning comes days after Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/twitter-restricts-over-a-dozen-high-profile-accounts-in-india-following-legal-demand/">blocked dozens of high-profile accounts in India</a> in compliance with New Delhi’s request, but later lifted the restriction.</p>
<p>Twitter “cannot assume the role of a court and justify non-compliance. Twitter being an intermediary is obliged to obey the directions as per satisfaction of authorities as to which inflammatory content will arouse passion and impact public order. Twitter cannot sit as an appellate authority over the satisfaction of the authorities about its potential impact on derailing public order,” said the notice, a copy of its summary was reviewed by TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>India’s IT ministry has also expressed concerns over what it deemed derogatory and factually incorrect tweets and hashtags that have been circulating in India this week that it said were designed to spread hate. &#8220;It is thus clear that, the offending tweets/ hashtag remained in public domain and must have been tweeted and re-tweeted several times at the risk and cost of public order and at the risk of incitement to the commission of offences,&#8221; the notice said.</p>
<p>Twitter declined to comment.</p>
<p>For more than three months, tens of thousands of farmers (if not more) in India and elsewhere have been protesting against three laws passed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#8217;s government last year that they say allow greater private sector competition.</p>
<p>Twitter, which reaches more than 75 million users through its apps in India, has emerged as the single-most important online forum for people seeking to voice their opinion on this matter. Singer Rihanna, who has more followers on Twitter than any Indian actor or politician, tweeted a CNN news story on Tuesday about the protests in India and asked &#8220;why are&#8217;t we talking about this!?</p>

<p>&#8220;You can choose to disagree, correct, ridicule, or engage with such fears, outcry. Seeking to ban &amp; precensor such discussions is a travesty of India&#8217;s Constitution + international human rights law. This is not what 21st Century India should permit, nor what our founders envisaged. The Ministry of Electronics and IT should release its actual orders and all documentation behind the Govt&#8217;s decisions to &#8211; (1) issue these orders and (2) press the matter with Twitter and other social media platforms. Don&#8217;t hide; explain &amp; justify how this is not unconstitutional.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Embedded finance &#8212; the idea of offering financial products where customers are already congregating via white label solutions and APIs &#8211; isn&#8217;t an entirely new concept. In fact, in one form or another, such as point of sale credit, the concept has existed for years and long before Silicon Valley venture capital firm and media company (ha!) Andreessen Horowitz <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/01/21/every-company-will-be-a-fintech-company/">made it a thing</a>. However, fuelled by cloud technology and a plethora of new fintech and Banking-as-a-Service startups, there is no doubt the embedded finance trend is accelerating.</p>
<p>The latest company to declare its hand is Berlin-based <a href="https://www.banxware.com/">Banxware</a>, which offers embedded finance in the form of loans for SMEs, in partnership with marketplaces, payments providers, and others. It launched in December and today is disclosing that it has raised €4 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is Force over Mass, and VR Ventures. They are joined by HTGF, and private investors in banking, payment and e-commerce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Banxware says it will use the investment to develop and grow its embedded white label financial services offering, and expand its team. In addition to lending, the startup will also soon offer card-based products and other financial services.</p>
<p>Banxware’s tech and infrastructure enables any company to offer loans and other banking services to SME customers. The idea is to act as the link between banks (lenders), digital platforms, and merchants. Banks get access to hard to reach SME customers. Platforms, such as online marketplaces, can up-sell financial products beyond their core offering. And merchants benefit from speedy access to working capital.</p>
<p>“SMEs have a hard time to access capital when needed, especially when they are less than three years old or do not have the most pristine credit history,” explains co-founder and CEO Jens Röhrborn. “On top of this, loan applications, i.e. loan decisions and loan payout, still take several weeks in most cases.</p>
<p>“More and more sellers and merchants are using digital platforms through which they sell their products or process their digital payments. By using the recent historic data on these merchants provided by the platforms, we can lend against their future revenues”.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Oo47FW5pzb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/liberis-the-embedded-finance-provider-for-smes-raises-additional-70m-in-equity-and-debt/">Liberis, the embedded finance provider for SMEs, raises additional £70M in debt</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Liberis, the embedded finance provider for SMEs, raises additional £70M in debt&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/liberis-the-embedded-finance-provider-for-smes-raises-additional-70m-in-equity-and-debt/embed/#?secret=Oo47FW5pzb" data-secret="Oo47FW5pzb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This has seen Banxware build an instant lending tool that includes AML and KYC compliance, and a scoring engine that analyzes historic platform data and data from third party providers, such as account information providers and external scoring services. The promise is an instant loan decision and loan payout, “all in less than 15 minutes”.</p>
<p>“On the lending side, we work with both balance sheet lenders and lending vehicles with whom we pre-agree on lending terms and loan decision criteria and on whose behalf we execute the loan decision,” says Röhrborn. “Merchants repay their loan in such a way that platforms subtract a certain percentage of the future merchant payouts”.</p>
<p>Röhrborn says the company&#8217;s instant lending tool is &#8220;only the beginning&#8221; and that Banxware will develop additional embedded financial services and expand internationally.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the German fintech currently generates revenue by charging a one time fee for each loan that is processed through its platform and via a one off customization fee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, became profitable for the first time in the December quarter, the company announced in its <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p210202.pdf">earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s cloud unit achieved positive adjusted EBITA (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization) during the quarter, after being in business since 2009. The milestone is in part a result of the &#8220;realization of economies of scale,&#8221; Alibaba said.</p>
<p>Alibaba Cloud, which incorporates everything from database, storage, big data analytics, security, machine learning to IoT services, has dominated China&#8217;s cloud infrastructure market for the past few years and its market share worldwide continues to grow. As of 2019, the cloud behemoth was the third-largest public cloud company (providing infrastructure-as-a-service) in the world with a 9% market, trailing behind Amazon and Microsoft, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-admin/post-new.php">Gartner</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>COVID-19 has been a boon to cloud and digital adoption around the world as the virus forces offline activities online. For instance, Alibaba notes in its earnings that demand for digitalization in the restaurant and service industry remains strong in the post-COVID period in China, a trend that benefits its food delivery and on-demand services app, Ele.me. The firm&#8217;s cloud revenue grew to $2.47 billion in the December quarter, primarily driven by &#8220;robust growth in revenue from customers in the internet and retail industries and the public sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commerce remained Alibaba&#8217;s largest revenue driver in the quarter accounting for nearly 70% of revenue, while cloud contributed 7%.</p>
<p>Tencent&#8217;s cloud segment is Alibaba Cloud&#8217;s closest rival. As of 2019, it had a 2.8% market globally, according to Gartner. The industry in China still has ample room for growth, as Alibaba executive vice-chairman Joe Tsai pointed out in an analyst call from <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/20/alibaba-group-holding-ltd-baba-q1-2021-earnings-ca/">last August</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on the third-party studies that we&#8217;ve seen, the China cloud market is going to be somewhere in the $15 billion to $20 billion total size range, and the U.S. market is about eight times that. So the China market is still at a very early stage,&#8221; said Tsai.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel very good, very comfortable to be in the China market and just being an environment of faster digitization and faster growth of usage of cloud from enterprises because we&#8217;re growing from such a smaller base, about one-eighth the base of that of the U.S. market.&#8221;</p>
<p>A key strategy to grow Alibaba Cloud is the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/14/apple-remove-podcasts-in-china-alibaba-new-cloud-strategy/"> integration of cloud into Alibaba&#8217;s enterprise chat app Dingtalk</a>, which the company hopes can drive industries across the board onto cloud services. It’s a relationship that echoes that between Microsoft 365 and Azure, as president of Alibaba Cloud, Zhang Jianfeng, previously suggested in an <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/61159778">interview</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to just provide cloud in terms of infrastructure services,&#8221; said Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang in the August earnings call. &#8220;If we just do it as an infrastructure service, as SaaS services, then price competition is inevitable, and then all the cloud service is more like a commodity business. Today, Alibaba&#8217;s cloud is cloud plus intelligence services, and it&#8217;s about cloud plus the power of the data usage.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eyelash extensions have taken off in recent years &#8212; particularly in Asia &#8212;  but the audience is only so broad. Getting extensions &#8212; semi-permanent fibers that are attached to one&#8217;s natural eyelashes &#8212; can require hundreds of dollars and hours in the seat of a lash stylist. There&#8217;s always the risk, too, of irritation or worse. Little wonder that, even accounting for low-budget lashes that can be applied at home, the market stands at around $2 billion, which is too small a market to capture the attention of most venture capitalists.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.luumlash.com/">Luum</a>, a four-year-old, 15-person, Berkeley, Ca.-based robotics company, thinks it can change the math &#8212; and attract investment &#8212;  by &#8220;exponentially&#8221; expanding the market, says its CEO, Philippe Sanchez, who has overseen large chain businesses, including as a managing director for Starbucks in France.</p>
<p>The way forward, he says, is through robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, which Luum says it&#8217;s using to ultimately create a robot that that can apply lashes in 20 minutes and, if all goes as planned, will be widely available in beauty shops. More, because lash extensions need to be replaced every two to four weeks as the lashes fall, customers will come back again and again.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Right now, there&#8217;s a bit of magical thinking involved, admits Sanchez. The tech currently relies on Epson industrial robots to which a variety of arms and sensors are attached, making it look a little like something you might see in the dentist&#8217;s office. The procedure of applying lashes has been tried out 100 times on 25 brave souls alone. The process currently takes as long as it would to apply lashes by hand, too, meaning a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Still, Luum, which has raised $10 million to date from Foundation Capital and others and is about to begin talking with investors about a Series A round, is convinced it has the right team to chase and grow what it sees as a big and underserved opportunity in the beauty space.</p>
<p>We talked with Sanchez yesterday afternoon about the company and its next steps. Our chat has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So you are targeting this popular treatment in what seems like a very fragmented industry.</strong></p>
<p>PS: It&#8217;s very popular and yet a little bit undiscovered and yes, it&#8217;s very fragmented. There are 34,000 lash extension services being offered right now in the U.S. alone, where you&#8217;ve got an artist coming over to you and selecting one lash extension at a time, dipping it in an adhesive, and gluing it to an existing lash, then waiting a few seconds to get the next one and the next one, and two hours later, you have amazing lashes that look extremely natural.</p>
<p>But these are individual lash artists. And we see this as a great opportunity to reinvent the category and take a service that&#8217;s already popular and make it even more popular with high-level execution and a new world-class brand.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So the idea is that you create a brand and develop a chain of walk-in centers around the country and world where these eyelashes will be robotically attached?</strong></p>
<p>PS: Correct. We want to leverage our technology to build our brand and launch a chain of studios, as well as to license the technology to people who already sell beauty services and products and and offer them a chance to either be much better at what they do if they are lash artists or, if you know, they have a hair salon or a large cosmetic retailer, they can [add lashes as an ancillary business]. They love the idea of returning customers having to come back every month for services, and lash extensions bring them back into their stores.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This obviously requires the same or better precision than human fingers, along with high safety requirements given this hardware is so near to someone&#8217;s eyes. How does the robot work right now?</strong></p>
<p>PS: The machine is pretty large and pretty soft and very advanced. There is a bed just like you would have in a first-class business flight. And the machine nearby that is about the size of a human, and so you lay in the bed and the machine work overs your face &#8212; you have a mask, just like if you were to do a manual extension &#8212; and it has a little robotic arm that does the job of a person but is much faster and more precise than any manual application. And it&#8217;s very safe. It&#8217;s got little prongs in the plastic at the end of these arms that are very light held by very light magnets because you need only a few grams of force to manipulate the lash.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So if there was any type of external event &#8212; an earthquake or something . . .</strong></p>
<p>PS:  . . . the arms literally fall because they&#8217;re held by these little very light magnets. If you you shake the machine or somebody sneezes, the arms will fall. It creates an environment that simply cannot hurt you, which is critical to the service itself.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you licensing anyone else&#8217;s tech or building everything in-house eventually?</strong></p>
<p>PS: It&#8217;s all built in house. We&#8217;re leveraging advanced robots from Epson that are very good at doing precise manipulation and that are fast. But [as for] IP in the beauty space, there was essentially no prior art, so we have secured a patent already in the U.S and Korea and Australia and [have] 25 patent cases around the world that are very broad and provide us with a moat and protection for the company at large.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How much will these robots cost?</strong></p>
<p>PS: They will cost about $125,000 or so, but this one-time capital expense can boost productivity of labor by four or six times, so you&#8217;ve essentially increased the throughput of one bed, one lash artist, by six. And the machine lasts four to five years.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Plus other costs.</strong></p>
<p>PS: You will have maintenance costs, but it&#8217;s essentially pure margin. For most of those consumer service business, most of the cost goes goes into the labor. That was for my experience at Starbucks.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How far away are you from realizing this vision?</strong></p>
<p>PS: COVID [slowed us down], though we can conduct consumer tests again right now [as California reopens slightly], so we&#8217;re testing the machine, which is already able to deliver a simple style at about the speed of a human. And as we continue to develop and work over the next few months and get closer to opening our first studio,  the performance of the machines will increase to twice the speed and three times the speed and four times the speed of a human application.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You need more capital toward that end. How much are you looking to raise?</strong></p>
<p>PS: A $15 million Series A. That will allow us to open our first studio and validate the unit economic model, as well as to build our third-generation machine. The capital will also be deployed to start to build the foundation of a world class beauty brand.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who should investors know is on your team?</strong></p>
<p>PS: The company was founded by Nathan Harding, who also founded the [robotic exoskeleton pioneer] Ekso Bionics, and Kurt Amundson [who worked with Harding at Ekso Bionics for a decade]. They&#8217;ve got tremendous experience and expertise already in the world of advanced robotics, and also computer vision on the computer vision side.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s to keep a company like Dyson from jumping into this market if you&#8217;re able to prove there is one?</strong></p>
<p>PS: Some folks will realize that this is an attractive space and it&#8217;s worth looking at, but we&#8217;ve got a couple of years on them already.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Time is critical for healthcare providers, especially in the middle of the pandemic. Singapore-based <a href="https://www.botmd.com/en/">Bot MD </a>helps save time with an AI-based chatbot that lets doctors look up important information from their smartphones, instead of needing to call a hospital operator or access its intranet. The startup announced today it has raised a $5 million Series A led by Monk’s Hill Ventures.</p>
<p>Other backers include SeaX, XA Network and SG Innovate, and angel investors Yoh-Chie Lu, Jean-Luc Butel and Steve Blank. Bot MD was also part of Y Combinator&#8217;s summer 2018 batch.</p>

<p>The funding will be used to expand in the Asia-Pacific region, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia, and to add new features in response to demand from hospitals and healthcare organizations during COVID-19. Bot MD’s AI assistant currently supports English, with plans to release Bahasa Indonesian and Spanish later this year. It is currently used by about 13,000 doctors at organizations including Changi General Hospital, National University Health System, National University Cancer Institute of Singapore, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore General Hospital, Parkway Radiology and the National Kidney Transplant Institute.</p>
<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer Dorothea Koh told TechCrunch that Bot MD integrates hospital information usually stored in multiple systems and makes it easier to access.<a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bot-MD_Radiology_Phone_1-e1612251270188.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2107101" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bot-MD_Radiology_Phone_1-e1612251270188.png?w=680" alt="A smartphone with Bot MDs medical AI assistant for doctors displayed on it" width="680" height="468" /></a></p>
<p>Image Credits: Bot MDWithout Bot MD, doctors may need to dial a hospital operator to find which staffers are on call and get their contact information. If they want drug information, that means another call to the pharmacy. If they need to see updated guidelines and clinical protocols, that often entails finding a computer that is connected to the hospital’s intranet.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of what Bot MD does is to integrate the content that they need into a single interface that is searchable 24/7,&#8221; said Koh.</p>
<p>For example, during COVID-19, Bot MD introduced a new feature that takes healthcare providers to a form pre-filled with their information when they type &#8220;record temperature&#8221; into the chatbot. Many were accessing their organization&#8217;s intranet twice a day to log their temperature and Koh said being able to use the form through Bot MD has significantly improved compliance.</p>
<p>The time it takes to onboard Bot MD varies depending on the information systems and amount of content it needs to integrate, but Koh said its proprietary natural language processing chat engine makes training its AI relatively quick. For example, Changi General Hospital, a recent client, was onboarded in less than 10 days.</p>
<p>Bot MD plans to add new clinical apps to its platform, including ones for electronic medical records (EMR), billing and scheduling integrations, clinical alerts and chronic disease monitoring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you want to buy a refrigerator or a television, you can walk to the nearby electronics store or visit an e-commerce website like Amazon. But where do you go when you’re looking for parts of a crane, a door or chassis of different machines?</p>
<p>For several businesses globally, the answer to that question is increasingly <a href="https://www.zetwerk.com/">Zetwerk</a>, a Bangalore-based startup.</p>
<p>The three-year-old startup runs a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/zetwerk-b2b-manufacturing-items-india-seriesb/">business-to-business marketplace for manufacturing items</a> that connects OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and EPC (engineering procurement construction) customers with manufacturing small-businesses and enterprises.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All the products it sells today are custom-made. &#8220;Nobody has a stock of such inventories. You get the order, you find manufacturers and workshops that make them,&#8221; explained Amrit Acharya, co-founder and chief executive of Zetwerk, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Its customers &#8212; there are over 250 of them, up from 100 a year ago &#8212; operate across two-dozen industries (including process plants, oil &amp; gas, steel, aerospace, medical devices, apparel and luxury goods) in the infrastructure space, and approach Zetwerk with digital designs they wish to be translated into physical products.</p>
<p>Customers aren’t alone in seeing value in Zetwerk. On Wednesday, the Indian startup said it has raised $120 million in a Series D financing round led by existing investors Greenoaks Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Existing investors Sequoia Capital and Kae Capital also participated in the Series D round.</p>
<p>The new round, which brings Zetwerk’s to-date raise to $193 million, gives the firm a post-money valuation of somewhere between $600 million to $700 million, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. (A quick side note: Zetwerk announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/zetwerk-an-indian-b2b-marketplace-for-manufacturing-items-raises-21-million/">$21 million Series C round last year</a>, but ended up raising $31 million in that round.)</p>
<p>Zetwerk was co-founded by Acharya, Srinath Ramakkrushnan, Rahul Sharma and Vishal Chaudhary. Long before Acharya and Ramakkrushnan joined forces to tackle this space, they had been contemplating this idea.</p>
<p>Both of them studied at IIT Madras, went to the same exchange program in Singapore, and were colleagues at Kolkata-headquartered conglomerate ITC. While working there, they realized that part of a product manager’s job at the firm was dealing with gazillions of suppliers and the manufacturing items they offered.</p>
<p>The process was archaic: There were no databases, and people couldn’t track shipments.</p>
<p>The early version of Zetwerk, which was a database of suppliers, was a direct response to this. But after listening to requests from customers, the startup saw a bigger opportunity and transformed itself into a full-fledged marketplace with integrations with third-party vendors. Once a firm has placed an order, Zetwerk allows them to keep tabs on the progress of manufacturing and then the shipping. There are also quality checks in place.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107640" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107640" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2107640 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zetwerk-website.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="670" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zetwerk-website.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zetwerk-website.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zetwerk-website.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zetwerk-website.jpg?resize=768,502 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zetwerk-website.jpg?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zetwerk-website.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2107640" class="wp-caption-text">Zetwerk website</p></div></p>
<p>Zetwerk operates in such a unique space today &#8212; Shailesh Lakhani, managing director at Sequoia India, says the startup has defined a new category of marketplace &#8212; that by and large it’s not competing with any other firm in India &#8212; or South Asia. (The startup competes with domain project consultants in the offline world.)</p>
<p>The opportunity in India itself is gigantic. According to industry reports, manufacturing today accounts for 14% of India’s GDP. Vaibhav Agarwal, a partner at Lightspeed, estimates that the market is as large as $40 billion to $60 billion in India and global trade-tailwinds that creates opportunity to serve international demand.</p>
<p>As more and more companies expand or shift their manufacturing to India &#8212; in part due to import duties imposed by India and geo-political tension with China, the global hub for manufacturing &#8212; this opportunity has only grown bigger in recent years.</p>
<p>&#8220;India has a lot of depth in manufacturing, but much of it has not been tapped well,&#8221; said Acharya.</p>
<p>Zetwerk &#8212; which grew 3X last year and reported revenue of $43.9 million in the financial year that ended in March, a 20X growth from the year prior &#8212; plans to deploy the new capital to expand to more areas of categories, and broaden its technology stack. Consumer goods (which covers items such as mixer grinders and TVs) is an area Zetwerk expanded to last year, and said it accounts for 15% of the revenue it generated in the last six months.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Currently 25 of its customers are in the U.S., Canada, Europe and other international markets. Acharya said the startup plans to open offices overseas this year as it scouts for more international customers. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to partner with Zetwerk on the next leg of their journey, as they expand their value proposition globally. Zetwerk&#8217;s operating system for manufacturing has digitized multiple supply chains end-to-end, ensuring on-time delivery and high quality standards. This has led to rapid growth in India and internationally, with the potential to quickly become one of the most important manufacturing platforms globally,&#8221; said Neil Shah, partner at Greenoaks Capital, in a statement.</p>

<p>The amount was undisclosed, but sources say it brings BukuWarung’s total funding so far to $20 million. The company’s last round, announced in September 2020, was between $10 million to $15 million. Launched in 2019, BukuWarung was founded by Chinmay Chauhan and Abhinay Peddisetty and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/meet-bukuwarung-the-bookkeeping-app-built-for-indonesias-60-million-micro-merchants/">took part in Y Combinator last year</a>.</p>

<p>Rocketship.vc is also an investor in Indian startup Khatabook, which reached a valuation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/indias-khatabook-raises-60-million-to-help-merchants-digitize-bookkeeping-and-accept-payments-online/">between $275 million to $300 million</a> in its last funding round. Like Khatabook, BukuWarung helps small businesses, like neighborhood stores called warung, that previously relied on paper ledgers, transition to digital bookkeeping and online payments. BukuWarung recently launched Tokoko, a Shopify-like tool that lets merchants create online stores through an app, and says Tokoko has been used by 500,000 merchants so far.</p>
<p>Chauhan, BukuWarung’s president, said it has started making revenue through its payments solution. In total, BukuWarung now claims more than 3.5 million registered merchants in 750 Indonesian towns and cities, and says it is recording over $15 billion worth of transactions across its platform and processing over $500 million in terms of volume.</p>
<p>SMEs <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2020/07/17/smes-safeguard-economy.html">contribute about 60% to Indonesia’s gross domestic product</a> and employ 97% of its domestic workforce, but many <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-fintech-can-help-indonesias-small-and-medium-enterprises-survive-the-covid-19-pandemic-148528">have difficulty accessing financial services</a> that can help them grow. By digitizing their financial records, companies like BukuWarung can make it easier for them to access lines of credit, working capital loans and other services. Other companies serving SMEs in Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, include BukuKas and CrediBook.</p>
<p>BukuWarung will use its new funding to grow its tech and product teams in Indonesia, India and Singapore. It plans to launch more monetization products, including credit and grow its payments solution this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Bezos era is ending, Uber acquires Drizly and Tesla recalls 135,000 vehicles. This is your Daily Crunch for February 2, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Jeff Bezos will step down as Amazon CEO</strong></p>

Andy Jassy, currently the CEO of Amazon Web Services, will be taking over as chief executive for the entire company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an email to employees, Bezos said that this will allow him to devote more time to &#8220;Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and [his] other passions.&#8221; Jassy, meanwhile, had previously been identified as a likely successor.</p>
<p><strong>The tech giants</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blockbuster news struck late this afternoon when Amazon announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">that Jeff Bezos would be stepping back</a> as CEO of Amazon, the company he built from a business in his garage to worldwide behemoth. As he takes on the role of executive chairman, his replacement will be none other than AWS CEO Andy Jassy.</p>
<p>With Jassy moving into his new role at the company, the immediate question is who replaces him to run AWS. Let the games begin. Among the names being tossed about in the rumor mill are Peter DeSantis, vice president of global infrastructure at AWS and Matt Garman, who is vice president of sales and marketing. Both are members of Bezos&#8217; elite executive team <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazon-expands-bezos-elite-s-team-adding-6-execs-emerging-branches-company/">known as the S-team</a> and either would make sense as Jassy&#8217;s successor. Nobody knows for sure though, and it could be any number of people inside the organization, or even someone from outside. Amazon was not ready to comment on a successor yet with the hand-off still months away.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, a senior analyst at Constellation Research, says that Jassy is being rewarded for doing a stellar job raising AWS from a tiny side business to one on a $50 billion run rate. &#8220;On the finance side it makes sense to appoint an executive who intimately knows Amazon&#8217;s most profitable business, that operates in more competitive markets. [Appointing Jassy] ensures that the new Amazon CEO does not break the &#8216;golden goose&#8217;,&#8221; Mueller told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jeff Bezos will no longer be CEO of Amazon as of later this year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/embed/#?secret=OQ2pRaZyvt" data-secret="OQ2pRaZyvt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Alex Smith, VP of channels, who covers the cloud infrastructure market at analyst firm Canalys, says the writing has been on the wall that a transition was in the works. &#8220;This move has been coming for some time. Jassy is the second most public-facing figure at Amazon and has lead one of its most successful business units. Bezos can go out on a high and focus on his many other ventures,&#8221; Smith said.</p>
<p>Smith adds that this move should enhance AWS&#8217;s place in the organization. &#8220;I think this is more of an AWS gain, in terms of its increasing strategic importance to Amazon going forward, rather than loss in terms of losing Andy as direct lead. I expect he’ll remain close to that organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ed Anderson, a Gartner analyst also sees Jassy as the obvious choice to take over for Bezos. &#8220;Amazon is a company driven by technology innovation, something Andy has been doing at AWS for many years now. Also, it’s worth noting that Andy Jassy has an impressive track record of building and running a very large business. Under Andy’s leadership, AWS has grown to be one of the biggest technology companies in the world and one of the most impactful in defining what the future of computing will be,&#8221; Anderson said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AWS is sick of waiting for your company to move to the cloud&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/09/aws-is-sick-of-waiting-for-your-company-to-move-to-the-cloud/embed/#?secret=CWRRLJktxD" data-secret="CWRRLJktxD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the company earnings report released today, AWS came in at $12.74 billion for the quarter up 28% YoY from $9.6 billion a year ago. That puts the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">on an elite $50 billion run rate</a>. No other cloud infrastructure vendor, even the mighty Microsoft, is even close in this category. Microsoft stands at around 20% marketshare compared to AWS&#8217;s approximately 33% market share.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what impact the executive shuffle will have on the company at large or AWS in particular. In some ways it feels like when Larry Ellison<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/09/18/349637734/larry-ellison-steps-down-as-oracles-ceo"> stepped down as CEO of Oracle in 2014</a> to take on the exact same executive chairman role. While Safra Catz and Mark Hurd took over at co-CEOs in that situation, Ellison has remained intimately involved with the company he helped found. It&#8217;s reasonable to assume that Bezos will do the same.</p>
<p>With Jassy, the company is getting a man who has risen through the ranks since joining the company in 1997 after getting an undergraduate degree and an MBA from Harvard. In 2002 he became VP/technical assistant, working directly under Bezos. It was in this role that he began to see the need for a set of common web services for Amazon developers to use. This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/">idea grew into AWS</a> and Jassy became a VP at the fledgling division working his way up until he was appointed CEO in 2016.</p>
