										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four years ago when Zach Jones went to do due diligence on <a href="https://www.czero.energy/">C-Zero</a>, a startup out of Santa Barbara, Calif. commercializing a new approach to producing hydrogen, for the small family office he was working for, he had no idea he&#8217;d wind up as the company&#8217;s chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Or that the company would wind up raising money from Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the billionaire backed investment vehicle focused on financing companies developing technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and some of the world&#8217;s largest industrial and oil and gas companies.</p>
<p>At the time, Jones was working for Beryllium Capital, a small investment office out of South Dakota, and had identified a potential investment opportunity in C-Zero, a company commercializing a new way of making hydrogen developed by <a href="https://chemengr.ucsb.edu/people/eric-mcfarland">Eric McFarland</a>, a professor at UCSB.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There was only one problem &#8212; McFarland had the research, but didn&#8217;t know how to run a company. That&#8217;s when Jones stepped in. His firm didn&#8217;t make the investment, but when the former Economist science writer took over, the company was able to nab a seed round from PG&amp;E and SoCal Gas, California&#8217;s two massive utilities.</p>
<p>The reason for their investments is the same reason Breakthrough Energy Ventures became interested in the young company. Even with renewable energy production coming on line at a breakneck pace, much of the world will still be using fossil fuels for the foreseeable future and the greenhouse gas emissions from that fossil fuel production needs to go to zero.</p>
<p>C-Zero is developing a technology that converts natural gas to hydrogen, a much cleaner source of fuel, and solid carbon as the only waste stream for use in <span style="font-weight: 400;">electrical generation, process heating and the production of commodity chemicals like hydrogen and ammonia. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our CTO talks about running a coal mine in reverse,&#8221; Jones said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1721136" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1721136" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1721136" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/industrial.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="590" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/industrial.jpg 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/industrial.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/industrial.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/industrial.jpg?resize=768,443 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/industrial.jpg?resize=680,392 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/industrial.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1721136" class="wp-caption-text">Night image of an industrial manufacturing plant. Image Credit: Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s technology is a form of methane pyrolysis, which uses a proprietary chemical catalyst to separate the hydrogen gas from other particles, leaving behind that solid carbon waste. The process, which is neither waste free (there&#8217;s that solid carbon) nor renewable (the feedstock is natural gas), is cleaner than current low-cost methods of hydrogen production and far cheaper than the more renewable ways of making hydrogen.</p>
<p>Making renewable hydrogen requires making electricity to send a charge through water to split the liquid into hydrogen and oxygen. And it takes far more energy to pull a hydrogen atom off of an oxygen atom than it does to split that hydrogen from a carbon atom.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The reason that hydrogen is interesting is that it is a great supplement to intermittent renewables,&#8221; said Jones. &#8220;It’s really about energy storage… when you look at long duration storage on a daily and seasonal basis… it becomes exorbitantly expensive. Having a chemical fuel is going to be critical part of decarbonizing everything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Jones describes the technology as &#8220;pre-combustion carbon capture&#8221;, and thinks that it could be critical to unlocking the benefits of hydrogen for a range of industrial applications including heavy vehicle fueling, utility power generation, and industrial power for manufacturing.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not alone.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over $100 billion of commodity hydrogen is produced annually,” said Carmichael Roberts, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the new lead investor in C-Zero&#8217;s $11.5 million funding. “Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of that production comes from a process called steam methane reforming, which also produces large quantities of CO2. Finding low cost, low emission methods of hydrogen production – such as the one C-Zero has created – will be critical to unlocking the molecule’s potential to decarbonize major segments of the agricultural, chemical, manufacturing and transportation sectors.”</span></p>
<p>Joining the Bill Gates-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures in the new round is Eni Next, the investment arm of the Italian oil and gas and power company, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and the hydrogen technology-focused venture firm, AP Ventures.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Heavy Industries already has an application for C-Zero&#8217;s technology. The company is in the process of re-powering an existing coal plant to run on a combination of natural gas and hydrogen by 2025. It&#8217;s possible that C-Zero&#8217;s technology could help get there.</p>
<p>Beyond the lower cost methods used in manufacturing hydrogen, C-Zero may be one of the first companies that could qualify for new tax credits on carbon sequestration established by the IRS in the U.S. earlier this year. Those credits would give qualifying companies $20 per ton of sequestered solid carbon &#8212; the exact waste product from C-Zero&#8217;s process.</p>
<p>Even as C-Zero begins commercializing its technology it faces some stiff competition from some of the largest chemical companies in the world.</p>
<p>The German chemicals giant BASF has been developing its own flavor of methane pyrolysis for nearly a decade and has begun building test facilities to scale up production of its own clean hydrogen.</p>
<p>And yesterday, two other big European corporations are also joining the hydrogen production game as the French chemicals company Air Liquide announced a joint venture with Siemens Energy to work on hydrogen production.</p>
<p>Jones acknowledges that the company&#8217;s technology is only a stopgap solution&#8230; for now. In the future, as the world moves to renewable natural gas production from waste, he envisions the potential of a potentially circular hydrogen economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 100 years will this technology be around? If it is it’ll be because we’re using renewable natural gas,&#8221; Jones said. There are a lot of steps that need to be traveled to get there, but Jones is confident in the near-term success of the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There’s always going to be  a need for a very energy dense fuel. Liquid hydrogen is the most energy dense thing that’s out there outside of something that’s nuclear in nature,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think that hydrogen is here to stay. At the end of the day the lowest cost of energy that has the lowest cost for avoided CO2 is what’s going to win.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://sentinelone.com/">SentinelOne</a>, a late-stage security startup that helps customers make sense of security data using AI and machine learning, announced today that it is acquiring <a href="https://www.scalyr.com/">Scalyr</a>, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the high-speed logging startup for $155 million in stock and cash.</span></p>
<p>SentinelOne sorts through oodles of data to help customers understand their security posture, and having a tool that enables engineers to iterate rapidly in the data, and get to the root of the problem is going to be extremely valuable for them, CEO and co-founder Tomer Weingarten explained. &#8220;We thought Scalyr would be just an amazing fit to our continued vision in how we secure data at scale for every enterprise [customer] out there,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>He said they spent a lot of time shopping for a company that could meet their unique scaling needs and when they came across Scalyr, they saw the potential pretty quickly with a company that has built a real-time data lake. &#8220;When we look at the scale of our technology, we obviously scoured the world to find the best data analytics technology out there. We [believe] we found something incredibly special when we found a platform that can ingest data, and make it accessible in real time,&#8221; Weingarten explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Scalyr scores $20M Series A for super-fast log reading tool&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/20/scalyr-scores-20m-series-a-for-super-fast-log-reading-tool/embed/#?secret=hxTkxTx871" data-secret="hxTkxTx871" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He believes the real time element is a game changer because it enables customers to prevent breaches, rather than just reacting to them. &#8220;If you&#8217;re thinking about mitigating attacks or reacting to attacks, if you can do that in real time and you can process data in real time, and find the anomalies in real time and then meet them, you&#8217;re turning into a system that can actually deflect the attacks and not just see them and react to them,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>The company sees Scalyr as a product they can integrate into the platform, but also one which will remain a stand-alone. That means existing customers should be able to continue using Scalyr as before, while benefiting from having a larger company contributing to its R&amp;D.</p>
<p>While SentinelOne is not a public company, it is a pretty substantial private one, having raised over $695 million, according to Crunchbase data. The company&#8217;s most recent funding round came in February last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/sentinelone-raises-200m-at-a-1-1b-valuation-to-expand-its-ai-based-endpoint-security-platform/">a $200 million investment</a> with a $1.1 billion valuation.</p>
<p>As for Scalyr it was launched in 2011 by Steve Newman, who first built a word processor called Writely and <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/09/writely-confirms-google-acquisition/">sold it to Google in 2006</a>. It was actually the basis for what became Google Docs. Newman stuck around and started building the infrastructure to scale Google Docs, and he used that experience and knowledge to build Scalyr. The startup raised $27 million along the way, according to Crunchbase data including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/20/scalyr-scores-20m-series-a-for-super-fast-log-reading-tool/">a $20 million Series A investment in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>The deal will close this quarter, and when it does Scalyr&#8217;s 45 employees will be joining SentinalOne.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.fabric.inc">Fabric</a>, a startup powering e-commerce for companies like GNC and ABC Carpet and Home, has raised $43 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The announcement comes less than four months after <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/next-top-brand-fabric-closes-9-5m-seed-for-e-commerce-platform/">Fabric announced its $9.5 million seed round</a>. CEO Faisal Masud said Fabric hadn&#8217;t intended to raise more funding so quickly, but given its growth and investor interest, he  the startup&#8217;s leadership team had to ask, &#8220;Do we delay the growth or do we just go now?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer is probably self-evident, since you&#8217;re reading this funding story. The round was led by Norwest Venture Partners, with Norwest&#8217;s Scott Beechuk joining Fabric&#8217;s board of directors. Redpoint Ventures and Sierra Ventures also participated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Fabric is the only headless commerce platform that combines the simplicity of drag-and-drop configuration with the power to create rich modern customer experiences, without the need for a large dev team,&#8221; Beechuk told me via email. &#8220;Most importantly, however, is the fact that Faisal (CEO) and [co-founder Ryan Bartley] are rockstar veterans of the e-commerce world from Amazon, eBay, Staples and Groupon. They empathize with their customers’ challenges and have the expertise to disrupt the mature e-commerce market with a significantly better product.&#8221;</p>
<p>E-commerce has <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/global-ecommerce-2020">grown rapidly during the pandemic</a>, and there are a number of platforms offering a &#8220;headless&#8221; approach, which (as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/making-headless-commerce-less-spooky-faisal-masud/?trackingId=xWcUHL8WRNu0BkBDyz0MJA%3D%3D">Masud explained in a blog post</a>) separates the frontend and the backend of the shopping experience.</p>
<p>But Masud said there&#8217;s still &#8220;a large gap in the market today&#8221; when it comes to supporting large, growing brands, whether they&#8217;re direct-to-consumer or business-to-business.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110532" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110532" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2110532" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fabric-PIM-2.jpg?w=680" alt="Fabric screenshot" width="680" height="392" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fabric-PIM-2.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fabric-PIM-2.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fabric-PIM-2.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fabric-PIM-2.jpg?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fabric-PIM-2.jpg?resize=680,392 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fabric-PIM-2.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110532" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fabric</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We like to say that Shopify Plus is our on-ramp and Salesforce Commerce Cloud is our off-ramp,&#8221; he said. In other words, Fabric serves businesses that have &#8220;outgrown Shopify Plus but don&#8217;t want to spend a fortune on Salesforce Commerce Cloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>To serve those customers, Fabric has built 32 separate applications which can be integrated with existing commerce tools, and which collectively cover everything from customer experience to product information and order management.</p>
<p>Masud argued that most other products billing themselves as headless e-commerce platforms are &#8220;jerry rigging themselves to become headless&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were built in 2007, they&#8217;re not flexible or modular,&#8221; he said, adding that while older platforms might require 18 months to on-board a large customer, Fabric only requires weeks.</p>
<p>The startup isn&#8217;t discouraging its customers from having a presence on Amazon and other marketplaces, either. But Masud (who was previously director of AmazonBasics and AmazonWarehouse) said they need to build their own differentiated shopping experiences and their own direct relationship with consumers at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I built AmazonBasics and AmazonBasics is coming for you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We encourage them to differentiate and continue their journey as a marketplace, building a direct business with their customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the new funding, Fabric will be able to expand its sales and marketing team while also continuing to improve the product. Masud said he&#8217;s less interested in reaching larger or smaller customers, and more interested in expansion by &#8220;building out a bigger suite co-pilot apps,&#8221; for example by doing more to support order logistics and fulfillment.</p>

<p><a href="http://symend.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Symend</a>, which builds behavioral analytics that integrate with customer engagement products to help identify customers having trouble paying bills, and then suggests payment alternatives to keep them from defaulting altogether, has picked up $43 million in funding.</p>
<p>The money is an extension to its Series B, closed in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/symend-raises-52m-to-help-mediate-when-customers-are-at-risk-of-defaulting-on-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May of last year</a>, bringing the total for the round to $95 million, and over $100 million for the Calgary, Canada startup since being founded in 2016.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Inovia Capital is leading this latest funding injection, with other unnamed investors participating.</p>
<p>Symend is not disclosing its valuation but Hanif Joshaghani, Symend&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Tiffany Kaminsky (the startups CMO), said that it comes on the heels of a &#8220;massive uptick&#8221; among enterprises investing in solutions to help support customers finding it hard to meet payments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Customer uncertainty has been extremely high and service providers don’t have the capacity to support the mass volumes of inquiries in a way that effectively resonates with and empathetically reassures customers,&#8221; he said in an interview.</p>
<p>The startup has been working primarily with clients in telecommunications, financial services, utilities and media and claims to have two-thirds of the major telecommunications providers in North America, as well as a multinational bank, as customers.</p>
<p>Last year, Symend said it was on track to work with 100 million customers (that is, customers of its clients) by the end of 2020, and we are asking the company whether it has passed that number.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s aim is twofold: it identifies when their customers are having trouble paying bills, and offers those customers alternatives beyond simple deferrals, which for many just put off addressing the issue.</p>
<p>At the same time, Symend&#8217;s solution is not just about avoiding deferrals: the company&#8217;s solutions aim to provide assistance and alternatives to companies that are seeing an overwhelming amount of traffic in its customer service operations.</p>
<p>Deferrals, however, remain a key point: Most service providers have been offering deferral periods this past year as their first-line approach to avoiding defaults. But Joshaghani said he believes that deferrals &#8220;can provide a false sense of financial security for customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>That, in part, is because those customers are usually deferring more than one bill.</p>
<p>A survey the company conducted in July among 500 of its users found a 27% increase in people falling behind in bill payments between April and July 2020, with those falling behind typically doing so on an average of three bills: 55% on at least one loan; 37% were behind on mortgage/rent; 21% were behind on their line of credit; 52% were behind on credit card payments.</p>
<p>Missing payments, and any personal financial trouble, is usually tied in with more than simply not having money: there can be job losses, illness, family trouble, and much more behind why someone finds himself or herself missing a bill deadline.</p>
<p>Symend therefore tries to take a sensitive approach both to identifying when problems are arising, and addressing them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given that Symend’s primary goal is to save customers from negative outcomes, we deployed strategies with our clients to ensure customers felt supported and empowered to act and avoid bills piling up through the deferral period,&#8221; Joshaghani noted. &#8220;By engaging customers with empathetic communications, self-serve tools and flexible repayment options, Symend has helped leading enterprises provide customers with a positive experience in an otherwise highly uncertain and stressful time. By empowering customers to act through digital tools, Symend alleviates pressure from overwhelmed call centres, increases customer satisfaction, lowers operating costs and helps customers resolve past due bills before they reach collections.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we have described before, Symend&#8217;s staff is around 25% behavioral science PhDs, but it does not go into a lot of detail about how it works, or the approach that it takes in evaluating customers. It uses data from businesses themselves, and combines that with third-party resources (not unlike the data trove that many AI-based fintechs might use to, say, weigh up the eligibility of a person for a particular loan at a particular interest rate).</p>
<p>Kaminsky notes that the last year of business has seen the company make more investments into its algorithms and analytics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using our behaviorally informed algorithms, Symend can identify and distinguish between key variations in customer behavior to personalize and optimize interactions based on the unique preferences of the individual,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Symend’s AI/ML model takes this a step further by combining insights from customer interactions with historical data on actions taken. These insights help Symend discover underlying psychological and behavioral traits to determine which engagement strategies will positively shape behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then to capture customer sentiment and further iterate on these strategies, she says that Symend uses NLP processing models to automatically categorize sentiment based on provided responses to communications and within self-serve tools. &#8220;Our metrics are shaped with the end goal of building a consistently positive brand experience that extends far beyond past due bills, which is why our AI/ML model uses sentiment analysis and engagement scoring,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This ultimately ensures that communications resonate with the customer’s unique and evolving needs, creating a consistently positive experience that retains customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Going ahead, the company is going to use the funding to continue hiring, in particular internationally, with a focus on opening up operations in Latin Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. It&#8217;s also going to be investing in expanding its products to include customer retention and acquisition tools, alongside more investment in expanding its product to help people avoid defaults on bills.</p>
<p>“We are big believers in Symend’s mission to add lasting value to enterprises, by helping their customers avoid collections,” said Dennis Kavelman, Partner at Inovia Capital, in a statement. “Their approach is differentiated and effective because it combines behavioral science and data science to drive a personalized approach for each customer. With this new investment, Symend is well funded to execute its strategy of scaling globally, and to partner with large enterprises in many industries.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Soon, your cloud photo backups could reside on beams of light transmitted between satellites instead of in huge, power-hungry server farms here on Earth. Startup <a href="https://www.lyteloop.com">LyteLoop</a> has spent the past five years doing tackling the physics challenges that can make that possible, and now it&#8217;s raised $40 million to help it leapfrog the remaining engineering hurdles to make its bold vision a reality.</p>
<p>LyteLoop&#8217;s new funding will provide it with enough runway to achieve its next major milestone: putting three prototype satellites equipped with its novel data storage technology into orbit within the next three years. The company intends to build and launch six of these, which will demonstrate how its laser-based storage medium operates on orbit.</p>
<p>I spoke to LyteLoop CEO Ohad Harlev about the company&#8217;s progress, technology and plans. Harlev said five years into its founding, the company is very confident in the science that underlies its data storage methods – and thrilled about the advantages it could offer over traditional data warehousing technology used today. Security, for instance, gets a big boost from LyteLoop&#8217;s storage paradigm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Everybody on every single data center has the same same possible maximum level of data security,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can provide an extra four layers of cyber security, and they&#8217;re all physics-based. Anything that can be applied on Earth, we can apply in our data center, but for example, the fact that we&#8217;re storing data on photons, we could put in quantum encryption, which others can&#8217;t. Plus, there are big security benefits because the data is in motion, in space, and moving at the speed of light.&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of security, LyteLoop&#8217;s model also offers benefits when it comes to privacy, because the data it&#8217;s storing is technically always in transit between satellites, which means it&#8217;ll be subject to an entirely different set of regulations vs. those that come into play when you&#8217;re talking about data which is warehoused on drives in storage facilities. LyteLoop also claims advantages in terms of access, because the storage and the network are one in the same, with the satellites able to provide their information to ground stations anywhere on Earth. Finally, Harlev points out that it&#8217;s incredibly power efficient, and also ecologically sound in terms of not requiring million of gallons of water for cooling, both significant downsides of our current data center storage practices.</p>
<p>On top of all of that, Harlev says that LyteLoop&#8217;s storage will not only be cost-competitive with current cloud-based storage solutions, but will in fact be more affordable – even without factoring in likely decreases to come in launch costs as SpaceX iterates on its own technology and more small satellite launch providers, including Virgin Orbit and Rocket Lab, come online and expand their capacity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although it&#8217;s more expensive to build and launch the satellite, it is still a lot cheaper to maintain them in the space,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So when we do a total cost of ownership calculation, we are cheaper, considerably cheaper, on a total cost of ownership basis. However [&#8230;] when we compare what the actual users can do, you know, we can definitely go to completely different pricing model.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlev is referring to the possibility of bundled pricing for combining storage and delivery – other providers would require that you supply the network, for instance, in order to move the data you&#8217;re storing. LyteLoop&#8217;s technology could also offset existing spend on reducing a company&#8217;s carbon footprint, because of its much-reduced ecological impact.</p>
<p>The company is focused squarely on getting its satellites to market, with a plan to take its proof of concept and expand that to a full production satellite roughly five years form now, with an initial service offering made available at that time. But LyteLoop&#8217;s tech could have equally exciting applications here on Earth. Harlev says that if you created a LyteLoop data center roughly the size of a football field, it would be roughly 500 times as efficient at storing data vs. traditional data warehousing.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s technology, which essentially stores data on photons instead of physical media, just requires far less matter than do our current ways of doing things, which not only helps its environmental impact, but which also makes it a much more sensible course for in-space storage when compared to physical media. The launch business is all about optimizing mass to orbit in order to reduce costs, and as Harlev notes, photons are massless.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SplashLearn, a 10-year-old U.S.-headquartered edtech startup that teaches children through a game-based curriculum, has raised $18 million in a new financing round as it looks to expand to more markets.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Owl Ventures led the Series C funding round in SplashLearn, and Accel, which had earlier invested $7 million in the startup’s Series B, also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, <a href="https://www.splashlearn.com">SplashLearn</a> co-founder and chief executive Arpit Jain said one of the biggest hurdles the education system faces today is that kids do not wish to learn, so you have to broach the subject in a way they find engaging.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>His startup offers math and reading courses to students in pre-kindergarten to grade five. It has developed, with guidance from teachers and other experts, over 4,000 games and other interactive activities to explain various concepts to the children.</p>
<p>In a demo, Jain showed an adventure game that was riddled with hurdles. A kid needed to visually apply the concept of addition to progress forward in the game. “When the kids are engaged, there is improvement in their learning outcome,” said Jain.</p>
<p>SplashLearn platform additionally provides 15 minutes to 20 minutes of personalized learning experience to each student every day, he said.</p>
<p>The startup charges $12 a month to parents for its service. Alternatively, the service is free for schools. Currently, one in every three schools in the United States use SplashLearn, Jain said.</p>
<p>“One of our goals has been to make quality education available to students for free. Our business model has enabled us to work on this,” he said. SplashLearn doesn’t reach out to schools, he said. Teachers use our platform, and if they like the offering, they make the case for wider adoption at the school, said Jain, who like the other three co-founders, is an alumni of IIT Kharagpur.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110659" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110659" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2110659 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/splashlearn.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110659" class="wp-caption-text">Image: SplashLearn</p></div></p>
<p>The team first created an edtech platform that was similar to what Coursera has evolved into over the past decade. But their previous venture failed to gain traction as the Indian market, which had fewer than 50 million internet users then, wasn’t ready for it, said Jain.</p>
<p>SplashLearn today caters to more than 40 million registered students on its platform, 10 million of whom joined last year as the coronavirus shut schools worldwide. More than 750,000 teachers have also joined the platform.</p>
<p>The startup is currently largely serving students in the United States, which accounts for 80% of its revenue. But students from over 150 other markets, including the UK, Australia, Canada and India use the platform today.</p>
<p>“SplashLearn is well poised to bring about a distinct change in the digital learning space with its unique blend of scientifically designed curriculum and its pedagogical methods with global appeal. SplashLearn fits into our objective of supporting innovative companies in the edtech space, helping drive a paradigm shift in the way education is imparted, bringing it to scale,” said Amit A. Patel Managing Director, Owl Ventures, in a statement. Patel is joining the SplashLearn’s board along with Abhinav Chaturvedi, a partner at Accel.</p>
<p>Last year, SplashLearn also started a tutoring service for kids, where teachers teach a group of three to five students. This service costs $10 to $25 an hour. “Even at this cost, we are offering the service at a fraction of what it would cost students in a private tuition,” he said.</p>
<p>The tutoring service is currently available in the U.S., and Jain said the startup plans to grow it within the country this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The lead data supervisor for a slew of tech giants in the European Union, including Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, TikTok and Twitter, is still relying on Lotus Notes to manage complaints and investigations lodged under the bloc&#8217;s flagship General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), per freedom of information requests made by the <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/internal-problems-exposed-at-irish-data-protection-commission/">Irish Council for Civil Liberties</a> (ICCL).</p>
<p>Back in its <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/sites/default/files/uploads/2018-11/Annual%20Report%202016.pdf">2016 annual report</a> Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) stated that one of its main goals for GDPR (and ePrivacy) readiness included &#8220;implementation of a new website and case-management system&#8221; in time for the regulation coming into force in May 2018. However some five years later this ITC upgrade project is still a work in progress, responses to the ICCL&#8217;s FOIs show.</p>

<p>&mdash; Johnny Ryan (@johnnyryan) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnyryan/status/1359038430429216768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Project deadlines were repeatedly missed, per <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6j78spx33zbq4wc/AACT_XVI5BqJyXEnG5aqG2bqa?dl=0">internal documents now in the public domain</a>, while by October 2020 the cost of the DPC&#8217;s ICT upgrade had more than doubled vs an initial projection &#8212; ballooning to at least €615,121 (a figure that excludes staff time spent on the project since 2016; and also does not include the cost of maintaining the antiquated Lotus Notes system which is borne by the Irish government&#8217;s Department of Justice).</p>
<p>The revelation that the lead data supervisor for much of big tech in Europe is handling complaints using such &#8216;last-gen&#8217; software not only looks highly embarrassing for the DPC but raises questions over the effectiveness of its senior management.</p>
<p>The DPC continues to face criticism over the slow pace of regulatory enforcement vis-a-vis big tech which, combined with the GDPR&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism, has led to a huge backlog of cases that the European Commission has conceded is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">weakness of the regulation</a>. So the revelation that it&#8217;s taking so long to get its own ITC in order will only fuel criticism that the regulator is not fit for purpose.</p>
<p>The wider issue here is the vast gulf in resources and technical expertise between tech giants, many of which are racking up vast profits off of people&#8217;s data that they can use to put toward paying armies of in-house lawyers to shield them from the risk of regulatory intervention, vs the tiny, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/brave-accuses-european-governments-of-gdpr-resourcing-failure/">under-resourced public sector agencies</a> tasked with defending users&#8217; rights &#8212; without appropriately modern tools to help them do the job.</p>
<p>In Ireland&#8217;s case, though, the length of time involved in overhauling its internal ICT does throw the spotlight on management of resources. Not least because the DPC&#8217;s budget and headcount has been growing since around 2015, as more resource have been allocated to it to reflect GDPR coming into application.</p>

<p>The ICCL is calling for the Irish government to consider hiring two additional commissioners &#8212; to supplement the current (sole) commissioner, Helen Dixon, who was appointed to the role back in 2014.</p>
<p>It notes that Irish law allows for the possibility of having three commissioners.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people who are supposed to make sure that Facebook and Google do not misuse the information that they have about each of us, are using a system so antiquated that one former staff member told me it is &#8216;like attempting to use an abacus to do payroll&#8217;,&#8221; Dr Johnny Ryan, an ICCL senior fellow, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The DPC is not configured for its digital mission,&#8221; he added in a statement. &#8220;What we have discovered indicates that it cannot run critically important internal technology projects. How can it be expected to monitor what the world’s biggest tech firms do with our data? This raises serious questions not only for the DPC, but for the Irish Government. We have alerted the Irish Government of the strategic economic risk from failing to enforce the GDPR.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reached for comment, the DPC told us it has a &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">functional and fit-for-purpose&#8221; Case Management System which it said has been &#8220;optimised with new features over the last number of years (including with capability for the generation of statistics and management reports)&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But it conceded the system is &#8220;dated&#8221; and &#8220;limited&#8221; in terms of how much it can be adapted for integration with a new DPC website and web forms and the IMI [information systems management] shared platform used between EU data protection authorities &#8212; given that it&#8217;s based on Lotus Notes technology. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Significant work in specifying the system and building its core modules has been completed,&#8221; deputy commission Graham Doyle said. &#8220;Some delays in delivery have occurred because of updates to specification of security and infrastructure elements. Some other elements have on demand from the DPC been slowed in order to allow for the resolution between EU DPAs of final intended processes such as those involved in the Article 60 cooperation and consistency mechanism under the GDPR.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPB [European Data Protection Board] is only now preparing internal guidance on the operationalisation of Article 60 and further on the dispute resolution mechanism under Article 65. These are key features of work between EU DPAs that require hand-offs between systems. In addition, the EU almost 3 years after it intended to has not yet adopted its new e-Privacy legislation. Further, the DPC alongside all other EU DPAs is learning how the procedural and operational aspects of the GDPR are to operate in fine detail and some of them remain to be settled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doyle added that &#8220;progress continues&#8221; on the new Case Management System investment &#8212; saying it&#8217;s the DPC&#8217;s intention that &#8220;initial core modules&#8221; of the new system will be rolled out in Q2 2021.</p>
<p>To date, Ireland&#8217;s regulator has only issued one decision pertaining to a cross-border GDPR complaint: In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">December</a> when it fined Twitter $550k over a security breach the company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/17/twitter-bug-revealed-some-android-users-private-tweets/">publicly disclosed in January 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Disagreement between Ireland and other EU DPAs over its initial enforcement proposal added months more to the decision process &#8212; and the DPC was finally forced to increase its suggested penalty by up to a few thousand euros following a majority vote.</p>
<p>The Twitter case was hardly smooth sailing but it actually represents a relatively rapid turnaround compared to the seven+ years involved in a separate (2013) complaint (aka Schrems II) &#8212; related to Facebook&#8217;s international data transfers which predates the GDPR.</p>
<p>With that complaint the DPC chose to go to court to raise concerns about the legality of the data transfer mechanism itself rather than acting on a specific complaint over Facebook&#8217;s use of Standard Contractual Clauses. A referral to the European Court of Justice followed and the EU&#8217;s highest court ended up torpedoing a flagship data transfer arrangement between the EU and the US.</p>
<p>Despite its legal challenge resulting in the EU-US Privacy Shield being struck down, the DPC still hasn&#8217;t pulled the plug on Facebook&#8217;s EU transfers. Although last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">September</a> it did issue a preliminary suspension order &#8212; which Facebook immediately challenged (and blocked, temporarily) via judicial review.</p>
<p>Last year the DPC settled a counter judicial review of its processes, brought by the original complainant, agreeing to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">swiftly finalize the complaint</a> &#8212; although a decision is still likely months out. But should finally come this year.</p>

<p>The DPC defends itself against accusations of enforcement foot-dragging by saying it must follow due process to ensure its decisions stand up to legal challenge.</p>
<p>But as criticism of the unit continues to mount revelations that its own flagship internal ICT upgrade is dragging on some five years after it was stated as a DPC priority will do nothing to silence critics.</p>
<p>Last week the EU parliament&#8217;s civil liberties committee issued a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/LIBE/RE/2021/02-04/1222135EN.pdf">draft motion</a> calling on the Commission to begin infringement proceedings against against Ireland &#8220;for not properly enforcing the GDPR&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the statement it wrote of &#8220;deep concern&#8221; that several complaints against breaches of the GDPR have not yet been decided by the Irish DPC despite GDPR coming into application in May 2018.</p>
<p>The LIBE committee also flagged the Schrems II Facebook transfers case &#8212; writing that it is concerned this case &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">was started by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, instead taking a decision within its powers pursuant to Article 58 GDPR&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also notable that the Commission&#8217;s latest plans for updating pan-EU platform regulations &#8212; the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act &#8212; propose to side-step the risk of enforcement bottlenecks by suggesting that key enforcement against the largest platforms should be brought in-house to avoid the risk of any single Member State agency standing in the way of cross-border enforcement of European citizens&#8217; data rights, as continues to happen with the GDPR.</p>

<p>Another quirk in relation to the Irish DPC is that the unit is not subject to the full range of freedom of information law. Instead the law only applies in respect of records concerning &#8220;the general administration of the Commission&#8221;. This means that its &#8220;supervisory, regulatory, consultation, complaint-handling or investigatory functions (including case files) are not releasable under the Act&#8221;, as it notes on its <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/who-we-are/corporate-governance/freedom-information">website</a>.</p>
<p>Freedom of information requests filed by TechCrunch last year &#8212; asking the DPC how many times it has used GDPR powers to impose a temporary or absolute ban on data processing &#8212; were refused by the regulator on these grounds.</p>
<p>Its refusal to disclose whether or not it has ever asked an infringing entity to stop processing personal data cited the partial coverage of FOI law, with the regulator saying &#8216;general administration&#8217; only refers to &#8220;records which have to do with the management of an FOI body such as records referring to personnel, pay matters, recruitment, accounts, information technology, accommodation, internal organization, office procedures and the like&#8221;.</p>
<p>While Ireland&#8217;s FOI law prevents closer scrutiny of the DPC&#8217;s activities, the agency&#8217;s enforcement record speaks for itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s been a profusion of startups emerging in the last year around the concept of rolling up smaller e-commerce businesses &#8212; operations that mainly sell and distribute their products on marketplace platforms like Amazon&#8217;s &#8212; using economies of scale to bring them together to run and grow them more efficiently.</p>
<p>Today, one of the latest of these, <a href="http://joinbranded.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Branded Group</a>, is coming out of stealth with a significant round of funding. The company has picked up $150 million and says that since quietly opening for business in mid-2020 it has already acquired 20 startups in categories like home, leisure and lifestyle across Europe, United States, and Asia.</p>
<p>The idea is that while the companies it acquires will continue to be sold and distributed via Amazon&#8217;s B2B service Fulfilled by Amazon (they are often referred to as FBA businesses), Branded will help with things like marketing, financing, operations expertise and technology to manage the business, provide business analytics and intelligence and so on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is being led by Target Global, which is being described as a &#8220;co-founder&#8221; of the startup, alongside the other two co-founders Pierre Poignant and Michael Ronen.</p>
<p>Other investors in the round include Declaration Partners, Tiger Global, Kreos Capital, Lurra Capital, Regah Ventures, Kima Ventures, and Vine Ventures, as well as individual investments from Marc Pincus (Founder of Zynga), Jon Oringer (Founder of Shutterstock), and a dozen other execs who have worked at retail giants like Amazon, Walmart, Alibaba and Lazada.</p>
<p>Branded is not disclosing the names of the 20 companies it has acquired &#8212; we have asked &#8212; but it claims to include some of the biggest companies selling home, leisure, and lifestyle products on Amazon.</p>
<p>Branded said they collectively generate $150 million in gross revenues annually. (This is the amount in sales prior to any cost-of-sale deductions, so not net revenue or nor profit.)</p>
<p>And in a market where reviews (for what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/ftc-brings-its-first-case-against-fake-paid-reviews-on-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they are worth</a>) are one of the key levers in convincing shoppers to buy one similar-looking product (sometimes the exact same product, in fact) over another, Branded says that its sellers have amassed a whopping 700,000 reviews.</p>
<p>One reason that Branded may not be talking about specific names in its stable is to keep some competitive strategic advantage, because the landscape of companies building roll-up outfits to bring smaller e-commerce businesses together is getting crowded very fast.</p>
<p>At the end of January, Berlin Brands Group &#8212; which itself is profitable and has not raised significant outside funding, yet &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> it would use $300 million+ off its balance sheet to by smaller companies. That came on the heels of U.S. competitor<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/thrasio-brings-in-500m-debt-facility-to-go-after-bigger-acquisitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thrasio </a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">raising $500 million in debt to use to buy companies, as well as significant rounds in the several months for </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SellerX</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/heyday-emerges-from-stealth-with-175m-series-a-funding-to-accelerate-marketplace-native-brands-15493868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heyday</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroes</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perch</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">There is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9a9cc7e0-e406-477c-bc15-28d6d250c29b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">well over $1 billion in capital</a> swimming around now among startups looking to be the consolidator-in-chief</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> among smaller sellers, who have build fledging businesses leaning on efficient marketplace services for marketing, distribution and logistics to get their products to buyers, but may not have bigger strategies for how to operate them in the longer term, or to grow them.</span></p>
<p>In that mix, though, there are some interesting details about the founders of Branded that speak to why it has attracted so much funding so soon, and the company&#8217;s potential ability to leverage that into a bigger business.</p>
<p>Poignant was the co-founder of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/lazada-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lazada</a> &#8212; the Asia-based Amazon clone backed by Rocket Internet, Alibaba and others &#8212; while Ronen was previously a managing partner at SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund in the U.S. (he left almost exactly a year ago, after the fund had <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2020/02/05/second-softbank-executive-plans-departure-from-troubled-conglomerate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started to come under a lot of scrutiny</a>). Branded&#8217;s pitch is that it can use that expertise in building online businesses to grow its stable of sellers and brands better than they might be able to do on their own.</p>
<p>“We are excited to leverage our e-commerce and business-building experience to create this next-generation multi-brand platform,&#8221; said Mr. Poignant in a statement. “Our team will provide unmatched operations, marketing, business development and supply chain expertise, serving as the partner of choice for entrepreneurs worldwide to scale their consumer brands and delight consumers on Amazon and beyond. Our global footprint, our team’s experience in scale-up growth, our strong access to capital, as well as the proprietary analytical tools and business intelligence capabilities we are building, uniquely position us to exponentially grow the best brands out there.”</p>
<p>The opportunity is a big one, it seems. It is estimated that there are some <a href="https://www.feedbackexpress.com/amazon-1029528-new-sellers-year-plus-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 million smaller sellers</a> on Amazon&#8217;s Marketplace, making up about half of all sales on the platform.</p>
<p>Similar to the other companies that are hoping to make a splash in the area of consolidating some of them, the pitch from Branded is that it&#8217;s able to find the most interesting of these to partner or buy in brands to help run them more efficiency and scale them to the next levels of growth.</p>
<p>That opportunity appears to be a particularly keen one at the moment. The global health pandemic has led to a huge shift towards online shopping, with consumers either choosing or being forced to use the internet to buy goods and services as regions enact lockdown orders or in other cases encourage people to stay away from crowded places to slow the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s spelled a lot of activity for retailers selling on digital platforms, although as a Perch founders once described it, not all sellers are prepared for or interested in exploring how to handle that kind of growth. That is the scenario that startups like Branded are hoping to tap, giving them a chance to grow a stable of brands on the back of proven consumer demand.</p>
<p>“Covid-19 has been a massive accelerator of consumers’ continuing shift to online shopping. We see fundamental changes in consumer behavior and purchase decision-making opening an opportunity to build a new type of consumer products leader with a digital-first mindset,&#8221; said Ben Kaminski, partner at Target Global who is also a co-founded at Branded as well as chairman of the board, in a statement. &#8220;Target Global has been a proud co-founder and investor in Branded. We are excited to jointly realize this unique opportunity, while becoming a home for some of the most talented sellers and entrepreneurs seeking to take their brands to the next level. I am excited to work with Pierre and Michael to realize Branded’s full potential.”</p>
<p>For now, it seems that Branded&#8217;s focus is mainly on Amazon &#8212; which remains the biggest company of its kind in the U.S. and has a strong presence in a number of other countries &#8212; but it&#8217;s notable that others in the space like Berlin Brands Group are looking beyond it for other marketplaces and even opportunities in direct-to-consumer brands that sell through their own sites to bring into the bigger roll-up strategy.</p>
<p>“Thanks to Amazon’s incredible investment in global logistics and leading technology, there are millions of third-party sellers worldwide on the Amazon marketplace,” said Mr. Ronen in a statement. “We are facing a generational opportunity to build Branded into the leading, digital-first consumer product goods (CPG) e-commerce platform, distilling the best among the $300 billion in revenue generated by businesses already thriving on Amazon’s marketplace. We will look to partner with and enable the most successful founders of high-potential brands to scale their operations globally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.finchcapital.com/">Finch Capital</a>, the early-stage fintech VC with a presence in London and Amsterdam, has raised a third fund. Targeting a final close of €150 million, the fund has already secured €85 million from LPs ready to deploy.</p>
<p>Out of Finch Capital “Europe III,” the VC will invest in fintech startups at the Series A and B stages, deemphasising its previous inclusion of seed. Specifically, it says it is on the lookout for “European category leaders,” and in particular those leveraging AI with €2-5 million in revenues &#8212; a company profile, the firm argues, that is currently seeing a funding gap. Noteworthy, in early 2020, Finch Capital added Google and DeepMind alum Steve Crossan as a venture partner.</p>
<p>As with its previous funds, Finch plans to back 15-20 European startups over the next three years, and candidly reveals it’s targeting liquidity (i.e. exits) “3-5 years post investment”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Although we have a relatively good hit rate on seed deals, the overall impact on the fund is small, as we have made the best returns on deals with €2-5 million in revenues,” Radboud Vlaar, MD Finch Capital, tells me. “This plays to our sweet spot as a team, to leverage our network to help companies to scale, which is harder in the earlier stages when the companies look for product market fit”.</p>
<p>On a potential funding gap, Vlaar says there is a lot of early-stage capital going to companies with €0.5-2 million in revenue, with the aim to get to €5 million and beyond in revenue quickly. And there is also a lot of capital chasing companies with €5-10 million in revenue. “In reality, B2B takes time and many companies are not growing linearly,” he observes. “They might have to adapt the team, strategy etc., on the way to cracking the market.</p>
<p>In addition, most of the U.S. or European growth firms prefer to see signs of a “winner takes all” market, which in Europe, due to its fragmented landscape, is more the exception than the rule, with a greater proportion of €100-500 million exits.</p>
<p>This means that Finch is seeing promising companies with “great products” that are facing a funding gap at €2-5 million in revenue, which the VC aims to plug. “Our strategy is fairly dynamic in terms of ownership but specific in terms of theme: we can aspire for 30-40% in certain companies as well as the more traditional stake of 15-25%,” adds Vlaar.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Finch’s current portfolio spans pure-play fintech, regtech and insurtech, and includes Trussle, Fourthline, Goodlord, Grab, Hiber, BUX, Twisto and Zopa. Exits include Salviol and Cermati, plus two exits currently unannounced or in progress.</p>
<p>In 2020 the firm launched &#8220;Flowrence,&#8221; its machine learning tool to help source and manage deal flow. Finch says that over the last SIX months, 20% of its shortlisted deals were sourced by Flowrence, especially useful during the current pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hoxtonfarms.com/">Hoxton Farms</a>, a U.K. startup that wants to produce animal fat without using animals, has raised £2.7 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The round is led by Founders Fund, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm founded by Peter Thiel. Also participating is Backed, Presight Capital, CPT Capital and Sustainable Food Ventures.</p>
<p>Still at the R&amp;D stage, Hoxton Farms says it will use the funding to grow its interdisciplinary science team in a new purpose-built lab in London’s Old Street. “[We] will be working towards a scalable prototype of our cultivated fat over the next year to 18 months,” co-founder and mathematician Ed Steele tells me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He started the company with longtime school friend Dr Max Jamilly, who has two degrees in biotechnology and a PhD in synthetic biology (the pair met at pre-school). “I spent my PhD using a genome editing technology called CRISPR to discover better treatments for children&#8217;s leukaemia,” says Jamilly. “Along the way, I learnt how to grow complex cells at scale &#8212; a fundamental part of the scientific challenge that we face at Hoxton Farms”.</p>
<p>Like other companies in the meat alternative space, the startup is founded on the premise that the traditional meat industry is unsustainable. This is seeing demand for meat alternatives soaring, but, argues Steele, these products still aren’t good enough. “They don’t taste right and they aren’t healthy. They are missing the key ingredient: fat,” he says. And, of course, it&#8217;s fat that gives meat most of its flavour.</p>
<p>However, meat alternatives typically use plant oils as a fat replacement, which has a number of drawbacks. Some oils are bad for the environment, such as coconut and palm oil, and most lack flavour.</p>
<p>“At Hoxton Farms, we grow real animal fat without the animals,” explains Steele. “Starting from just a few cells, we grow purified animal fat in bioreactors to produce cultivated fat, a cruelty-free and sustainable ingredient that will finally unlock meat alternatives that look, cook and taste like the real thing&#8221;.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Future Fields is tackling cultured meat&#8217;s biggest problem&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/02/future-fields-is-tackling-cultured-meats-biggest-problem/embed/#?secret=veTc7mPdqt" data-secret="veTc7mPdqt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Furthermore, he says that current techniques for culturing animal cells are too expensive. Hoxton Farms is using mathematical and computational modelling to &#8220;massively reduce the cost of cell culture,&#8221; which the company believes will result in a production process “that is cost-effective at scale”.</p>
<p>“We’re combining the latest techniques from computational biology and tissue engineering to do science that wasn’t possible a few years ago,” says Steele. “What sets us apart is the fundamental philosophy that the only way to grow cells cost-effectively at scale is to combine the power of mathematical modelling with synthetic biology”.</p>
<p>It’s envisioned that his computational approach will not only help it compete with other companies working on the same problem &#8212; competitors include Mission Barns in the U.S. and Peace of Meat in Belgium/Israel &#8212; but also enable it to customise fats for different manufacturers. This could include fine tuning the taste profile, physical properties (melting temperature, density, etc.) and nutritional profile (saturated/unsaturated fatty acid ratio etc.).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hoxton Farms’ early customers will be plant-based meat companies who seek a more sustainable and flavoursome alternative to plant oils. Much further into the future, the startup will target cultivated meat companies that grow muscle cells but still need a source of fat, and other industries, such as bakery, confectionery and cosmetics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Tesla, which is seeing rapid growth in China as it ramps up local manufacturing capacity, has been called upon by the Chinese government for talks over quality issues in its electric cars.</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>A group of Chinese authorities, including the country’s top market regulator, cyberspace watchdog and transportation authority, held talks with Tesla after consumers complained about acceleration irregularities, battery fire, software upgrade failures and other vehicle problems, according to a government <a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202102/t20210208_326012.html">notice</a> posted late Monday.</p>
<p>Tesla <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/3615027564/4602446846363896">said</a> on microblogging platform Weibo that it “sincerely accepts the government departments’ guidance” and will “strictly comply with Chinese laws.” It will also work to strengthen its “internal operational structure and workflow” under the direction of the regulators in order to ensure safety and consumer rights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While its popularity surged in China over the past few years, Tesla has made a series of recalls due to faulty parts or functions in the country. Just before its meeting with the government, the American EV giant recalled 20,428 imported Model S vehicles and 15,698 units of imported Model X, China’s market regulator <a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/zw/zh/202102/t20210205_325916.html">announced</a> last week.</p>
<p>China is an increasingly important and the second-largest market for Tesla. The Gigafactory in Shanghai, where Tesla enjoys tax breaks granted by the local municipal government, has allowed the carmaker to localize procurement and production, thus driving down prices in products like Model 3.</p>
<p>China contributed $6.66 billion in revenue for Tesla in 2020, more than doubling the amount from a year before, and accounted for more than 20% of the firm’s total revenues, according to Tesla’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm">filing</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week. In 2019, China made up just around 12% of Tesla’s revenues.</p>
<p>Tesla is competing with a handful of well-financed and indigenous electric car startups in China such as Nio and Xpeng, which are both listed in the U.S. For comparison, Xpeng shipped a total of 27,041 vehicles in 2020, while Nio topped that with 43,728 units shipped. These numbers are still fractions of Tesla’s total delivery, which reached 499,647 vehicles in the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.lanzajet.com/">LanzaJet</a>, the renewable jet fuel startup spun out from the longtime renewable and synthetic fuel manufacturer, <a href="https://www.lanzatech.com/">LanzaTech</a>, has inked a supply agreement with British Airways to supply the company with at least 7500 tons of fuel additive per yer.</p>
<p>The deal marks the second agreement between the UK-based airline and a renewable jet fuels manufacturer <a href="https://www.velocys.com/2019/08/20/plans-submitted-for-the-first-waste-to-jet-fuel-plant-in-the-uk-and-europe/">following an August 2019 agreement with the British company Velocys</a>. It&#8217;s also LanzaJet&#8217;s second offtake agreement. The company announced itself with a partnership between the renewable fuels manufacturer and the Japanese airline ANA.</p>
<p>Through the deal, British Airways will invest an undisclosed amount in LanzaJet&#8217;s first commercial scale facility in Georgia. The fuel will being powering flights by the end of 2022 the companies said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s part of a broader expansion effort that could see LanzaJet establish a commercial facility for the UK airline in its home country in the coming years.</p>
<p>Back in the U.S. the plan is to begin construction on the Georgia facility later this year which will convert ethanol into a jet fuel additive using a chemical process.</p>
<p>Fuel from the plant will reduce the overall greenhouse emissions by 70 percent versus traditional jet fuel. It&#8217;s the equivalent of taking almost 27,000 gasoline or diesel-powered cars of the orad each year, according to the company.</p>
<p>The deal is the culmination of years of research and development work between LanzaJet&#8217;s parent company, LanzaTech and Department of Energy&#8217;s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/lanzajet-launches-to-make-renewable-jet-fuel-a-reality/">Spun off in June 2020</a>, LanzaJet was financed by an investment group including parent company LanzaTech, <a href="https://www.mitsui.com/jp/en/index.html">Mitsui</a>, and <a href="https://www.lanzatech.com/">Suncor Energy</a>. British AIrways now joins the two other strategic investors as LanzaJet eyes an ambitious scale up program through 2025. The company plans to launch four large scale plants producing a pipeline of renewable fuels. <b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Low-cost, sustainable fuel options are critical for the future of the aviation sector  and the LanzaJet process offers the most flexible feedstock solution at scale, recycling wastes and  residues into SAF that allows us to keep fossil jet fuel in the ground. British Airways has long been a  champion of waste to fuels pathways especially with the UK Government,&#8221; said Jimmy Samartzis, the chief executive of LanzaJet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;With the right support for  waste-based fuels, the UK would be an ideal location for commercial scale LanzaJet plants. We look  forward to continuing the dialogue with BA and the UK Government in making this a reality, and to  continuing our support of bringing the Prime Minister’s Jet Zero vision to life.&#8221;  </span></p>
<p>The LanzaJet fuel is certified for commercial flight up to 50% blend with conventional kerosene. &#8220;Considering the aviation market is 90 billion gallons of jet fuel a year, having 50% or 45 billion of production capacity and reaching that max blend level will be a great problem to have,&#8221; said LanzaTech chief executive Jennifer Holmgren in an email.</p>
<p>LanzaJet&#8217;s manufacturing facility in Georgia is designed to produce zero-waste fuels, according to Holmgren, and British Airways will receive 7,500 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel from LanzaJet&#8217;s biorefinery each year for the next 5 years.</p>
<p>The partnership between British Airways, Hangar 51, International Airlines Group&#8217;s accelerator and others.</p>
<p>In addition to its biofuel work, British Airways is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/zeroavias-hydrogen-powered-vision-for-aviation-nets-21-4-million-from-amazon-shell-and-bill-gates-backed-fund/">working with companies like ZeroAvia</a>, the hydrogen fuels company that also received backing from Amazon, Shell, and Breakthrough Energy Ventures.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For  the last 100 years we have connected Britain with the world and the world with Britain, and to  ensure our success for the next 100, we must do this sustainably,&#8221; said British Airways chief executive Sean Doyle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Progressing the development and commercial deployment of sustainable aviation fuel is crucial to  decarbonising the aviation industry and this partnership with LanzaJet shows the progress British  Airways is making as we continue on our journey to net zero.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://maya.com.bd/">Maya</a> is dedicated to making it easier for women to get healthcare, especially for sensitive issues like reproductive and mental health. Now the startup, based in Bangladesh and incorporated in Singapore, is expanding into new countries. Maya announced today it has raised $2.2 million in seed funding, which it said is the largest raised by a Bangladeshi health tech company so far. The round was led by early-stage fund Anchorless Bangladesh and The Osiris Group, a private equity firm focused on impact investing in Asian markets.</p>
<p>The funding will be used to introduce new products to Maya&#8217;s telehealth platform and on its international expansion. Maya recently launched in Sri Lanka and has started testing its service in India, Pakistan and Middle Eastern countries. It is also planning to enter Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Maya uses natural language processing and machine learning technology for its digital assistant, which answers basic health-related questions and decides if users need to be routed to human experts. It has about 10 million unique users and currently counts more than 300 licensed healthcare providers on its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founder and chief executive officer Ivy Huq Russell, who grew up in Chittagong and Dhaka before moving to the United Kingdom for university, started Maya as a blog with healthcare information in 2011. At the time, Russell worked in finance. She had just given birth to her first child and her mother had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. Russell told TechCrunch she realized how many challenges there were to seeking medical care in Bangladesh, including financial barriers, a shortage of providers and long travel times to clinics.</p>
<p>She began Maya with the goal of providing trustworthy health information, but quickly realized that the site&#8217;s visitors needed more support. Many sent messages through WhatsApp, email or the site&#8217;s chat box, including survivors of sexual abuse, rape and domestic violence. After receiving a grant from BRAC, a Bangladeshi non-governmental organization, Maya&#8217;s team began developing an app to connect users with medical information and experts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110583" style="width: 427px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110583" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2110583" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?w=417" alt="Bangladesh-based healthcare app Maya's homescreen" width="417" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg 1684w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?resize=92,150 92w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?resize=184,300 184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?resize=768,1253 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?resize=417,680 417w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?resize=941,1536 941w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?resize=1255,2048 1255w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Homescreen-v2.jpg?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2110583" class="wp-caption-text">Maya&#8217;s homescreen</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We were very focused on two things,&#8221; Russell said. &#8220;One is how do we built trust in our community, in their language, because it&#8217;s very important that they communicate in the language that they&#8217;re comfortable using. At the same time, we realized as soon as we started getting hundreds and hundreds of questions, that we&#8217;re not going to be able to scale up if we just have 50 experts on computers typing.&#8221;</p>
<p>To support Bengali and regional dialects, Maya spent more than two years focused on developing its natural language processing technology. It collaborated with data scientists and linguists and took part in Google Launchpad&#8217;s accelerator program, working on tokenization and training its machine learning algorithms. Now Maya is able to provide automated answers in Bengali to basic questions in 50 topics with about 95% accuracy, Russell said. Out of the four million queries the platform has handled so far, about half were answered by its AI tech. It has also worked on NLP technology to support Urdu, Hindi and Arabic.</p>
<p>Many have to do with sexual or reproductive health and the platform has also seen an increase in questions about mental health. These are topics users are often hesitant seeking in-person consultations for.</p>
<p>&#8220;Growing up in Bangladesh, we got minimum sexual education. There&#8217;s no curriculum at school. Recently in the last one or two years, we&#8217;ve also started to see a lot of mental health questions, because I think we&#8217;ve made a good drive toward talking about mental health,&#8221; said Russell. She added, &#8220;it’s quite natural that whatever they couldn&#8217;t go and ask a question about very openly in traditional healthcare systems, they come and ask us.&#8221;</p>
<p>More consultations are coming from men, too, who now make up about 30% of Maya’s users. Many ask questions about birth control and family planning, or how to support their partners&#8217; medical issues. To protect users&#8217; privacy, consultations are end-to-end encrypted, and experts only see a randomly-generated ID instead of personal information.</p>

<p>In order to understand if someone needs to be routed to a human expert, Maya&#8217;s algorithms considers the length, complexity and urgency of queries, based on their tone. For example, if someone types &#8220;please, please, please help me,&#8221; they automatically get directed to a person. The majority of questions about mental health are also sent to an expert.</p>
<p>Russell said Maya&#8217;s approach is to take a holistic approach to physical health and mental wellness, instead of treating them as separate issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;People don&#8217;t just ask about physical health issues. They also ask things like, &#8216;I wear a hijab and I want to go for a run, but I feel really awkward,'&#8221; said Russell. &#8220;It sounds like a very normal question, but it&#8217;s actually quite a loaded question, because it&#8217;s affecting their mental health on a day-to-day basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the company’s goals is to make the app feel accessible, so people feel more comfortable seeking support. &#8220;We&#8217;ve literally have had sweets delivered to our office when a user has a baby,&#8221; Russell said. &#8220;These are the personal touches that I think Maya has delivered in terms of dealing with both physical as well as mental health conditions combined together.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is currently working with different monetization models. One is business-to-business sales, positioning Maya as a software-as-a-service platform that employers can offer to workers as a benefit. Garment manufacturing is one of Bangladesh&#8217;s <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/987683/bangladesh-garment-share-total-exports/">biggest export sectors</a>, and many workers are young women, fitting Maya’s typical user profile. The startup has worked with Marks and Spencer, Primark and the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturer and Exporters Association (BGMEA).</p>
<p>Another B2B route is partnering with insurance providers who offer Maya as a benefit. On the direct-to-consumer side, Maya recently launched premium services, including in-app video consultations and prescription delivery. Demand increased sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it now handles about one consultation every ten seconds. Russell expects many users to continue using telehealth services even after the pandemic subsides.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve really seen the advantage of just having a doctor right in front of you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;For people with chronic conditions, it&#8217;s easier because they don&#8217;t have to go somewhere every week, and the fact they have monitoring and their history gathered is helpful for regular users, too.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reddit has raised a new funding round, totalling $250 million. This is the company&#8217;s Series E round of financing, and it comes hot on the heels of renewed public attention on the site that has dubbed itself &#8216;the front page of the Internet,&#8217; owing to the role the subreddit r/WallStreetBets played in the recent meteoric rise (and subsequent steep fall) of the value of GameStop stock. Reddit also ran a 5-second Super Bowl ad on Sunday, consisting of a single static image that looked like a standard post on the network itself.</p>
<p>This is Reddit&#8217;s 16th year of operation, and the company has raised around $800 million to date, including a Tencent-led $300 million Series D in February, 2019. Today&#8217;s round included financing from &#8220;existing and new investors,&#8221; Reddit noted in a <a href="https://redditblog.com/2021/02/08/fueling-reddits-future/">blog post in which it announced the funding</a>.</p>
<p>In the post, Reddit notes that the company felt &#8220;now was the right opportunity to make strategic investments in Reddit including video, advertising, consumer products and expanding into international markets.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2110580" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110580" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2110580" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210207205820-reddit-superbowl-ad-exlarge-169.jpg" alt="" width="780" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210207205820-reddit-superbowl-ad-exlarge-169.jpg 780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210207205820-reddit-superbowl-ad-exlarge-169.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210207205820-reddit-superbowl-ad-exlarge-169.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210207205820-reddit-superbowl-ad-exlarge-169.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210207205820-reddit-superbowl-ad-exlarge-169.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210207205820-reddit-superbowl-ad-exlarge-169.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110580" class="wp-caption-text">Reddit&#8217;s 5-second Super Bowl ad.</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how the round came together exactly, but given the network&#8217;s time in the spotlight over the past few weeks, culminating in yesterday&#8217;s very brief, but also very memorable and high-profile ad, it seems likely it was at least finalized fast in order to help the company make the most of its time in the spotlight.</p>
<p>In terms of what kind of specific moves Reddit could make with its new cash on hand, the blog post also name-checked its acquisition late last year of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/reddit-acquires-dubsmash/">short video sharing platform Dubsmash</a>, and announced plans to double its team over the course of this year with new hires.</p>

<p>Reddit&#8217;s long history has also included some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/21/reddit-is-still-in-turmoil/">significant tumult</a>, and efforts to clean up its act in order to present a better face to advertisers, and to potential new community members.</p>
<p>The network still struggles with balancing its commitments to fostering a home for a range of communities with the potential for hate speech and discrimination to take root within some of these. And it was also in the news earlier this year for finally banning controversial subreddit r/donaldtrump following &#8220;repeat´d policy violations&#8221; surrounding the attempted insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by a mob of domestic terrorists.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dayna Grayson and Rachel Holt seemingly didn&#8217;t have the best timing. It was late in 2019 when the two, who met six years ago in Washington through a mutual acquaintance, decided to act on earlier conversations and start a fund together called <a href="https://constructcap.com/">Construct Capital</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Grayson spied an opportunity to create a new venture brand that focused largely on the types of <a href="https://www.desktopmetal.com/">manufacturing-related deals</a> that she was funding inside of the investing giant, NEA, which she joined in 2012.</p>
<p>Holt, who&#8217;d joined Uber in 2011, rising from a city general manager in Washington to the eventual head of the company&#8217;s mobility unit in 2018, was also ready for a change and excited about the prospect of investing full time, having been brought into NEA by Grayson to scout out nascent deals on the side.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Of course, we didn&#8217;t expect COVID,&#8221; Holt says now. Still, it didn&#8217;t stop them from moving forward with fundraising and, in the process, securing $140 million in capital commitments from what Holt describes as &#8220;the typical kind of institutional LP base, including endowments, foundations,&#8221; and also some peers, including Aileen Lee of Cowboy Ventures, Josh Kopelman of First Round, and Grayson&#8217;s former NEA colleague, Scott Sandell.</p>
<p>Construct, which is focused primarily on five themes &#8212;  decentralized manufacturing, supply chain visibility, automation, transportation and mobility &#8212; is already actively writing checks, in fact. Among the companies it has backed are <a href="https://chefrobotics.ai/">Chef Robotics</a>, a startup focused on assembling food at high throughput; <a href="https://www.copia.io/">Copia</a>, an outfit whose tools aim to empower engineers to streamline workflows, increase productivity, and decrease downtime; and <a href="https://www.chargelab.co/">ChargeLab</a>, a maker of electric vehicle charging software that Holt likens to the &#8220;Android of the charging market.&#8221;</p>
<p>To get a better sense of the types of startups that might be ideal for the firm going forward, we talked earlier with the pair, who recently signed a lease in D.C. for their team (Construct also has <a href="https://constructcap.com/#team">two junior investors</a>), and who were together today at Holt&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>Parts of that conversation follow, edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Rachel, what startups did you identify for NEA and how do they fit into your point of view as an investor?</strong></p>
<p>RH: I was always attracted to business solving real-world problems, so among the investments [I made as a scout for] NEA is an auto-refinancing company called <a href="https://www.motorefi.com/">MotoRefi</a> because that was a problem I saw firsthand, talking with Uber drivers. I&#8217;m still on the board of that company.</p>
<p>But Dayna and I have both been attracted to what we called foundational industries. I saw [opportunities] on the transportation side, on the supply chain side on the logistics side [at Uber]. When we were running Jump [as part of the mobility unit of Uber], we were building an e-bike, which is actually a pretty complicated piece of equipment to pull together, and you would see that something had left a factory in China, then you would lose track of it for five weeks, then you would see that it entered a port in the U.S., and then you would lose track of it again and I knew there had to be a better way . . . and I think COVID only highlights the urgency around some of the cracks in the system.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Right. I think we&#8217;ve all been stunned by the supply chain issues as they related to the vaccines and PPE, certainly. Are you focused on global supply chain opportunities or just domestically?</strong></p>
<p>DG: We&#8217;re primarily focused domestically. We will do investments in Canada and occasionally in Europe. We wouldn&#8217;t [invest in] Asia without some more dedicated personnel there, and that&#8217;s not in the scope right now.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;ve seen in COVID is just a huge acceleration of consumer demand, so if you&#8217;re a brand or an e-tailor and you were planning all these upgrades to meet that demand two years from now, that&#8217;s happening today, so it&#8217;s really put a crunch on the system. A company like <a href="https://www.tradeswell.com/">Tradeswell</a> &#8212; which is one of our investments &#8212; brings data visibility across the supply chain, from where sales are happening online to how they&#8217;re being fulfilled in inventory. That&#8217;s something that analysts and agencies could help you do, but when you&#8217;re looking at just the crunch of having to have that real-time urgency and information at your fingertips, you can&#8217;t wait for human intervention anymore. You have to automate.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You invested in Tradeswell&#8217;s seed round and its Series A. Will that be typical going forward? Relatedly, what size checks will you be writing and how much ownership will you be targeting when you invest in a company?</strong></p>
<p>RH: Our typical size is $2 million to $6 million checks. We like to lead those those rounds, but they can be part of a round that goes up to, say, $12 million.</p>
<p>DG: As for ownership, something reasonable is close to 15%. We&#8217;re not going to have a huge portfolio. Every company really matters to the fund. We&#8217;re not gonna have a huge portfolio. Every company really matters to the fund; every company receives dedicated time and attention from us. There isn&#8217;t a cookie cutter approach where if you work with Construct, you get X. It depends on the entrepreneur and what they need.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How important are board seats to you both?</strong></p>
<p>RH: What&#8217;s more important to us is meeting the company where they are and understanding what the entrepreneur needs and how we can add value.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re in Washington. As investors who focus on what you do, is there any special advantage to being there?</strong></p>
<p>DG: We&#8217;re investing nationally. If we find great projects here, we&#8217;d love to be involved, but of our first investments, two are in the Bay Area and two are on the East Coast.</p>
<p>RH: Dayna [had been operating remotely at times before COVID] and I was running teams in the U.S and Canada [at Uber]. We don&#8217;t have a backyard bias.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So you&#8217;re likely to do more remotely, even after the world returns to normal.</strong></p>
<p>DG: I definitely think some things are here to stay, and that it&#8217;s great for founders. Their ability to engage investors over Zoom, whether they&#8217;re down the street or across the globe, is really in their interest and I&#8217;m glad to see a more efficient fundraise happen for a lot of them.</p>
<p>RH: I think for entrepreneurs, trying to find the best fit for what they are building, versus just who is the person they know because they run into them at the gym, is a big net positive [to come out of this whole thing]. It also enables them to build companies in the place where they&#8217;re best-suited to build the company, rather than indexing for where they&#8217;ll be seen from a funding perspective.</p>

<p>As a standard bearer for the consumer electric vehicle industry and the broader climate tech movement rallying around it, Tesla&#8217;s bet to go all in on crypto could damage its climate bonafides and its reputation with customers even as other automakers pour in to the EV market.</p>

<p>Given Bitcoin&#8217;s current environmental footprint, the deal flies in the face of Tesla&#8217;s purported interest in moving the world to cleaner sources of energy and commerce.</p>
<p>Until the energy grid decarbonizes in places like Russia and China, mining bitcoin remains a pretty dirty business (from an energy perspective), according to some energy investors who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about Musk&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were talking about people doing this in Russia back in 2018 and how they were tapping coal power to run their mining operations,&#8221; one investor said. &#8220;The cost per transaction from an energy intensity standpoint has only gotten more intense. I don’t see how those things coalesce, climate and crypto.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The stake makes Tesla one of the largest corporate hodlers of Bitcoin but represents a massive portion of the company&#8217;s $19 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the size of their treasury it feels irresponsible, IMO,&#8221; wrote one investor whose firm backed Tesla from its earliest days. The company&#8217;s move could be seen as another example of the absurdity of U.S. capital markets in today&#8217;s investment climate &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/what-are-these-rich-people-doing-pumping-crappy-assets/">and the underlying cynicism of some of its biggest beneficiaries</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin investors welcomed the move, which sent the value of their holdings rocketing up by roughly 18% over the course of the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;The announcement that Tesla has diversified its treasury through the addition of bitcoin is not surprising, nor is the assuredness implied by an 8% allocation of cash-on-hand. Equal to Tesla’s R&amp;D expenditure for 2020, this investment is significant to the Company and shows a commitment to maximizing shareholder returns,&#8221; wrote Stillmark founding partner Alyse Killeen. &#8220;Elon Musk has a long history of operating at the precipice of what’s possible technically and setting the trend of what’s to later become common operationally. I suspect the same will be true here, and that Tesla is the first of a larger cohort of publicly-traded companies that will aim to optimize the returns of their cash via bitcoin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Industry observers on Wall Street also criticized the company&#8217;s big bet on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tesla buying $1.5 billion in BTC is interesting. Am assuming they haven&#8217;t hedged it, so they will either be cash rich in the future or have a hole in the balance sheet. Elon Musk stays wild,&#8221; wrote one capital planning executive at a major Wall Street bank who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the press. &#8220;[It&#8217;s] not dissimilar from a large company throwing cash into a wildly volatile emerging market currency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, in the short term, the deal is showing dividends. The price of Bitcoin has risen nearly $8,000, or 18.73%, over the course of the day since Tesla made its announcement.</p>
<p>But the investment represents the equivalent of the company&#8217;s entire research and development budget, as Killeen noted. That&#8217;s&#8230; something. There&#8217;s also the question is whether any regulator will step in to punish Musk.</p>
<p>Musk has been tweeting his support for Bitcoin and other, more arcane (or useless) cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin for the past several weeks, in what seems to be a violation of his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/26/elon-musk-sec-agree-to-guidelines-on-twitter-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s richest man has previously been fined by regulatory agencies for his tweeting habits. Back in 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/27/here-is-the-sec-complaint-against-elon-musk-and-tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SEC charged Musk with fraud for tweets</a> about privatizing the electric vehicle company at $420 per share.</p>
<div class="group">
<p>Musk eventually settled with the SEC, at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/29/elon-musk-agrees-to-resign-as-tesla-chairman-in-settlement-with-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price of his role as chairman of Tesla&#8217;s board</a> and a $20 million personal fine &#8212; with Tesla paying out another $20 million to the SEC.</p>
<p>The volatility of the cryptocurrency could impact more than just Tesla&#8217;s bottom line, but also hit its customers should they use the currency to buy cars.</p>
</div>
<p>“Bitcoin jumped over 15% to a new high of $44,000 on Monday. This sort of hype-based price power should be worrying to investors and consumers alike &#8211; especially if this is to be used as medium of exchange,&#8221; wrote GlobalData analyst Danyaal Rashid, Head of Thematic Research at GlobalData.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Elon Musk can help dictate the price of this asset with a tweet or large order, the same could happen to send the price back down. The task of purchasing a vehicle should not be speculative. Consumers who may have thought of buying bitcoin to use as a substitute for fiat – could very easily end up with more or less than they bargained for.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cynthia Perry, a former design research senior manager at Salesforce who left earlier this month, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6763264995485728768/">posted her resignation letter</a> on LinkedIn that detailed her negative treatment at the company, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/salesforces-benioff-diversity-inclusion-woes">Protocol first reported</a>. In it, Perry, a Black woman, alleges she experienced &#8220;countless microaggressions and inequity&#8221; during her time there.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Perry said she left her job because she had been &#8220;Gaslit, manipulated, bullied, neglected, and mostly unsupported&#8221; by folks she chose not to name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Salesforce, for me, is not a safe place to come to work,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a place where I can be my full self. It&#8217;s not a place where I have been invested in. It&#8217;s not a place full of opportunity. It&#8217;s not a place of Equality for All. It&#8217;s not a place where well-being matters.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Salesforce has long been vocal about the importance of equality. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/15/tony-prophet-named-as-salesforces-first-chief-equality-officer/">In 2016</a>, Salesforce named Tony Prophet as its first-ever chief equality officer. That came about a year after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said its major diversity focus was &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/14/slack-engineer-erica-baker-diversity-efforts-need-to-extend-beyond-gender/?_ga=2.41637990.573523786.1612804300-1057749772.1591641289">the women&#8217;s issue.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>Salesforce was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/unpacking-techs-response-to-george-floyds-death/">one of the many companies that came out in support of Black people</a> in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now more than ever we must support one another as allies and speak up for justice and equality,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/salesforce/status/1266066647275757568">the company said in a tweet</a>.</p>
<p>But companywide, Salesforce is just 3.4% Black in the U.S., while its leadership team is only 2.3% Black, <a href="https://equalitydata.herokuapp.com/">according to its November 2020 diversity report</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;For privacy reasons, we can&#8217;t comment on individual employee matters but Equality is one of our highest values and we have been dedicated to its advancement both inside and outside of our company since we were founded almost 22 years ago,&#8221; a Salesforce spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Perry is the latest Black female tech worker to speak out about her negative experience at a tech company. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/pinterests-22-5m-settlement-highlights-techs-inequities-say-former-employees-who-alleged-discrimination/">Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks came forward with allegations of racial and gender discrimination at Pinterest</a>. Then, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/">Dr. Timnit Gebru said she was fired</a> for speaking out about diversity issues in artificial intelligence at Google. That was shortly before Google former diversity recruiter <a href="https://twitter.com/RealAbril/status/1341135824730013696">April Curley alleged Google fired her</a> for calling the company out &#8220;on their racist bullshit.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vaccine misinformation has been around since well before the pandemic, but ensuring that anti-scientific conspiracies don&#8217;t get boosted online is more crucial than ever as the world races against the spread of a deadly, changing virus.</p>
<p>Now, Facebook says it will expand the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/#removing-more-false-claims">criteria it uses to take down false vaccine claims</a>. Under the new rules, which Facebook said it made in consultation with groups like the World Health Organization, the company will remove posts claiming that COVID-19 vaccines aren&#8217;t effective, that it&#8217;s &#8220;safer to get the disease&#8221; and the widely debunked longstanding anti-vaxxer claim that vaccines could cause autism.</p>
<p>Facebook says it will place a &#8220;particular focus&#8221; on enforcement against Pages, groups and accounts that break the rules, noting that they may be removed from the platform outright.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In the coming weeks we&#39;ll be making it harder to find accounts in search that discourage people from getting vaccinated on Instagram. These changes won&#39;t happen overnight, but will help keep our community safe and informed, especially as more claims around the vaccine emerge.</p>
<p>&mdash; Adam Mosseri <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f637.png" alt="😷" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@mosseri) <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1358851016553332738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Facebook took steps to<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/coronavirus/#latest"> limit COVID-19 vaccine misinformation in December</a>, preparing the platform for the vaccine rollout while still lagging well behind the rampant spread of anti-vaccine claims. The company began removing posts containing some misinformation about the vaccine, including &#8220;false claims that COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips&#8221; and content claiming that the vaccine is being tested on portions of the population without their consent.</p>
<p>Why this kind of stuff didn&#8217;t already fall under Facebook&#8217;s rules against COVID-19 misinformation is anyone&#8217;s guess. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/facebook-coronavirus-information-center-zuckerberg/">came out of the gate early</a> in the pandemic with a new set of policies intended to prevent an explosion of potentially deadly COVID-related conspiracies, but <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/covid-19-vaccines-face-varied-powerful-misinformation-movement-online-n1249378">time</a> and <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/facebook_coronavirus_vaccine_misinformation.php">time again</a> the company fails to evenly and firmly enforce its own rules.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Income-share agreements, or ISAs, have been gathering force as an alternative financial model for students, particularly at non-traditional schools like coding boot camps and trade schools. We’ve done <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/31/how-income-share-agreements-will-spark-the-rise-of-career-accelerators/">some pretty deep dives into the space</a> over the years in terms of how these loan products incentivize students and colleges to work together for better professional outcomes. Given their novelty though, one of the largest barriers to wide adoption remains the lack of capital for these models.</p>

<p>That’s starting to change, and companies like <a href="https://joinblair.com">Blair</a> are leading the charge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Blair told TechCrunch that it has raised $100 million in a new debt facility to fund what it is dubbing “Blair Capital” to fund ISAs at partner institutions. The money came from an undisclosed investor, which was described by Blair CEO Mike Mahlkow as an “institutional capital partner with more than $10 billion under management.”</p>
<p>My colleague Mike Butcher <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/launching-out-of-yc-blair-is-aiming-to-reshape-the-financing-of-college-tuition/">first profiled Blair when it was coming out of YC back in summer 2019</a>. When Blair first got started by co-founders Mahlkow, Constantin Schreiber and David Nordhausen, it was focused exclusively on the direct-to-consumer market for ISAs. The idea was that students would go to Blair and secure an ISA with a set amount of upfront cash to cover tuition and cost of living, and then choose a school to attend. Underwriting was based on the future income potential of the student.</p>

<p>Blair’s technology platform allowed it to service ISAs for students, such as collecting their payments, tracking their requirements and giving them updates on their remaining terms. But to really scale up the platform, Blair needed capital to actually underwrite ISAs and increase loan volumes on its platform.</p>
<p>So it looked to raise a debt facility — and then COVID-19 hit. “It was very, very, difficult to raise any kind of debt capital for direct-to-consumer ISAs,” Mahlkow explained in the milieu of a pandemic. But, “we got a lot of inbound demand from education institutions,” and particularly from alternative schools like coding boot camps.</p>

<p>So Blair rejiggered its platform (now dubbed Blair Servicing) away from D2C lending to being a technology servicing layer for schools offering ISAs as part of their programs. From there, it constructed Blair Capital, this new $100 million facility which can be used by its partner schools to fund their own ISA programs. That means these schools won’t have to raise their own debt capital for their ISAs if they don’t want to.</p>
<p>Unlike Blair’s original approach focused on consumers, underwriting for ISAs is now based on the quality of an individual school, and even more specifically an individual program. So rather than underwriting a person, Blair knows that certain programs have a given return profile and can underwrite terms of the ISA to fit that risk.</p>
<p>Terms can vary widely between programs. Mahlkow explained that the company more or less has merely floors and ceilings on terms but otherwise is flexible. For instance, the company won’t do income shares above 20% (and often gets queasy even going near that number), and there are repayment caps and limits on repayment time periods as well, with most ISAs it offers being between 1-2 years or a maximum of three years.</p>
<p>Alternative schools with track records of student achievement can use Blair Capital right away. For newer schools without the same operating history, Blair will help guide those schools to build the early track record they need so that the company can underwrite their ISAs in the future. Either way, all schools can use Blair Servicing to handle their loans.</p>

<p>Blair Servicing takes a percentage fee of the money that flows back from an ISA after graduation, while Blair Capital takes an origination fee plus joins in the upside of the ISA itself. The goal is to incentive-align the loans for all parties involved.</p>
<p>The company, which is based in SF, remains lean, at six employees. With $100 million capital to fund ISAs though, it hopes to have an outsized impact on this burgeoning industry.</p>
