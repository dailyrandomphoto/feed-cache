										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we move deeper into a cloud-centric world, everything was supposed to get easier, but in truth there&#8217;s a lot of moving parts, and companies need help getting everything to work. This takes people with a particular set of skills to help clients with tasks like integrations, managing hybrid and multi-cloud environments and getting data where you need it.</p>
<p><a href="https://tercera.io/">Tecera</a>, a new venture capital firm launching today wants to attack this problem by investing in companies that can act as helpers and consultants. In a world where venture capital tends to gravitate mostly towards software and hardware, this is a distinctly different investment thesis.</p>
<p>Chris Barbin, founder and CEO at Tecera knows quite a bit about this. He was one of the founders at <a href="https://appirio.com/">Appirio</a>, a consulting firm founded way back in 2006 when cloud computing as we know it today was just getting off the ground. His former company had the vision and the foresight to start a firm to help companies use new tools like Salesforce, Google, Workday and AWS. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/20/indias-wipro-buys-cloud-services-consultancy-appirio-for-500m/">Wipro bought the company</a> in 2016 for $500 million after it had raised over $117 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Barbin believes that today, the level of complexity has only increased, and there will be a growing need for what he calls this people power to make everything work, and that takes a specialized kind of investor. &#8220;There&#8217;s been a flurry of investment activity into professional services-based companies over the last couple of years, but there&#8217;s never been an investment firm that is exclusively focused on these types of businesses,&#8221; Barbin explained.</p>
<p>During the firm&#8217;s research phase, the founders identified key platform companies like Salesforce, Twilio, Snowflake, DataDog and Cloudflare, and they estimate that there are between 7500 and 10,000 consulting companies supporting companies like this. &#8220;The goal of the firm is to help create a kind of a powerhouse for those emerging [platforms], or a firm or two that actually has the collection of those [SaaS platforms] in their toolkit,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company will be targeting established firms with revenue between $5 and $20 million with aspirations to grow into the hundreds of millions, and will be doling out investments of between $5 and 20 million of capital per bet.</p>
<p>The firm is just getting started, but plans to have 8 employees by mid-year. Barbin indicated at least one investment was already in the pipeline, but wasn&#8217;t ready to give details just yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New wellness startup <a href="http://yourheights.com">Heights</a> is formally launching this week, focusing on a category it describes as ‘braincare’. The startup will market &#8220;ultra high quality, sustainable plant-based supplements that feed your brain” based on what it says is scientific data.</p>
<p>It has raised a $2 million Seed funding round (£1.7M) via the Seedrs crowdfunding platform, with the round also including the institutional investor <a href="https://forwardpartners.com/">Forward Partners</a>. Angel investors include Tom Singh (founder of New Look), Damian Bradfield (WeTransfer), Dhiraj Mukherjee (Shazam), Renee Elliot (Planet Organic), and celebrity investor Chris Smalling (an England and Manchester United professional footballer).</p>
<p>The funds will be used for customer growth and new product development, including soon-to-launch a ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychobiotic">psychobiotic</a>&#8216; probiotic aimed at cognition and mental health.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Customers first take a ‘<a href="http://www.yourheights.com/brainhealth">brain health</a>’ survey, then sign up for a monthly, quarterly, or annual subscription.</p>
<p>Customers need only take two capsules a day, thus hugely decreasing the complexity of juggling regular vitamin taking.</p>
<p>The product fits through a letterbox and the unusual bottle was designed by the well-known product design agency <a href="https://www.pentagram.com/">Pentagram</a>. A content and coaching program included in the subscription helps customers, and another brain health survey happens after a month. Heights claims that “93%” improve their brain health score within one month.</p>
<p>Heights is not alone in this new market for what some describe as ‘designer vitamins’ and the arena is already populated by the likes of <a href="http://www.forhims.co.uk">Hims</a> / <a href="http://www.forhers.com">Hers</a>, <a href="https://www.motionnutrition.com"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Motion</span></a>, <a href="https://www.vitabiotics.com/">Vitabiotics</a> and <a href="https://www.bulletproof.com/">Bulletproof.</a></p>
<p>These companies broadly fall into the &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic">Nootropics</a>&#8221; category — vitamins and minerals designed to improve cognitive function, memory, creativity, or motivation, in healthy individuals. But the market is not small. The ‘self care&#8217;, &#8216;healthcare&#8217;, and &#8216;personal development&#8217; market is worth over $1Trillion but supplements alone is worth at least $100BN+.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2105377" style="width: 655px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2105377" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2105377" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Group3Landscape.jpg" alt="Heights founders Dan Murray-Serter and Joel Freeman, with adviser Dr Tara Swart." width="645" height="353" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Group3Landscape.jpg 645w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Group3Landscape.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Group3Landscape.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Group3Landscape.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2105377" class="wp-caption-text">Heights founders Dan Murray-Serter and Joel Freeman, with adviser Dr. Tara Swart.</p></div></p>
<p>However, co-founder Dan Murray-Serter says Heights is aiming to do something different to the aforementioned players.</p>
<p>In a text-based interview, he said: “Nootropics as a category really focus on quick fixes, which is why we&#8217;re working on the category creation of ‘braincare’ because there are no &#8216;quick fixes&#8217; in life, and that terminology and category have essentially set people up with the same false hopes as ‘get-rich-quick’ schemes do. We&#8217;re set up differently — aka, starting with scientifically researched articles and journal references.”</p>
<p>He said Heights will be positioned more like a skincare or haircare brand, “because people understand that the daily habit/practice is what creates the longevity and impact, not just a one-day miracle.”</p>
<p>Murray-Serter says there are 20 key nutrients science says our brains need to thrive, and these are mostly found in a combination of buying multivitamins, omega 3s, and &#8216;nootropics’. He says Heights has sourced the “highest quality” ingredients in the most &#8216;bioavailable form&#8217; in a patented capsule which makes it easier to digest for the body.</p>
<p>“One of the most common reasons the habit of taking vitamins doesn’t stick for people is that the bottle goes into a cupboard and gets ignored. So we started with design alongside quality,” he says. The Heights vitamins come in a distinctive, recyclable bottle which Heights will also aven recycle if you send it back to them.</p>
<p>Murray-Serter, who previously founded the mobile startup Grabble, says he came up with the idea for the startup after a bout of chronic anxiety and a 6 month-long period of insomnia. The problem was solved by high-quality, high-density vitamins and supplements, as opposed to normal supplements which usually only have the lowest recommended daily levels of vitamins inside them.</p>
<p>After starting a newsletter on the subject of optimizing cognitive performance with cofounder Joel Freeman, the pair amassed a following of 60,000 readers www.yourheights.com/sundays</p>
<p>and then came up with the idea of launching the actual product.</p>
<p>The company now has a ‘<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/braincare/id1533960100">Braincare</a>&#8216; podcast that has reached 100,000 downloads, and the founders have also been joined by key team member Chief Science Officer, Dr Tara Swart (pictured).</p>
<p>Two things may help Heights. Firstly, in the era of Covid-19, public health authorities and governments around the world have recommended taking Vitamin D to boost the body&#8217;s immune system should someone fall prey to the disease. It&#8217;s not insignificant that two Heights capsules contain 400% of the ‘Nutrient Reference Value’ (formerly known as Recommended Daily Allowance) of Vitamin D3, as well as many other supplements. Theoretically, one could take four normal tablets of this, but the customer experience and other added vitamins in Heights will appeal to many. Secondly, the growing awareness of mental health and interest in maintaining good mental health is now a regular subject of public discourse. So Heights appears to be well-positioned to ride both those waves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pandemic has left some startups strapped for cash, the aptly-named Brazilian neobank <a href="https://nubank.com.br/en/">Nubank</a> is swimming in it. This morning, the company announced that it has raised a $400 million Series G round, putting their total funding to date at $1.2 billion. But even more remarkable, in addition to their new $25 billion valuation (up from $10 billion in 2019), is their customer base of 34 million users, which they’ve built up since the fintech&#8217;s launch in 2013.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve gone from 12 million customers in 2019 to 34 million solely based on word of mouth,” said David Velez, the company’s co-founder and CEO. By September last year, the company was onboarding 41,000 new customers per day. NuBank prides itself on having a $0 customer acquisition cost. Velez said the startup spends what would be marketing money on “great salaries” and superior customer service, which in turn creates “fanatic” customers who share their love for the brand with others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new valuation places NuBank as the fourth most valuable financial institution in Latin America and the largest digital bank in the world by the number of customers and app downloads. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was led by both private and public investors including Singapore&#8217;s GIC, Whale Rock, and Invesco. Current investors Tencent, Dragoneer, Ribbit Capital, and Sequoia also participated in the round. Velez is a former Sequoia partner and is originally from Colombia though he attended Stanford University and worked in the U.S. for many years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NuBank, based in São Paulo — the financial capital of Latin America and home to 12.8 million people — has expanded to Colombia and Mexico and plans to use the new funding to flesh out its operations in those markets while continuing to build out its product offerings in Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What started as a credit card company now functions as a full-service bank, minus the cumbersome bank branches, which is one way the company has been able to allocate its funding primarily toward growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People were really done with being mistreated and paying high fees,” said Velez, speaking to Brazil’s notoriously bureaucratic and dreadful banking experience (liken it to going to the DMV, but regularly). Historically, to pay your monthly bills in Brazil, you had to go to a bank branch and wait in line — often outside in the heat — until it was your turn. The lines wrapped around the block like that of an Apple Store upon the release of the latest iPhone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s like they are doing you a favor by opening an account for you and then charging you 450% interest rate per year,” said Velez. “Our bet was that people would really like to be treated like humans,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1994, when the Brazilian real currency was introduced, it was pegged at 1:1 with the U.S. dollar. However, in recent years, with the country’s largest corruption scandal in history which saw three consecutive presidents jailed, impeached, and incriminated, respectively, the economy has plummeted. And COVID-19 certainly hasn’t helped. The exchange rate is now 1 USD to 5.40 BRL. With low exchange rates in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, a $400 million USD investment creates a sizable runway, especially since Nubank’s Brazil operation has been cash-flow positive since 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is known for reaching the unbanked population in Brazil, especially those who simply weren’t in the financial position to get a credit card. Traditional banks are present in about 80% of Brazilian municipalities, but considering that Nubank’s app-based product is location-agnostic, it’s able to reach 100% of the municipalities, the company said. In addition, it’s been helping Brazilians build credit. Its Barney-purple credit card starts at a monthly limit of $50 reals per month (roughly $10 USD). If a customer pays on time the first month, their credit continues to increase over the following months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amongst its slew of products, Nubank also offers a debit card and savings account, and while it doesn’t have branches of its own, money can be withdrawn from network ATM’s, as is common in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nubank was born out of the conviction that people deserved better, more transparent and human financial services that would allow them to be in control of their money and their future. We started seven years ago in Brazil, a country with one of the most concentrated banking sectors in the world, and we were able to free millions of people of the bureaucracy and the pain. Through technology and human customer service, we were able to have a positive impact on their daily lives,” said Velez.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s competition regulator will make a decision on whether or not Facebook&#8217;s purchase of Giphy has a &#8216;realistic prospect&#8217; of substantially lessening competition by March 25, it <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/600fffefe90e07143c6dafc3/Notice_commencement_initial_period.pdf">said today</a>, as it continues to scrutinize the acquisition.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) hereby gives notice pursuant to paragraph (b) of the definition of ‘initial period’ in section 34ZA(3) of the [Enterprise] Act that it has sufficient information in relation to the completed acquisition by Facebook, Inc of Giphy, Inc, (the Merger) to enable it to begin an investigation for the purposes of deciding whether to make a reference for a Phase 2 investigation,&#8221; it writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The initial period defined in section 34ZA(3) of the Act in relation to the Merger will therefore commence on the first working day after the date of this notice, ie on 29 January 2021. The end of the initial period and the deadline for the CMA to announce its decision whether to refer the Merger for a Phase 2 investigation is therefore 25 March 2021.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Competition and Markets Authority launched a probe of Facebook&#8217;s $400M acquisition of the GIF-sharing platform back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/12/uk-competition-watchdog-launches-investigation-into-facebooks-400m-acquisition-of-giphy/">June 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The investigation put a freeze on Facebook&#8217;s ability to continue activities related to integrating Giphy into its wider business empire &#8212; such as integrating products or teams or working on business deals or contracts together &#8212; despite having already been completed the acquisition.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="sLm0jQKvyx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/12/uk-competition-watchdog-launches-investigation-into-facebooks-400m-acquisition-of-giphy/">UK competition watchdog launches investigation into Facebook&#8217;s $400M acquisition of Giphy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK competition watchdog launches investigation into Facebook&#8217;s $400M acquisition of Giphy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/12/uk-competition-watchdog-launches-investigation-into-facebooks-400m-acquisition-of-giphy/embed/#?secret=sLm0jQKvyx" data-secret="sLm0jQKvyx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Facebook confirmed its plan to acquire Giphy in <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/welcome-giphy/">May 2020</a> &#8212; when it also announced its plan to integrate the platform into its photo and video sharing app, Instagram.</p>
<p>But those plans remain on ice as a result of competition scrutiny in the UK. (Last June Facebook and Giphy confirmed they were complying with the CMA&#8217;s order to pause integration activity.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s another sign of the growing regulatory friction that tech giants are facing when they seek to grow via acquisition. Last year, for example, European regulators also spent months eyeing Google&#8217;s Fitbit acquisition &#8212; although they did finally clear the deal in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/">December</a>. But only after obtaining a number of commitments from the tech giant related to how Fitbit data could be used and rivals&#8217; access to APIs.</p>

<p>In the Facebook-Giphy case, the UK watchdog will make a decision in March on whether to open a deeper and broader Phase 2 investigation (after which it would need to issue a final decision).</p>
<p>It could also decide at that point that there is no &#8216;realistic prospect&#8217; of a substantial lessening of competition as a result of Facebook acquiring Giphy and conclude its intervene &#8212; lifting the bar on continued integration between the pair.</p>
<p>The regulator also has discretion to choose not to open a Phase 2 investigation for other reasons, such as if it believes the market is not of sufficient importance to justify the deeper dive or that benefits to customers from a merger outweigh any negative competitive effects.</p>
<p>Given the acquired business in this case is a platform for swapping reaction GIFs it certainly seems possible the CMA may decide that a deeper dive isn&#8217;t merited. But we&#8217;ll know more in a couple of months.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, regulatory concern linked to Facebook&#8217;s grip on the social web has already delayed its plans for Giphy by well over half a year &#8212; and the probe may yet drag on for longer &#8212; impacting its ability to move fast (and break things).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the rise of direct-to-consumer businesses has been one of the big e-commerce trends of the last decade, then the growth of startups raising huge rounds to consolidate D2C players, to bring more economies of scale to the model, has definitely been a related theme of the past year.</p>
<p>In the latest move, a startup out of Germany called the <a href="https://www.berlin-brands-group.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berlin Brands Group</a> has announced that it plans to invest €250 million (about $302 million at today&#8217;s rates) to buy up smaller companies and bring them into its fold.</p>
<p>While a lot of the company&#8217;s would-be competitors in the consolidation race are focusing primarily on the Amazon Marketplace &#8212; leaning on fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) to carry out the distribution and logistics &#8212; Peter Chaljawski, the founder and CEO, tells us that it&#8217;s a different story in its existing target market of Europe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In the M&amp;A market, one big difference between the U.S. and Europe is that the latter is more fragmented,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In the U.S., D2C sellers do a lot on Amazon. In Europe, there are still lots of alternatives. And in some markets like France, consumers don&#8217;t even like Amazon.&#8221; This is in addition, of course, to selling directly to consumers and bypassing marketplaces altogether, an area that Chaljawski said will continue to be a big focus for BBG. In all, BBG today says it uses some 100 channels to sell its products.</p>
<p>BBG is not your typical e-commerce startup, in that up to now it&#8217;s managed to build a big and profitable business largely on its own steam. And despite being a big e-commerce player in Berlin, BBC has no connection to Rocket Internet, the famous incubator of e-commerce businesses founded in the city.</p>
<p>The $302 million earmarked for acquisitions is coming off the startup&#8217;s own balance sheet. And from what we understand, it&#8217;s also coming ahead of BBG raising a significant round of outside funding to continue its growth. Although BBG has raised money (of an undisclosed amount, per <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/115395-85/company/profile#service-providers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PitchBook</a>) in the past, this would be its first significant equity round when it closes.</p>
<p>BBG itself has built its own profitable direct-to-consumer business from the ground up. Founded in 2005 first focused on audio equipment (Chaljawski had ambitions to be a DJ in a past life) it has some 14 brands today, covering 2,500 items, that it has hatched and grown itself, which it sells in 28 markets.</p>
<p>The conglomerate model that BBG has taken covers a variety of categories, mostly in consumer electronics (including audio gear, fitness equipment and home appliances), and are sold under a range of different brands like auna, Klarstein and Capital Sports. To date, it says it has sold more than 10 million products, and it is profitable, making €300 million (around $363 million) in revenues in 2020.</p>
<p>Its focus for new acquisitions will include more brands and products in garden, home and living goods, sports, electronics and household appliances, with targets generating anything from €500,000 to €30 million in revenues.</p>
<p>While BBG has mostly been about organic growth, it started taking its first foray into inorganic expansion <a href="https://www.de24.news/en/2020/12/berlin-brands-group-starts-acquisition-offensive-with-online-retailers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last December</a>, with the acquisition of home goods brand Sleepwise, which Chaljawski describes as making &#8220;a very nice blanket.&#8221;</p>
<p>The comfort of a nice blanket might come in handy. Despite its success to date, a number of challenges lie ahead for BBG.</p>
<p>First of these are competitors. BBG&#8217;s strategy shift and acquisition plans come at a time when consolidators in the space are starting to emerge, armed with fistfuls of dollars to consolidate smaller brands that have emerged with success on marketplaces like Amazon&#8217;s (in fact, primarily the Amazon marketplace) but perhaps without obvious paths to scaling.</p>
<p>They include the likes of <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/thrasio-brings-in-500m-debt-facility-to-go-after-bigger-acquisitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thrasio</a> (which most recently raised $500 million in debt to use to buy companies), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SellerX</a>, <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/heyday-emerges-from-stealth-with-175m-series-a-funding-to-accelerate-marketplace-native-brands-15493868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heyday</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroes</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perch</a> and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9a9cc7e0-e406-477c-bc15-28d6d250c29b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This story</a> from December in the FT (before that most recent debt round of Thrasio&#8217;s) estimated that there has been at least $1 billion raised collectively by these companies to build out new online consumer empires based on this model.</p>
<p>The vision for all of them is very clear: they want to create the next Unilever, P&amp;G, or Sony, and they are leveraging new economic models and technology to bring in manufacturing, logistics, economies of scale, sales analytics and new innovations in marketing to do it.</p>
<p>Another challenge is how successful and efficient a company, which has up to now taken a very deliberate and organic path, will be in integrating lots of new brands, with the cultures and business partnerships relationships that exist with those, in tow.</p>
<p>The third is the sourcing of quality brands themselves. As we&#8217;ve pointed out before, taking just Amazon as one example, t<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">here is a ton of junk sold there, including a whole industry of those who buy off wholesale sites and resell on Amazon, which is one reason why so many merchants sell what look like identical products in specific categories. These marketplace sellers leverage things like SEO and armies of reviews to get their products sifting to the top of huge piles of search results, and they can often sell well, even if they are not great buys for you the consumer. That means misleading signals for a potential consolidator looking for hot companies to snap up.</span></p>
<p>The balance between how marketplaces are leveraged versus how much brands and their owners try to build these things on their own will be an interesting one to watch in the coming years. Amazon and its ilk have only continued to grow and become more efficient, although this sometimes means they are too powerful rather than more useful for third parties:</p>
<p>On the other hand, we&#8217;re seeing another persistent theme to help them: the presence of startups and bigger companies continuing to make tools to help the smaller players stay in the game on their own terms. They include biggies like Shopify, but also newer players like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/gosite-snags-40m-to-help-smbs-bring-their-businesses-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoSite</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/shogun-raises-35m-to-help-brands-take-on-amazon-with-faster-and-better-sites-of-their-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shogun</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/germanys-xentral-nabs-20m-led-by-sequoia-to-help-online-facing-smbs-run-back-offices-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xentral</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has updated and broadened its Play Store policy on gaming loyalty programs to help developers better understand the practices that are permitted, months after confusion about the guidance <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/google-pulls-indias-paytm-app-from-play-store-for-repeat-policy-violations/">prompted some backlash in India</a>, the biggest Android market by users.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/01/simplifying-our-play-store-policies-on.html">said</a> on Thursday that it now specifies guidance on gamified loyalty programs that are based on a qualified monetary transaction in an app and offer prizes of cash or other real-world cash equivalent perks.</p>
<p>Scores of apps run gamified loyalty programs in their apps to appease and win users. Last year, the company sent notices to several Indian startups including Paytm, Zomato, and Swiggy whose in-app gamifying techniques, the company said at the time, resembled gambling. Google had asked the firms to withdraw from engaging in such gamifying techniques. The new policy covers developers worldwide, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paytm, which is India&#8217;s most valued startup, had alleged at the time that Google was preventing the startup from engaging in the very same set of practices that the company&#8217;s own app, Google Pay, was employing to win users in the country. Google had temporarily delisted Paytm app from the Play Store after the violation.</p>
<p>This back and forth between the two firms, as well as changes to Play Store commission in the following weeks, gave birth to a coalition of Indian startups that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/indian-startups-explore-forming-an-alliance-and-alternative-app-store-to-fight-googles-monopoly/">sought government intervention</a> to regulate the power Google holds in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;App developers in India are actively building uniquely Indian features and services. One example is the use of mini games, quizzes and other gamification techniques to delight users and convert them into loyal customers. These experiences are often launched during important festivals and sporting events, and getting it right within the specific time window is critically important,&#8221; wrote Suzanne Frey, Vice President, Product, Android Security and Privacy, in a blog post.</p>
<p>The company still does not permit real gambling apps in India, but said developers globally now will have better clarity on rules so they can inform their strategies.</p>
<p>“This is one of the things we discussed when we spoke to several startup CEOs in India and around the world in the past few months. And, as part of the very first policy update of 2021 we are clarifying and simplifying the policies around loyalty programs and features,” wrote Frey.</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company will be outlining the full guidelines later today.</p>
<p>As part of the update, the company said it is also launching <a href="https://play.google.com/intl/en_in/about/howplayworks/">How Google Play Works,</a> a repository of useful information and best practices to help developers. &#8220;It also contains India-specific details on programs that local developers can leverage to find success and scale. For users, this site helps to demystify key aspects of the Google Play platform, and explains how user security and protection remains at the heart of everything we do,&#8221; wrote Frey.</p>
<p>In a virtual event on Thursday, Sameer Samat, VP of Android and Google Play at Google, said today&#8217;s update is the first of many the company plans to issue this year and it is committed to listening to more feedback from the industry.</p>
<h2>More on Google and Jio Platform&#8217;s upcoming smartphones</h2>
<p>In a wide-range discussion at the event <a href="https://delhi.tie.org/">organized by startup network TiE Delhi-NCR</a>, Samat also talked about the efforts Google is putting into bringing Android-powered smartphones to more people in India. Last year, Google announced an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">investment of $4.5 billion into Indian telecom operator Jio Platforms</a>. As part of the partnership, the two firms have said they will work on low-cost Android smartphones.</p>
<p>&#8220;While India is the fastest growing smartphone market in the world, there are a lack of devices priced in a certain range that prevents a number of consumers from purchasing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have been optimizing Android for entry level devices with Android Go. The point of that project is to enable Android to run on entry level hardware that hopefully brings the price down. There are more than 100 million Android Go smartphones in the market today, but we need to go further than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Samat said the company is trying to bring the set of services that higher-end smartphones feature to &#8220;entry-level&#8221; handsets it is building with Jio Platforms. &#8220;More affordable phones cannot mean lower quality phones.&#8221; He suggested that these phones will have a different consumer interface that is directly aimed at users who have not previously used a smartphone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://bfaglobal.com/catalyst-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catalyst Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a global accelerator managed by </span><a href="https://bfaglobal.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BFA Global</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announced the 8th cohort for its Inclusive Fintech Program today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accelerator runs the flagship program annually and with a focus on Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Mexico and India, selected startups receive £80,000 (~$100,000) in grant capital, six months of support and connections with follow-on investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, all five countries had representatives in the accelerator. However, the selected six startups this year are from Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. These startups offer embedded finance solutions; </span><a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/maeliscarraro"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maelis Carraro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Catalyst Fund MD, explains the thought process behind this selection in a statement.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, fintech is rapidly evolving to the point where it’s no longer a standalone vertical. Embedded finance offerings have the potential to improve the value of products in adjacent sectors significantly while finding new ways to better reach and serve low-income individuals via touchpoints they already know and trust,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the startups in the 8th cohort. First off, from Kenya,</span><a href="https://www.withkoa.com/"> Koa</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enables users to save and invest, gaining control over their finances. </span><a href="https://www.lami.world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lami</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an insurance platform and API that enables more individuals and businesses to access insurance coverage. </span><a href="https://m-power.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows gig and salaried workers access to earned wages and other financial services, and contribute to savings via partner banks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Nigeria,</span><a href="https://www.indicina.co/"> Indicina</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> facilitates lending for individuals and small businesses through AI-powered digital credit infrastructure.</span><a href="https://jetstreamafrica.com/"> Jetstream</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows businesses to export goods across borders and access trade financing in Nigeria and Ghana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representing South Africa,</span><a href="https://kandua.com/"> Kandua</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> connects skilled home service professionals with access to customers, professional tools and digital financial services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is interesting about the companies in this cohort is that they are predominantly led or co-founded by women as all startups except Kandua have a female founder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a conscious decision to make this cohort more inclusive for women given the gap in funding and support to women founders, particularly in emerging markets,” Carraro said to TechCrunch. “For example, founders in our previous cohort were all male. We are consciously making an effort to support as many women founders as we can going forward.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an </span><a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/f62312ad-7ef5-4b90-b57d-6b793ae20a17/20200216-VC-WeFi-Research-Snapshot.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=n15lznn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IFC report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only 11% of seed funding capital in emerging markets goes to companies with at least a woman on their founding team. The numbers are lower for later-stage funding despite evidence that investing in gender-diverse teams leads to more substantial business outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These startups will join the Catalyst Fund&#8217;s existing portfolio of 37 companies, which have raised over $122 million in follow-on funding since 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lami CEO </span><a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/jihan-abass-09b609125"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jihan Abass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says her insurance company will use the investment to enhance its platform features, get more third-party integrations, and put data security and ISO certifications in place. For Indicina and CEO </span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/yvonneoyetakin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yvonne Johnson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the capital from Catalyst Fund will enable the company to expand its platform, which will include new AI capabilities to improve credit in Africa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This cohort, which is all-African, represents Catalyst Fund&#8217;s continued effort to support fintech startups on the continent. It adds to the growth of a sector that has consistently received most of the VC money coming into the continent. Last year, fintechs accounted for 31% of the total funding raised by African startups per </span><a href="https://briterbridges.com/africa-investment-report-2020"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briter Bridges data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catalyst Fund has the backing to keep this going. Last year, it</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/19/catalyst-fund-gets-15m-from-jp-morgan-uk-aid-to-back-30-em-fintech-startups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced $15 million in additional funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., to accelerate 30 new inclusive fintech startups by 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the fund has financed 12 startups and will need to add 18 between now and next year to achieve that objective. But having funded Chipper Cash, Turaco, Sokowatch, Cowrywise, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/owrywise-raises-3m-pre-series-a-to-scale-its-wealth-management-platform/">which just closed a $3M pre-seed round</a>, among others, the total number of startups in its portfolio sits at 43.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tokopedia, Lazada, Shopee, and other firms created an e-commerce market in Indonesia in the past decade, making it possible for consumers to shop online in the island nation. But as is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/from-indias-richest-man-to-amazon-and-100s-of-startups-the-great-rush-to-win-neighborhood-stores/">true in other Asian markets</a>, most small retailers and mom-and-pop stores in the Southeast Asian country still face a myriad of challenges in sourcing inventory and working capital, and continue to rely on an age-old supply chain network.</p>
<p>Nipun Mehra (a former executive of Flipkart in India), Alan Wong (who previously worked with Amazon), Derry Sakti (who oversaw consumer goods giant P&amp;G’s operations in Indonesia), and Riky Tenggara (former Lazada and aCommerce), began to explore opportunities to address this in 2019.</p>
<p>“Much like India, much of the Indonesian retail market is unorganized. In the food and vegetable category, for instance, there are lots of farmers who sell to agents, who then sell to markets. From these markets, the inventory goes to small wholesalers, and so on. There are lots of players in the chain,” said Mehra, whose previous stints include working at Sequoia Capital India, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mehra, Wong, Sakti and Tenggara <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/5-months-old-indonesian-startup-ula-raises-10-5-million-for-its-wholesale-e-commerce-marketplace/">co-founded Ula in January of 2020</a>. With Ula, they are trying to organize this sourcing and supply chain for small retailers so that there is a one-stop shop for everybody.</p>
<p>Despite the pandemic, <a href="https://landing.ula.app/en/">Ula</a> made inroads in the Indonesian market last year and today serves more than 20,000 stores. And naturally, investors have noticed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2105314" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2105314" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2105314 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ula-team.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="994" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ula-team.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ula-team.jpg?resize=150,146 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ula-team.jpg?resize=300,291 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ula-team.jpg?resize=768,746 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ula-team.jpg?resize=680,660 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ula-team.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ula-team.jpg?resize=50,50 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2105314" class="wp-caption-text">From left to right: Derry Sakti, Nipun Mehra (screen), Riky Tenggara, Ganesh Rengaswamy (screen), Alan Wong, and Dan Bertoli. Photo credit: Ula</p></div></p>
<p>On Thursday, Ula announced it has raised $20 million in a Series A financing round. The round was led by existing investor Quona Capital and B Capital Group. Other existing investors including Sequoia Capital India and Lightspeed &#8212; that financed Ula’s $10.5 million Seed round in June last year &#8212; have also participated in the Series A.</p>
<p>“If you look at the whole retail value chain, especially for essential goods, FMCG, staple, and fresh produce, it’s significantly fragmented,” said Ganesh Rengaswamy, Managing Partner at Quona Capital, in an interview. “Whereas the market has moved on in terms of being able to more efficiently consolidate, demand and supply. Ula is trying to redo the retail distribution ecosystem with a significant technology overlay. It’s connecting some of the largest players in the supply side to the smallest retailers and consumers.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Ula is providing these micro retailers, who usually operate from small shops that are extensions of their homes, with working capital so that they don’t have to wait to be paid by their customers to buy the new batch of inventory. (It’s a serious challenge that micro-retailers face in Asian markets. These shops have strong bonds with their customers, so often they sell them items without getting paid upfront. Collecting this payment often takes longer than it should.)</p>
<p>“Frictionless payment and offering credit to retailers so that they can more efficiently manage their cashflow are critical components of modern digital commerce,” said Rengaswamy. For Quona, which has backed several e-commerce and fintech startups in Asia, Ula checks both the boxes.</p>
<p>Mehra said last year was largely about expanding the Ula team and building the technology stack. The startup now plans to deploy the capital to reach more small retailers and expand within the nation.</p>
<p>Indonesia will remain Ula’s focus market. The opportunity in the region itself is very large. The retail spend is expected to surpass $0.5 trillion over the next 4 years, said Kabir Narang, Founding General Partner at B Capital Group, in a statement. Traditional in-store retail accounts for nearly 80% of the total retail market, according to some estimates.</p>
<p>Ula currently operates in the FMCG and food and vegetable spaces, but it intends to broaden its offerings to include apparel and eventually electronics.</p>
<hr />
<p>A few more things from my notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like many other startups in Asia, Ula largely relies on feet-and-street sales people to spread the word out about its offerings and onboarding new shops. The key to growing, said Mehra, is to get a few retailers who are very happy with the services and see its value and then tell their friends about it. It&#8217;s a learning he credited to Indian business-to-business e-commerce platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/indian-b2b-e-commerce-startup-udaan-raises-280-million/">Udaan co-founders</a> Amod Malviya, Vaibhav Gupta and Sujeet Kumar, with whom he worked at Flipkart back in the day. Udaan co-founders have backed Ula.</li>
<li>Electronics is a category that is very popular among B2C and B2B e-commerce platforms. Mehra said he has always known that the startup could expand to electronics, so it has chosen to focus on other categories first that test the supply chain network.</li>
<li>Indonesia comprises of more than 17,000 islands, but only a handful of islands including Java and Sumatra contributes most to the GDP.</li>
<li>I asked Quona&#8217;s Rengaswamy to draw parallels between e-commerce and payments markets of India and Indonesia. He said India has made more inroads with creating frictionless payments. But on the flip side, this has created potential for startups in Indonesia to solve additional challenges.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The media licensing business is a massive market, but much of the work involved is still handled manually through emails and spreadsheets. A startup called <a href="https://www.flowhaven.com/">Flowhaven</a> is working to change that. The company, which has now closed on $16 million in Series A funding, helps brands to manage their licensing partnerships, including the account management aspects, the individual product information, the financial information, and more.</p>
<p>The new round was led by Sapphire Sport, the part of Sapphire Ventures that specializes in sports, media and lifestyle brands. Existing investors Global Founders Capital and Icebreaker.vc also returned, bringing Flowhaven&#8217;s total raise to date to $21.5 million.</p>

<p>The idea to modernize the media licensing business comes from a founder who had direct experience in the industry.</p>
<p>Flowhaven CEO Kalle Törmä previously worked on licensing for the Angry Birds mobile game franchise while at Rovio, starting back in 2012. While there, he created the global blueprint for managing the merchandising side of the business, which later expanded to include partnerships for the Angry Birds Star Wars and Angry Birds Transformers games.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was evident that the workflows were very broken &#8212; from managing the commerce, or the agreements, the product approvals, and financials. The information was very siloed. Also, there were a lot of things that fell through the cracks,&#8221; explains Törmä.</p>
<p>In addition, it was time consuming and difficult to pull together data that would allow management to understand how the business was doing.</p>
<p>The challenges Törmä faced at Rovio led him to understand what would be needed to create a solution like Flowhaven &#8212; particularly, the difficulty of managing tricky licensing workflows and timetables through manual methods.</p>
<p>He left Rovio in 2016 and founded Flowhaven, where he&#8217;s joined by university pal and CCO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timo-olkkola-75a0589b/">Timo Olkkola</a>, whose background is in sales.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2101366" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101366" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2101366" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-assets-contentmanagement.jpg?w=680" alt="Flowhaven software" width="680" height="456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-assets-contentmanagement.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-assets-contentmanagement.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-assets-contentmanagement.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-assets-contentmanagement.jpg?resize=768,515 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-assets-contentmanagement.jpg?resize=680,456 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-assets-contentmanagement.jpg?resize=1536,1030 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-assets-contentmanagement.jpg?resize=2048,1373 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-assets-contentmanagement.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101366" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flowhaven</p></div></p>
<p>Today, the Flowhaven licensing management platform automates the brand licensing workflow process, including the planning and strategy, account and agreement management, content distribution, design approvals, royalty reporting, and more.</p>
<p>It also helps to keep teams on schedules that can often be tight in the media and entertainment businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always a timeframe that they follow &#8212; whether it&#8217;s a film release or game release,&#8221; Törmä says. &#8220;There are lot of moving pieces in closing all the agreements and then moving the products through the approvals [so when], let&#8217;s say, a film comes out, a couple of months prior, the merchandise hits the retail shelves,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t have the products approved and ready, then you didn&#8217;t really seize the momentum,&#8221; Törmä adds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2101367" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101367" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2101367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-designapproval.jpg?w=680" alt="Flowhaven software" width="680" height="456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-designapproval.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-designapproval.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-designapproval.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-designapproval.jpg?resize=768,515 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-designapproval.jpg?resize=680,456 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-designapproval.jpg?resize=1536,1030 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-designapproval.jpg?resize=2048,1373 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flowhaven-product-designapproval.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101367" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flowhaven</p></div></p>
<p>Flowhaven pitches that its software isn&#8217;t just saving time, it also saves money. The company estimates that licensing professionals waste 50 hours per month at $70 per hour on work that could be automated. This equals approximately $42,000 per year wasted for a single professional.</p>
<p>As of its new funding, Flowhaven&#8217;s software-as-a-service platform has been adopted by close to 100 companies, ranging from smaller business to Fortune 100 companies in markets like media, entertainment, sports, fashion, and by corporate and consumer brands Though some customer names can&#8217;t be shared, Flowhaven says it&#8217;s working with Nintendo, LAIKA, Games Workshop, Acamar Films, and Crunchyroll.</p>
<p>Its <a href="https://www.flowhaven.com/pricing">pricing</a> is based on how many users will be on the platform. This doesn&#8217;t include those with guest access outside the organization, who are always free of charge.</p>
<p>The company also reports 400% year-over-year growth and says it&#8217;s expecting that trend to continue, but declines to share its current revenue figures.</p>
<p>The additional funding will help Flowhaven fuel its growth, expand its product and platform, and aid in hiring, Törmä says. Today, the company&#8217;s staff is split between offices in Helsinki, London and L.A. but says it&#8217;s seeing the most growth in the latter two.</p>
<p>In terms of the product itself, the plan is to further develop Flowhaven&#8217;s analytics and speed up the process of exchanging information between the brand owners and their licensees.</p>
<p>Already in 2021, Flowhaven is growing. It began the year with a team of 30 and is now 43 people. Throughout the year, Törmä says the team will grow to nearly 100.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cowrywise.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowrywise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Nigerian fintech startup that offers digital wealth management and financial planning solutions, has raised $3 million in pre-Series A funding. </span><a href="https://quona.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quona Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led the round as <a href="https://www.tsadik.org/">Tsadik Foundation</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gumroad CEO </span><a href="https://twitter.com/shl?lang=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahil Lavingia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a syndicate of Nigerian angel investors locally and in the diaspora participated. The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously raised more than $500,000 through a combination of equity financing and grants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for Cowrywise came when CEO </span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/razaqa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Razaq Ahmed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was an investment analyst with Meristem covering equities and making recommendations to retail and wealth management clients. He noticed that existing investment management firms in the country focused on the top 1 percent. They couldn&#8217;t scale investment products to millions of Nigerians primarily due to their restricting size.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks, though, have been able to make progress on this front when compared to investment firms. They expanded heavily in the mid and late 2000s to accumulate the branch networks they have today where there are about 45 million unique accounts in Nigeria.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But over the years, the quality of bank services in terms of savings and investments has drastically reduced. With interest rates hovering around 3-5% per annum, what Nigerians are now familiar with is to send and receive money via their bank accounts, and use debit cards for withdrawals leaving the market still underserved when it comes to investment products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, Ahmed, alongside </span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/edwardpopoola"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edward Popoola</span></a> as CTO<span style="font-weight: 400;">, founded Cowrywise in 2017 to solve this problem. With Cowrywise, they hoped to democratise access to savings and investment products to the growing demography of underserved Nigerian millennials and the middle class. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wealth management had been strange to many Nigerians because the existing players were not built for the mass market. That has always been a problem we felt required a solution,&#8221; Ahmed told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they launched, the founders wanted to leverage the telecom industry&#8217;s reach to drive its investment products to millions of subscribers. But it didn&#8217;t turn out as planned, as the project became expensive to undertake and also, the telcos requested cutthroat prices and commissions. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company switched focus, deciding to build upon existing payment infrastructure companies like Flutterwave and Paystack. The first facet of products launched to the market were savings-related products backed by fixed income instruments like treasury bills. Ahmed claims that these products yield better interests at 10%-15%, more substantial than what banks offered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following that was the introduction of its mutual funds&#8217; products. Currently, the company has 19 different mutual funds and at least 20% of the total mutual funds in the country are listed on its platform. Ahmed claims this is the largest portfolio of mutual funds a single entity has in the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These assets cut across five investment partners, and they allow users to save and invest with as little as ₦100 ($0.25). The partners include United Capital Asset Management, Meristem Wealth Management, Afrinvest Wealth Management, ARM Investment Managers and Lotus Capital. Cowrywise indirectly charges customers for this service and splits the fee with the mutual fund partners but the CEO doesn&#8217;t disclose how much. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the four-year-old company takes into account the needs of different demographics and religious background, which Ahmed asserts is as a result of an understanding with the mutual fund partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our mutual fund partners clearly recognize the value of being part of an inclusive digital platform that allows retail investors to invest regardless of faith or financial status,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YC alum and Catalyst Fund company also offers advisory services and recommends different funds to customers based on their risk appetite and spending power.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2105287" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2105287" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2105287 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-screens-9-1024x576-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-screens-9-1024x576-1.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-screens-9-1024x576-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-screens-9-1024x576-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-screens-9-1024x576-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-screens-9-1024x576-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-screens-9-1024x576-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2105287" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cowrywise</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But building trust with users has not always been smooth for the company. It’s an issue Ahmed explains Cowrywise has had to deal with via transparency and outstanding service delivery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, one of Cowrywise&#8217;s darkest days came last September when a customer took to Twitter to complain about its lack of communication in reported stolen funds from her account. In response, Cowrywise </span><a href="https://cowrywise.com/blog/official-statement-from-cowrywise-customer-support-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apologised for the lapse in communication</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, acted on the request, and promised to do better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Service delivery has helped us bridge that trust gap to a huge extent, and I feel it&#8217;s reflected in the user growth and adoption we&#8217;ve experienced. Trust was a major issue we faced but right now, we&#8217;re crossing that bridge pretty well,&#8221; the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About that, Cowrywise has more than 220,000 users. In its first year, it had just 2,000 users. Similarly, to highlight the journey ahead for the company, there are only half a million Nigerians actively investing in mutual funds. When compared to the total number of active bank accounts in the country of more than 40 million, it is obvious Cowrywise still has room to grow in the $3 billion market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowrywise&#8217;s unique approach to wealth management is one reason why Quona Capital led the round according to partner </span><a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/johanbosini"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johan Bosini</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The VC firm, known to back fintech and retail enablers like SA-based Lulalend and Yoco, and Kenya&#8217;s Sokowatch, is making its first foray into the Nigerian market with Cowrywise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Razaq, Edward, and the Cowrywise team are providing everyday Nigerians with easy access to powerful and flexible wealth-generating tools that have typically been reserved for people who are already wealthy,&#8221; said Bosini to TechCrunch. &#8220;In a market of 200 million people, we think this will be very impactful for individuals to have more control over their financial future.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company hopes to increase its customer base, and the new infusion will be critical to that. According to the company, the investment will also expand Cowrywise’s product offerings, support more fund managers in Nigeria and build out its investment management infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowrywise is one of the many wealth tech startups on the continent. There are startups with comparable business models like Nigeria&#8217;s Piggyvest and others are Robinhood-esque platforms like Egypt&#8217;s Thndr and Nigeria&#8217;s Bamboo, Trove, Risevest and Chaka. Cowrywise&#8217;s investment which is the largest publicized round at this stage brings in much-needed validation for this segment of fintech startups that are starting to take off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same vein, despite a slow start to a year which has seen Africa&#8217;s agritech and cleantech sectors take the lion&#8217;s share of investments, we might see fintech startups picking up the kind of pace we&#8217;ve been accustomed to that has made them dominate VC funding for the past couple of years.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned popular messaging app with more than 2 billion users, has been getting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a lot of heat</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/e2e-encrypted-email-providers-also-see-sign-ups-surge-as-chat-app-users-flock-to-signal-and-telegram-in-search-of-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">losing users</a> in recent weeks after announcing (and then <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delaying</a>) changes to how it uses your data. It&#8217;s not done with how it&#8217;s tweaking privacy and security. Now, it&#8217;s adding a new biometric feature to the service to bring in a new authentication layer for those using its web and desktop versions.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1354700879312560128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that from today, it will let people add in a fingerprint, face, or iris scan to use WhatsApp on desktop or web by linking it to your mobile app, to be used alongside the existing QR code authentication.</p>
<p>The feature is coming on the heels of what WhatsApp is describing as a &#8220;visual refresh&#8221; of the WhatsApp web page on the Android and iOS apps for linking and managing devices connected to your account. The company hints there will be more updates coming soon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the new feature, you will now be able to add in a biometric login, which uses either a fingerprint, face ID, or iris ID &#8212; depending on the device &#8212; on Android or iPhone handsets, to add in a second layer of authentication. It works only if you&#8217;ve enabled biometric authentications on your device: it doesn&#8217;t if you have not.</p>
<p>When implemented, it will appear for users before a desktop or web version can be linked up with a mobile app account, which today relies just on using a QR code. The QR code doesn&#8217;t go away; this is a second step users will need to take, similar to how you can choose to implement two steps of authentication on a handset to use the WhatsApp mobile app today.</p>
<p>WhatsApp says that on iPhone, it will work with all devices operating iOS 14 and above with Touch ID or Face ID, while on Android, it will work on any device compatible with Biometric Authentication (Face Unlock, Fingerprint Unlock or Iris Unlock). The full instructions for how to turn it on <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/download-and-installation/how-to-log-in-or-out?fbclid=IwAR3NUNKWcx73cQbKXwaEQ132mxGsrlkEGGqKhEUvtsnXCL9HIN5z57vJUiI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are here</a>.</p>
<p>The service is another step forward in WhatsApp creating more feature parity between its flagship mobile apps and how you interact with the service when you use it elsewhere.</p>
<p>While WhatsApp started as a mobile messaging app, it has over the years been building out other ways of using it, for example <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/19/at-long-last-whatsappweb-ios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding desktop support in 2015 to the iOS version</a>.</p>
<p>Mobile still accounts for the majority of WhatsApp&#8217;s users, but events like global health pandemics, which are keeping more of us inside, are likely leading to a surge of users of its Web and native desktop apps, and so it makes sense for it to be adding more functionality there.</p>
<p>WhatsApp told TechCrunch that it is going to be adding in more features this year to bring the desktop and mobile experiences closer together. There are still big gaps. For example, you can&#8217;t make calls on the WhatsApp web version. (That feature may be one coming soon: last month, it <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-calls-available-on-whatsapp-web-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started to get spotted in beta tests</a>.)</p>
<h3>What comes next for biometrics?</h3>
<p>WhatsApp&#8217;s recent announcement (and walk back) regarding data-sharing changes between it and Facebook have put a lot of people on edge about the company&#8217;s intentions.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s no surprise. It&#8217;s a particularly sensitive issue since messaging has been thought of a very personal and sometimes private space, seen as separate from what people do on more open social networking platforms.</p>
<p>Over the years, of course, that view has been eroded through data leaks, group messaging abuse, and (yes) changes in privacy terms.</p>
<p>All that means there will likely be a lot of people who will doubt what Facebook&#8217;s intentions are here, too.</p>
<p>WhatsApp is pretty clear in outlining that it&#8217;s not able to access the biometric information that you will be storing in your device, and that it is using the same standard biometric authentication APIs that other secure apps, like banking apps, use.</p>
<p>But the banking app parallel is notable here, and maybe one worth thinking about more. Consider how the company has been adding a lot more features and functionality into WhatsApp, including the ability to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-receives-approval-to-expand-its-payments-service-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pay for goods and services</a>, and in markets like India, tests to offer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/whatsapp-to-pilot-projects-to-deliver-credit-insurance-and-pension-to-users-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insurance and pension products</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, this new biometric feature is being rolled out today to create a more secure way for people to link up apps across devices. But in the interest of that feature parity, in future, it will be interesting to see how and if biometrics might appear as those other features get rolled out beyond mobile, too.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Text corrected to reflect that the new look will be on the mobile apps (not the web) aimed at improving how to manage linked devices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.levity.ai/">Levity</a>, which has been operating in stealth (until now), is the latest no-code company to throw its wares into the ring, having picked up $1.7M in pre-seed funding led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/angular-ventures/">Gil Dibner’s Angular Ventures</a>. The Berlin-based startup wants to bring AI-powered workflow automation to anyone, letting knowldge workers automate tedious, repetitive and manual parts of their job without the need to learn how to code.</p>
<p>Suitable for customer service, marketing, operations, HR, and more, Levity has elected to be a horizontal offering from the get-go. Typical repetitive tasks that can be automated includes reviewing and categorizing documents, images, or text. The premise is that conventional, rule-based automation software isn’t able to automate tasks like these as it requires cognitive abilities, meaning that they usually done manually. This, of course, is where machine learning come into play.</p>
<p>“We want to solve the problem that people spend so much time at their jobs doing boring, repetitive stuff that can be automated to free up space and time for fun and interesting work,” says Gero Keil, co-founder and CEO. “Even though this is what AI has been promising us for decades, there are very few solutions out there, and even less for non-technical people who can’t code”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jVJH3bTRNY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/blobr/">Blobr, the &#8216;no-code&#8217; company turning APIs into products, raises €1.2M pre-seed</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Blobr, the &#8216;no-code&#8217; company turning APIs into products, raises €1.2M pre-seed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/blobr/embed/#?secret=jVJH3bTRNY" data-secret="jVJH3bTRNY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To that end, Keil says Levity’s entire mission is to help non-technical knowledge workers automate what they couldn’t automate before. Specifically, the startup targets work processes that involve making decisions on unstructured data, such as images, text, PDFs and other documents.</p>
<p>“For example, if a company receives hundreds or thousands of emails from partners and customers with attachments every day, someone typically has to download the attachment, look at it and then decide what to do with it,” explains Keil. “With Levity, they can train their own custom AI on all of the historic data that they have accumulated, and once it has learned from that it seamlessly integrates with their existing tools and workflows e.g. Dropbox, Gmail, Slack etc.”</p>
<p>More broadly, he says there are many companies struggling to “productionize AI” that would really benefit from having an end-to-end platform “that enables them to build their own AI solutions and make them part of their processes”.</p>
<p>Keil argues that Levity’s main competitor is people doing work manually, but concedes that there is crossover with automation machine learning tools, workflow automation offerings, and labeling tools,</p>
<p>“Instead of going deep into every domain of the ML value chain and making the lives of developers and data scientists at large corporations easier, we focus only the most essential bits and pieces, wrap them in simple and enjoyable UX and abstract the rest away,” he says. “That makes us the best for non-developers in small and medium-sized businesses that want to automate previously non automatable processes in the most straightforward way. The people that have the automation problem become the same people that solve the automation problem; it’s a paradigm shift just like what Wix and Squarespace did to websites”.</p>
<p>Adds Gil Dibner, general partner and founder at Angular Ventures, in a statement: “Levity is driving a massive shift that will affect all knowledge workers. By allowing knowledge workers to easily train AI engines, build AI-powered automations, and integrate them into their everyday workflows, Levity is radically democratizing the benefits of AI.”</p>
<p>Alongside Angular, Levity’s other backers include: System.One, Discovery Ventures (founders of SumUp), Martin Henk (founder of Pipedrive) and various additional unnamed angel investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has shared a few more details about its much-discussed privacy changes in iOS 14. The company first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-ios-14-ad-tracking/">announced at WWDC in June</a> that app developers would have to ask users for permission in order to track and share their IDFA identifier for cross-property ad targeting purposes.

<p>Now we&#8217;ve got a slightly-more-specific timeline. The plan is to launch these changes in early spring, with a version of the feature coming in the next iOS 14 beta release.</p>
<p>This is how Apple describes the new system: &#8220;Under Settings, users will be able to see which apps have requested permission to track, and make changes as they see fit. This requirement will roll out broadly in early spring with an upcoming release of iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and tvOS 14, and has already <a href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ranking-Digital-Rights-Joint-Letter-to-Apple-iOS14-delay.pdf">garnered support from privacy advocates around the world</a>.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And here are the basics of what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The App Tracking Transparency feature moves from the old method where you had to opt-out of sharing your Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) to an opt-in model. This means that every app will have to ask you up front whether it is ok for them to share your IDFA with third parties including networks or data brokers.</li>
<li>The feature&#8217;s most prominent evidence is a notification on launch of a new app that will explain what the tracker will be used for and ask you to opt-in to it.</li>
<li>You can now toggle IDFA sharing on a by-app basis at any time, where previously it was a single toggle. If you turn off the &#8220;Allow apps to request to track&#8221; setting altogether no apps can even ask you to use tracking.</li>
<li>Apple will enforce this for all third-party data sources including data sharing agreements, but of course platforms can still use first party data for advertising as per their terms of service.</li>
<li>Apple expects developers to understand whether APIs or SDKs that they use in their apps are serving user data up to brokers or other networks and to enable the notification if so.</li>
<li>Apple will abide by the rules for its own apps as well and will present the dialog and follow the &#8216;allow apps to request&#8217; toggle if its apps use tracking (most do not at this point).</li>
<li>One important note here is that the Personalized Ads toggle is a <em>separate</em> setting that specifically allows or does not allow Apple itself to use its own <em>first party</em> data to serve you ads. So that is an additional layer of opt-out that affects Apple data only.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple is also increasing the capabilities of its Ad attribution API, allowing for better click measurement, measurement of video conversions and also — and this is a big one for some cases, app-to-web conversions.</p>
<p>This news comes on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Privacy_Day">Data Privacy Day</a>, with CEO Tim Cook speaking on the issue this morning at the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference in Brussels. The company is also sharing <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf">a new report</a> showing that the average app has six third-party trackers.</p>
<p>While this seems like a welcome change from a privacy perspective, it&#8217;s drawn some criticism from the ad industry, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">Facebook launching a PR campaign emphasizing the impact on small businesses</a>, while also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/facebook-q4-earnings-2/">pointing to the change</a> as &#8220;one of the more significant advertising headwinds&#8221; that it could face this year. Apple&#8217;s stance is that this provides a user-centric data privacy approach, rather than an advertiser-centric one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on the company&#8217;s 2020 Q4 earnings call that all engineering work is now complete on the Tesla Semi, the freight-hauling semi truck that the company is building with an all-electric powertrain. The company expects to begin deliveries of Tesla Semi this year, it said in its Q4 earnings release, and Musk said the only thing limiting their ability to produce them now is the availability of battery cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main reason we have not accelerated new products – like for example Tesla Semi – is that we simply don&#8217;t have enough cells for it,&#8221; Musk said. &#8220;If we were to make the Semi right now, and we could easily go into production with the Semi right now, but we would not have enough cells for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musk added that the company does expect to have sufficient cell volume to meet its needs once it goes into production on its 4680 battery pack, which is a new custom cell design it created with a so-called &#8216;tables&#8217; design that allows for greater energy density and, therefore, range.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JPOSyQCqWW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/future-teslas-will-have-batteries-that-double-as-structure-making-them-extra-stiff-while-improving-efficiency-safety-and-cost/">Future Teslas will have batteries that double as structure, making them extra stiff while improving efficiency, safety and cost</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Future Teslas will have batteries that double as structure, making them extra stiff while improving efficiency, safety and cost&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/future-teslas-will-have-batteries-that-double-as-structure-making-them-extra-stiff-while-improving-efficiency-safety-and-cost/embed/#?secret=JPOSyQCqWW" data-secret="JPOSyQCqWW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;A Semi would use typically five times the number of cells that a car would use, but it would not sell for five times what a car would sell for, so it kind of would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now,&#8221; Musk said. &#8220;But it will absolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint.&#8221;</p>
<p>That constraint points to the same conclusion for the possibility of Tesla developing a van, Musk added, and the lifting of the constraint will likewise make it possible for Tesla to pursue the development of that category of vehicle, he said.</p>
<p>Tesla has big plans for &#8220;exponentially&#8221; ramping cell production, with a goal of having production capacity infrastructure in place for a Toal of 200 gigawatt hours per year by 2022, and a target of being able to actually produce around 40% of that by that year (with future process improvements generating additional gigawatt hours of cell capacity  in gradual improvements thereafter).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The man behind a once-influential pro-Trump account is facing charges of election interference for allegedly disseminating voting disinformation on Twitter in 2016.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors allege that Douglass Mackey, who used the name &#8220;Ricky Vaughn&#8221; on Twitter, encouraged people to cast their ballot via text or on social media, effectively tricking others into throwing away those votes.</p>
<p>According to the Justice Department, 4,900 unique phone numbers texted a phone number Mackey promoted in order to &#8220;vote by text.&#8221; <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/twitter-doesnt-think-this-attempt-to-disenfranchise-voters-v">BuzzFeed reported the vote-by-text scam at the time</a>, noting that many of the images were photoshopped to look like official graphics from Hillary Clinton&#8217;s presidential campaign.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Some of those images appeared to specifically target Black and Spanish-speaking Clinton supporters, a motive that tracks with the account&#8217;s track record of white supremacist and anti-Semitic content. The account was <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/twitter-doesnt-think-this-attempt-to-disenfranchise-voters-v">suspended</a> in November 2016.</p>
<p>At the time, the mysterious account quickly gained traction in the political disinformation ecosystem. HuffPost <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-white-nationalist-troll-ricky-vaughn_n_5ac53167e4b09ef3b2432627">revealed that the account was run by Mackey</a>, the son of a lobbyist, two years later.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; His talent for blending far-right propaganda with conservative messages on Twitter made him a key disseminator of extremist views to Republican voters and a central figure in the alt-right&#8217; white supremacist movement that attached itself to Trump’s coattails,&#8221; HuffPost&#8217;s Luke O&#8217;Brien reported.</p>
<p>Mackey, a West Palm Beach resident, was taken into custody Wednesday in Florida.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no place in public discourse for lies and misinformation to defraud citizens of their right to vote,&#8221; Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Seth D. DuCharme said.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Mackey’s arrest, we serve notice that those who would subvert the democratic process in this manner cannot rely on the cloak of Internet anonymity to evade responsibility for their crimes.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is open to licensing its software, including its Autopilot highly-automated driving technology and the neural network training it has built to improve its autonomous driving technology. Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed those considerations on the company&#8217;s Q4 earnings call on Wednesday, adding that the company has in fact already &#8220;had some preliminary discussions about licensing Autopilot to other OEMs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company began rolling out its beta version of the so-called &#8216;full self-driving&#8217; or FSD version of Autopilot late last year. The standard Autopilot features available in general release provide advanced driver assistance (ADAS) which provide essentially advanced cruise control capabilities designed primarily for use in highway commutes. Musk said on the call that he expects the company will seek to prove out its FSD capabilities before entering into any licensing agreements, if it does end up pursuing that path.</p>
<p>Musk noted that Tesla&#8217;s &#8220;philosophy is definitely not to create walled gardens&#8221; overall, and pointed out that the company is planning to allow other automakers to use its Supercharger networks, as well as its autonomy software. He characterized Tesla as &#8220;more than happy to license&#8221; those autonomous technologies to &#8220;other car companies,&#8221; in fact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One key technical hurdle required to get to a point where Tesla&#8217;s technology is able to demonstrate true reliability far surpassing that of a standard human driver is transition the neural networks operating in the cars and providing them with the analysis that powers their perception engines is to transition those to video. That&#8217;s a full-stack transition across the system away from basing it around neural nets trained on single cameras and single frames.</p>
<p>To this end, the company has developed video-labelling software that has had &#8220;a huge effect on the efficiency of labeling,&#8221; with the ultimate aim being enabling automatic labeling. Musk (who isn&#8217;t known for modesty around his company&#8217;s achievements, it should be said) noted that Tesla believes &#8220;it may be the best neural net training computer in the world by possibly an order of magnitude,&#8221; adding that it&#8217;s also &#8220;something we can offer potentially as a service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Training huge quantities of video data will help Tesla push the reliability of its software from 100% that of a human driver, to 200% and eventually to &#8220;2,000% better than the average human,&#8221; Musk said, while again suggesting that it won&#8217;t be a technological achievement the company is interested into keeping to themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a wild day for public markets driven by Reddit traders commandeering stocks and combatting hedge fund short sellers, the community at r/wallstreetbets no longer has a home on Discord and its Reddit community has been locked down as an invite-only subreddit for the time being.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Update: 4:49pm PT:</strong> The r/wallstreetbets subreddit returned <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6j4r9/where_do_we_go_from_here_and_who_is_going_to_step/">with a post from moderator u/zjz</a> claiming that the group was &#8220;suffering from success,&#8221; and needed more help from Reddit to deal with the new flow of attention it has received while also calling out Discord for banning their chat community, &#8220;Discord did us dirty and I am not impressed with them destroying our community,&#8221; the moderator noted.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Discord announced this afternoon that they had banned the WallStreetBets Discord server following hate speech violations after &#8220;repeated warnings.&#8221; The Discord server had been seeing heavy traffic of new users in the past several days as traffic surged to the subreddit as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On Reddit&#8217;s end, it&#8217;s not quite so clear what has happened. It does not appear as though Reddit took direct action against the community, but instead that r/wallstreetbets moderators were overwhelmed by the influx of new users and have taken the subreddit down themselves. The site notes that only moderators and &#8220;approved users&#8221; are currently allowed in the community. A number of long-time subscribers have noted on social media that they are unable to access the community which boasted several million subscribers.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Reddit for further clarification.</p>

<p>In a statement given to TechCrunch earlier today before the WallStreetBets subreddit went private, a company spokesperson says, &#8220;Reddit&#8217;s site-wide policies prohibit posting illegal content or soliciting or facilitating illegal transactions. We will review and cooperate with valid law enforcement investigations or actions as needed.”</p>
<p>The full statement from a Discord spokesperson to TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The WallStreetBets server has been on our Trust &amp; Safety team’s radar for some time due to occasional content that violates our Community Guidelines, including hate speech, glorifying violence, and spreading misinformation. Over the past few months, we have issued multiple warnings to the server admin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we decided to remove the server and its owner from Discord for continuing to allow hateful and discriminatory content after repeated warnings.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, we did not ban this server due to financial fraud related to GameStop or other stocks. Discord welcomes a broad variety of personal finance discussions, from investment clubs and day traders to college students and professional financial advisors. We are monitoring this situation and in the event there are allegations of illegal activities, we will cooperate with authorities as appropriate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla just released its latest earnings report, and the results indicate that Elon Musk&#8217;s bets on energy storage and solar are beginning to pay off.</p>
<p>The storage business was the star of the company&#8217;s power plays in the fourth quarter, with quarterly year-on-year growth approaching 200%. As the company said in its presentation to shareholders, &#8220;[energy] deployments grew substantially from 2019 to 2020. For the first time, our total battery deployments surpassed 3 GWh in a single year, which is an 83% increase compared to the prior year.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2101547" style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png" alt="" width="1024" height="219" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png 2604w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png?resize=150,32 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png?resize=300,64 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png?resize=768,165 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png?resize=680,146 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png?resize=1536,329 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png?resize=2048,439 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png?resize=50,11 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Solar deployments also had their day in the sun. For the year, solar energy installations increased to 205 MW, an 18% increase over the prior year. &#8220;This growth is the result of meaningful improvements to our solar retrofit strategy, including product simplification, cost reduction and industry-leading pricing.</p>
<p>Revenue from the energy generation and storage business came in at $752 million for the fourth quarter, up from $436 million in the year-ago period, and up $579 million from the third quarter.</p>
<p>This is likely only the beginning of the surge that&#8217;s coming for Tesla&#8217;s power business. The company has long stated that it wants to be one of the world&#8217;s largest power or utility companies, and global capital is marshaling resources to encourage the shift to renewables.</p>
<p>Tesla could be a huge beneficiary from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/a-biden-presidency-doesnt-need-a-green-new-deal-to-make-progress-on-climate-change/">Biden administration&#8217;s renewable plans</a> through their goals to dramatically boost solar development and buildings. The big infrastructure spend will require big batteries to store renewable power. It will also require massive solar installations.</p>

<p>And even as the federal government makes money moves to renewables, private capital is coming in to boost solar installations and energy storage dramatically.</p>
<p>Over the last week alone, investors have pumped nearly $2 billion into companies that lend money to homeowners for solar installations and energy efficiency upgrades. One company, founded by a former SolarCity executive, announced that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/renewable-investment-wave-continues-as-solar-lending-company-loanpal-raises-800-million/">raised $800 million in capital just today</a>.</p>
<p>At least some of that money will have cash registers ringing for Tesla&#8217;s energy storage and solar installation business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four European apps which secure user data via end-to-end encryption, ProtonMail, Threema, Tresorit and Tutanota, have issued a joint-statement warning over recent moves by EU institutions that they say are setting lawmakers on a dangerous path to backdooring encryption.</p>
<p>End-to-end encryption refers to a form of encryption where the service provider does not hold keys to decrypt the data, thereby enhancing user privacy &#8212; as there&#8217;s no third party in the loop with the technical capability to access data in a decrypted form.</p>
<p>E2e encryption also boosts security by reducing the attack surface area around people&#8217;s data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However growth in access to e2e encrypted services has, for some half decade or more, been flagged as an issue of concern for law enforcement. This is because it makes it harder for agencies to access decrypted data. Service providers served with a warrant for e2e encrypted user data will only be able to provided it in an unreadable form.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/eu-council-wants-secure-encryption-and-lawful-data-access/">Last month </a>the EU Council passed a resolution on encryption that&#8217;s riven with contradiction &#8212; calling for &#8220;security through encryption and security despite encryption&#8221; &#8212; which the four e2e app makers believe is a thinly veiled call to backdoor encryption.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DZuIiXHIBA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/eu-council-wants-secure-encryption-and-lawful-data-access/">EU Council wants secure encryption and lawful data access</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU Council wants secure encryption and lawful data access&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/eu-council-wants-secure-encryption-and-lawful-data-access/embed/#?secret=DZuIiXHIBA" data-secret="DZuIiXHIBA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The European Commission has also talked about seeking &#8220;improved access&#8221; to encrypted information, writing in a wide-ranging counter-terrorism agenda also published in December that it will &#8220;work with Member States to <strong>identify possible legal, operational, and technical solutions for lawful access</strong>&#8221; [emphasis its].</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the Commission has said it will &#8220;promote an approach which both maintains the effectiveness of encryption in protecting privacy and security of communications, while providing an effective response to crime and terrorism&#8221;. And it has made it clear there will be no &#8216;one silver bullet&#8217; as regards the e2e encryption security &#8216;challenge&#8217;.</p>
<p>But such caveats are doing nothing to alleviate the concerns of e2e encrypted app makers &#8212; who are convinced proposals from the Council of the EU, which is involved in adopting the bloc&#8217;s laws (though the Commission usually drafts legislation), sums to an push toward backdoors.</p>
<p>&#8220;While it’s not explicitly stated in the resolution, it’s widely understood that the proposal seeks to allow law enforcement access to encrypted platforms via backdoors,&#8221; the four app makers write, going on to warn that such a move would fatally underline the security EU institutions also claim to want to maintain.</p>
<p>&#8220;The resolution makes a fundamental misunderstanding: Encryption is an absolute, data is either encrypted or it isn’t, users have privacy or they don’t,&#8221; they go on. &#8220;The desire to give law enforcement more tools to fight crime is obviously understandable. But the proposals are the digital equivalent of giving law enforcement a key to every citizen’s home and might begin a slippery slope towards greater violations of personal privacy.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On encryption and counter-terrorism, EU lawmakers say they&#8217;ll work for &#8216;lawful&#8217; data access&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/on-encryption-and-counter-terrorism-eu-lawmakers-say-theyll-work-for-lawful-data-access/embed/#?secret=QnhJyyVmaZ" data-secret="QnhJyyVmaZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>They point out that any move to break e2e encryption in Europe would run counter to the global rise in interest in robustly encrypted services &#8212; pointing to the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/e2e-encrypted-email-providers-also-see-sign-ups-surge-as-chat-app-users-flock-to-signal-and-telegram-in-search-of-privacy/">surge in sign-ups for apps like Signal</a> as a result of mainstream privacy concerns attached to Facebook-owned WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Europe has also been ahead of the curve globally in legislating to protect privacy and security. So it would be quite the U-turn for EU lawmakers to line up to poke holes in e2e encryption. (Which, for example, EU data protection regulators are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">simultaneously recommending</a> be used in order to legally secure transfers of personal data out of the bloc to third countries where it might be at risk).</p>
<p>To say there are ideological contradictions in the EU pushing in an anti-encryption direction is a massive understatement. Even as the contents of current communiques coming out of Brussels on this topic read as if they&#8217;re inherently conflicted &#8212; which may in fact be a recognition that squaring this circle is no simple policy proposition.</p>
<p>The app makers also pick up on that. &#8220;People around the world are taking back control of their privacy, and often it’s European companies helping them do it. It seems illogical that policy makers in the EU would now push for laws that fly in the face of public opinion and undermine a growing European technology sector,&#8221; they write.</p>

<p>In an individual quotation from the joint-statement, Andy Yen, CEO and founder of ProtonMail, a Swiss end-to-end encrypted email service, warns against complacency in the face of the latest seeming push for a legal framework to perforate encryption.</p>
<p>“This is not the first time we’ve seen anti-encryption rhetoric emanating from some parts of Europe, and I doubt it will be the last. But that does not mean we should be complacent,” he said. “Put simply, the resolution is no different from the previous proposals which generated a wide backlash from privacy conscious companies, civil society members, experts and MEPs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The difference this time is that the Council has taken a more subtle approach and avoided explicitly using words like ‘ban’ or ‘backdoor’. But make no mistake, this is the intention. It’s important that steps are taken now to prevent these proposals going too far and keep European’s rights to privacy intact.”</p>

<p>Martin Blatter, CEO of end-to-end encrypted instant messaging app Threema, also argues that EU lawmakers risk kneecapping homegrown startups if they seek to push ahead with legislation to force European vendors to bypass or deliberately weaken e2e encryption.</p>
<p>&#8220;[It] would not only destroy the European IT startup economy, it would also fail to provide even one bit of additional security,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;Joining the ranks of the most notorious surveillance states in this world, Europe would recklessly abandon its unique competitive advantage and become a privacy wasteland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also chipping in, Istvan Lam, co-founder and CEO of Tresorit, an e2e encrypted file sync &amp; sharing service, argues that any moves to weaken encryption would seriously undermine trust in services &#8212; as well as being &#8220;irreconcilable with the EU’s current stance on data privacy&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We find this resolution especially alarming given the EU’s previously progressive views on data protection. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU’s globally recognized model for data protection legislation, explicitly advocates for strong encryption as a fundamental technology to ensure citizens’ privacy,&#8221; he said, adding: &#8220;The current and proposed approaches are at complete odds with each other, as it is impossible to guarantee the integrity of encryption while providing any kind of targeted access to the encrypted data.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Arne Möhle, co-founder of Tutanota, a German e2e encrypted email provider, says any push to backdoor encryption would be a disaster for security &#8212; which actually risks <em>helping</em> criminals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every EU citizen needs encryption to keep their data safe on the web and to protect themselves from malicious attackers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With the latest attempt to backdoor encryption, politicians want an easier way to prevent crimes such as terrorist attacks while disregarding an entire range of other crimes that encryption protects us from: End-to-end encryption protects our data and communication against eavesdroppers such as hackers, (foreign) governments, and terrorists.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By demanding encryption backdoors, politicians are not asking us to choose between security and privacy. They are asking us to choose no security,” he added.</p>

<p>A fight looks to be brewing in Europe over what exactly the Council&#8217;s contradictory edict on ensuring &#8220;security through encryption and security despite encryption&#8221; will shake out to. But it seems clear that any push toward backdoors would mobilize major regional opposition &#8212; as well as being an unattractive option for EU policymakers because it would face legal challenge under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/">region&#8217;s jurisprudence</a>.</p>
<p>The Commission recognizes this complexity. Its counter-terrorism agenda is also notably wide-ranging. There&#8217;s certainly no suggestion that it believes e2e encryption is a sole nut that must be cracked. EU institutions are pushing across a number of fronts here, not least because a bunch of fundamental red lines limit wiggle room for non-targeted interventions.</p>
<p>What comes out of the Council&#8217;s resolution may therefore be a concerted push to upskill police in areas relevant to investigations (such as digital forensics and metadata analysis). And perhaps create structures for local or state level forces across the bloc to access more powerful security service technical competences for furthering targeted investigations (e.g. device hacking). Rather than an EU-level order blasted at e2e encryption vendors to mandate a universal key escrow &#8216;solution&#8217; (or similar) &#8212; indiscriminately risking everyone&#8217;s security and privacy.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s certainly one to watch.</p>
