		Wilkin Sanchez is the founder of the Rhode Island Group for Hispanic Technology (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/rihispanictech/">RIGHT</a>).	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">When I first came to the United States from the Dominican Republic, nobody wanted to hire me for a job in tech.</p>
<p>Rather than recognize the skills I possessed, employers could only see my still-developing English and my lack of a college degree. They failed to take into account my years of experience working with technology and electronics because the route I had taken was too unfamiliar.</p>
<p>It’s a situation all too common for the more than <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/our-solutions/stars-insights/reach-stars-report/">70 million workers in the U.S.</a> who are <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/stars/">skilled through alternative routes (STAR)</a> — especially for the <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/our-solutions/stars-insights/hispanic-stars/">13.5 million Hispanic STAR</a> workers like me out there today. If the employers who are <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cybersecurity-job-openings-united-states/">struggling to fill open tech roles</a> want to overcome the growing “skills gap,” then it’s a situation that must change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When I arrived in the U.S., I applied to countless IT jobs, from customer service to computer repair. Every company rejected me before they even gave me the chance to show what I could do. Had employers taken the time to talk to me, they would have learned I started fixing my neighbors’ phones and computers at the age of 12, and that I had already sailed through a series of computer classes on networking, basic coding, cybersecurity, scripting and computer repairs.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			About 31 million workers — including millions of Hispanic workers — possess skills that qualify them for higher-paying roles they are never considered for.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Even as I continued to learn English and mastered coding and cybersecurity concepts, companies failed to recognize what I could bring to the table. My background was too unfamiliar to make it past most employment filters that relied on degree requirements. I was often screened out of the hiring process before showcasing my talents, and I faced the biases of hiring managers who weren’t used to candidates like me. I could only get cleaning jobs or work at factories and fast food restaurants — places where I felt all my skills were going to waste.</p>
<p>I ended up getting lucky, and thanks to mentoring and hiring support through a follow-on to President Obama’s <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/technology/techhire">TechHire Initiative</a>, doors began to open. After years of struggling, I could finally get my foot in the door, meet hiring managers and showcase my skills. I am now working as a cybersecurity associate, but my career could have begun much earlier.</p>
<p>Sadly, this story is a familiar one for far too many STAR workers, especially Hispanic people. Many of them aren’t as lucky as I am.</p>
<p>The statistics are sobering. About 31 million workers — including millions of Hispanic workers — possess skills that qualify them for higher-paying roles they are never considered for. Recent research shows, for instance, that there are 114,000 Hispanic workers employed as food and hospitality service managers, who have the skills to transition to similarly skilled jobs as community and social services managers, where wages are nearly 50% higher.</p>
<p>Hispanic STAR workers <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/our-solutions/stars-insights/navigating-stars-report/#wpcf7-f2868-o1">are also less likely</a> to transition to higher-wage jobs than their white counterparts, and even when they are able to make such a transition, they are compensated less for their skills.</p>
<p>Employers must begin building more promising pathways that are accessible to all workers. The need for this shift has only grown over the last year as the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted Hispanic and Latino communities. Hispanic or Latino workers accounted for <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2021/03/05/496733/latinos-face-disproportionate-health-economic-impacts-covid-19/">nearly one-quarter</a> of the pandemic’s initial job losses. Even as the economy continues to slowly recover, the unemployment rate for those workers sits at 8.6%, compared with 5.7% for white workers. The fallout has been especially pronounced among Hispanic and Latina women. In December, they <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/08/covid-job-losses-women-december-us-unemployment-rate/">accounted for 45%</a> of all job losses.</p>
<p>All this is happening while employers say they are struggling to find workers to fill open positions, even as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/15/966376492/millions-are-out-of-a-job-yet-some-employers-wonder-why-cant-i-find-workers">millions remain unemployed</a> and job postings have <a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/02/02/job-postings-through-jan-29/">begun to return</a> to pre-pandemic levels. The narrative around <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/09/09/the-labor-market-doesnt-have-a-skills-gap-it-has-an-opportunity-gap/">skills gaps</a> continue to be perpetuated by employers, and they <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2021-02-01-covid-19-has-widened-the-skills-gap-but-it-also-presents-an-opportunity-to-close-it">may have worsened</a> during the COVID-19 crisis. These gaps are <a href="https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/projecting-future-skill-shortages-through-2029/">expected to cost</a> the U.S. economy $1.2 trillion over the following decade, but most of these gaps aren’t actually real. They’re just the consequence of employers ignoring workers who learned their skills through alternative routes.</p>
<p>By rethinking hiring barriers like degree requirements, employers can more easily find job-ready talent and improve diversity at the same time. Such shifts can lead to even more systemic change down the road.</p>
<p>My success doesn’t end with me, as there is a multiplier effect to hiring STAR workers. Now that I have a strong foothold in the industry, I am able to help other members of my community. I formed an organization called Rhode Island Group for Hispanic Technology (RIGHT) to provide training in basic computing, coding, cybersecurity and digital literacy — all in Spanish.</p>
<p>If America is going to build back better, employers need to seek out and hire more workers who are skilled through alternate routes. They must begin to look beyond the traditional signals of employability and expand their understanding of what makes a good employee. Those who fail to do so will continue to miss out on the more than 13 million talented Hispanic STAR workers like me.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Things are changing in China, and the regulatory landscape of tech work in the country won't be the same from here on out.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Watching the Chinese technology sector over the last week has been a fascinating exercise. The Chinese government took on entire industries like edtech while also coming down on individual companies (Tencent, Meituan) in a broad effort to change the country&#8217;s technology landscape.</p>
<p>The sum of the financial damage is easy to understand. The <a href="https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/Index/History/HXC">NASDAQ Golden Dragon China Index</a>, for example, which tracks U.S.-listed companies that do their business in China, fell from a 52-week high set earlier this year of 20,893.02 to 10,672.37 yesterday. You can also track the decline in value of various Chinese technology companies both on-shore and on foreign exchanges if you want to get an even fuller picture of the financial carnage.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s common among commentators and analysts to draw a direct line between the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/pulled-ant-group-ipo-costs-alibaba-nearly-60b-in-market-cap/">blocked Ant Group IPO last year</a>, the ensuing fall from grace of Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, and the latest news out of the Chinese Communist Party&#8217;s (CCP) regulatory bodies. That&#8217;s reasonable. Things are changing in China, and the regulatory landscape of tech work in the country won&#8217;t be the same from here on out.</p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve explored the moment a little, noting last week that edtech investment <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">could slow</a> in the country provided that the government went through with its plan to force tutoring companies to go nonprofit. The government then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">did so</a>, and more, also blocking tutoring companies from being formed, going public, raising external capital from foreign sources and more. It was comprehensive. Natasha Mascarenhas has a great read on the matter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/edtechs-venture-backed-globalization-pauses-at-china/">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, bad news for startups? After all, if edtech investment could slow in the face of regulatory changes, what about other technology-influenced areas of business?</p>
<p>The negative case is somewhat easy to make. The positive case is more interesting. Some market watchers are making the argument that by taking on some of China&#8217;s largest technology companies, more room could be cleared in the country for smaller companies to snag a piece of business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jason Saltzman is a serial entrepreneur. He first cofounded SeamlessDocs and then went on to found The Alley, a coworking space based out of New York City. Following Alley&#8217;s joint venture partnership with Verizon, Saltzman left to build something new and became fascinated with the debt consolidation and relief space.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how <a href="https://www.relief.app/">Relief</a>, cofounded by Saltzman, Bryan Okeke, and Ram Barrouet, was born. Today, the startup is announcing it has raised $2 million via a convertible note, led by Collaborative Fund, BFV, Necessary Venture, The Fund. Angels also participated in the round, including Justin Kan, Ben Kaplan, Elliot Tabule, and David Galanter.</p>
<p>Saltzman&#8217;s thesis came out of his observation of the space. Third-party debt collection agencies use lots of automation tools but those same services aren&#8217;t extended to the individuals seeking debt relief. Relief is an app that uses machine learning algorithms and collective bargaining to reduce debt balances. In essence, Relief does the math on behalf of users and negotiates directly with creditors to bring down the balance (in half of more, according to Saltzman), all for free.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not unlike Justworks, Relief uses the power of its entire user base to negotiate with creditors to bring down balances and lower interest rates. Once the negotiation is complete, Relief sets up a payment plan for users to pay off the rest of their debt.</p>
<p>Offering debt consolidation and loans for folks in financial peril is not new, but the ability to negotiate on behalf of the user is not a broadly available feature on most similar platforms.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not a platform to help folks save money. Saltzman explained that Relief app is an alternative to bankruptcy.</p>
<p>To start, Relief will generate revenue by the credit issuers who pay to have settlements handled, with Relief taking the place of a debt collector. The startup can also generate revenue by issuing loans and earning off of the interest. But Saltzman hopes to get enough users to start thinking creatively about how to make other forms of revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust is the biggest challenge,&#8221; said Saltzman. &#8220;We have to get into consumers houses and de-stigmatize this horrible problem. The solution is not there right now. The data shows us that one in three Americans is behind on their credit card bills right now. So we need them to trust us.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: An earlier version of this article stated that Verizon acquired Alley. It has been updated for accuracy.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As I write this, I have no fewer than five recently reviewed earbuds sitting on the desk in front of me. And you know what? They’re all pretty good. Some are better than others, of course — that’s why they invented gadget reviews. But as far as consumer electronics go, the category seemed to mature &#8212; and the products became ubiquitous &#8212; virtually overnight.</p>
<p>Nearly every hardware maker has entered the category — some several times over. You can get a truly great pair for over $200 and a pretty decent one for under $100. There’s a broad range in quality across that spectrum, of course. But features? A few things, here and there, but on the whole, earbuds settled into a similar sort of homogeneity as smartphones before them.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172645" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172645" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172645" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9559.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172645" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Differentiation was certainly a big topic during today’s launch of Nothing’s Ear (1). It’s also been a core part of Nura’s DNA since the beginning. But where a company like Nothing views its earbuds as the first piece in a larger ecosystem, Nura is, simply put, a headphone company. And there’s a pretty simple reason behind that. Everything Nura does is built around its audio technology — something that’s held true since before I had the opportunity to try the original Nuraphones as a prototype with a big, unsightly circuit board attached.</p>
<p>Announced today, NuraTrue mark the company’s third entry into the headphone market, following the over-ear Nuraphones and the tethered Nuraloop. The “true,” one assumes, refers to the truly wireless design, abandoning the behind-the-neck design that gave last year’s Nuraloop their name.</p>
<p>The decision to launch earbuds with a wire seemed an odd one at the $199 price point four years after Apple released the first AirPods (the year Nura was founded). There were some practical technical concerns, and Nura made the most of them with a magnetic connector that lets them double as wired headphones/monitors (something I appreciated when I still took a couple plane rides a month).</p>

<p>When I put the question of going fully wireless to Nura co-founder Dragan Petrovic, he answered,</p>
<blockquote><p>We wanted to release a fully wireless product only once we could ensure an outstanding user experience and (most importantly) outstanding sound quality. Fully wireless earbuds have been around for about 5 years now, but only recently has the underlying technology matured to the point of being able to do justice to the music. These improvements were delivered by the wireless chip providers, which is why many of the fully wireless products that have come out this year are considerably better than what was available before. For NuraTrue, we took the finally mature wireless technology provided by the chip makers and added Nura&#8217;s (or rather, the listener&#8217;s) personalized sound to deliver the best sound quality in the most convenient form factor.</p></blockquote>
<p>While it’s true that everyone and their uncle has offered their own take on the category, Nura’s entry wasn’t as simple as pulling together some off-the-shelf components. The company offers one of the more unique listening experiences, courtesy of on-board technology that beams sound into the wearer’s ear and reads back the faint transmissions that return.<br />
Per Nura,</p>
<blockquote><p>Encoded in the returning sound wave is information about how well you heard the sound that went in. The Nuraphone uses an extremely sensitive microphone to detect this returning sound wave, and a self-learning engine built into the Nuraphone to create your profile. No buttons or knobs. It all happens automatically and in about 60 seconds. It is a little bit magic.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2172649" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172649" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172649" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172649" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The experience is the same across the three devices, so we’ve written about it a few times. Essentially the system creates a sort of custom sonic fingerprint based on the reading it gets back and uses that to adjust the settings according. It does feel like a bit of wizardry the first time you try it, especially when you flip back and forth between the default and custom settings.</p>
<p>The original Nuraphones quickly became one of my most recommended headphones — a solid accomplishment for such a young hardware startup. Since the launch of the original over-ear headphones, however, I’ve been waiting to see what the company might be able to do in a fully wireless form factor. And on most accounts, I’d say the NuraTrue are a success.</p>
<p>The great sound is largely intact — a solid accomplishment. There are nuances you’ll hear in these headphones that you too often miss in comparably priced tech — subtle details that get lost in the mix with less balanced headphones. Of course, you’ll continue to lose other nuances depending on the source of the music you’re listening to. What Nura’s able to do is impressive, but not miraculous.</p>
<p>You do, obviously, lose something with the smaller size. The Nurphones’ big differentiator is the addition of a powerful, tactile bass, courtesy of the ear cups. This experience is accomplished to some extent by the immersion slider in the app, which is designed to adjust the experiential level provided by the buds. But again, there’s no replacing the cocooning effect of the over-ear cups.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172646" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172646" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172646" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172646" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>But listen, at this point I think we all implicitly understand that different form factors offer different compromises. Otherwise, we would only have one style of headphone. The NuraTrue are quite light — I was actually surprised, given their size. Each bud weighs 7.4 grams. They’re also extremely comfortable. As with other Nura products, the headphones will detect whether you have a tight seal when doing the initial testing. Of its three products, however, the NuraTrue gave me the least problems on that front.</p>
<p>As someone who frequently experiences ear pain from different buds, they’ve not given me an issue wearing them around effectively all day. The weight distribution and a design that you basically twist into your ear means they stay put quite well. I’ve had no issues with them falling out at the gym or on a few short runs.</p>
<p>The active noise canceling is decent. It’s not industry-leading by any stretch, but it gets the job done for sure. It’s a bit of an annoyance, however, that you have to go into the app to toggle it on and off — as well as the immersion feature. These things, coupled with the fundamental importance of sound profiles means the buds are tied to their app a lot more than other earbuds. It’s the price you pay for being different, I suppose.</p>
<p>The battery is rated at six hours on the buds and 24 with the case factored in. There’s no superfast charging here — it takes about 2.5 hours to get the case’s 500 mAh battery from zero to full. Likely that won’t be an issue unless you never remember to charge the thing or you’re planning to go on a couple of long-haul flights. The inclusion of four battery lights on the front of the case is a nice touch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172650" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172650" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172650" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9578.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172650" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>My biggest complaint here is a bit of a surprise to me. A majority of the headphones I’ve tested recently haven’t had any Bluetooth connectivity issues. Honestly, I’d thought we’d moved past that. While the NuraTrue isn’t using the latest version of Bluetooth (5.2), the 5.0 it does uses is the same version found in, say, the AirPods Pro (Apple, of course, has the decided advantage of making its own phone, operating system and chips). The connection is fine around the house, but I’ve experienced drops while walking around that I haven’t with other recent pairs.</p>
<p>It’s more annoying than end of the world, but it’s worth keeping in mind — and certainly something the company should consider addressing for gen 2. The built-in  microphone also left something to be desired, creating distortion when I took calls.</p>
<p>As from those, there’s really not a lot to complain about. The NuraTrue are well rounded (figuratively and literally), comfortable, and the company’s sound profiling technology is enough of a standout feature to set them apart from an army of similar buds. For my own specific needs, I’d say they also make the Nuraloop largely redundant, though Petrovic tells me, the company is keeping the product around as it, “complement[s] our product portfolio by offering things that no true wireless product has, most importantly 16+ hours of battery life, and the ability to connect to an analog audio jack.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172643" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172643" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172643" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172643" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Fair enough on those two points. Again, if any headphone did everything, there wouldn’t be much point in variety. On the whole, I do think NuraTrue carry the far broader appeal for a majority of users. The ability to hardwire has its appeal but is pretty limited for most of us at this point. And 16 hours of battery built-in is great, but most of the time six on the bud and 24 with the case should suffice.</p>
<p>Mostly, it’s just nice to see a legit hardware startup continue to make some waves in the consumer space by taking on the big names with differentiated technology. In the earliest days, I’d imagined Nura would get snapped up by a Samsung or Apple, but I’m glad the company opted to go its own way.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For our Wednesday show this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> Chris had prior Equity guest Phil Libin back for a chat. Libin was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/listen-to-us-talk-about-undercorns-ipos-and-what-going-public-is-really-about/">on our show a while back</a> to chat about his startup studio. But since then, he&#8217;s been a little busy.</p>
<p>You may recall that mmhmm, Libin&#8217;s project to build a better video communication service, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/mmhmm-raises-100m-which-is-a-fun-thing-to-say-to-people-who-dont-follow-tech/">raised $100 million the other week</a>. And we here on the Equity pod made a little bit of fun at the number. It was just so very much money for a roughly one year old company. What was the company going to use it for?</p>
<p>Well, Libin&#8217;s folks got in touch and so we decided to just have him on to chat. And we wanted him back because he was one of the most memorable guests on the show, frankly, thanks to his candor the last time around.</p>
<p>So, what did we get into? A refresh on the mmhmm story, and notes from Libin about what&#8217;s ahead for his company. It certainly has the cash to pursue its vision. But as we learned, building software for a variety of platforms comes with challenges. Challenges that are ameliorated by having lots of smart staff. So, that&#8217;s where the money is going.</p>
<p>Regardless, it was good sporting of Libin to come back for another chat. Equity is back Friday morning with our news roundup. Make sure to follow the show on Twitter, as we&#8217;re doing the odd Twitter space that you won&#8217;t want to miss.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Music publishing giant ASCAP said today that a quartet of early-stage startups/university music projects will compete in its Immersive Music Studio Challenge. The 12-week project is a partnership between ASCAP Lab and NY Media Lab (NYCML) that offers the teams grants and access to development resources. They&#8217;ll also be showcasing at the upcoming <a href="http://www.ascapexperience.com">ASCAP Experience</a>.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting little cohort, aiming to tackle some wide-ranging music industry issues. Some have already laid out commercialization plans, while others essentially came together for the program and really haven’t thought that far down the road.</p>
<p>We spoke to the founding teams to get a better sense of the projects.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><strong>Who&#8217;s on your founding team? </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>MiSynth began as a fictional business proposal created by Senaida Ng in her freshman year class, “Are Friends Electric?” taught by professor Errol Kolosine. After the class ended, Ng continued with the idea and worked closely with Kolosine to bring the idea to life. She recruited Ph.D. biomedical engineer Sinem Eriksen to lead the R&amp;D alongside the guidance of NYU Music and Audio Research Lab (MARL) researchers Pablo Ripollés and Elena Georgieva.</p>
<p><strong>Please describe your product. What problems in the market are you trying to address?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>MiSynth is a revolutionary music software plugin that will allow musicians, songwriters and producers to synthesize any sounds they hear in their heads. They will bridge the gap between your imagination and your music by taking data from brain computer interfaces (BCIs) and turning them into playable MIDI instruments. The team at MiSynth strongly believes that everyone can and should have the tools to be an artist. Rather than spending hours learning about sound design and trying to re-create the perfect synth, MiSynth is making music more accessible and efficient for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any plans to commercialize? If so, what? Have you identified revenue streams?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we plan on continuing to build our prototype and testing it after the ASCAP NYCML Challenge and we hope to launch our software by August 2024. MiSynth will be sold as a software plugin compatible with any digital audio workstation (DAW), including Logic Pro X, Ableton Live, Pro Tools, FL Studio, Cubase and Reason. Customers can buy the license to use the software by paying either a one-time fee or a monthly subscription fee until they pay off the full price of the license.</p>
<p><strong>What is your funding to date?</strong></p>
<p>We are a relatively new company that began only in December 2020, but we plan on continuing to seek funding from investors, research grants and challenges like the ASCAP NYCML Challenge to continue our venture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Voice-based and other personal assistant apps &#8212; which use natural language and hefty AI engines in the backend to source information to address your various questions, do your e-commerce bidding, or control one electronic device or another in your home &#8212; have been around for years, but too often they have come up short when it comes to user experience, failing to nail the right solutions to your queries. Today a new app is launching from a startup that has largely been in stealth mode up to now to try to address that disparity. <a href="https://brain.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brain Technologies</a> is today announcing $50 million in funding, and along with that is releasing <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/natural-simply-get-anything/id1521375720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natural</a>, an iOS app, in the US market.</p>
<p>The $50 million (which is actually described as &#8220;over $50 million&#8221; by the company, with an exact number undisclosed), meanwhile, is coming from a very interesting mix of investors &#8212; backers include Laurene Powell Jobs&#8217; Emerson Collective, Goodwater Capital, Scott Cook and WTT Investment, a list that underscores some of the attention that Brain has been getting, even before having released a single product.</p>
<p>Prior to this round, Brain had raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/25/meet-brain-the-ai-engine-that-wants-to-replace-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 million back in 2016</a> from an unnamed investor while still in stealth mode.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jerry Yue, the young founder and CEO of Brain &#8212; a repeat entrepreneur and robotics enthusiast whose last company, a grocery delivery service in China called Benlai, is <a href="https://www.benlai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still going strong</a> &#8212; said in an interview that he does not like to call Natural a &#8220;personal assistant&#8221; app, not because of the shortcomings of so many of these in the past, but because of the voice association many have with the concept.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don’t position ourselves as a voice assistant because we don’t think the future is voice only,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It should be the right combination of voice and native app experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, he describes what Natural is as the world&#8217;s first &#8220;generative computer interface&#8221;, the logical progression in digital information search.</p>
<p>That progression, in his view, started with the web, progressed to search engines, and then apps, before landing where he sees it today. Natural brings all of these together in some degree. Currently, you speak or type any kind of question or command into the app, which then provides a solution that might be in the form of links to other apps you might have.</p>
<p>For example, &#8220;I&#8217;d like sushi tonight,&#8221; will bring back options (in theory) for ordering sushi, and possibly your most favored dishes, from a selection of restaurants by way of food ordering apps that you use, or places to go eat it, as well as options for making that sushi yourself (and buying the ingredients online to do so, as well as a method).</p>
<p>Similarly, travel searches return results that dip into multiple silos from, say, airlines and airline aggregators that are easily editable and that you can buy directly from those results, if you already have payment details on your device. (While Google provides this to some degree, you eventually have to navigate to sites to buy tickets, which might end up significantly more expensive when you actually visit said sites.)</p>
<p>The more you use the app, the theory is that it will learn more about what you might want from your questions.</p>
<p>AI that anticipates what we are trying to say or do is something that has been attempted before, of course, but the difference here, Yue said, is in Brain&#8217;s approach, which is based on the concept of &#8220;one shot&#8221; learning, which he described as a kind of general purpose AI, &#8220;a tool that learns to use other tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>The alternative is a more labor-intensive approach that AI-based systems are typically built on today, largely based around keywords. &#8220;AIs from Google or Amazon are based on thousands of people and human coding to connect services,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This approach treats natural language processing as a classification problem.&#8221; In contrast, the breakthrough system he and his team have devised, he said, &#8220;has learned more than 4 million functions on its own.&#8221; Ironically, the end result of a successful AI like this is not to make us feel more technologically powerful, but to get us away from our devices, and spending time fussing on them, and into the world.</p>
<p>Given that this is a consumer app, it will be interesting to see how and if there is mass takeup of Natural, and whether the right combination of anticipatory AI with natural language and design come together to pique collective attention. The team and what they&#8217;ve built in any case will be a hot property, given that AI will continue to be a strong and growing presence in the tech landscape for years to come.</p>
<p>“What Jerry and his team are developing is incredibly special. I’m not aware of anyone doing more interesting work to demonstrate how fundamentally AI can enhance our everyday lives,” said investor Scott Cook, who was also the founder of financial software giant Intuit, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Many of us remember the first time we used an iPhone. The software felt magical, and every animation felt dynamic yet subtle,” said Tom Goodwin, a Natural beta customer. “Experiencing this app is the closest thing I’ve felt to that for a long time. I love the idea of one place to go for everything.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company's post-funding valuation is $3.7 billion, according to a source familiar with the investment round.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Redwood Materials CEO JB Straubel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/why-amazon-and-panasonic-are-betting-on-this-battery-recycling-startup/">shared his aspirations</a> last year to turn the startup he co-founded in 2017 into one of the world’s major battery recycling companies. Now, the former Tesla co-founder and CTO has the money to accelerate those plans.</p>
<p>Redwood Materials said Wednesday it raised $700 million from high-profile institutional investors and venture firms, providing the capital needed to expand its existing operations well beyond its Carson City, Nevada, home base to locations throughout North America and even into Europe.</p>
<p>The Series C round was led by funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates and included Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Baillie Gifford, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Fidelity. Previous investors &#8212; Capricorn&#8217;s Technology Impact Fund, Bill Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund &#8212; returned to put more capital into Redwood. Valor Equity Partners, Emerson Collective and Franklin Templeton also participated, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Redwood previously raised $40 million in a Series B and some seed money, which brings its total raise under $800 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s post-funding valuation is $3.7 billion, according to a source familiar with the investment round. Redwood declined to comment on the figure.</p>
<p>Redwood Materials is aiming to create a circular supply chain. This closed-loop system, Straubel said, will be essential if the world&#8217;s battery cell producers hope to have the supply needed for consumer electronics and the coming wave of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Redwood recycles scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. It then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and supplies those back to its customers, which today includes Panasonic at the Gigafactory in Nevada that it operates with Tesla and Envision AESC&#8217;s battery plant in Tennessee. Redwood has also partnered with Amazon to recycle EV and other lithium-ion batteries and e-waste from parts of their businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our view, the need for these materials will grow exponentially over time as we enter the era of de-carbonization,&#8221; Joe Fath, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund, said in a statement, adding that &#8220;Redwood is well-positioned to be at the forefront of tackling this emerging and critically important problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Straubel sees a bottleneck coming as the whole supply chain seeks to access critical materials. That will affect the growth rate and challenge automakers like Ford, GM and Volkswagen that have laid out ambitious plans to electrify their portfolios.</p>
<p>That problem is likely to compound as more automakers go down the electric path. Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/mercedes-benz-to-build-eight-battery-factories-in-push-to-become-electric-only-automaker-by-2030/">Mercedes-Benz said</a> it will spend €40 billion ($47 billion) to become an electric-only automaker by the end of the decade. The German automaker determined it will need battery capacity of more than 200 gigawatt-hours. To meet those needs, Mercedes plans to set up eight battery factories with existing partners and one new partner to produce cells.</p>
<p>Straubel said it&#8217;s time for Redwood to scale more aggressively.</p>
<p>Those plans were already well underway even before it closed the $700 million round, Straubel noted. The company announced in June it had purchased 100 acres of land near the Gigafactory that Panasonic operates with Tesla in Sparks, Nevada. Redwood now has some operations at the site.</p>
<p>Redwood is also in the process of nearly tripling the size of its existing 150,000-square-foot facility in Carson City, Nevada. The new 400,000-square-foot addition onto the recycling facility is expected to be operational by the end of the year.</p>
<p>To support the growth, Redwood started hiring more employees, with plans to add more than 500 jobs over the next two years. Redwood employs more than 130 people today.</p>
<p>The company has expanded in other ways as well, including the launch of a program that allows consumers to send in personal electronics such as smartphones to be recycled.</p>
<p>&#8220;This additional equity to some extent helps us finish all those things, but it&#8217;s not really the primary purpose for all of it,&#8221; Straubel said.</p>
<p>The company is examining additional sites in North America and actively looking at entering the European market, he added without providing a specific timeline. He did say that for now, Redwood is focused on the North American and European markets. Asia would be its third market.</p>
<p>Redwood is also investing money into some large-scale projects that seek further improve its recycling process, specifically around material purification and how to most effectively get these raw materials back into the battery supply chain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Noetic Cyber, a cloud-based continuous cyber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/asset-management/">asset management</a> and controls platform, has launched from stealth with a Series A funding round of $15 million led by Energy Impact Partners.</p>
<p>The round was also backed by Noetic’s existing investors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ten-eleven-ventures/">TenEleven Ventures</a> and GlassWing Ventures, and brings the total amount of funds raised by the startup to $20 million following a $5 million seed round. Shawn Cherian, a partner at Energy Impact Partners, will join the Noetic board, while Niloofar Razi Howe, a senior operating partner at the investment firm, will join Noetic&#8217;s advisory board.</p>
<p>“Noetic is a true market disruptor, offering an innovative way to fix the cyber asset visibility problem — a growing and persistent challenge in today’s threat landscape,” said Howe.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts-based startup claims to be taking a new approach to the cyber asset management problem. Unlike traditional solutions, Noetic is not agent-based, instead using<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>API aggregation and correlation to draw insights from multiple security and IT management tools.</p>
<p>“What makes us different is that we’re putting orchestration and automation at the heart of the solution, so we’re not just showing security leaders that they have problems, but we’re helping them to fix them,” Paul Ayers, CEO and co-founder of Noetic Cyber tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Ayer was previously a top exec at PGP Corporation (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/29/symantec-shells-out-370-million-for-data-encryption-companies-pgp-and-guardianedge/">acquired by Symantec for $370 million</a>) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/vormetric/">Vormetric</a> (acquired by Thales for $400 million) and founded Noetic Cyber with Allen Roger and Allen Hadden, who have previously worked at cybersecurity vendors including Authentica, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/raptor/">Raptor</a> and Axent. All three were also integral to the development of Resilient Systems, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/29/ibm-adds-post-cyber-attack-planning-with-resilient-systems-acquisition/">which was acquired by IBM</a>.</p>
<p>“The founding team’s experience in the security, orchestration, automation and response market gives us unique experience and insights to make automation a key pillar of the solution,” Ayers said. “Our model gives you the certainty to make automation possible, the goal is to find and fix problems continuously, getting assets back to a secure state.”</p>
<p>“The development of the technology has been impacted by the current cyber landscape, and the pandemic, as some of the market drivers we’ve seen around the adoption of cloud services, and the increased use of unmanaged devices by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/remote-work/">remote workers</a>, are driving a great need for accurate cyber asset discovery and management.”</p>
<p>The company, which currently has 20 employees, says it plans to use the newly raised funds to double its headcount by the end of the year, as well as increase its go-to-market capability in the U.S. and the U.K. to grow its customer base and revenue growth.</p>
<p>“In terms of technology development, this investment allows us to continue to add development and product management talent to the team to build on our cyber asset management platform,” Ayers said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The beauty of our approach is that it allows us to easily add more applications and use cases on top of our core asset visibility and management model. We will continue to add more connectors to support customer use cases and will be bringing a comprehensive controls package to market later in 2021, as well as a community edition in 2022.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Spot is tackling affordable healthcare with a digital, on-demand injury insurance product that can be as-is or as a compliment to traditional health insurance.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Affordable healthcare continues to be a major problem in the U.S., with roughly 30 million people without comprehensive healthcare and high medical costs causing many to go into debt. <a href="https://www.getspot.com/">Spot</a> is tackling this issue with a digital, on-demand injury insurance product that can be as-is or as a complement to traditional health insurance.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Austin, the company raised $15 million in equity and $2.5 million in debt in a round of seed funding led by GreatPoint Ventures, with participation from Montage Ventures, Mutual of Omaha, MS&amp;AD and Silverton Partners.</p>
<p>The idea for the company came from a conversation founder Maria Goy and Matt Randall had back in 2018. Randall is married to Goy’s best friend, and one night, they started talking about Goy’s job at the time, in insurance at New York Life, and how there needed to be a product that provided affordable insurance. That led to a discussion about how to also have healthcare that was accessible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Every major market was disrupted by some change of distribution, like Netflix and Airbnb,” Goy told TechCrunch. “We are setting the foundation to drive change and the distribution of insurance.”</p>
<p>Spot’s business model takes a holistic approach by providing customized injury insurance policies through both direct-to-consumer and strategic partnerships with companies and organizations. For example, one of the company’s first partners was the Austin Marathon, selling one-time injury policies to the participants. Randall wasn‘t sure if people would buy them, but they ended up selling over 1,100 policies.</p>
<p>That led to applying the same idea across youth sports, ski resorts and cycling organizations. It now has over a dozen partners, including USA Cycling, Powder Mountain, USA BMX, National Ski Patrol and athleteReg, and covers tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>The policies start at $25 and work like a monthly subscription. Family plans are also available. Spot covers up to $20,000 each time the customer is injured. The company will also coordinate with any existing healthcare insurance. Customers can use any licensed physician, hospital or urgent care clinic.</p>
<p>Spot has grown 800% in policies from last year and 300% in partnerships, including bringing on Mutual of Omaha. Spot is the first startup the insurance giant has invested in, and “having them alongside Maria is beyond a powerhouse team to say the least,” Randall said.</p>
<p>The company’s policies are available in 42 states via the DTC model and nationwide on group coverage, Goy said. The new funding round will be used to triple Spot’s team of 25, go after new partnerships and develop a go-to-market strategy. Randall also plans to raise a Series A round in the next nine months.</p>
<p>“We are focusing on bringing additional products that fill in holes and gaps in insurance and provide more education to the market,” Goy added. “We are getting requests for alternative coverage. For example, people would rather have acupuncture instead of surgery, which is not easy for a typical policy. Ultimately, our big mission is how to create a community within our customers and drive engagement.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Mike McCormick, principal at GreatPoint Ventures, will join Spot’s board of directors. He said in an interview that his firm is on the lookout for things that make healthcare better, including companies rooted in rethinking how to keep people well.</p>
<p>Spending much of his time in both healthcare and insurtech, McCormick wanted to find an answer to the problem of how the U.S. is spending so much money, on a per capita basis, and getting what he called “meh results.”</p>
<p>There are also the issues of most care being fee-for-service, and insurance for most people being attached to employment, while high deductibles have become a big feature, he said. He likes Spot because it is offering a product, for example, to someone young who is unlikely to get diabetes or cancer soon, but could incur $10,000 in medical costs breaking a leg skiing.</p>
<p>“What Spot is doing for the underinsured and uninsured makes sense,” McCormick added. “Maria and Matt are incredible people building an incredible company with growth and product-market fit. In terms of the partnership and direct-to-consumer models, they could build either one into a $10 billion company and both will work.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A slew of launch startups have emerged in recent years to help meet growing demand from satellite providers, biotech companies and others looking to send payload to space. One such startup is Germany’s <a href="https://www.isaraerospace.com/">Isar Aerospace Technologies</a>, which is focused on building orbital launch vehicles designed to carry up to 1,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit.</p>
<p>The startup made headlines last December – including here at TechCrunch – for scoring a $91 million Series B, the largest round to date in the European space launch scene. Now the company says it has raised an additional $75 million in a Series B extension, bringing the total round to over $165 million.</p>
<p>The extension round was led by HV Capital, Porsche SE and banking group Lombard Odier. Existing investors Earlybird Venture Capital, Lakestar, Vsquared Ventures, Apeiron Investment Group and UVC Partners also participated, with Earlybird subscribing the largest amount. Earlybird and Airbus Ventures led Isar’s <a href="https://www.isaraerospace.com/article.php?id=2019121001">$17 million Series A</a> in December 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Participation by Porsche SE – a major shareholder of Volkswagen – is particularly interesting as it signals growing interest from established mobility investors in connectivity and space-enabled technologies.</p>
<p>“As an investor focusing on mobility and industrial technology, we are convinced that cost-effective and flexible access to space will be a key enabler for innovations in traditional industries as well as for new and disruptive technologies and business models,” Porsche SE executive board member Lutz Meschke said in a statement. “Therefore, we are excited to back Isar Aerospace on its way to become the leading European small-launcher and to meet the increasing appetite for launch services.”</p>

<p>The funding will likely provide a significant boost for continued development and manufacturing as the company nears its planned first test flight in 2022.</p>
<p>Isar began production of its inaugural launch vehicle, the Spectrum rocket, this year. Spectrum is a two-stage vehicle that’s designed for lightweight delivery to low Earth orbit. The idea is to create a launcher that can move quickly and at a low cost to small satellite companies. Isar is aiming to conduct engine tests in Kiruna, Sweden, and launch operations in nearby Andøya, Norway, thanks to a 20-year agreement with Andøya Space for exclusive access to one of its launch pads. Notably, Isar has already secured its first paying customer, Airbus Defence and Space, and said in a statement that it plans on announcing more contracts soon.</p>
<p>The startup was spun out of Munich Technical University, where co-founders Daniel Metzler, Josef Fleischmann and Markus Brandl were studying engineering. While many of the new wave of launch companies are based in the United States, Isar is leading a parallel wave in Germany.</p>
<p>“A competitive and diverse space ecosystem will be crucial for humanity in the decades to come,” Isar CEO Daniel Metzler said in a statement. “We are convinced that European cooperation, a level-playing field for all players, and a demand-driven approach will provide customers with access to different and internationally competitive launch capabilities for a broad spectrum of payloads. The US has shown that cornerstone contracts based on demand – instead of political parameters – are preparing the ground for innovation and growth in the space sector.”</p>

<p>As well a product development, Dixa plans to use the cash injection as a war chest to roll-up other products. It already acquired Melbourne-based Elevio in January 2021.</p>
<p>Founded in Denmark in 2015 and launched in 2018, Dixa says it enables brands to stay connected with customers via messaging, live chat, email, or voice.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mads Fosselius, founder and CEO of Dixa said: “For today’s customers, channels have ceased to matter. The way they engage now is holistically blended into what is called ‘multiexperience’. This is how we’re empowering brands to continuously stay true to their values.</p>
<p>Tom Hussey, Vice President in General Atlantic’s Technology sector focused on B2B software added: “Customer service software is undergoing a fundamental transformation, moving away from disjointed, transactional approaches towards longitudinal, conversational engagement. Dixa has helped to define and lead this multiexperience approach.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company's digital therapy platform works to measure and improve someone’s ability to walk after they have experienced a neurologic injury or disease.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.medrhythms.com/">MedRhythms</a> secured $25 million in Series B funding to advance its digital therapy platform aimed at measuring and improving someone’s ability to walk after they have experienced a neurologic injury or disease.</p>
<p>Morningside Ventures and Advantage Capital co-led the round, with participation from existing investor Werth Family Investment Associates, to give the Portland, Maine-based company $31 million in funding to date.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Brian Harris was a neurologic music fellow at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston, treating people with stroke and brain deficits with music. He began getting questions from patients and families on how they could access similar care outside of the hospital. Not seeing a suitable alternative, he started MedRhythms with entrepreneur Owen McCarthy in 2016.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s platform uses sensors, music and software, along with an evidence-based intervention called “rhythmic auditory stimulation,” to target the neural circuitry that controls movement. The technology taps into “entrainment,” a neurologic process in which the auditory and motor systems of the brain are coupled in synchrony with an external rhythmic cue, which over time, can lead to improved walking functionalities.</p>
<p>“There is no other stimulus that engages the brain like music does,” Harris said. “When someone is engaging in music, it aids in neuroplasticity to create new connections and strengthen old ones. Neuroplasticity is how we can learn new things or why people with brain deficits can improve.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182726" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182726" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2182726" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg 1386w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Productcycle_Rev2-2-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182726" class="wp-caption-text">MedRhythms&#8217; product cycle. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> MedRhythms</p></div></p>
<p>A year ago, MedRhythms’ digital therapeutic product received Breakthrough Device designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat chronic walking deficits resulting from a stroke. It is the first in the company’s pipeline, which is also looking at using music to treat neurological conditions like Parkinson’s, acute stroke and multiple sclerosis. To that effect, it is participating in a neuroimaging study with Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>
<p>Harris intends to use the proceeds from the Series B funding to get the product to market, expand the team and the treatment pipeline. The company is preparing for submission to the FDA so it can do a commercial launch of the technology and begin clinical trials.</p>
<p>Stephen Bruso, investment partner at Morningside, said he has known the team at MedRhythms for a year. The firm is active in the digital health space and has followed the company closely since then.</p>
<p>COVID served to fundamentally shift healthcare in how to deliver care. The hospital and clinic models were robust, but resistant to change until the pandemic forced care to telemedicine visits at home, he said. It also forced innovation on the industry, and at-home therapy is an area where Bruso expects to see improvement in both patient compliance and recovery, and MedRhythms is capitalizing on that trend of shifting care to the home.</p>
<p>What intrigued the firm for the last couple of months was the idea of affecting the brain via non-pharmaceutical needs.</p>
<p>“MedRhythms using musical intervention to drive changes and improvements in neurologics is compelling,” Bruso added. “Emotional memory is tied to music. Its use provides a richer experience than taking a drug, and the company exists to tap into that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.algolia.com">Algolia</a> has raised a $150 million Series D funding round at a post-money valuation of $2.25 billion. Compared to the Series C round from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/algolia-finds-110m-from-accel-and-salesforce-for-its-search-as-a-service-used-by-slack-twitch-and-8k-others/">October 2019</a>, the company’s valuation has more than quadrupled. It means that Algolia is now a unicorn with a valuation above $1 billion.</p>
<p>The company is best known for its search-as-a-service product. It lets you integrate real-time search in your app or website using a developer-friendly API. Using an Algolia-powered search feature feels like using Spotlight on a Mac. Results load with each keystroke and appear in just a few milliseconds.</p>
<p>The company now has over 10,000 customers, including some big names, such as Slack, Stripe, Medium, Zendesk and Lacoste. Right now, the company handles over 1.5 trillion search queries per year — that’s a 1,500,000,000,000 if you want to see all the zeros.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lone Pine Capital is leading today’s funding round. Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, STEADFAST Capital Ventures, Glynn Capital and Twilio also participated in the round. But that’s not all, some existing investors also put more money on the table, such as Accel, Salesforce Ventures, DAG, Owl Rock and World Innovation Lab.</p>
<p>While the company doesn’t share revenue numbers directly, Algolia says that its annual recurring revenue has increased by 180% year over year.</p>
<p>“The future is API-first – a reality underscored by the growth seen by Twilio, Stripe, Algolia and others in the API economy. A huge part of our success has, and will continue to be, our relentless focus on developers with our PLG strategy — enabling them to build search into their websites and apps, so they create the most relevant and dynamic digital experiences.” Algolia CEO Bernadette Nixon said in a statement. “And we’re excited to continue to solve customers&#39; problems as we continue to expand beyond search with Algolia Recommend and Predict.”</p>
<p>In addition to its search API, Algolia has expanded to other real-time APIs. For instance, you can provide real-time product recommendations on your e-commerce website with <a href="https://www.algolia.com/products/recommendations/">Algolia Recommend</a>. This is part of a strategy to diversify the company’s product offering.</p>
<p>In particular, the company is now trying to analyze the visitor’s intent to predict whether they’re likely to purchase something on not. Companies can then leverage that info to refresh content dynamically, send a push notification, display a special offer, etc.</p>
<p>Originally founded in France, the company has grown tremendously over the past few years. Algolia is now a big enterprise-focused company with a solid business. Last year, its co-founder and CEO Nicolas Dessaigne <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/algolia-gets-a-new-ceo-as-founder-steps-down/">decided</a> to transition to a non-operational role.</p>
<p>And the company has recruited quite a few senior executives over the past 18 months — Michelle Adams (chief revenue officer, formerly of Dropbox), Carlton Baab (chief financial officer, formerly of Alfresco), Piyush Patel (chief business development officer, formerly of Capgemini), Jim Schattin (chief customer officer, formerly of Alteryx), Jason McClelland (chief marketing officer, formerly of Salesforce and Adobe) and Bharat Guruprakash (chief product officer, formerly of Twilio).</p>
<p>As you can see, it’s a long list of talented people, which means that Algolia is focused on building a long-term company instead of building cool technology and optimizing for an acquisition. I wouldn’t be surprised to learn about an IPO down the road.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is leading seniors through the Medicare maze, helping whittle down over 3,000 available plans into a handful of best choices based on their care requirements.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Employers typically offer three options for healthcare insurance. When it&#8217;s time to switch to Medicare, particularly Medicare Advantage, there are over <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-advantage-2021-spotlight-first-look/">3,500 plans available</a> nationwide, and an average of 30 plans someone can choose from in their particular area. Connie Health is leading seniors through the Medicare maze, helping whittle down those 3,000 plans into a handful of best choices based on care requirements.</p>
<p>The company’s three co-founders, Oded Eran, CEO, David Luna, chief revenue officer, and Michael Scopa, chief growth officer, saw this problem firsthand as executives at primary care company Iora Health, which is <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/one-medical-to-acquire-iora-health-2-1b-all-stock-deal">being acquired by OneMedical</a> for $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>They started their company in 2019 to develop a Medicare concierge service to assist seniors in easily navigating through those 30 plans to find the right one for them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We were coming from the provider side and understood that though healthcare is local, people don’t know the difference in hospitals or the ins and outs of local networks,” Eran told TechCrunch. “Seniors need trust there, and when there are local advisers to meet over the phone or at home, you gain that trust.”</p>
<p>The Boston-based company announced Wednesday it raised $13 million in Series A funding led by Khosla Ventures and Pittango Healthtech to give it a total of $16 million in funding. The company raised $3 million in a seed round back in January 2020, also led by Khosla. The seed and Series A rounds also saw participation by AbstractVentures, Dynamic Loop Capital, Arkitekt Ventures, as well as a group of angel investors, including Hippo Insurance CEO Assaf Wand and Flatiron Health founders Zach Weinberg and Nat Turner.</p>

<p>With 55 million Medicare consumers benefiting from major innovation in Medicare Advantage and value-based care, Kaul saw a large market that was being disrupted by Connie Health. He was especially impressed with the team Eran built and how the company was able to launch during the pandemic and stay nimble.</p>
<p>“The Medicare Advantage space is rich and will continue to grow,” Kaul added. “Technology has not played a big role here, and Oded is going to bring technology in to make the market more efficient.”</p>
<p>Medicare Advantage is the private market part of the insurance program. Eran said the government is trying to drive competition and innovation, so there are a lot of new players coming in to create more plan options, more nuances and to help manage costs better. On the consumer level, this creates a lot of confusion, he added. Potential customers have a hard time making decisions on the latest and greatest options, so they tend to stick with the status quo.</p>
<p>That’s where Connie Health comes in. The company’s technology takes into account the providers someone sees, the medications they are on and the benefits they would like to have, feed those into its model, and based on that, sifts through the thousands of plans available and recommends the best fits.</p>
<p>Four months ago, Connie Health kicked off its consumer platform in Arizona, and with the new investment, also began operating in Texas. Over the next year, Eran expects to move into Illinois, where he is seeing big demographic changes as a lot of people are moving into Medicare and other states. The new funding will also enable the company to branch off to other insurance products.</p>
<p>Within those states, the company’s footprint grew to seven markets, and its local agent base grew 15 times.</p>
<p>“We are going to democratize access to the local agents to help people make these often tough decisions and find healthcare that they deserve and have paid for all of their working life,” Eran said. “We are taking this market-by-market approach because healthcare is in the community.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four high-profile Indian entrepreneurs who are among those who kickstarted India’s SaaS journey, building and helping startups scale and win customers globally and also backed about 100 such firms, are ready for their next phase of participation in the country’s startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>The group &#8212; Girish Mathrubootham of Freshworks, Manav Garg of Eka Corporation, Shubham Gupta, formerly with investment firm Matrix, and Avinash Raghava, formerly with Nasscom, iSPIRT and SaaSBOOMi &#8212; said on Wednesday it has created a venture capital fund, called Together Fund, with an initial corpus of $85 million to back young Indian startups operating in the software-as-a-service space.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.together.fund">Together Fund</a> is looking to back between 20 to 25 startups at Pre-seed to Series B stages. The firm’s check size will range between $250,000 to $3 million, said Garg in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indian news outlet the CapTable <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/03/mathrubootham-garg-vc-hat-with-80-mn-saas-fund/">first reported</a> about the fund&#8217;s formation earlier this year and cited an investor who said that Together is likely to attract all good SaaS deals because of its founding team and problem statement.</p>
<p>The fund has amassed a network of over 150 startup founders and investors including Krish Subramanian of Chargebee, Nishith Rastogi of Locus, Shashank ND of Practo, and Kunal Shah of CRED. And that underscores the reason why Together Fund was conceived, said Garg. The entire team consists of founders and other operators who have built startups and have expertise around sales strategy and global expansion, he said.</p>
<p>“This is India’s first operator and founder-led fund,” he said. “The idea of creating this fund was to provide great help and opportunities to the founders along with money.”</p>
<p>The creation of the fund &#8212; which counts its founding team among its LPs &#8212; comes at a time when Indian startups are raising record capital as many high-profile investors double down in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>In the past decade, India’s startup ecosystem has evolved from a space that most Indian families were apprehensive about to one that has witnessed several high-profile exits and many entrepreneurs have marched ahead to work on their second startups.</p>
<p>“Today, Freshworks is a large company with more than 3,800 team members and offices all over the world. But almost eleven years ago, we were just a six-member team operating out of a small garage in Chennai. I didn’t have a gilt-edged resume or family wealth but that never stopped me from dreaming big,” wrote Mathrubootham in a blog post.</p>
<p>“To me, Together is not just a fund, it is a way to pay it forward to the startup community that gave me so much. It is a natural progression of the “pay it forward” initiatives we started with community programs such as PNGrowth, SaaSx and SaaSBOOMi. With Together, we are not just offering capital to founders, we are offering our time and counsel as well,” he added.</p>
<p>The founding team of Together Fund will continue to participate in other industry initiatives, including SaaSBOOMi, an annual flagship conference focused on SaaS startups in India, said Raghava in an interview.</p>
<p>India’s SaaS industry could reach $1 trillion in value and create about half million new jobs by 2030, according to a recent study by SaaSBoomi, consultancy firm McKinsey and industry trade group Nasscom.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[TechCrunch caught up with Contentful's CEO, Steve Sloan (previously of Twilio and Bessemer), and its comms connect, Brian Spittler (previously of Podium), to dig more into its products.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contentful</a> this morning announced a $175 million Series F round of capital, led by Tiger Global, valuing the unicorn at around $3 billion. Contentful, formerly known as a UI-free content management system (headless CMS), now views itself in a broader light. More simply, Contentful provides customers with a service that will deliver images, words, and other content to their applications and websites around the world, quickly.</p>
<p>According to the company, Tidemark and Base10 Advancement Initiative were added to its cap table in the round, which also saw participation from previous investors. Prior to the round that Contentful announced today, its most recent fundraising event was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/contentful-raises-80m-series-e-round-for-its-headless-cms/">an $80 million Series E</a> led by Sapphire Ventures in June 2020.</p>
<p><a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a> indicates that that round was raised at a roughly $550 million valuation, while our reporting at the time of the company&#8217;s Series E includes the tidbit that &#8220;a Contentful spokesperson [told TechCrunch] that [the company was] approaching a $1 billion&#8221; valuation. Split the difference and it&#8217;s clear that Contentful&#8217;s new valuation is a multiple of what the company was worth a year ago.</p>
<p>But before we dig into metrics and results &#8212; or really a lack thereof &#8212; let&#8217;s take a minute to chat through Contenful&#8217;s business.</p>
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with Contentful&#8217;s CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-sloan-213515">Steve Sloan</a> (previously of Twilio and Bessemer), and its comms connect, <a href="https://twitter.com/brianspittler">Brian Spittler</a> (previously of Podium), to dig more into its products.</p>
<p>Sloan explained Contentful by analogy, saying that as Twilio served the communications market and Stripe the payments space, Contentful wants to handle the world&#8217;s digital content. Yes, we&#8217;re talking APIs (application programming interface). Contentful has a handful of core APIs that allow for reading and writing content to its data buckets and making content available at the right time.</p>
<p>In more practical terms, Contentful doesn&#8217;t want to help companies build apps. Other companies are rather good at that. Instead, it wants to help customers&#8217; apps load their in-app content very quickly, regardless of where their users are. You can now better understand the modestly aspirational Stripe and Twilio comparison; Contentful wants to take a piece of a developer&#8217;s workload, in this case delivering digital content to controlled applications, abstract it and deliver the functionality as an API. So as developers could simply use Twilio to make text messages appear around the world without coming to terms with global telephone providers, Contentful customers can avoid having to think about content delivery networks (CDNs) and global bandwidth for their content.</p>
<p>Now that we have a reasonable grasp of what Contentful does, let&#8217;s talk about growth:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s not an errant space. Contentful&#8217;s CEO declined to share essentially anything concerning its business growth, aside from that when Contentful raised its Series E it was around an &#8220;inflection point&#8221; for the company. This irked me a little; we <em>know</em> that the company had a good 2020 and likely a good 2021 thus far. Why? Because Tiger didn&#8217;t invest in a $175 million round at a new, higher price for Contentful on the back of mediocre results.</p>
<p>To his credit, Sloan was willing to explain why his company decided to avoid sharing growth information. Per the CEO, when a company discloses pieces of growth data over time, folks will go back when they go public and compare data to claims. And, he added, given that definitions can change, sharing can be more bother than it&#8217;s worth. There&#8217;s some truth to this: Some startups will claim profitability, for example, only to gently backpedal and explain that what they meant was really adjusted EBITDA, say, or positive operating cash flow.</p>
<p>The solution, of course, is for growth-stage startups to share GAAP-ready data with the media when they want our attention. After all, Contentful is aiming toward an IPO and is probably already learning to get its books in proper order. GAAP results are possible! And to be fair to Contentful, <em>many</em> startups decline to share useful data about their performance when courting media attention, often at the request of their investors; that we journalists of the world have to then deal with <em>other</em> investors complaining to us that the media is too fixated on funding rounds as progress points is a distinct, if closely related, matter.</p>
<p>Why do we think that Contentful is targeting an eventual public debut? Because companies tend not to raise nine figures at 10-figure valuations if they are hoping for a quick exit. The unicorn is now too expensive for anyone but the largest tech companies to buy; ergo it intends to go public. And, yes, we <em>would</em> go back and check claimed results against historical GAAP data in its S-1 if we were able to. That&#8217;s research! And fact-checking!</p>
<p>Gripes aside, Sloan shared employee growth expectations in a broad manner. Contentful is around 600 people today, split between its hubs in Denver, Berlin and San Francisco. Over the next two years, it intends to double (or a bit more than double) that headcount. Pull out your pencils and come up with your own revenue guesses based on that. The correct answer is present-day ARR somewhere between $75 and $75 million. Good luck.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Contentful sells to three main customer buckets, per its CEO: midmarket customers, enterprise customers and venture-backed startups that intend to get big. Given that all of those are either pursuing digital transformation work or are digitally native, we presume that Contentful&#8217;s market will remain fertile for some time. That implies a winsome total addressable market for the company to sell into, implying ample future growth opportunities. Let&#8217;s see what it can get done with $175 million more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to software to help IT manage workers&#8217; devices wherever they happen to be, enterprises have long been spoiled for choice &#8212; a situation that has come in especially handy in the last 18 months, when many offices globally have gone remote and people have logged into their systems from home. But the same can&#8217;t really be said for small and medium enterprises: as with so many other aspects of tech, they&#8217;ve long been overlooked when it comes to building modern IT management solutions tailored to their size and needs.</p>
<p>But there are signs of that changing. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.atera.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atera</a> that has been building remote, and low-cost, predictive IT management solutions specifically for organizations with less than 1,000 employees, is announcing a funding round of $77 million &#8212; a sign of the demand in the market, and Atera&#8217;s own success in addressing it. The investment values Atera at $500 million, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv-based startup has amassed some 7,000 customers to date, managing millions of endpoints &#8212; computers and other devices connected to them &#8212; across some 90 countries, providing real-time diagnostics across the datapoints generated by those devices to predict problems with hardware, software and network, or with security issues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Atera&#8217;s aim is to use the funding both to continue building out that customer footprint, and to expand its product &#8212; specifically adding more functionality to the AI that it currently uses (and for which Atera has been granted patents) to run predictive analytics, one of the technologies that today are part and parcel of solutions targeting larger enterprises but typically are absent from much of the software out there aimed at SMBs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in essence democratizing capabilities that exist for enterprises but not for the other half of the economy, SMBs,&#8221; said Gil Pekelman, Atera&#8217;s CEO, in an interview.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by General Atlantic, and it is notable for being only the second time that Atera has ever raised money &#8212; the first was earlier this year, a $25 million round from K1 Investment Management, which is also in this latest round. Before this year, Atera, which was founded in 2016, turned profitable in 2017 and then intentionally went out of profit in 2019 as it used cash from its balance sheet to grow. Through all of that, it was bootstrapped. (And it still has cash from that initial round earlier this year.)</p>
<p>As Pekelman &#8212; who co-founded the company with Oshri Moyal (CTO) &#8212; describes it, Atera&#8217;s approach to remote monitoring and management, as the space is typically called, starts first with software clients installed at the endpoints that connect into a network, which give IT managers the ability to monitor a network, regardless of the actual physical range, as if it&#8217;s located in a single office. Around that architecture, Atera essentially monitors and collects &#8220;datapoints&#8221; covering activity from those devices &#8212; currently taking in some 40,000 datapoints per second.</p>
<p>To be clear, these datapoints are not related to what a person is working on, or any content at all, but how the devices behave, and the diagnostics that Atera amasses and focuses on cover three main areas: hardware performance, networking and software performance and security. Through this, Atera&#8217;s system can predict when something might be about to go wrong with a machine, or why a network connection might not be working as it should, or if there is some suspicious behavior that might need a security-oriented response. It supplements its work in the third area with integrations with third-party security software &#8212; Bitdefender and Acronis among them &#8212; and by issuing updated security patches for devices on the network.</p>
<p>The whole system is built to be run in a self-service way. You buy Atera&#8217;s products online, and there are no salespeople involved &#8212; in fact most of its marketing today is done through Facebook and Google, Pekelman said, which is one area where it will continue to invest. This is one reason why it&#8217;s not really targeted larger enterprises (the others are the level of customization that would be needed; as well as more sophisticated service level agreements). But it is also the reason why Atera is so cheap: it costs $89 per month per IT technician, regardless of the number of endpoints that are being managed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our constituencies are up to 1,000 employees, which is a world that was in essence quite neglected up to now,&#8221; Pekelman said. &#8220;The market we are targeting and that we care about are these smaller guys and they just don’t have tools like these today.&#8221; Since model is $89 dollars per month per technician using the software, it means that a company with 500 people with four technicians is paying $356 per month to manage their networks, peanuts in the greater scheme of IT services, and one reason why Atera has caught on as more and more employees have gone remote, and are looking like they will stay that way.</p>
<p>And the fact that this model is thriving is also one of the reason and investors are interested.</p>
<p>“Atera has developed a compelling all-in-one platform that provides immense value for its customer base, and we are thrilled to be supporting the company in this important moment of its growth trajectory,” said Alex Crisses, MD, Global Head of New Investment Sourcing and Co-Head of Emerging Growth at General Atlantic, in a statement. “We are excited to work with a category-defining Israeli company, extending General Atlantic’s presence in the country’s cutting-edge technology sector and marking our fifth investment in the region. We look forward to partnering with Gil, Oshri, and the Atera team to help the company realize its vision.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.class.com/">Class</a>, a virtual classroom that integrates exclusively with Zoom, announced today that it has raised $105 million in a financing led by SoftBank Vision Fund II. <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/class-for-zoom-earliest-investors-are-betting-millions/">The 10-month old startup</a> has now raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/class-series-a-zoom/">a total of $146 million</a> in known venture funding to date, which eclipses the amount of capital raised by founder Michael Chasen’s now-public previous company, Blackboard.</p>
<p>Despite its infancy, Class is rapidly nearing unicorn status, confirming that it currently sports a post-money valuation of $804 million. Other investors in Class include GSV Ventures and Emergence Capital, who led the startups’ pre-seed round, as well as top U.S. edtech funds including Reach Capital, Owl Ventures, Insight Partners and Learn Capital.</p>
<p>Class, formerly Class for Zoom, uses management and instruction tools to bolster the video conferencing call experience. Since launch, Class has integrated exclusively with the videoconferencing giant, which rose to household name prominence during the initial months of the pandemic and continues to be a mainstay in synchronous communication. It’s part of a wave of Zoom alternatives and enhancements that have launched over the past year &#8211; and to date has over 250 customers. <img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2182954 alignnone" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png" alt="" width="604" height="402" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png 1616w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-9.55.11-PM.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement of the SoftBank stamp of approval means that Class is making two statements: one, that it&#8217;s taking global expansion seriously, and two, I&#8217;d argue that it’s signaling that it is not looking to be just an acquisition target for Zoom.</p>
<h2><strong>Globalization of edtech</strong></h2>
<p>SoftBank likes to back what it views as “winner” in one sector and throw millions into it to help it foothold international markets. Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/clearco-gets-the-softbank-stamp-of-approval-in-new-215m-round/">the Japanese conglomerate put millions into Clearco</a>, formerly Clearbanc, to help the alternative financing startup grow into new geographies beyond Europe, Canada and the United States. At this point, I imagine SoftBank is looking for opinionated startups that are naturally pulled internationally, and then funds the heck out of them.</p>
<p>Class is no different. Chasen explained how international demand for the product has been high since Class announced its seed round. Schools from Europe, the Middle East and Japan reached out before Class had rolled out general availability. Now, with Class&#8217; general availability rolled out on Mac, Windows, iOS, Android and Chromebook, Chasen is focusing on turning those on the waitlist into customers.</p>
<p>Class&#8217; international expansion will see it build up local teams in target regions such as the UK and Ireland, EMEA, Latin American and APAC. The startup is expecting to add 100 new team members across the world to its already 200-person team.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Edtech&#8217;s venture-backed globalization pauses at China&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/edtechs-venture-backed-globalization-pauses-at-china/embed/#?secret=cf0JB6wGrZ" data-secret="cf0JB6wGrZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chasen estimates that 65% of the financing will fuel Class’ internationalization and that the remaining will be allocated toward product development. One critique of Class is that the platform offers the same experience to a second grade class as it does to a higher-ed class. Chasen agreed that the startup needs to add more specificity to its product &#8211; perhaps gamification for K-12 and exam proctoring for higher ed &#8211; in future versions.</p>
<p>“V1 gives you what we believe is the bare minimum you need to teach online,” he said, noting features such as testing and grade trackers. “Right now, we need a product that works well across every market, and in the future we’ll make enhancements that are specific for the markets.”</p>
<p>And so far, users are paying for it. Class said that its revenue grew almost 4X quarter over quarter in 2021.</p>
<h2><strong>Friends with Zoom benefits </strong></h2>
<p>While there’s a numbing effect around big rounds and flashy valuations, Class’ recent raise could squash questions around whether it’s teeing itself up for an eventual acquisition by Zoom.</p>
<p>When TechCrunch first spoke to Chasen, he said that Zoom is focused more on scale than the sort of in-depth specialization that Class wants to provide.</p>
<p>Still, the company was in kahoots with Zoom’s earliest investors and acted as a Zoom reseller in multiple markets, suggesting that consolidation wouldn’t be too wild of an assumption down the road. After today, though, it’s clear Class views itself as a standalone business. Startups don’t just raise nine-figure funding rounds from savvy investors unless they have ambitions to be bigger than an integration.</p>
<p>Going forward, Class may use some of those millions to establish its brand as the go-to option for schools or institutions that want a classroom-friendly Zoom environment. <a href="https://www.class.com/careers/">Per Class’ careers page</a>, marketing is its most aggressive hiring focus right now. The company has six open roles in the marketing team, which include an international marketing manager and a content marketing manager.</p>
<p>Class’ closest competitor is Engageli, which last raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/engageli-nabs-33m-more-for-its-collaborative-video-based-teaching-platform/">$33 million Series A in May 2021.</a> Engageli&#8217;s co-founder and COO, Jamie Farrell, left in February 2021 for another edtech startup, and the company doesn&#8217;t appear to be hiring too aggressively via online job boards. While the details are anecdotal, Engageli may face steeper competition in terms of bandwidth and marketing now that Class has fresh capitalization &#8211; and a growing team of global employees.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company's Shelf Life project aims to remedy the inventory-management issues in Africa's retail pharmacies. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharmacies in Africa struggle with access to finance, but inventory management is really what bogs them down. H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ow do pharmaceutical retailers know how much stock they need? How do they know which products to stock at a given time? How do they know what products aren&#8217;t selling? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, there&#8217;s not enough data to answer these questions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cash gets tied up; there are more or fewer products than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are needed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a particular time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it&#8217;s the former, they run a risk of selling expired products. If it&#8217;s the latter, patients can&#8217;t get what they need</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://field.inc/">Field Intelligence</a> is digitizing this supply-chain process to help African pharmacies sell better. The company, which started in 2015, was government-focused and tried to tackle the challenges facing the public health supply chain in Nigeria&#8217;s capital city, Abuja.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO Michael Moreland said he noticed that independent pharmacies in Abuja faced similar challenges to the government-owned ones. After building a SaaS platform to manage complex and large-scale pharmaceutical distribution for the government, the company decided to branch out into the private space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In trying to solve that supply-chain problem, Field Intelligence shifted from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">strictly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being a software company to become a pharmaceutical distributor using technology to reimagine how the value chain works</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Field Intelligence launched <a href="https://shelflife.co/">Shelf Life</a> in 2017 as the standalone product to handle this transition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Up until now, they had operations in Abuja, Lagos and Nairobi. The product aims</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to solve the inventory problem across Africa’s <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Pharmaceuticals%20and%20Medical%20Products/Our%20Insights/Africa%20A%20continent%20of%20opportunity%20for%20pharma%20and%20patients/Africa_a_continent_of_opportunity_for_pharma_and_patients.pdf">$65 billion pharmaceutical market</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, the company announced its expansion into 11 cities across Nigeria and Kenya. The seven cities in Nigeria include Delta, Edo, Enugu, Kaduna, Kano, Kwara and Rivers. In Kenya, it&#8217;s Eldoret, Kisumi, Mombasa and Naivasha. The expansion will build on Field Intelligence’s more than 700 existing pharmacies, which have served over 1.4 million patients so far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelf Life takes the burden and risk of inventory off the pharmacies. It manages forecasting, quality assurance, fulfillment and inventory management via a subscription service. Pharmacies sell Shelf Life-supplied goods on consignment through a pay-as-you-sell program, avoiding expiry risk and accessing a cheaper alternative to working capital finance. The company claims that this model allowed pharmacies to grow an average of 25% CAGR.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We launched Shelf Life in 2017 to allow pharmacies to outsource their supply chain to us. And it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grew very </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">organically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from there,&#8221; Moreland said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And as we built up, we expanded down to Lagos and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Nairobi to see if it would work in East Africa in that context, and it did</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We haven&#8217;t looked back since then. The future of the business is in the private pharmacy market.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Field Intelligence concluded its first round of outside capital in March last year, <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2020/03/12/nigeria-based-e-health-startup-field-intelligence-raises-3-6m/">a $3.6 million Series A</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The money </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was raised for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expansion, but the pandemic stalled that plan. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Field Intelligence went back to work by the end of Q4 2020 and planted the initial seeds of what has grown until this moment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Importance of data in Field Intelligence&#8217;s operations</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This expansion comes a year after the company experienced rapid sales and Shelf Life membership subscriptions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales grew by 47% in Nigeria and 65% in Kenya, selling over 586,950 products in 63 different product categories</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using data to optimize predictions and identify irregularities in the market, Field Intelligence met the demands for prescription and over-the-counter drugs. But how does it receive and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this data?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We see that as a math problem. And that starts with having </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> great data about what&#8217;s selling across a wide number of locations and different seasons, across a wide formulary of products,&#8221; the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182987" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182987" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2182987" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png?w=680" alt="Shelf Life" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png 1539w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Field_Shelf-Life-Delivery.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182987" class="wp-caption-text">A Shelf Life agent</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Field Intelligence introduces Shelf Life to a pharmacy, it takes over its supply chain and inventory management processes. The company has fulfillment partners to manage the pharmacy&#8217;s stock counts, inventory management and merchandising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data about stock positions and movements at the retail level comes from a wide array of locations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the company can build a proprietary dataset that shows pharmacies in real-time, providing insights into demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With that, Field Intelligence provides visibility and control of pharmaceutical procurement and inventory management. This eliminates frequent over- and understocking; pharmacies can change products or prices based on the information available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fulfillment partners operate an asset-light model, which Moreland said allowed the company &#8220;to build a scalable and intelligent distribution service that operates lean but yet creates a lot of value for the patients and retailers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can say that our level of the value chain here as sort of this tech-enabled distributor, there&#8217;s nobody that operates at this level of the supply chain in so many cities,&#8221; he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelf Life is currently </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in more than 700 pharmacies across Nigeria and Kenya. The company says </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria has more than 4,500 registered pharmacies and over 15,000 drugstores; while Kenya has 6,000 registered pharmacies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So there&#8217;s plenty of market share to capture. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By next year, Field Intelligence plans to surpass 2,000 Shelf Life pharmacies and drugstores</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By 2025, the company is targeting 12,000 pharmacies and drugstores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreland said that the company has grown 5x </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recurring revenue, adding that Shelf Life has sold more drugs and served more patients in the last three months than its first three years of business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Field Intelligence is looking to tackle inventory management with Shelf Life, Moreland believes the company is also effectively solving a finance problem too because it provides an alternative to traditional financing options by lowering the cost of running a pharmacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the big value propositions for us is that because we are selling on consignment, we free up a lot of working capital for the retailer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in the market, we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">broadly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seen as a financial services provider and a form of alternative finance for our pharmacies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it&#8217;s a big part of our story because when you compare the cost of joining Shelf Life to accessing the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">equivalent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amount of working capital from microfinance or traditional bank, even concessionary lenders, we can be 60 to 80% cheaper with far more value-added services,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
