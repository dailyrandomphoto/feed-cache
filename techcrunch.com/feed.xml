										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/airtable/">Airtable</a>, the no-code relational database that has amassed a customer base that spans 250,000 different organizations, has today announced the close of a $270 million in series E funding. The valuation comes out to $5.77 billion post-money, more than doubling its valuation from September, when it raised $185 million in Series D funding.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This latest round was led by Greenoaks Capital, with participation from WndrCo, as well as existing investors Caffeinated Capital, CRV, and Thrive.</p>
<p>The company says it plans to use the funding to accelerate the development of its enterprise product and growing the team. Also of note: Founder and CEO Howie Liu told <a href="http://forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2021/03/15/airtable-tops-57-billion-valuation-on-growing-enterprise-sales-and-a-soaring-cloud-market/?sh=925ccf5249a6">Forbes</a> that he was approached by Greenoaks, rather than actively seeking funding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Airtable is a relational database that many describe as a souped up version of Excel or Google Sheets. Being such, and having the infrastructure to support an app ecosystem on top of that, means that this no-code tool can actually be used to write software. In other words, the use cases are nearly infinite, and so is the potential customer base.</p>
<p>Greenoaks Capital partner Neil Mehta basically said as much in the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe Airtable is chasing a massive opportunity to become the ‘residual’ software platform for every bespoke and custom use case that is either performed manually today or structurally underserved by rigid third-party software. By equipping business users with fundamental software primitives that can be assembled together into powerful business applications, Airtable has become central to its users’ everyday workflows but at the same time is scalable and extensible enough to support incredibly complex enterprise use cases like ticketing, content management, and CRM.</p></blockquote>
<p>Airtable has raised a total of $617 million since inception, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/airtable/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials and GenZers seem interested in investing more than ever these days. As a result, a number of startups have emerged in recent years to give them more options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such startup, </span><a href="http://www.trygatsby.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">G</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">atsby</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announced Monday that it has raised $10 million in a Series A round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backers include Techstars Ventures, Beta Bridge Capital, a network of “super angels” placed by ClearList and an oversubscribed SeedInvest campaign. Previous investors include Barclays Bank, SWS Venture Capital, and Rosecliff Ventures, </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Myers and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Belanger-Saleh co-founded Gatsby, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commission-free options and stock trading app aimed at younger traders, in 2018. The pair had already one successful exit in Dealtable.com, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social data room platform.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125073" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125073" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2125073" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PXL_20210310_200013063.PORTRAIT-1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125073" class="wp-caption-text">Co-founders and co-CEOs Jeff Myers (left) and Ryan Balenger-Saleh (right)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-quinn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter Quinn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a founder of stock trading service Public.com &#8212; which recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/as-expected-stock-trading-service-public-raises-220m-at-unicorn-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $220 million at a $1.2 billion valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; serves as Gatsby’s chief operations officer and as the company&#8217;s first hire, is considered a member of its founding team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides focusing on a younger demographic, Gatsby aims to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">give people “a safe and fair platform to trade on without users having to worry about getting in over their heads or being shut out of names when volatility spikes.” The app launched into iOS and Android in early 2020, with the number of signups doubling since the beginning of 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also seen a spike in trade volume with cannabis and meme stocks ranking among its most popular trades of the year so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatsby aims to take on Robinhood by offering traders no commission trading, no per-contract fees and “with no excessive jargon.” Beyond that, it also offers users a way to earn revenues from trade activity through a rewards program or as Myers puts it, “get paid to trade.” It also hosts a social network that can be a source for trade ideas or a place for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatsby traders to share on their wins (or commiserate their losses).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that PFOF (payment for order flow) is a fundamentally better pricing model than commissions for users trading on small accounts as long as customers feel like their broker is being fair and honest about execution quality and how they make money,” Myers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the second quarter, Gatsby plans to launch a feature called ‘Gatsby Circles,’ through which traders can create groups of friends to follow and share trades, and get alerts when someone in their circle executes a trade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital “to grow aggressively” in 2021. Specifically, the company plans to expand in engineering and brokerage operations over the course of the year. It plans to boost its 12-person team by another “10 to 20 heads” over the next three quarters, according to Myers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s goal is to have over 100,000 accounts by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatsby also plans to launch additional research tools for more sophisticated options traders, as well as more advanced strategies. Down the line, the startup is also planning to launch crypto-trading features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also working on building an adaptive interface. This means that Gatsby’s algorithm will assess the trader and adjust the feature set and interface to be tailored for that user depending on their experience level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Jordan French, an early stage investor in Gatsby and publisher at Grit Daily News, Myers and Belanger-Saleh “have the right combination of technology and marketing experience to grow Gatsby into a defensible position that will be very difficult for competitors to unseat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also believes the company’s approach aligns closely with its core investor base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatsby seeks to “shed the ‘fat-cat cronyism’ of legacy financial institutions,” French added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Researchers at Canada’s University of Waterloo are <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/259076.php">showcasing work with prosthesis and exoskeletons</a> that utilizes cameras and AI to deliver more natural human movement. The ExoNet project leverages video captured by wearable camera, run through deep learning AI, in order to mimic how humans adapt and adjust movements based on their environment.</p>
<p>The project is an attempt to create more natural locomotion on the fly than is currently offered through systems with connected smartphone apps or other external controllers.</p>
<p>&#8220;That can be inconvenient and cognitively demanding,&#8221; Waterloo PhD candidate Brokoslaw Laschowski said in a release tied to the research. &#8220;Every time you want to perform a new locomotor activity, you have to stop, take out your smartphone and select the desired mode.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The research highlighted primarily focuses on robotic exoskeletons, which are being developed by a number of different companies to help assist people with impaired mobility. The hope here is that the ExoNet system could eventually replace the need for external control by the wearer, in order to create more natural locomotion.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s still a lot of work to be done. Naturally, the system is easier to navigate on flat terrain. Next steps would involve adapting it to environments that can give those with limited mobility some difficult, including stairs and other obstacles. A final version of the system would be able to anticipate and adapt accordingly.</p>
<p>“Our control approach wouldn’t necessarily require human thought,” Laschowski adds. “Similar to autonomous cars that drive themselves, we’re designing autonomous exoskeletons that walk for themselves.”</p>
<p>There are other challenges here, as well. Batteries are an issue, for one. The team is looking to improve longevity by experimenting with a system that can recharge with the wearer’s movement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://up.codes/">UpCodes</a>, a startup that develops building code compliance tools, announced today it has raised $3.36 million in pre-Series A funding. This brings its total raised so far to $4.15 million. The new funding was led by Berlin-based Point Nine Capital, which focuses on SaaS and online marketplaces.</p>
<p>The company also recently won a legal victory when United States District Court Judge Victor Marrero granted UpCodes its motion to dismiss a false advertising and unfair competition lawsuit filed against it by the International Code Council (ICC). An earlier copyright lawsuit filed by the ICC against UpCodes is still ongoing, but UpCodes won a major decision in the case last year when Judge Marrero ruled that its posting of building codes is covered by public domain and fair use.</p>

<p>UpCodes&#8217; other investors include PlanGrid co-founders Ryan Sutton-Fee, Ralph Gootee, Tracy Young and Kenny Stone; Bragiel Brothers; Capital X; Flex Capital; and Liquid 2 Ventures. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/27/upcodes/">took part in Y Combinator’s summer 2017</a> accelerator program.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by brothers Garrett and Scott Reynolds, UpCodes now has about 500,000 monthly active users. The company&#8217;s paid customers include construction firms like Stantec and ARCO National Construction, architecture firms SOM and Ennead, and Airbnb, Cornell University and the State University of New York. It is also used by rental tenants, landlords, homeowners, general contractors, plumbers, electricians—basically anyone with a question about building code compliance.</p>
<p>UpCodes&#8217; first product was a searchable database of building codes with collaboration tools. Then in 2018 it launched UpCodes AI, a tool that scans 3D models created with building information modeling (BIM) data and alerts architects about potential issues.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s newest feature, its code calculator, is designed for people who have compliance questions, but might not know how to navigate building codes, which differ between municipalities, contain multiple sections and often have amendments attached.</p>
<p>In response to questions like &#8220;how much square footage is allowed per floor,&#8221; &#8220;how many exits does this floor need&#8221; or &#8220;what is the maximum corridor length allowed,&#8221; the code calculator generates a list of requirements, with links to the relevant building code sections. The feature is currently available for more than 40 states as part of UpCodes&#8217; paid plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our end goal is that no matter who you are or what level of sophistication you have with building codes, you can go into a friendly interface and answer your code question,&#8221; said Scott, who worked as an architect before launching UpCodes. He notes that even at architecture, engineering and construction firms, which often work with code consultants as part of their compliance process, employees have differing levels of familiarity with referencing building codes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve heard from users that they&#8217;ll be looking at one particular section of the code, and they&#8217;ll make the building compliant to that, but not realize there&#8217;s a more stringent piece of code somewhere else, like say the fire code compared to the building code,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It causes huge downstream issues because they don&#8217;t have the full picture of it, so that’s what we&#8217;re trying to solve.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Reynolds brothers compared UpCodes code calculator to tax software like TurboTax, which help people comply with tax laws even if they haven&#8217;t parsed it closely. &#8220;When Americans file their taxes every year, they&#8217;re not cracking open the tax code. They have tax software,&#8221; said Garrett, who was previously a software engineer at PlanGrid. &#8220;We’re very much in the dark ages of compliance and so we want to modernize it and not have people read through the raw building codes, which are much more complicated than tax code.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funding will be used for hiring, so UpCodes can add new features more quickly, including ones to automate calculations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sprinklr.com/">Sprinklr</a>, a New York-based customer experience company, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sprinklr-announces-confidential-submission-of-draft-registration-statement-for-proposed-initial-public-offering-301247285.html">announced</a> today it has filed a confidential S-1 ahead of a possible IPO.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sprinklr today announced that it has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) relating to the proposed initial public offering of its common stock,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>It also indicated that it will determine the exact number of shares and the price range at a later point after it receives approval from the SEC to go public.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company most recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/sprinklr-raises-200m-on-2-7b-valuation-three-years-after-last-investment/">raised $200 million on a $2.7 billion</a> valuation last year. It was its first fundraise in 4 years. At the time, founder and CEO Ragy Thomas said his company expected to end 2020 with $400 million in ARR, certainly a healthy number on which to embark as a public company.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sprinklr launches major push into customer experience&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/11/sprinklr-launches-major-push-into-customer-experience/embed/#?secret=bESztCpZjN" data-secret="bESztCpZjN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He also said that Sprinklr&#8217;s next fundraise would be an IPO, making him true to his word. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been public about the pathway around this, and the path is that the next financial milestone will be an IPO,&#8221; he told me at the time of the $200 million round. He said that with COVID, it probably was a year or so away, but the timing appears to have sped up.</p>
<p>Sprinklr sees customer experience management as a natural extension of CRM, and as such a huge market potentially worth a $100 billion, according to Thomas. But he also admitted that he was up against some big competitors like Salesforce and Adobe, helping explain why he fundraised last year.</p>
<p>Sprinklr was founded in 2009 with a focus <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/31/sprinklr-joins-unicorn-club/">on social media listening</a>, but it announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/11/sprinklr-launches-major-push-into-customer-experience/">hard push into customer experience</a> in 2017 when it added marketing, advertising, research, customer and e-commerce to its social efforts.</p>
<p>The company has raised $585 million to-date, and has also been highly acquisitive buying 11 companies along the way as it added functionality to the base platform, according to Crunchbase data.</p>

<p>New York-based Garbo was originally founded in 2018 by Kathryn Kosmides, a survivor of gender-based violence who wanted to make it easier for everyone to be able to have the ability to look up critical information about someone&#8217;s background that could indicate a history of violence.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Typically, background check services are run by for-profit companies and surface a wide variety of personal information &#8212; like drug offenses or minor traffic violations &#8212; that aren&#8217;t always relevant to matters of safety and abuse. Plus, those types of charges are often levied against members of more vulnerable communities, <a href="https://medium.com/garbo/update-to-garbos-database-policy-to-create-a-more-equitable-background-check-da94028ad715">Garbo has pointed out</a>, and aren&#8217;t correlated to gender-based violence.</p>
<p>Garbo instead offers low-cost background checks by collecting public records and reports of violence and abuse only, including arrests, convictions, restraining orders, harassment, and other violent crimes. To use the service, a user would enter either a first and last name, or a first name and phone number &#8212; often the only information a dating app users will have on one of their matches.</p>
<p>The service will then perform what it calls an &#8220;equitable background&#8221; check, <a href="https://medium.com/garbo/update-to-garbos-database-policy-to-create-a-more-equitable-background-check-da94028ad715">meaning it will exclude drug possession charges</a> form its results, as well as traffic tickets besides DUIs and vehicle manslaughter.</p>
<p>Last year, the nonprofit launched a beta test of its technology with 500 people in the NYC area, and soon grew its waitlist to over 6,000 more entirely by word-of-mouth. Garbo later pulled the test as the team realized the technology had the potential for national scale &#8212; something the team wanted to deliver before launching to the public.</p>
<p>As a small nonprofit without much in terms of financial backing, Garbo also realized a larger partner may be needed in that effort. After Kosmides was connected with Match Group&#8217;s new head of safety, Tracey Breeden, the two companies agreed to work together on bringing the technology to a broader U.S. audience.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2125056 alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="501" height="213" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg 1484w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?resize=768,326 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?resize=680,289 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;For far too long women and marginalized groups in all corners of the world have faced many barriers to resources and safety,&#8221; said Breeden, Match Group&#8217;s Head of Safety and Social Advocacy, in a statement about today&#8217;s news. &#8220;We recognize corporations can play a key role in helping remove those barriers with technology and true collaboration rooted in action. In partnership with Match Group, Garbo’s thoughtful and groundbreaking consumer background check will enable and empower users with information, helping create equitable pathways to safer connections and online communities across tech,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>This is Match Group&#8217;s second investment in an outside safety technology provider to enhance its dating apps&#8217; feature sets. In early 2020, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/match-group-invests-in-noonlight-to-power-new-safety-features-in-tinder-and-other-dating-apps/">invested in Noonlight</a> to help it power new safety features inside Tinder and other dating apps following a damning investigative report <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/tinder-lets-known-sex-offenders-use-the-app-its-not-the-only-one">by ProPublica and Columbia Journalism Investigations</a>, published December 2019. The report revealed how Match Group allowed known sexual predators to use its apps. It also noted that Match Group didn’t have a uniform policy of running background checks on its dating app users, putting the responsibility on users to keep themselves safe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tinder&#8217;s top competitor Bumble has been marketing itself as a more women-friendly alternative to traditional dating apps like Tinder, and has rolled out a number of features designed to keep users safe from bad actors &#8212; including, most recently, a way to prevent to prevent them from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/bumbles-new-feature-prevents-bad-actors-from-using-unmatch-to-hide-from-their-victims/">using the app&#8217;s &#8220;unmatch&#8221; option to hide from their victims.</a></p>
<p>Given that gaining a reputation for being an &#8220;unsafe&#8221; app could be significantly damaging to a brand like Tinder and the larger online dating industry as a whole, it&#8217;s obvious why Match Group is now directly investing to address this problem. With the Noonlight investment, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/match-group-invests-in-noonlight-to-power-new-safety-features-in-tinder-and-other-dating-apps/">Match Group promised features</a> like a discreet way to trigger emergency services inside the Tinder app, similar to the feature found in Uber and Lyft, plus other anti-abuse measures.</p>
<p>Match Group says Garbo will use the new investment to hire across product, engineering and in leadership &#8212; including a head of engineering and an initial team of five engineers. This team will work to build out Garbo&#8217;s capabilities, using technologies like natural language processing and A.I.</p>
<p>Garbo will also benefit from sizable contributions of time and resources from Match Group, as its gets its product fully operational and then rolled out across Match Group products, starting with Tinder. And Match Group will help Garbo make the nonprofit&#8217;s technology accessible to other platforms, as well &#8212; like ridesharing companies.</p>
<p>Once live in Tinder, the background check feature may not be free, however.</p>
<p>Instead, Match Group says it will work to determine the pricing based on things like what user adoption looks like, how many people want to use it, how many searches they want to perform and other factors. It also hasn&#8217;t yet determined how deep the integration may be &#8212; whether, for example, it will link outside the app to Garbo or make it seem more like an in-app feature.</p>
<p>Match Group doesn&#8217;t have any exact time frame for the feature&#8217;s launch beyond &#8220;later this year&#8221; for Tinder, to be followed by other U.S. dating apps. The company may consider looking into similar investments for its services aimed at international users in the months to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Elon Musk made $25 billion in one day. On Monday, he crowned himself “Technoking of Tesla.” In Musk-speak, this new title still translates into the Chief Executive Officer of the electric car company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eccentric billionaire is nothing if not creative with his dubs (see: Offspring named X Æ A-Xii.) Zach Kirkhorn, the company’s Chief Financial Officer, has also been bestowed the title of Master of Coin. A nod to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Honestly, who knows? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new appellations were announced via a </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000156459021012981/tsla-8k_20210315.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which reads: </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Effective as of March 15, 2021, the titles of Elon Musk and Zach Kirkhorn have changed to Technoking of Tesla and Master of Coin, respectively. Elon and Zach will also maintain their respective positions as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This title change follows Musk’s announcement last month that Tesla might start accepting bitcoin as a form of payment in the near future. The cryptocurrency’s stock price hit a new high of $61,788 over the weekend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps this is Musk&#8217;s not-so-subtle way of trying to let the world know who reigns supreme, especially after being bumped by Jeff Bezos as the richest person on the planet and after being </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/elon-musk-tesla-board-sued-in-lawsuit-alleging-erratic-tweets-violate-fiduciary-duty/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued by a Tesla investor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for his continuous “erratic tweets” that potentially expose the electric vehicle company to fines and penalties that could drive its share price down. </span></p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s announcement had a negligible impact on the stock price. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla’s stock is up 1.5% in morning trading. Tesla shares had an impressive 600% soar in 2020. However, the stock is now down 20% for the year from a high of $880.82 reached January 8. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla also disclosed on Monday that Jerome Guillen, president of automotive, will now take on the role of president of Tesla Heavy Trucking. In a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/elon-musk-says-tesla-semi-is-ready-for-production-but-limited-by-battery-cell-output/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Q4 earnings call, Musk said he expects deliveries of the Tesla Semi to begin this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The engineering work on the freight-hauling truck with an all-electric powertrain is complete, but lack of availability to battery cells might halt production, Musk said during the call. </span></p>

<p>Led by Accel, it also includes participation from new backers GV (formerly Google Ventures) and Salesforce Ventures, in addition to existing investors Citi, Illuminate Financial and Tribeca Venture Partners, who also invested in this round. To give you an idea of who it works with, Citi, along with ING, London Clearing House, and XP Investments, are some of Genesis customers.</p>
<p>Originally conceived in 2012 in Brazil by a pair of British co-founders &#8212; Stephen Murphy (CEO) and James Harrison (CTO), who cut their teeth in the world of investment banking &#8212; Genesis had raised less than $5 million before this round, mostly bootstrapping its business and leaning on Murphy and Harrison&#8217;s existing relationships in the world of finance to grow its customer base.</p>
<p>Today, Murphy lives in and leads the business from Miami &#8212; where he moved from New York just as the Covid-19 pandemic was starting to gain steam last year &#8212; while James Harrison (CTO) leads part of the team based out of the UK.</p>
<p>As you might imagine with so little funding before now for a company going on nine years old, Genesis was doing fine financially before this Series B, so the plan is to use the funding specifically to grow faster than it could have on its own steam. The startup is not disclosing its valuation with this round.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were not really fixated on valuation,&#8221; said Murphy in an interview, who said the funding came about after a number of VCs had approached the startup. &#8220;The most important thing is the future opportunity and where we could take the company with additional funding&#8230; this will help us hyper scale up.&#8221; He did note that the term sheets contained &#8220;some amazing numbers and multiples,&#8221; given the current interest in no-code and low-code technology.</p>
<p>Indeed, the vogue for no-code and low-code tech &#8212; other well-funded names in the crowded space include startups like <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210114/p53#a210114p53" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/airtable-is-now-valued-at-5-77b-with-a-fresh-270-million-in-series-e-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airtable</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/rows-formerly-dashdash-raises-16m-to-build-and-populate-web-apps-using-only-spreadsheet-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rows</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/london-based-gyana-raises-3-9m-for-a-no-code-approach-to-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gyana</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/bryter-raises-16m-for-a-no-code-platform-for-non-technical-people-to-build-enterprise-automation-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bryter</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/ushur-raises-25m-for-its-no-code-platform-to-build-customer-communication-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ushur</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/creatio-raises-68m-as-the-low-code-space-keeps-attracting-huge-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creatio</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/easysend-raises-16m-from-intel-more-for-its-no-code-approach-to-automating-b2c-interfaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasySend</a>, as well as significant launches from Google and Microsoft and other bigger players &#8212; is coming out of two trends colliding.</p>
<p>On one side, we&#8217;ve well and truly entered an era in enterprise technology &#8212; with the same trend playing out in consumer tech, too &#8212; where smart developers are taking sophisticated and complex services and putting &#8220;wrappers&#8221; around them by way of APIs and simpler (low- or no-code) interfaces, so that those sophisticated tools can in turn be integrated and implemented in more places. This saves needing to build or integrate that complexity from scratch and expands access to the processes within those wrappers.</p>
<p>On the other side, the thirst for tech knowledge has become well and truly mainstream and as a result getting far more democratized. Working in a variety of applications, using different digital tools and devices, and seeing the fruits of tech pay off are all second nature to today&#8217;s working world &#8212; whether or not you are a technologist. So it&#8217;s no surprise to see more proactive, non-technical people looking for more ways to get their hands on these tools themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;You now have a whole citizen developer world, for example business analysts who understand the solution you want but might not know how to get there,&#8221; Murphy said. &#8220;We play to seasoned developers first but the investment will help us put more low code and no code tools into place to widen the tools out to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Starting out in finance made sense not just because that was where the two founders had previously worked, but also because of the history of how different software tools were already being used. Specifically, he noted that the ubiquity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microservices</a> &#8212; which themselves are collections of services as apps &#8212; laid the groundwork for more low-code. &#8220;We saw that if we could build a low-code entry point to microservices, that would be powerful.&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of that, investment banks, he said, have a history of wanting to build things themselves to tailor to their specific needs. &#8220;Buying off the shelf means you are at the mercy of the vendor,&#8221; he said. These factors made financial services companies very receptive to what Genesis was offering.</p>
<p>While a lot of the no/low-code players are coming at the concept with specific verticals in mind &#8212; no surprise, since different verticals have very specific use cases and needs &#8212; so what&#8217;s interesting with Genesis is how the company is leveraging what it already knows about finance, and then looking at other industries that have similar demands, structures and rules.</p>
<p>Murphy said that Genesis will stay &#8220;very focused on financial markets for 2021&#8221; but that it&#8217;s identified a number of other verticals similar to it, and is actually already seeing some inbound interest from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of people have already approached us from the world of healthcare,&#8221; he said, pointing out that these organizations, like financial services, face challenges around how to audit data and regulations around performing transactions. Manufacturing, meanwhile, has some parallels around the area of complex event processing similar to equity algorithmic trading, he said. (In short, this relates to how external events might trigger more transactions, not unlike how external factors affect manufacturing operations.)</p>
<p>The trend is one that analysts forecast will only grow in the coming years: Gartner, for example, says that by 2024, low-code platforms will account for no less than 65% of all app development activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Low-code promises business users the autonomy to make their own technology usage and purchase decisions while enabling them to actually build their own applications without having to rely on IT,&#8221; said Andrei Brasoveanu, a partner at Accel, said n a statement. “By bringing one of the most transformative innovations in software development to financial services, Steve and the Genesis team are taking on a huge market of legacy vendors &#8211; and winning too &#8211; while delivering on the promise of low-code. The confidence they’ve gained from serving such large institutions is proof that there’s a real and urgent need for a purpose-built low-code solution for financial markets. We’re excited to partner with Genesis and support them in delivering this across the world.&#8221; Brasoveanu is joining the startup&#8217;s board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volkswagen AG is gearing up to seize the top spot as the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer with plans announced Monday to have six 40 Gigawatt hour (GWh) battery cell production plants in operation in Europe by 2030.</p>
<p>To get there, the automaker put in a 10-year, $14 billion order with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/swedish-battery-manufacturer-northvolt-receives-a-14-billion-order-from-vw/">Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt</a> – and that&#8217;s only one of the six planned factories. A second plant in Germany will commence production in 2025.</p>
<p>The company also announced serious investments in charging infrastructure across China, Europe and the United States. It aims to grow its fast-charging network in Europe to 18,000 stations with its partner IONITY, 17,000 charging points in China through its joint venture CAMS New Energy Technology, and to increase the number of fast-charging stations in the United States by 3,500.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

The cell also paves the way for the transition to a solid-state battery cell, which the company anticipates for the middle of the decade. VW has made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">significant investments</a> in solid-state battery manufacturer QuantumScape.</p>
<p>Volkswagen&#8217;s new Unified Premium Battery platform will be rolled out in 2023 and will be used across 80 percent of its EV models. The first to contain the new battery, the Audi Artemis, will be rolled out in 2024.</p>
<p>Scania AB, VW&#8217;s brand of heavy-duty trucks and busses, also has plans to increase its share of EVs. Departing from other major heavy-duty players that have opted for hydrogen fuel cells, company representatives on Monday said that it is unequivocally possible to electrify the heavy-duty transportation sector.</p>
<p>Looking to the battery&#8217;s end-of-life, VW said it will be able to recycle up to 95% of the battery through a process called hydrometallury.</p>

<li>Stripe! Stripe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/">raised new money at a new price</a> and both were rather large. Would you believe that Stripe is still not public? It isn&#8217;t! But it should be. Perhaps this is the last time it will raise before listing.</li>
<li>Also from the recent past, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/megvii-ipo-china/">Megvii filed to go public</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/nimble-robotics-scores-50m-for-its-fulfillment-automation-tech/">Nimble Robotics raised</a>.</li>
<li>The Deliveroo IPO is happening, and the £1 billion raise could value the company at £5 billion, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deliveroo-ipo-idUSKBN2B70OO">Reuters reckons</a>.</li>
<li>Oh, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/wework-unbundles-its-products-in-an-attempt-to-make-itself-over-but-will-the-strategy-work/">TechCrunch has the most recent WeWork numbers</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/deepsee-ai-raises-22-6m-series-a-for-its-ai-centric-process-automation-platform/">DeepSee.ai raised a Series A</a>, and we have questions about its product &#8212; and hopes.</li>
<li><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/10/employee-engagement-startup-centrical-raises-32m/">Centrical also raised for its hybrid working software</a>, which could come in demand after COVID ends.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/extra-crunch-live-is-back-in-2021-connecting-founders-with-tech-giants-and-each-other/">Extra Crunch Live</a> this week is Emmalyn Shaw from Flourish Ventures and Adam Roseman from Steady.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Julia Collins is the first Black woman to co-found a venture-backed unicorn. So it should come as no surprise that investors lined up to bet on her latest venture, Planet FWD.</p>
<p>Investor Sarah Kunst says Collins&#8217; branding skills are on par with Supreme, the ubiquitous lifestyle brand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing that Supreme has done incredibly well is the same thing I think some very exceptional founders like Julia can do very well, which is to build a brand that stands for something,&#8221; said Kunst. &#8220;Smart people know that the best time to get aligned with a great brand is at the drop. A Supreme shirt that costs $100 bucks in the store will cost $1,000 online. So, as an investor, I am just a kid on the street corner flipping sportswear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kunst and Collins met well before Collins even had a clear idea for Planet FWD, but the duo knew they wanted to work together in the future. Kunst essentially told Collins that, whatever she was planning to do next, Kunst wanted to invest in it, sight unseen.</p>
<p>Kunst said Collins&#8217; ability to &#8220;see around the corner&#8221; with Zume gave her the confidence to proceed. When Zume launched, there were a lot of naysayers, recalls Kunst.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you look at where the world is and there are multibillion dollar companies in the space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Some of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world, like Travis Kalanick, are leaning into ghost kitchens, which are just less efficiently delivered versions of Zume Pizza robots. To quote Wayne Gretzky, because I&#8217;m from the Midwest and therefore care about hockey a tiny bit, you want to skate to where the puck is going.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two formed a friendship and eventually, Collins started building out Planet FWD and prepping to raise. By then, the foundation was there. Kunst got in on Planet FWD&#8217;s seed round.</p>
<h2>Fundraising is a process</h2>
<p>Collins says one of the biggest lessons she learned from her time at Zume was to limit distractions and focus on one thing at a time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt this disorientation at times, and it was hard to navigate,&#8221; she said, noting that she not only was starting a company but also settling into the Bay Area. &#8220;Now, it&#8217;s much easier for me to cut through a lot of noise and focus on a single conversation, a single product&#8217;s development, a single thing that I need to get done.&#8221;</p>
<p>In that same vein, Collins has learned to be incredibly deliberate when it comes to fundraising. It&#8217;s also worth noting that she&#8217;s raised some $400 million+ in the last five years.</p>

<p>Two-year-old CRED is in advanced stages of talks to raise about $200 million at about $2 billion valuation, three sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The new funding round, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/india-cred-raises-81m-buys-back-1-2m-shares-from-employees/">like this January&#8217;s Series C</a>, will be largely financed by existing investors, the sources said, requesting anonymity as talks are private. The round is expected to close within a month, one of them said.</p>
<p>CRED, founded by Kunal Shah, has become one of the most talked-about startups in India, in part because of the pace at which its valuation has soared.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Backed by high-profile investors including DST Global, Sequoia Capital India, Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital, and General Catalyst, CRED was valued at $806 million when it closed its Series C round in January this year and $450 million in August 2019. (TechCrunch also scooped the Series C round of CRED.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think <a href="https://twitter.com/CRED_club?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CRED_club</a> has probably scaled faster than any Indian startup I know. In two years they have created a category so strong that everyone has an opinion on it.</p>
<p>&mdash; Harshil Mathur (@harshilmathur) <a href="https://twitter.com/harshilmathur/status/1365662664752467973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>If the new deal goes through, CRED will be the fastest startup in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market to attain a $2 billion valuation. Prior to the upcoming Series D round, CRED had raised about $228 million.</p>
<p>Reached by TechCrunch early last week, CRED declined to comment. Sequoia Capital India didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The Indian startup operates an eponymous app that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/india-cred-kunal-shah/">rewards customers for paying their credit card bills on time</a> and offers deals from online brands such as Starbucks, Nykaa, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/vahdam-teas-series-c-united-states-expansion/">Vahdam Teas</a>. It had over 5.9 million customers as of January &#8212; or about 20% of the credit card holder population in the country.</p>
<p>The startup, unlike most others in India, doesn&#8217;t focus on the usual TAM of India &#8212; hundreds of millions of users of the world&#8217;s second most populated nation &#8212; and instead caters to some of the most premium audiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;India has 57 million credit cards (vs 830 million debit cards) [that] largely serves the high-end market. The credit card industry is largely concentrated with the top 4 banks (HDFC, SBI, ICICI and Axis) controlling about 70% of the total market. This space is extremely profitable for these banks – as evident from the SBI Cards IPO,&#8221; analysts at Bank of America wrote in a recent report to clients.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very few starts-ups like CRED are focusing on this high-end base and [have] taken a platform-based approach (acquire customers now and look for monetization later). Credit card in India remains an aspirational product. The under penetration would likely ensure continued strong growth in coming years. Overtime, the form-factor may evolve (i.e. move from plastic card to virtual card), but the inherent demand for credit is expected to grow,&#8221; they added.</p>

<p>CRED says it is trying to help customers improve their financial behavior. An individual needs a credit score of at least 750 to join CRED. In a recent newsletter to customers, CRED said the median credit score of its customers was 830 and at &#8220;any given point in time&#8221; more than 375,000 individuals are on the app&#8217;s waiting list, many of whom have demonstrably improved their score to join CRED.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to be responsible when you&#8217;re empowered. 80% CRED Protect members got visibility on extra interest charges and avoided late payment fees by tracking their dues on CRED. Ignorance is not always bliss. CRED members detected additional charges worth over ₹145 Crores [$20.1 million] on their statements. CRED members avoided over ₹43.5 Crores [$6 million] worth of late payment fees,&#8221; it wrote in the newsletter.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the help of regular bill payment reminders, and a seamless credit card management experience; 160,000 CRED members improved their credit scores last month. CRED members know it pays to be good as they earned cash-back worth ₹12 Crores [$1.65 million] by paying their bills on time. There&#8217;s always something to look forward to on CRED. Our members got access to over 750 new rewards and products.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup makes money by cross-selling financing products — for which it has a revenue-sharing arrangement with banks and other financial institutions — and levies a similar cut from merchants who are on the platform, Shah, who is also one of the most <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/want-to-invest-in-nothing-carl-pei-opens-investment-opportunity-to-community/">prolific angel investors in India</a>, told TechCrunch in an interview in January this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Anthony Geranio has played video games for the past thirteen years. The 26 year-old first time founder of <a href="https://www.1v1me.com/">1v1Me</a>, a new company that lets anyone gamble on their ability to win in a player vs. player game, tried to make it as a professional gamer, but when that didn&#8217;t work, he turned to the tech industry.</p>
<p>Geranio and his co-founder Alex Emmanuel bounced between companies like TextNow, Skillshare, and Grailed to combine both of their passions &#8212; gaming and entrepreneurship into a new company.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason I got into programming was because I wanted to be my own boss one day,&#8221; Geranio said. And even though he was making $200,000 a year working at mission driven tech companies, Geranio said he still wasn&#8217;t fulfilled.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic finally convinced Geranio and Emmanuel to take the plunge. All of Geranio&#8217;s friends had started lockdown whiling away the hours by playing poker online for money. Then poker turned into Call of Duty, which turned into Madden, which became whatever else the kids play these days (my gaming days ended with Mortal Kombat II).</p>
<p>Geranio then went to OnDeck and, after graduating, began knocking on investors&#8217; doors. The company managed to raise over $2 million from investors including On Deck, Erik Torenberg at Village Global, Turner Novak at GeltVC, Niv Dror at Shrug, SterlingVC, Ali Hamed at Crossbeam, Cody Hock and Cole Hock from UpNorth, Lightshed Ventures and BettorCapital. Notable angels also wanted in on the action including Justin Waldron, Brud founder Trevor McFedries, Ian Borthwick, Albert Cheng, Stephen Sikes and Anthony Pompliano.</p>
<p>The company is launching its app on the app store with an invite only approach, with the first invites going to content creators who already play games like Call of Duty. The longterm goal is to create content creators around wagering. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to create a network where wagering is the engagement tool,&#8221; said Geranio.</p>
<p>For now, the company is only supporting bets on games like Call of Duty and Fortnite. The service acts as a marketplace which exchanges contact information on a PlayStation or Xbox. To win a wager, competitors have to link their bank accounts, settle on an amount, and 1v1Me puts that money in escrow. Gamers stream their game on Twitch and 1v1Me monitors the game to determine the winner. Once the competition is over, the winner gets the money transferred to their account.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is launching with gamers like  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NoisyButters" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/user/NoisyButters&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615897291490000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8Z_YZ-Yyqh9iCG4lQNyNI0T6_KA">NoisyButters</a> (who invested as well), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIUXwNNq0kNXkF9E_YTnfvg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIUXwNNq0kNXkF9E_YTnfvg&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615897291490000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEeen1jsgwGIivQ6vw40Jq1s8PVog">Lunchtime</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rlaw" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.twitch.tv/rlaw&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615897291490000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHTxJFl-Lb269-HMXO5YCShS9NBKw">RLaw</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vonniezugz" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tiktok.com/@vonniezugz&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615897291490000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHfPqAA9mt7JnKG6eUqvwnHXsG8EQ">Vonniezugz</a>. </span></p>
<p>To juice signups and invites, which can either be obtained through a creator or by following the company on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/1v1me" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.twitter.com/1v1me&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615897291490000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEAHX0Qvk797PdHV5olvrNdzQWPyQ">Twitter</a> where 1v1Me will give codes away, the company is also hosting a $500 challenge to whichever competitor wins the most games at the end of the week.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I worked at YouTube, I met many gaming creators that desired to entertain their fans and hone their skills, but it can be a struggle to make significant money along the way,&#8221; said Albert Cheng, Co-lead of Socially Financed and Director of Product at Duolingo. &#8220;1v1 is the most promising platform for esports gamers to make a living, and I&#8217;m thrilled to back them on their journey.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.myzeller.com/">Zeller</a>, a payment and financial services startup founded by former Square executives, quietly raised a $25 million AUD (about $19.4 million USD) Series A last year, it announced today. The funding was led by Addition, the investment firm founded by former Tiger Global partner Lee Fixel, and included participation from returning investors Square Peg and Apex Capital. The Melbourne-based company said this is one of Australia&#8217;s largest pre-launch Series A rounds ever.</p>
<p>The startup previously raised a $6.3 million AUD (USD $4.9 million) seed round in June 2020. Zeller was was founded last year by Ben Pfisterer, Square&#8217;s former Asia Pacific and Australia head, and Dominic Yap, its strategy and growth lead. It has made 38 new hires over the past six months, growing its team to 50 people.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding will be used to expand Zeller&#8217;s product development and engineering capabilities, marketing and sales, and customer support teams as it prepares for its launch. A date hasn&#8217;t been set yet, but chief executive officer Pfisterer told TechCrunch it is &#8220;imminent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeller will offer a fully-integrated payments and financial services solution designed for small- to medium-sized businesses that currently rely on multiple providers for their payment terminals, point of sale systems, e-commerce payments, transaction accounts and credit cards. Zeller&#8217;s software is combined with a payment terminal, transaction account and business Mastercard, and intended to make it easier for businesses to accept and send payments, access funds and manage their finances. Zeller will have no lock-in contracts and one low fee for card payments.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t underestimate the challenges that come with scaling a new brand in an area dominated by entrenched banking incumbents, yet the opportunity is incredibly exciting,&#8221; said Pfisterer. &#8220;The industry experience our team has built up over the years means that we are well aware of the pain points business owners face when getting set up with a new banking or financial services provider.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that despite the growth of e-commerce, about two-thirds of transactions are still processed in person. Zeller&#8217;s &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; is currently businesses that process up to $10 million AUD annually, mostly in face-to-face transactions.</p>
<p>&#8220;They may be sole traders or employ a team, may operate across one or multiple locations and come from a variety of verticals including retail, hospitality, fixed or mobile services, events, trades and many more,&#8221; said Pfisterer. He estimated that Zeller&#8217;s market opportunity in Australia includes just under 1.5 million merchants, and it is also designed to be scalable into other markets.</p>
<p>Other payment and financial services companies in Australia include Square, eWAY, PayPal, Ayden and Stripe.</p>
<p>Pfisterer said eWAY, Stripe and Adyen tend to focus on e-commerce payment processing, &#8220;yet this is just one element of what business owners need to manage their cash flow.&#8221; Most still need to accept in-person payments, which means going to a traditional bank for a merchant terminal and account. On the other hand, PayPal and Square focus mainly on micro-merchants. &#8220;The growing pains kick in when a business starts to expand and demands a wider variety of services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeller already has plans to introduce new payment and financial services products, and integrations with tools like point-of-sale and accounting software, to scale up with businesses as they grow, he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://northvolt.com/">Northvolt,</a> the Swedish battery manufacturer which raised $1 billion in financing from investors led by Goldman Sachs and Volkswagen back in 2019, has signed a massive $14 billion battery order with VW for the next 10 years.</p>
<p>The big buy clears up some questions about where Volkswagen will be getting the batteries for its huge push into electric vehicles, which will see the automaker <a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/volkswagen-boosts-ev-production-target-15-million-2025">reach production capacity of 1.5 million electric vehicles by 2025.</a></p>
<p>The deal will not only see Northvolt become the strategic lead supplier for battery cells for Volkswagen Group in Europe, but will also involve the German automaker increasing its equity ownership of Northvolt.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the partnership agreement, Northvolt&#8217;s gigafactory in Sweden will be expanded and Northvolt agreed to sell its joint venture share in Salzgitter, Germany to Volkswagen as the car maker looks to build up its battery manufacturing efforts across Europe, the companies said.</p>
<p>The agreement between Northvolt and VW brings the Swedish battery maker&#8217;s total contracts to $27 billion in the two years since it raised its big $1 billion cash haul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Volkswagen is a key investor, customer and partner on the journey ahead and we will continue to work hard with the goal of providing them with the greenest battery on the planet as they rapidly expand their fleet of electric vehicles,&#8221; said Peter Carlsson, the co-founder and chief executive of Northvolt, in a statement.</p>
<p>Northvolt&#8217;s other partners and customers include ABB, BMW Group, Scania, Siemens, Vattenfall, and Vestas. Together these firms comprise some of the largest manufacturers in Europe.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, the company said that its cell manufacturing capacity could hit 16 Gigawatt hours and that it had sold its capacity to the tune of $13 billion through 2030. That means that the Volkswagen deal will eat up a significant portion of expanded product lines.</p>
<p>Founded Carlsson, a former executive at Tesla, Northvolt&#8217;s battery business was intended to leapfrog the European Union into direct competition with Asia&#8217;s largest battery manufacturers &#8212; Samsung, LG Chem, and CATL.</p>
<p class="Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x">Back when the company first announced its $1 billion investment round, Carlsson had said that Northvolt would need to build up to150 gigawatt hours of capacity to hit targets for. 2030 electric vehicle sales.</p>
<p>The plant in Sweden is expected to hit at least 32 gigawatt hours of production thanks, in part to backing by the Swedish pension fund firms AMF and Folksam and IKEA-linked IMAS Foundation, in addition to the big financial partners Volkswagen and Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Northvolt has had a busy few months. Earlier in March the company announced the acquisition of the Silicon Valley-based startup company Cuberg.</p>
<p>That acquisition gave Northvolt a foothold in the U.S. and established the company&#8217;s advanced technology center.</p>
<p>The acquisition also gives Northvolt a window into the newest battery chemistry that&#8217;s being touted as a savior for the industry &#8212;<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/24/1018102/lithium-metal-batteries-electric-vehicle-car/"> lithium metal batteries</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>Cuberg spun out of Stanford University back in 2015 to commercialize what the company called its next-generation battery combining a liquid electrolyte with a lithium metal anode. The company&#8217;s customers include Boeing, BETA Technologies, Ampaire, and VoltAero and it was backed by Boeing HorizonX Ventures, Activate.org, the California Energy Commission, the Department of Energy and the TomKat Center at Stanford.</p>
<p>Cuberg&#8217;s cells deliver 70 percent increased range and capacity versus comparable lithium ion cells designed for electric aviation applications. The two companies hope that they can apply the technology to Northvolt&#8217;s automotive and industrial product portfolio with the ambition to industrialize cells in 2025 that exceed 1,000 Wh/L, while meeting the full spectrum of automotive customer requirements, according to a statement.</p>
<p>“The Cuberg team has shown exceptional ability to develop world-class technology, proven results and an outstanding customer base in a lean and efficient organization,&#8221; said Peter Carlsson, CEO and Co-Founder, Northvolt in a statement. &#8220;Combining these strengths with the capabilities and technology of Northvolt allows us to make significant improvements in both performance and safety while driving down cost even further for next-generation battery cells. This is critical for accelerating the shift to fully electric vehicles and responding to the needs of the leading automotive companies within a relevant time frame.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new nanocoating from Curran Biotech could dramatically improve air filtration to prevent the spread of COVID-19 indoors.</p>
<p>Their Capture Coating technology acts as a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/curran-biotechs-capture-coating-transforms-everyday-air-filters-into-virus-fighting-front-line-tools-in-the-battle-against-covid-19-contributing-to-the-safety-of-filtered-air-301236418.html?tc=eml_cleartime">supplement to any household or commercial HVAC system by bonding to the filter fibers</a>, giving them greater hydrophobic properties. This combined effect prevents virus-carrying droplets from traveling through the filter fibers, which, without the treatment, only prevent some viral transmission.</p>
<p>“&#8217;Capture Coating&#8217; is designed to mitigate and significantly decrease viral transmission of COVID-19 through specified air filtration media by forming a breathable, flexible, non-leaching, water-repellent barrier against aqueous respiratory droplets that act as virion carriers that can potentially be recirculated through conventional air-filters,” wrote Curran Biotech founder and University of Houston physics professor Shay Curran in an email. Despite the molecular complexity of the coating, the product itself can simply be sprayed onto an HVAC system’s filter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This new droplet-targeting coating is an improvement over current filtration methods, which typically only target dry molecules. Not only do those methods often have at least some potential of viral droplet transmission, but current solutions to improve them aren’t always energy efficient.</p>
<p>“In the world where energy management is very important, that means recycling the same air in the building with the risk of cross contamination,” wrote Curran. “Taking outside air is one way to dilute the air, but that means we also lose a huge amount in terms of energy, and still don&#8217;t solve the problem of taking the virus away from places where people congregate.”</p>
<p>Indoor air ventilation remains an important tool in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 across schools, small businesses, and other public buildings, but updating old HVAC systems to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/ventilation.html">recommended CDC standards can be costly</a>. Curran hopes that his company’s approach can help address this issue, as the Capture Coating requires only a simple spray, rather than a completely new system of filters. “That really means for a few dollars when used on a standard issue MERV8, you can have huge indoor protection and stop its spread throughout the building,” he wrote.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will unreliable research bury your healthcare startup?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/will-unreliable-research-bury-your-healthcare-startup/embed/#?secret=lxwxN248kq" data-secret="lxwxN248kq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Because of the nature of the nanocoating, Curran’s technology can help prevent viral droplet transmission long after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. The <a href="https://www.curranbiotech.com/gallery">hydrophobic qualities of the coating prevent respiratory droplets</a> from actions like sneezing or coughing from passing through the filter, while the HVAC system itself retains its normal capabilities for dry molecule filtration. With the Capture Coating, common droplet-transmitting viruses like the flu or cold will also be filtered out of circulation.</p>
<p>Similarly, the nanocoating would work in preventing transmission of any variant of the COVID-19 virus, as all of those variants also undergo droplet transmission. “It does not mean we get away from taking precautions such as hand washing, wearing masks etc, but it does mean we can work indoors far more safely,” wrote Curran.</p>
<p>So far, Curran Biotech’s Capture Coating technology is in use in 11 states, and will soon be announcing partnerships with distributors and filter companies to directly provide consumers with coated filters. Curran wrote that the company has also had successful trials of the technology in New York City, and hopes to expand use of the product even further across businesses and institutions around the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://deepsee.ai/">DeepSee.ai</a>, a startup that helps enterprises use AI to automate line-of-business problems, today announced that it has raised a $22.6 million Series A funding round led by led by ForgePoint Capital. Previous investors AllegisCyber Capital and Signal Peak Ventures also participated in this round, which brings the Salt Lake City-based company&#8217;s total funding to date to $30.7 million.</p>
<p>The company argues that it offers enterprises a different take on process automation. The industry buzzword these days is &#8216;robotic process automation,&#8217; but DeepSee.ai argues that what it does is different. I describe its system as &#8216;knowledge process automation&#8217; (KPA). The company itself defines this as a system that &#8220;mines unstructured data, operationalizes AI-powered insights, and automates results into real-time action for the enterprise.&#8221; But the company also argues that today&#8217;s bots focus on basic task automation that doesn&#8217;t offer the kind of deeper insights that sophisticated machine learning models can bring to the table. The company also stresses that it doesn&#8217;t aim to replace knowledge workers but help them leverage AI to turn the plethora of data that businesses now collect into actionable insights.</p>

<p>&#8220;Executives are telling me they need business outcomes and not science projects,&#8221; writes DeepSee.ai CEO Steve Shillingford. &#8220;And today, the burgeoning frustration with most AI-centric deployments in large-scale enterprises is they look great in theory but largely fail in production. We think that’s because right now the current ‘AI approach’ lacks a holistic business context relevance. It’s unthinking, rigid, and without the contextual input of subject-matter experts on the ground. We founded DeepSee to bridge the gap between powerful technology and line-of-business, with adaptable solutions that empower our customers to operationalize AI-powered automation – delivering faster, better, and cheaper results for our users.&#8221;</p>
<p>To help businesses get started with the platform, DeepSee.ai offers <a href="https://deepsee.ai/platform/">three core tools</a>. There&#8217;s <a href="https://deepsee.ai/platform/#assembler">DeepSee Assembler</a>, which ingests unstructured data and gets it ready for labeling, model review and analysis. Then, <a href="https://deepsee.ai/platform/#atlas">DeepSee Atlas</a> can use this data to train AI models that can understand a company&#8217;s business processes and help subject-matter experts define templates, rules and logic for automating a company&#8217;s internal processes. The third tool, <a href="https://deepsee.ai/platform/#advisor">DeepSee Advisor</a>, meanwhile focuses on using text analysis to help companies better understand and evaluate their business processes.</p>
<p>Currently, the company&#8217;s focus is on providing these tools for insurance companies, the public sector and capital markets. In the insurance space, use cases include fraud detection, claims prediction and processing, and using large amounts of unstructured data to identify patterns in agent audits, for example.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a relatively limited number of industries for a startup to operate in, but the company says it will use its new funding to accelerate product development and expand to new verticals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using KPA, line-of-business executives can bridge data science and enterprise outcomes, operationalize AI/ML-powered automation at scale, and use predictive insights in real time to grow revenue, reduce cost, and mitigate risk,&#8221; said Sean Cunningham, Managing Director of ForgePoint Capital. &#8220;As a leading cybersecurity investor, ForgePoint sees the daily security challenges around insider threat, data visibility, and compliance. This investment in DeepSee accelerates the ability to reduce risk with business automation and delivers much-needed AI transparency required by customers for implementation.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ElevateBio, one of the leading biotech companies focused on gene-based therapies has raised a massive $525 million Series C round of financing, more than doubling the company&#8217;s $193 million Series B funding which closed last year. This new funding comes from existing investor Matrix Capital Management, and also adds new investors SoftBank and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, and will be used to help the company expand its R&amp;D and manufacturing capabilities, as well as continue to spin out new companies and partnerships based on its research.</p>
<p>Cambridge, Mass-based ElevateBio was founded to bridge the world of academic research and development of cell and gene therapies with that of commercialization and production-scale manufacturing. The startup identified a need for more efficient means of brining to market the ample, promising science that was being done in developing therapeutics that leverage cellular and genetic editing, particularly in treatment of severe and chronic illness. Its business model focuses on both developing and commercializing its own therapies, and also working through long-term partnerships with academic research institutions and other therapeutics biotech companies to bring their own technologies to market.</p>
<p>To this end, ElevateBio is in the business of frequent spin-out company creation, with the new entities each focused on a specific therapeutic. The company has announced three such companies to date, including AlloVir (in partnership with Baylor College of Medicine), HighPassBio (a venture with gene-editing company Fred Hutchinson) and Life Edit Therapeutics (in partnership with AgBiome). There are additional spin-outs in the works, too, according to ElevateBio, but they are not being disclosed publicly yet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As you might expect, ElevateBio seems to have benefited from the increased appetite for biotech investment stemming from the global pandemic and its impacts. ElevateBio&#8217;s AlloVir spin-out is actually working on a T cell therapy candidate for addressing COVID-19, which is potentially effective in eliminating cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 in a patient to slow the spread of the disease and reduce its severity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, there was a debate as to whether WeWork was a tech company or more of a real estate play. At first, most people viewed WeWork as a real estate startup disguised as a tech startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as it kept scooping up more and more property, the lines continued to blur. Then we all watched as the company’s valuation plummeted and its IPO plans went up in smoke. Today, WeWork is rumored to be </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-in-talks-to-combine-with-spac-or-raise-money-privately-11611857306?mod=djemalertNEWS"><span style="font-weight: 400;">going public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/wework-could-strike-blank-check-company-merger-deal-in-1st-week-of-march-8211-wsj-62874558"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a SPAC </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">at a $10 billion valuation, down significantly from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the $47 billion it was valued at after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising $1 billion in its SoftBank-led Series H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> round in January 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and then-CEO Adam Neumann notoriously </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/report-weworks-adam-neumann-to-step-down-as-ceo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stepped down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later that year amid allegations of a toxic combination of arrogance and poor management. WeWork has since been very publicly trying to redeem itself and turn around investor &#8212; and public &#8212; perception.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chairman Marcelo Claure kicked off a strategic, five-year turnaround plan in earnest in February 2020. That same month, the beleaguered company named a real estate &#8212; not tech &#8212; exec as its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/01/report-wework-has-a-new-ceo-and-hes-a-real-estate-not-a-tech-exec/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new CEO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a move that set tongues wagging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeWork then also set a target of becoming </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wework-says-become-free-cash-132630453.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free cash flow positive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a year to 2022 as part of its plan, which was aimed at both boosting valuation and winning back investor trust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It likely saw the demise of competitor Knotel, which ended up </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/a-look-at-how-proptech-startup-knotel-went-from-a-1-6b-valuation-to-filing-for-bankruptcy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filing for bankruptcy </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and selling assets to an investor, and realized it needed to learn from some of that company’s mistakes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question now is: Has WeWork legitimately turned a corner? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the implementation of its turnaround plan, the company says it has exited out of over 100 pre-open or underperforming locations. (It still has </span><a href="https://www.wework.com/locations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 800 locations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> globally, according to its website.) WeWork has also narrowed its net loss to $517 million in Q3 2020 from $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, revenue has taken a hit, presumably due to the impact of the coronavirus. Revenue slumped to $811 million the 2020 third quarter, compared with $934 million in Q3 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic presented WeWork with challenges, but also &#8212; some might say &#8212; opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many people being forced to work from home and avoiding others during the work day, the office space in general struggled. WeWork either had to adapt, or potentially deal with a bigger blow to its valuation and bottom line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeWork’s dilemma is similar to  those of real estate companies around the world. With so many companies shifting to remote work not just temporarily, but also permanently, landlords everywhere have had to adjust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, as McKinsey </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/the-effect-of-government-stimulus-on-commercial-real-estate-amid-covid-19#"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all landlords have been forced to be more flexible and restructure tenant leases. So in effect, anyone operating commercial real estate space has had to become more flexible, just as WeWork has.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, WeWork has taken a few steps to adapt. For one, it realized its membership-only plan was not going to work anymore, and a dip in membership was evidence of that. So, it worked to open its buildings to more people through new </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/wework-but-make-it-uber-b428fbe2-7fc7-4d4e-aaba-8c8aa2be537d.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2020/10/24/wework-coworking-coronavirus-office-commercial-real-estate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> options. The goal was to give people who were weary of working out of their own homes a place to go, say one day a week, to work. WeWork also saw an opportunity to work with companies to offer up its office space as a perk via an All Access offering, as well as with universities that wanted to give their students an alternative place to study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgetown did a pretty unique partnership with WeWork to have one of its locations serve as “their replacement library and common space.” And, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies like Brandwatch have recently shifted from leveraging WeWork&#8217;s traditional spaces to instead offer employees access to WeWork locations around the globe via All Access passes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeWork has also launched new product features. At the beginning of the year, the company launched </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the ability to book space on the weekend and outside of business hours. </span></p>

<h2>The unbundling of space</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked with Prabhdeep Singh, WeWork’s global head of marketplace, who is overseeing the new products and also spearheading WeWork’s shift online, to learn more about the company’s new strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’ve essentially done is unbundle our space,” he said. “It used to be that the only way to enjoy our spaces was via a bundled subscription product and monthly memberships. But we realized with COVID, the world was shifting, and to open up our platform to a broader group of people and make it as flexible as humanly possible. So they can now book a room for a half hour or get a day pass, for example. The use cases are so wide.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since On Demand launched as a pilot in New York City in August 2020, demand has steadily been climbing, according to Singh. So far, reservations are up by 65% &#8212; and revenue up by 70% &#8212; over the 2020 fourth quarter. But of course, it’s still early and they were starting from a small base. Nearly two-thirds of On Demand reservations are made by repeat customers, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the last year and a half, we’ve been really figuring out what things we want to focus on what things we don’t,” Singh said. “As a flexible space provider, we are looking at where the world is going. And while we’re a small part of the whole commercial office space industry, we are working to use technology to enable a flexible workspace experience via a great app and the digitization of our spaces.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, things seem to be looking up some. In February, WeWork says it had nearly twice as many active users compared to January. Also, people apparently like having the option to come in at off hours. Weekend bookings now account for an estimated 14.5% of total bookings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly double as many existing members purchased All Access passes in February 2020 compared to January to complement their existing private office space during COVID, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the beginning of the COVID-19, WeWork saw a</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/15/success/wework-ceo-future-work/index.html?utm_term=PRV-160019770518545e993ef75ca&amp;utm_source=Work+Transformed+September+15&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=243358_1600197705203&amp;bt_ee_preview=NcSrJnseMIyhSYOHhgpWJBhg8%2Bguk%2FDdFMfL84t5SciDGnr%2BQdbNwGGFmVGUuyiT&amp;bt_ts_preview=1600197705203"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">higher departure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) than of its enterprise members, partially due to the nature of their businesses and the need to more immediately manage cash flow, the company said. But in the third quarter of 2020, SMB desk sales were up 50% over the second quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, throughout the pandemic, WeWork has seen its enterprise segment grow at nearly double the rate of its SMBs, now making up over half of the company’s total membership base.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s slowing down investing in new real estate assets in certain markets, it is still working to “right-size” its portfolio via exits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, when it comes to its finances, as of March 2, WeWork said its </span><a href="https://www.boerse-berlin.com/index.php/Bonds?isin=USU96217AA99"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bonds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were trading at the highest point since the summer of 2019, when the company failed to go public. That’s way up from a 52-week low of about 28%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At ~92% for a ~10% yield, the creditor sentiment is clearly positive and a testament to the overall market&#8217;s belief that WeWork&#8217;s flexible workspace product has a viable future in the future of real estate,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last March, WeWork’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bonds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trading at 43 cents on the dollar and S&amp;P Global had lowered WeWork’s credit rating further into junk territory and put the company on watch for further downgrades, reported </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2020/03/26/wework-mounts-charm-offensive-as-bondholders-run-for-the-exits/?sh=3dcafcfe28dd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the company is not done adapting. Singh told TechCrunch that to make WeWork’s value proposition even stronger, it’s working to offer a “business in a box.” Late last year, WeWork partnered with a number of companies to offer SMBs and startups, for example, services such as payroll, healthcare and business insurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people that come to WeWork are growing businesses,” Singh said. “So while we’ve stuck with our core business services, we’re working to offer more, as in a real suite of HR services that might be complex and expensive for a small business to manage on their own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also working to be able to offer its On Demand product globally so that people can opt to work out of a WeWork space from any of its locations around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now, we are in the largest work from home experiment,” Singh said. “I think we’re about to shift to the largest return to work experiment ever. We are just going to be very well positioned.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company appears to be trying to become a more sophisticated real estate company that may not be as flashy as the one of the Adam Neumann era, but more stable and more in demand. But is it trying to do too much, too fast?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be interesting to see how it all goes.</span></p>
