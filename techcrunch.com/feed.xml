										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For small and mid-sized restaurants in Nigeria and most of Africa, food procurement can be a complex process to manage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The system is such that a business can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> run out of money or have considerable savings. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most restaurants don&#8217;t have access to deal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with farms to get better deals because they lack the staffing to chase them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, they also don&#8217;t have the aggregation pull as single entities to directly get good value from the farms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian startup <a href="http://vendease.com">Vendease</a> solves this problem by building a marketplace that allows restaurants to buy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from farms and food manufacturers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/gatumialiyu"> Gatumi Aliyu</a>, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/olumide-fayankin-3a450339">Olumide Fayankin</a>, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tunde-kara-a0345121">Tunde Kara</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/waleoyepeju">Wale Oyepeju</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for Vendease came when founders who have been friends for more than five years noticed their favorite restaurants in cities like Lagos and Accra shutting down</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inquisitive, they asked the owners who were acquaintances why, and the problems boiled down to the unreliable and expensive nature of food procurement in the cities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some months later they saw a hotel manager </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">openly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complain to a vendor about the unsteady supply of produce the hotel was getting. It sparked an idea in the founders&#8217; minds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The established processes involved staff or a contract employee going to the market or using third-party vendors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders saw that these processes were often unreliable from the two unrelated events, and restaurants lost a lot of money from price inflation and bad produce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We thought to ourselves that if restaurant owners and hotel managers have these problems, let us actually do some research and find out if it is a problem we can solve, scale and make money while doing it,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Kara said to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Kara, the CEO, and Fayankin, the COO, held the respective positions at a Pan-African media consulting company called RED Media</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aliyu, the chief product officer (CPO), also held a similar role at another Lagos and San Francisco-based, YC-backed startup, 54gene</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Oyepeju, the CTO, was working on a couple of technology projects for corporates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vendease, they had founded an adtech startup for ride-hailing companies, which didn&#8217;t survive for long</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this was another shot at another entrepreneurial journey, and after two and half months of iteration, the founders decided to launch the company in January 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They also closed an undisclosed pre-seed round to kickstart operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On its website, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is described</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as &#8220;a procurement platform that provides a transparent process for hotels and restaurants to get the best quality products at the best possible price</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; But Kara has a more fanciful description: The Amazon Prime for restaurants in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers can order anything ranging from bread to grains and meat to vegetables on the website. The order notification goes to the farms or food manufacturers, gets processed, and delivery is done within 24 hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why we call ourselves that is because we are deliberate about fulfilling our orders to restaurants and hotels in less than 24 hours</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As most of us know, this is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how Amazon Prime prioritizes delivery,&#8221; he commented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speed and timely manner in which Vendease carries out its operations are such that it currently completes 80% of on-time and one-time deliveries across all orders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127339" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127339" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2127339" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vendease_landing_page_1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vendease_landing_page_1.png 1084w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vendease_landing_page_1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vendease_landing_page_1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vendease_landing_page_1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vendease_landing_page_1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vendease_landing_page_1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2127339" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vendease</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To further highlight how effective the company has been thus far, Kara claims that a good number of the 100 businesses using Vendease went from procuring only one type of produce to 80% of their catalog in two months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as Vendease helps restaurants a lot, it also looks out for the vendors and farmers involved in the supply chain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Typically it takes two to three months for these set of customers to get the payments </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and this happens because</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> restaurants and hotels take too long to balance their books before making payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In effect, farmers and vendors mark up their prices to mitigate losses, making products more expensive for restaurants and hotels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While growing up, Kara and Fayankin were on both sides of the vicious cycle. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up on a farm and helping his parents with livestock and crop care, Kara knows what it means to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be owed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a long time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Those experiences help fuel what I do right now. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, we had a problem selling our products and most times we ended up consuming them because we didn&#8217;t have enough off-takers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even when you did, they&#8217;ll owe for six months. And this problem still exists to date.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side of the marketplace is Olumide, who grew up in a hotel and restaurant business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He runs and handles procurement activities and his experience is vital to how Vendease handles issues around unreliable and expensive supply of food produce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But now they are helping these customers reduce the waiting time to days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they would&#8217;ve wanted to solve these problems earlier, their careers strayed toward media and energy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it has brought them back, and they&#8217;re solving </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> problems they didn&#8217;t recognise in the past</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They soon figured that customers couldn&#8217;t track most of their orders and be certain of what they got alongside the supply and cost issues</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vendease has built all that to help these businesses digitize, track and automate their procurement and inventory management processes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also helps with logistics, warehousing, quality control and financing where restaurants can</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> buy goods and pay later</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next five years, the one-year-old company wants to be the operating system for food supplies in Africa. Kara talks of plans to expand to other African cities in the coming months but is tight-lipped on the names. As Demo Day approaches, the team will be looking to raise some money </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and follows Egypt&#8217;s Breadfast as the only restaurant-focused companies from Africa (although they have very different business models) that the accelerator has funded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Across the street from Suzhou North, a high-speed railway station in a historic city near Shanghai, a futuristic M-shaped building easily catches the eye of anyone passing by. It houses the headquarters of the five-year-old Chinese autonomous driving startup, Momenta.</p>
<p>Like other major Chinese cities, Suzhou, which is famous for its serene canals and classical gardens, offers subsidized offices and policy support to attract high-tech firms. It seems to have chosen well. Momenta exceeded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/momenta-profile/">$1 billion in valuation</a> in two years and became one of the most-funded driving companies in China. The startup has a dazzling list of investors, from Kai-Fu Lee&#8217;s Sinovation Ventures, the government of Suzhou, to Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler.</p>
<p>Momenta recently closed another massive round, which nears $500 million and lifts its total funding to over $700 million. The investment marks an important step towards the firm&#8217;s international expansion, its chief of business development Sun Huan told TechCrunch. In a few months&#8217; time, Sun will head to Stuttgart, the German hometown of Mercedes-Benz, and open Momenta&#8217;s first European office.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding, a Series C round, was led by Chinese state-backed automaker SAIC Motor, Toyota and Bosch, an indication of the traditional auto monoliths&#8217; conviction to smart driving.</p>
<p>&#8220;The auto industry needs to develop more advantages when confronting Tesla&#8217;s marketing today, so they are paying more attention to autonomous driving,&#8221; Momenta&#8217;s founder and CEO Cao Xudong told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Financial investors leading the round were the Singaporean sovereign fund Temasek and Alibaba founder Jack Ma&#8217;s Yunfeng Capital. Other participants included Mercedes-Benz AG, Xiaomi founder Lei Jun&#8217;s Shunwei Capital, Tencent, Cathay Capital and a few undisclosed institutions. It&#8217;s rare to see Tencent and Alibaba (or their affiliates) co-invest.</p>
<h2>Be pragmatic</h2>
<p>Despite the sizable financial injection, Cao said that &#8220;autonomous driving companies can no longer rely solely on fundraising to burn cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mega-fundraising has become common in the capital-intensive autonomous vehicle world. Momenta&#8217;s Chinese rivals Pony.ai has amassed over $1 billion within five years and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/weride-200-million-funding/">four-year-old WeRide.ai</a> has raised over $500 million. Like Momenta, the two firms have nabbed investments from big automakers. Pony.ai also counts Toyota as an investor, and WeRide is backed by Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi.</p>
<p>Momenta declined to disclose its latest valuation. For reference, Pony.ai hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-pony-ai-hits-5-3-billion-valuation/">$5.3 billion</a> in its November fundraising round.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127361" style="width: 736px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127361" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2127361 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/momenta-2021_1.jpg" alt="" width="726" height="545" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/momenta-2021_1.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/momenta-2021_1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/momenta-2021_1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/momenta-2021_1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/momenta-2021_1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/momenta-2021_1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/momenta-2021_1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/momenta-2021_1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2127361" class="wp-caption-text">TechCrunch went on a test ride with Momenta / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Momenta prides itself on what it calls a &#8220;two-legged&#8221; business model. Unlike some peers that concentrate resources on &#8216;Level 4,&#8217; or real driverless passenger cars, Momenta is selling semi-automated driving software to carmakers while investing in more advanced tech that is years from mass adoption.</p>
<p>It also tries to cap expenses by crowdsourcing data from auto partners instead of building its own car fleets, which helps save billions of dollars, the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/momenta-profile/">reiterated</a>. By accumulating driving data at scale, Momenta gets to finetune its algorithms through a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/momenta-robotaxis/">self-correcting system</a>. The more data it has, the better its machine becomes at driving.</p>
<p>&#8220;It works like a flywheel,&#8221; Cao said, using a tech industry jargon first <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/the-aws-ipo/">popularized by Jeff Bezos</a> to explain Amazon&#8217;s growth.</p>
<h2>Driver&#8217;s habit</h2>
<p>During a test ride TechCrunch went on, where a safety driver was present but did not intervene, a Momenta-powered Lincoln maneuvered through a neighborhood of Suzhou dotted by jaywalkers, unleashed dogs, speeding scooters and reckless truck drivers. When the sedan slowed down at a highway entrance ramp, other cars zipped past us. It felt as if we were going too slowly, but in fact all the human-steered cars were going well above the 40km/h speed limit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some drivers may want the autonomous driving car to be more aggressive, so we are also exploring a system that learns from individual style,&#8221; said Jiang Yunfei, an R&amp;D engineer at Momenta who went on the ride. &#8220;Of course, on the condition that the car is obeying traffic rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>A tablet next to the dashboard showed what our car was capable of seeing and predicting on the road with a set of mass-produced sensors. &#8220;Prediction relies on data,&#8221; noted Sun. &#8220;If we build our own car fleets, it will be very costly to keep the data-driven approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>Momenta has joined in the ranks of companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/autox-removes-safety-drivers/">piloting robotaxis on China&#8217;s urban roads</a>. It aims to remove some safety drivers from its robotaxis, which it jointly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/momenta-robotaxis/">operates with auto partners</a>, in 2022 and expects all of its vehicles to go driverless in 2024. By then, the company will have significantly reduced labor costs and reach a positive operating margin per vehicle.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Daimler-backed Momenta says its robotaxis will be fully driverless and profitable in 2024&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/momenta-robotaxis/embed/#?secret=tjG9c0gTBi" data-secret="tjG9c0gTBi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Automate globally</h2>
<p>Momenta has kept a quiet public profile since its inception and rarely talked about its customers except for its partnership with Toyota on <a href="https://medium.com/@momentaai2016/momenta-reaches-strategic-cooperation-with-toyota-to-provide-hd-mapping-related-autonomous-driving-6602a1a0129e">high-definition maps</a>, which predated the investment. What Cao could say was the company has fostered &#8220;deep collaborations&#8221; with carmakers and Tier-1 suppliers across China, Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>By the end of 2021, multiple customers will start mass-producing mid-to-high-end cars equipped with Momenta&#8217;s software. And by 2024 or 2025, Momenta&#8217;s solutions could be powering millions of vehicles, which should provide a steady stream of driving data to the startup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Electrification is no longer enough to differentiate one high-end car brand from another because the motors and batteries they used are quite similar. The key differentiator now is intelligence,&#8221; said the founder.</p>
<p>When asked whether Momenta worries about challenges faced by Chinese firms amid geopolitical tensions and continuing U.S.-China technological decoupling, Jijay Shen, who recently joined Momenta as vice president of sales and marketing, said such situations are &#8220;uncontrollable&#8221; and &#8220;regulatory compliance&#8221; is the priority for entering any new market.</p>
<p>&#8220;The human race was able to achieve significant technological progress in the last ten years exactly because tech companies from different countries are building on top of each other,&#8221; said Shen, who spent over a decade at Huawei and was formerly CEO of the telecoms giant&#8217;s Ireland business.</p>
<p>&#8220;But because of geopolitical factors, many markets will begin to consider self-subsistence in the short term&#8230; I can&#8217;t conclude what is better, but I think the whole ecosystem and supply chain need to think what&#8217;s better &#8212; self-subsistence or interdependence.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wF5ykfTe4KE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s stipulate the storm of user media (social audio, newsletters, live streaming) is evidence of something real and lasting. When this citizen media migrates to small business and the enterprise, we see that as confirmation, validation. Most of these efforts are in the investment phase, where startups and platforms consolidate ecosystems around the various disruptions.</p>
<p>Clubhouse is moving to a more careful onboarding process that eschews mandatory gobbling of your contacts data and your phone number as a requirement for invitations. Twitter is surprisingly far along on integrating a suite of pilot projects — its Clubhouse clone Spaces, the Revue newsletter creation and distribution tool, and whatever happens to the Periscope live video streaming services the company has abandoned as a standalone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As the smoke clears, what emerges is a hybrid of work from anywhere and post-pandemic digital collaboration solutions. At the top of the stack, social audio delivers some real leadership in the casual way it captures user attention. While commuting listening is proscribed for at least the next quarter, exercise and mental health breaks pick up a lot of that deficit. Some of the resulting content is appointment focused, keynote events with industry leaders and celebrities. Smaller sessions are organized around self- and group-help concerns, and the usual assortment of get-rich schemes. Much of this competes directly with cable news and podcasts, and will likely absorb the older networks into the new paradigm over time.</p>
<p>You can see this at play in the streaming realignment, where cable-cutting is driving us toward broadband-based consumption of so-called linear television programming. Last night, we ended up switching from Comcast&#8217;s video access to CBS&#8217;s Grammy coverage in favor of IP streaming via the CBS All Access app (now renamed Paramount +.) The Comcast CBS channel was full of glitches and pixillation; the streaming version rock solid with what seemed like better video and audio quality. On the appointment television side of the equation, old-style network shows like This Is Us and Grey&#8217;s Anatomy are finding it more difficult to compete with Netflix, Prime, and other streaming originals. And then there are the kids, who refuse to even recognize anything they can&#8217;t stream as relevant.</p>
<p>Moving down the stack from streaming audio (I like that better than social audio as a thing) to the newsletter services, we discover what happens when fragmentation of the media produces too much content and not enough loyalty to a manageable number of suppliers. That loyalty thing is perhaps the new eyeballs, where the stickiness of the relationship is much more desirable for its ongoing lifetime value. Newsletters at their inception were aggregators built to skim the cream of relevant media, in effect replacing the home page and adding a social layer of authority. Now the glut has moved from posts and podcasts to the newsletters themselves.</p>
<p>To differentiate and encourage paid subscriptions, creators are now being wined and dined with tools for managing these microapp sites and competing with magazines and publishers for marquee authors. Newsletter stars start appearing on streaming audio in much the same way that Washington Post and New York Times reporters populate the CNN and MSNBC roundtables. Newsletter&#8217;s role as a blend of must reads is shifting to original material and a marketing channel for influence with the streaming audio communities. Twitter&#8217;s Revue newsletter tool already lets you drag and drop tweets into the latest issue. It seems a small tweak to use the newsletter as a calendar for upcoming Spaces notifications of events. The company has announced plans for Super Followers who can produce and receive subscribed content via this path between the platform and satellite services.</p>
<p>Twitter hasn&#8217;t been Super Clear on how or what video services they will maintain after they sunset Periscope, but closing the loop between streaming audio and on demand video programming gives Twitter a powerful advantage over services like Clubhouse that have fewer pieces of the puzzle. On the other hand, Twitter has to demonstrate newfound ability to launch and integrate the pieces to stay competitive with competitors both visible and in stealth. They include Facebook, Amazon and its growing ad platform, and streaming &#8220;Plus&#8221; services at a time where subscribers are dropping subscriptions to add new offerings from Disney, Apple, HBO Max, Paramount, and the cheaper free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) networks like Peacock and Hulu.</p>
<p>Working from anywhere is accelerating the streaming media transition. News becomes a notification-driven stream to dip in and out of as the vaccines begin to take hold. Work promotes attention and care of our values, while home brings a time of relearning how to breathe, treasuring our family and friends, and putting time into exploring things we have been fighting to keep alive: the rhythms of history, genealogy, climate change, the possibility that government can work for a change. As our anxiety moderates, we can dip into music, movies, sports, and other expressive uses of the powerful network we turned on to survive. Turn on, tune in, stay home.</p>
<p>Streaming audio can work for marketing, learning, sharing, and monetizing. It can also work for extending our collaboration with music, painting, storytelling, a kind of virtual comedy club, book club, and debating society. I can imagine the return of liner notes to the music experience, a kind of Prairie Home Companion writ small. The Grammys last night were awkward, strained by the exigencies of the virus. But the performances were bunched together, with the wonderful touch of the group of artists sitting on stools campfire-style after their song to listen and rock to the music of their fellow nominees. Clubhouse style.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re on the cusp of a powerful change in the way we live and work. Not just out of necessity but of a desire to fulfill the promise of global communication. We&#8217;ve laid the tracks of this new age of collaboration. Now we have to figure out what to do with it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s been quite a bit of movement in the additive manufacturing space in recent months. If I had to pinpoint a reason, I would say that &#8212; much like robotics (another space I follow fairly closely) &#8212; the category has gotten a boost in interest from the pandemic. Medical applications are understandably of interest lately, as is alternative manufacturing.</p>
<p>Desktop Metal, Markforged and new-comer Mantel have all made pretty big announcements in recent weeks, and now Fortify is making the round with a significant raise. The Boston-based startup announced a <a href="https://3dfortify.com/fortify-secures-20m-series-b/">$20 million Series B equity round</a>, led by Cota Capital with additional participation from Accel Partners, Neotribe Ventures and Prelude Ventures.</p>
<p>Fortify is attempting to stake out a claim in material deposits. Using digital light processing (DLP) tech, the company can mix and print in a variety of different materials, with a wide range of properties. The list includes some useful traits, including electromagnetic and thermal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Like Mantel, the company looks to be targeting manufacturing tools, including injection molding.</p>
<p>“Fortify has been focused on proving the viability of our product and market opportunity over the past 18+ months, and exceeded our goals set at the beginning of 2020,” CEO Josh Martin said in a release. “This next round will expand our go-to-market footprint in key verticals such as injection mold tooling while enabling us to capture market share in end-use electronic devices.”</p>
<p>Recent months have also found the company enlisting other 3D printing vets. Paul Dresens (ex Desktop Metal) signed on as VP of Engineering, while former GrabCad (a Stratasys acquisition) market exec Rob Stevens has signed on as an advisor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford said Thursday that some some Ford F-150 pickup trucks and Edge crossover without certain electronic modules due to a twofold punch of a global semiconductor shortage and a lack of parts caused a winter storm.</p>
<p>Ford said it will <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/03/18/ford-global-semiconductor-update.html">build and hold the vehicles</a> for a number of weeks, then ship the vehicles to dealers once the modules are available and comprehensive quality checks are complete. The automaker also said it is canceling shifts tonight and Friday at Louisville Assembly Plant due to the semiconductor-related part shortage. Ford said production of the Escape and Lincoln Corsair is expected to resume Monday on short shifts, with full production scheduled to resume Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ford isn&#8217;t alone in its decision to build vehicles without certain parts as the global chip shortage drags on. GM said earlier this week that certain pickup trucks would be produced <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/03/15/gm-pickups-chip-shortage/4708837001/">without a fuel management module</a>, a device that will prevent these vehicles from achieving top fuel economy performance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Both Ford and GM have previously issued guidance that the chip shortage will impact its financial results in 2021. Ford has said that if the semiconductor shortage scenario is extended through the first half of 2021, the shortage could lower its between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, net of cost recoveries and some production make-up in the second half of the year. GM said in February that the global shortage of semiconductors will have a short-term impact on its production, earnings and cash flow in 2021.</p>

Led by Prime Movers Lab, the round also features Prologis Ventures, Quiet Capital, Lemnos Labs, Creative Ventures, Ahoy Capital, Compound, FundersClub and Mark Cuban.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia-based company was founded in 2018 by Samuel Reeves, who previous headed up Humanistic Robotics. That fellow Pennsylvania startup is focused on landmine and IED-clearing remote operating robotic systems.</p>
<p>The newer company is focused more on safety software, for collaborative robotics and other autonomous systems. Among the other issues being tackled by the company is cybersecurity vulnerability among these sots of workplace robotics. Other issues targeted here include broader system failure and potential human error.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company says it currently works with 100 companies across a wide spectrum of categories, from warehouse fulfillment and manufacturing to delivery and transportation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world is on the cusp of a new industrial revolution in mobile automation,” Reeves said in a release tied to the news. “With added investment and support, we&#8217;ll be able to rapidly scale the company to capitalize on the convergence of trend and opportunity to ensure that robotic systems are safely deployed across all industries.&#8221;</p>
<p>We’ve seen a fair bit of investment excitement around robotics in the past year, owing to increased interest in automation during the pandemic. Fort is well-positioned in that respect, with a solution aimed a fairly wide range of different verticals within the category.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MrBeast&#8217;s management company is getting into the venture business.</p>
<p><a href="https://nightmedia.co/">Night Media</a>, the six-year-old, Dallas-based multimedia talent management company, is closing a debut fund with $20 million in capital commitments from the powerful family-friendly online influencers it manages, along with other social media stars.</p>
<p>The idea, says Night Media CEO Reed Duchscher, is to write initial checks of up to $300,000 into three categories: consumer-facing startups; gaming startups, especially those centered around user-generated content; and the creator economy, including startups supporting the creator economy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The last is a world that Duchscher knows particularly well.</p>
<p>A native North Dakotan who was a wide receiver for North Dakota State University, Duchscher was working for a sports agency after graduating when he stumbled across a comedy group online called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/DudePerfect">Dude Perfect</a>. He so loved their work that he reached out to better understand who its members are and how they made money; within months, Duchscher struck out on his own to work full-time with the group and seize on what appeared to be a big opportunity.</p>
<p>It was a savvy move. While Night Media no longer works with Dude Perfect, it now manages 16 other top influencer groups, with YouTube stars that include ZHC (19.7 million subscribers), Preston (15.6 million), Matt Stonie (13.7 million), Unspeakable (10.8 million), Azzyland (13.3 million), Typical Gamer (11.4 million) and Carter Sharer (7.6 million).</p>
<p>The crown jewel of the portfolio, so to speak, is MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson and who has amassed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MrBeast6000">55 million</a> subscribers on YouTube. He posts two to three videos each month that routinely rack up at least 30 million views. In a Bloomberg piece in December about Donaldson, famed filmmaker Casey Neistat said of him: &#8220;He<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-22/who-is-mrbeast-meet-youtube-s-top-creator-of-2020"> lives on a different planet</a> than the rest of the YouTube world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some might settle for that level of success. Duchscher &#8212; who met Donaldson after sending him a direct message on Twitter &#8212; has instead been helping Donaldson and his other clients think about next steps.</p>

<p>Last year, toward that end, Night Media created a venture studio to incubate companies that its stars can help shape and grow. One of those efforts is MrBeastBurger, wherein Donaldson has partnered with 300 ghost kitchens around the country to sell so-called Beast Burgers and other items that can be ordered through a <a href="https://mrbeastburger.com/">dedicated app</a>. Donaldson has also put his stamp on the second iteration of a game called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/3/21312701/mrbeast-finger-app-competition-stream-winner-final-four-prize-youtube-mschf">Finger on the App</a>.</p>
<p>Asked if either the food brand or the app might be open to follow-on funding, Duchscher suggests that&#8217;s not necessarily the plan for the startups in the venture studio, though they are open to outside funding &#8220;depending on what we&#8217;d do with all that capital.&#8221; Venture-type investment, he adds, could create unnecessary &#8220;complexity&#8221; in some cases.</p>
<p>At the same time, Night Media&#8217;s talent <em>is</em> interested in learning, molding and capitalizing from the trends impacting their industry. Enter the new venture fund, which could be the start of a much bigger business eventually.</p>
<p>Indeed, though a professional investor is joining the outfit this spring, Duchscher has himself been running the show and spending time with &#8220;people in the Valley and L.A. who have been in industry for 20 years and been through multiple funds and financial crises&#8221; in order to learn more about institutional investing. He cites Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Venture Partners, for example, as firms that are already sending him deal flow.</p>
<p>As for whether he&#8217;s also receiving advice from celebrity investors on the startup scene, Duchscher says there&#8217;s less of that, though he adds he has talked quite a bit with Ashton Kutcher&#8217;s Sound Ventures and even pulled the firm into a few deals, including <a href="https://playbackbone.com/">Backbone</a>, a company that makes a sleek <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/with-backing-from-mr-beast-and-nadeshot-backbone-one-could-finally-crack-competitive-mobile-gaming/">game controller for iPhones</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of roughly a dozen startups that Night Media has helped fund to date. Another bet is a rewards app that pays users in bitcoin called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/22/lolli-launches-to-give-you-free-bitcoin-while-you-shop/">Lolli</a> and which is also backed by Craft Ventures and famed talent agent Guy Oseary. Night Media also invested in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/pearpop-lets-tiktok-celebrities-monetize-by-sharing-shoutouts-and-screentime-with-fans/">Pearpop</a>, a startup that invites fans to bid for shared screen time with their favorite TikTok. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/15/italic-launches-its-marketplace-where-you-can-buy-affordable-luxury-goods-from-top-manufacturers/">Italic</a>, a marketplace that invites shoppers to buy luxury products directly from the manufacturers behind top brands, is a portfolio company, too.</p>

<p>All have agreed to work with Night Media in exchange for access to its creators and their know-how &#8212; assets that Duchscher believes gives the outfit an edge that most VCs can&#8217;t offer.</p>
<p>Whether it all leads to a stronger focus on venture capital down the road is the question, and Duchscher isn&#8217;t spending much energy on it right now, he suggests. &#8220;It would depend on fund one and how quickly it gets deployed,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to raise because we can. That&#8217;s never been the way we think or operate.&#8221;</p>
<p>He has more pressing concerns, in any case. A big part of his job is figuring out what to do with inbound interest in his clients, and there&#8217;s far more demand right now than there is inventory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Usually, people want to work with a specific creator,&#8221; he notes, and there are only so many hours in the day.</p>

<p>Sarah Perez <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">took an in-depth look at the Shorts experience,</a> noting that it&#8217;s pretty similar to TikTok while lacking some key features, such as intelligent sound syncing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.substack.com">Substack</a> has attracted a number of high-profile writers to its newsletter platform — and it&#8217;s not a secret that the venture-backed startup has lured some of them with sizable payments.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/04/is-substack-the-media-future-we-want">a New Yorker article</a> late last year identified several writers (Anne Helen Petersen, Matthew Yglesias) who’d accepted “substantial” advances, and others (Robert Christgau, Alison Roman) who’d started Substack newsletters without striking deals with the company.</p>
<p>However, a number of writers publishing via Substack have begun arguing that this strategy makes the company seem less like a technology platform and more like a media company (a familiar debate around Facebook and other online giants) — or at the very least, like a technology platform that also makes editorial decisions subject to scrutiny and criticism.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last week, the writer Jude Ellison Sady Doyle <a href="https://doyles.substack.com/p/in-queers-we-trust-all-others-pay">pointed to writers</a> like Yglesias, Glenn Greenwald and Freddie deBoer (several of whom departed <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/substack-and-medias-groupthink-problem/617102/">larger</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/business/media/glenn-greenwald-leaving-intercept.html">publications</a>, supposedly turning to Substack for greater editorial independence) and suggested that the platform has become “famous for giving massive advances [ … ] to people who actively hate trans people and women, argue ceaselessly against our civil rights, and in many cases, have a public history of directly, viciously abusing trans people and/or cis women in their industry.”</p>
<p>Doyle initially said that they would continue publishing via Substack but would not charge a subscription fee to any readers who (like Doyle) identify as trans. Later, they added an update saying they&#8217;d be moving to a different platform called <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a>.</p>

<p>Science journalist and science fiction writer <a href="https://thehypothesis.substack.com/p/heres-why-substacks-scam-worked-so">Annalee Newitz wrote yesterday</a> that they would be leaving the platform as well. As part of their farewell, they described Substack as a “scam”: “For all we know, every single one of Substack’s top newsletters is supported by money from Substack. Until Substack reveals who exactly is on its payroll, its promises that anyone can make money on a newsletter are tainted.”</p>
<p>Substack has responded with two posts of its own. In the first,<a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers"> published last week</a>, co-founder Hamish McKenzie outlined the details of what the company calls its Substack Pro program — it offers select writers an advance payment for their first year on the platform, then keeps 85% of the writers&#8217; subscription revenue. After that year, there’s no guaranteed payment, but writers get to keep 90% of their revenue. (The company also offers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/substack-launches-defender-a-program-offering-legal-support-to-independent-writers/">legal support</a> and healthcare stipends.)</p>
<p>“We see these deals as business decisions, not editorial ones,” McKenzie wrote. &#8220;We don’t commission or edit stories. We don’t hire writers, or manage them. The writers, not Substack, are the owners. No one writes <em>for</em> Substack — they write for their own publications.”</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/substack-is-for-independent-writers">The second post</a> (bylined by McKenzie and his co-founders Chris Best and Jairaj Sethi) provides additional details about who’s in the program — more than half women, more than one-third people of color, diverse viewpoints but “none that can be reasonably construed as anti-trans” — without actually naming names.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FX0vbs8IPb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/the-dispatch-substack-1-million-revenue/">The Dispatch, a news organization built on Substack, passes $1M in annual revenue</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Dispatch, a news organization built on Substack, passes $1M in annual revenue&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/the-dispatch-substack-1-million-revenue/embed/#?secret=FX0vbs8IPb" data-secret="FX0vbs8IPb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“So far, the small number of writers who have chosen to share their deals — coupled with some wrong assumptions about who might be part of the program — has created a distorted perception of the overall makeup of the group, leading to incorrect inferences about Substack’s business strategy,” the Substack founders wrote.</p>
<p>As for whether those writers are being held to any standards, the founders said, “We will continue to require all writers to abide by <a href="https://substack.com/content">Substack&#8217;s content guidelines</a>, which guard against harassment and threats. But we will also stick to a hands-off approach to censorship, as laid out in <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/substacks-view-of-content-moderation">our statement about our content moderation philosophy</a>.”</p>
<p>Greenwald, for his part, <a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1372577432310583299">dismissed</a> the criticism as &#8220;petty Substack censors&#8221; whose position boils down to, &#8220;because you refuse to remove from your platform the writers I hate who have built a very large readership of their own, I&#8217;m taking myself and my couple of dozen readers elsewhere in protest.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when I reached out to Newitz (a friend of mine) via email, they told me that the key issue is transparency.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Substack won&#8217;t tell us who they are paying, we can&#8217;t figure out who on the site has grown their audience organically, and who is getting juiced,&#8221; Newitz said. &#8220;It&#8217;s blatantly misleading for people who are trying to figure out whether they can make money on the platform. Plus, keeping their Pro list secret means we can&#8217;t verify Substack&#8217;s claims about how its staff writers are on ‘all sides’ of the political spectrum.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Why would Snowflake give up such a powerful tool a mere six months after it went public? We decided to look at the notion of dual-class shares and why Snowflake may have been willing to let them go.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snowflake <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014721000021/snow-20210301.htm">announced</a> earlier this month that it would give up its dual-class shareholder structure, a corporate governance setup that often gives founders and executives superior voting rights, typically involving 10 times as many votes for their own shares as others receive. The mechanism can enable founders to maintain control despite later dilution and may sometimes even grant ironclad control to an individual in perpetuity.</p>
<p>For many companies, these supervoting shares represent a highly powerful tool, allowing founders to have their <a href="https://chairmanofboard.com/dual-class-shares/">cake and eat it, too</a> — to go public and receive the advantages of being a public company while limiting the power of external shareholders to influence how they run the company once it floats.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Some founders and their investors argue that these preferred shares protect them from the short-term whims of the market, but the perspective isn&#8217;t universally accepted.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Some founders and their investors argue that <a href="https://foundercentric.org/research/2019/4/28/andreessen-horowitz-limit-dont-ban-dual-class-share-structures">these preferred shares protect them</a> from the short-term whims of the market, but the perspective isn&#8217;t universally accepted. Dual-class shares <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2019/06/28/dual-class-shares-governance-risks-and-company-performance/">are a controversial governance structure</a>, and some wonder if they are setting up an unfair playing field by allowing a cabal to wield outsized power.</p>
<p>Why would Snowflake give up such a powerful tool a mere six months after it went public? We decided to look at the notion of dual-class shares and why Snowflake may have been willing to let them go.</p>
<h2>Snowflake&#8217;s decision</h2>
<p>If one of the primary purposes of dual-class shares is to consolidate CEO power, then perhaps Snowflake felt they weren&#8217;t necessary, given the history of CEO-shuffling at the company. While Snowflake&#8217;s founders are still part of the organization, they hired Sutter Hill investor Mike Speiser to be their first CEO, followed by former Microsoft exec Bob Muglia before finally bringing in veteran CEO Frank Slootman to take their company public.</p>
<p>Without an all-powerful CEO founder in place, perhaps the company felt that supervoting shares weren&#8217;t necessary. Regardless, Snowflake CFO Mike Scarpelli framed the move as a decision that works for all parties when he announced that his company would abandon the special shares during its earnings call earlier this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, we announced that on March 1st, 2021, our Class B shareholders in accordance with our governing documents converted all of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock, eliminating the dual-class structure of our common stock and ensuring that each share has an equal vote. We view this as operationally beneficial to the company and our shareholders,&#8221; Scarpelli said <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/04/snowflake-inc-snow-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcrip/">during the call</a>.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA doesn&#8217;t just let anyone launch whatever they want to space without checking in with the agency about potential impacts to its own assets on orbit, including the International Space Station (ISS). The agency has a standard set of guidelines around so-called &#8220;Conjunction Assessment,&#8221; which is basically to determine the risk that a close approach between in-space objects might occur, which in turn could potentially result in a collision. This assessment determines when and where something flies, as you might expect.</p>
<p>Today, NASA published a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa-spacex_starlink_agreement_final.pdf">new agreement</a> between itself and SpaceX that goes above and beyond its standard Conjunction Assessment practices. The special agreement, which exists under the mandate of the Space Act that allows NASA to work with any company in order to fulfill its mandate, is defined as a &#8220;nonreimbursable&#8221; one, or just one in which no money changes hands, which is designed to benefit both parties involved.</p>
<p>It effectively lays out that because SpaceX operates Starlink, which is the largest existing on-orbit constellation of spacecraft, and which is growing at a rapid pace, and because each of these is equipped with the ability to maneuver itself autonomously in response to mission parameters, there needs to exist a deeper ongoing partnership between NASA and SpaceX for conjunction avoidance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Accordingly, the agreement outlines the ways in which communication and information sharing between NASA and SpaceX will exceed what has been typically been expected. For NASA&#8217;s part, it&#8217;ll be providing detailed and accurate info about its planned missions in advance to SpaceX so that they can use that to properly program Starlink&#8217;s automated avoidance measures whenever a mission is happening where NASA assets might cross paths with the constellation. It&#8217;ll also be working directly with SpaceX on improving its ability to assess and avoid any incidents, and will be providing technical support on how SpaceX might better mitigate &#8220;photometric brightness,&#8221; or the reflectivity of its Starlink spacecraft.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="B5lmh7m7Tz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/in-space-manufacturing-could-prompt-more-startups-to-reach-for-the-stars/">In-space manufacturing could prompt more startups to reach for the stars</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In-space manufacturing could prompt more startups to reach for the stars&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/in-space-manufacturing-could-prompt-more-startups-to-reach-for-the-stars/embed/#?secret=B5lmh7m7Tz" data-secret="B5lmh7m7Tz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, SpaceX will be responsible for ensuring its Starlink satellites take &#8220;evasive action&#8221; to &#8220;mitigate close approaches and avoid collisions with all NASA assets.&#8221; It&#8217;ll also be required to provide time frame &#8220;cut-outs&#8221; for periods when Starlink satellites aren&#8217;t able to employ their collision avoidance, which mostly occurs during the phase right after they&#8217;re launched when they&#8217;re still being activated and put into their target orbits.</p>
<p>Another key point in the agreement is that SpaceX plan Starlink launches so they&#8217;re at minimum either 5 km above or below the highest and lowest points of the International Space Station&#8217;s orbit as it makes its way around the Earth. Finally, SpaceX is also expected to share its own analysis of the effectiveness of its satellite dimming techniques, so the agency can adjust its own guidance on the subject accordingly.</p>
<p>The full agreement is embedded below, but the main takeaway is that NASA clearly wants SpaceX to be a better low-Earth partner and citizen as the size of its constellation pushes past the 1,200 mark, on track to grow to around 1,500 or more by year&#8217;s end. Also, NASA&#8217;s putting a lot of trust and responsibility in SpaceX&#8217;s hands &#8212; basically it&#8217;s laying out that Starlink&#8217;s built-in autonomous capabilities can avoid any really danger that might arise. The way NASA has structured this document also leaves open the possibility that it could repurpose it for other constellation operators &#8212; a growing need, given the number of companies working on networks of low-Earth orbit spacecraft.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a> has been one of a handful of NFT marketplaces to explode in popularity in recent weeks as collectors wade into the trading of nonfungible tokens on the blockchain. While new startups have been popping up everyday, platforms that launched in crypto&#8217;s earlier times are receiving rampant attention from investors who see this wave of excitement for cryptocurrencies and tokens as much different than the ones that preceded it.</p>
<p>Today, the startup announced that it&#8217;s closed a $23 million round of funding led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from a laundry list of angels and firms including Naval Ravikant, Mark Cuban, Alexis Ohanian, Dylan Field and Linda Xie.</p>
<p>OpenSea launched back in 2017, announcing a $2 million round a few months later from Founders Fund and a few crypto centric firms. At the time CryptoKitties mania was most of what Ethereum had to offer and early NFT projects were being slowly embraced by a community that was enthusiastic but more curious than anything.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fast forward to 2021 and NFTs are certainly having a moment, and while the specific shades of that moment may be heavily focused on high-dollar artwork sales from traditional auction houses or NFT memes being tweeted out by Elon Musk, proponents see a future for the tokens that upends the economics of content creation and influence on the internet. The enthusiasm accompanies a months-long rally in the value of cryptocurrencies themselves that have taken Ethereum and Bitcoin to multiples of previous all-time highs.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="k1oQDGJLp3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/the-nft-market-is-just-getting-started-but-where-is-it-headed/">The NFT market is just getting started, but where is it headed?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The NFT market is just getting started, but where is it headed?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/the-nft-market-is-just-getting-started-but-where-is-it-headed/embed/#?secret=k1oQDGJLp3" data-secret="k1oQDGJLp3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The market for digital goods expanding widely may depend heavily on further adoption among gaming giants and larger media organizations, but early on there&#8217;s hope that digital-first creators can use these marketplaces to connect more directly with fans and begin to bypass the massive platforms they depend on now.</p>
<p>There are still some early hiccups as the tech develops. While Ethereum has committed to moving from its energy-intensive proof-of-work standard to a more efficient proof-of-stake one eventually, the existing structure has been far from efficient, which has opened many of the early NFT artists to criticism surrounding climate change concerns and whether the stakeholders in crypto tokens should be prioritizing environmental worries over the specific challenges of certain proofs. In February, OpenSea <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/tezos-nfts-are-coming-to-opensea/">announced</a> support for more efficient Tezos-based NFTs.</p>
<p>A more nebulous challenge for marketplaces like OpenSea may be cutting through the noise of speculation and providing a marketplace for more users that are actually buying to own, an especially difficult proposition given the breakneck pace of growth for the digital currencies being used to purchase the digital goods themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian, the EV startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/rivian-raises-2-65-billion-in-new-capital-as-it-pushes-towards-production-of-its-electric-pickup/">backed by Amazon</a>, Cox Automotive and T. Rowe Price, plans to install more than 10,000 chargers by the end of 2023. The network will have a dual purpose: quickly power its electric vehicle models with fast chargers installed along highways and provide Level 2 chargers at further afield locations next to parks, trailheads and other adventurous destinations.</p>
<p>The company said Thursday that its so-called Rivian Adventure Network will include more than 3,500 DC fast chargers at over 600 sites, which will only be accessible to owners of its electric vehicles. Each site will have multiple chargers and located on highways and main roads, often by cafes and shops, the company said in a blog post Thursday.</p>
<p>Rivian is also installing thousands of &#8220;waypoint&#8221; Level 2 AC chargers throughout the United States and Canada. These waypoint chargers will have a 11.5 kW charging speed, which should be able add up to 25 miles of range every hour for its R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. The waypoint chargers will be strategically located along and near routes that Rivian customers are likely to take. They will be found at shopping centers restaurants, hotels, campsites and parks. The first of these waypoints, which will be open to the public and accessible to all electric vehicle brands with a J1772 plug, are being installed at all 42 Colorado State Parks. Each park will have two Rivian Waypoints each, with installation starting in July, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The decision to add this second layer of electric vehicle chargers is a direct appeal to Rivian’s customer base and one required to build confidence in the brand and electric vehicles, in general, Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/rivian-is-building-its-own-ev-charging-network-but-with-an-adventurous-twist/">told TechCrunch</a> late last year during a wide-ranging interview about charging, batteries and automated driving.</p>
<p>Rivian&#8217;s approach is similar to Tesla with a few distinct differences. Tesla has built a proprietary network of more than 20,000 Superchargers, which are typically located next to highways and busy commuter corridors, and destination chargers installed at high-end hotels, restaurants and other spots an owner of a Model 3, Model S, Model Y or Model X might visit.</p>
<p>Rivian&#8217;s waypoint chargers serve the same purpose — albeit different kinds of locations — to the Tesla destination chargers. However, unlike Tesla&#8217;s chargers, Rivian&#8217;s waypoint site are open to the public and use the J1772 plug, a North American standard for electrical connectors for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>As part of its announcement, Rivian shared an image of a map of its fast chargers, indicating where they will be located. The map is not yet interactive, making it difficult to provide exact locations, but it appears that there are fast chargers located near Grand Canyon National Park as well as Zion National Park in Utah.</p>

<p>Rivian owners will be able to locate the waypoints as well as its branded fast chargers through the vehicle&#8217;s navigation and the accompanying app. Drivers will also be able to use the app or in-car system to and monitor charge status.</p>
<p>Rivian&#8217;s vehicles are equipped with a direct current connector used for rapid charging called Combined Charging System (CCS). CCS is an open international standard that in recent years has gained popularity in Europe and North America. This means that Rivian trucks and SUVs can also use any third-party CCS charging station without having to use an adapter.</p>
<p>The company indicated that the entire charging network will be powered by 100% renewable energy. That doesn&#8217;t mean that there will be a solar panel and energy storage system. Rivian clarified to TechCrunch at there will not be solar or wind on site. Instead, the 100% renewable energy goal will be achieved through partnerships with electricity providers. Rivian said it will use wind and solar wherever possible along with Renewable Energy Certificates to offset other power sources.</p>
<p>Building out such a large network will require capital, which Rivian hasn&#8217;t had trouble accessing. Rivian announced in January that it had raised $2.65 billion in a round led by funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Fidelity Management and Research Company, Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Coatue and D1 Capital Partners as well as several other existing and new investors also participated, which pushed Rivian&#8217;s valuation to $27.6 billion, according to a person familiar with the investment round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An artificial retina would be an enormous boon to the many people with visual impairments, and the possibility is creeping closer to reality year by year. One of the latest advancements takes a different and very promising approach, using tiny dots that convert light to electricity, and virtual reality has helped show that it could be a viable path forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/retinal-implants-can-give-artificial-vision-to-the/">These photovoltaic retinal prostheses</a> come from the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, where Diego Ghezzi has been working on the idea for several years now.</p>
<p>Early retinal prosthetics were created decades ago, and the basic idea is as follows: A camera outside the body (on a pair of glasses, for instance) sends a signal over a wire to a tiny microelectrode array, which consists of many tiny electrodes that pierce the nonfunctioning retinal surface and stimulate the working cells directly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problems with this are mainly that powering and sending data to the array requires a wire running from outside the eye in — generally speaking a &#8220;don&#8217;t&#8221; when it comes to prosthetics and the body in general. The array itself is also limited in the number of electrodes it can have by the size of each, meaning for many years the effective resolution in the best case scenario was on the order of a few dozen or hundred &#8220;pixels.&#8221; (The concept doesn&#8217;t translate directly because of the way the visual system works.)</p>
<p>Ghezzi&#8217;s approach obviates both these problems with the use of photovoltaic materials, which turn light into an electric current. It&#8217;s not so different from what happens in a digital camera, except instead of recording the charge as in image, it sends the current into the retina like the powered electrodes did. There&#8217;s no need for a wire to relay power or data to the implant, because both are provided by the light shining on it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127149" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epfl-implant-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127149" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2127149" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epfl-implant-2.jpg" alt="Researcher Diego Ghezzi holds a contact lens with photovoltaic dots on it." width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epfl-implant-2.jpg 2216w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epfl-implant-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epfl-implant-2.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epfl-implant-2.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epfl-implant-2.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epfl-implant-2.jpg?resize=1536,862 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epfl-implant-2.jpg?resize=2048,1150 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/epfl-implant-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127149" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alain Herzog / EPFL</p></div></p>
<p>In the case of the EPFL prosthesis, there are thousands of tiny photovoltaic dots, which would in theory be illuminated by a device outside the eye sending light in according to what it detects from a camera. Of course, it&#8217;s still an incredibly difficult thing to engineer. The other part of the setup would be a pair of glasses or goggles that both capture an image and project it through the eye onto the implant.</p>
<p>We first heard of this approach back in 2018, and things have changed somewhat since then, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-021-00133-2">as a new paper documents</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We increased the number of pixels from about 2,300 to 10,500,&#8221; explained Ghezzi in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;So now it is difficult to see them individually and they look like a continuous film.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course when those dots are pressed right up against the retina it&#8217;s a different story. After all, that&#8217;s only 100&#215;100 pixels or so if it were a square — not exactly high definition. But the idea isn&#8217;t to replicate human vision, which may be an impossible task to begin with, let alone realistic for anyone&#8217;s first shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technically it is possible to make pixel smaller and denser,&#8221; Ghezzi explained. &#8220;The problem is that the current generated decreases with the pixel area.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127161" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127161" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2127161 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg" alt="Image showing a close-up of the photovoltaic dots on the retinal implant, labeled as being about 80 microns across each." width="1024" height="327" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg 1404w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg?resize=150,48 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg?resize=300,96 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg?resize=768,246 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg?resize=680,217 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/implant-pixels.jpg?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127161" class="wp-caption-text">Current decreases with pixel size, and pixel size isn&#8217;t exactly large to begin with. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ghezzi et al</p></div></p>
<p>So the more you add, the tougher it is to make it work, and there&#8217;s also the risk (which they tested) that two adjacent dots will stimulate the same network in the retina. But too few and the image created may not be intelligible to the user. 10,500 <em>sounds</em> like a lot, and it <em>may</em> be enough — but the simple fact is that there&#8217;s no data to support that. To start on that the team turned to what may seem like an unlikely medium: VR.</p>
<p>Because the team can&#8217;t exactly do a &#8220;test&#8221; installation of an experimental retinal implant on people to see if it works, they needed another way to tell whether the dimensions and resolution of the device would be sufficient for certain everyday tasks like recognizing objects and letters.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127141" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127141" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2127141" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg" alt="A digitally rendered street scene and distorted monochrome versions below showing various ways of representing it via virtual phosphors." width="1024" height="747" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg 1725w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg?resize=768,560 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg?resize=680,496 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg?resize=1536,1120 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-1.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127141" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jacob Thomas Thorn et al</p></div></p>
<p>To do this, they put people in VR environments that were dark except for little simulated &#8220;phosphors,&#8221; the pinpricks of light they expect to create by stimulating the retina via the implant; Ghezzi likened what people would see to a constellation of bright, shifting stars. They varied the number of phosphors, the area they appear over, and the length of their illumination or &#8220;tail&#8221; when the image shifted, asking participants how well they could perceive things like a word or scene.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127142" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127142" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2127142" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg" alt="The word &quot;AGREE&quot; rendered in various ways with virtual phosphors." width="1024" height="730" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg 1725w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg?resize=768,548 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg?resize=680,485 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg?resize=1536,1095 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/phosphors-2.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127142" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jacob Thomas Thorn et al</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/abb5bc">Their primary finding</a> was that the most important factor was visual angle — the overall size of the area where the image appears. Even a clear image is difficult to understand if it only takes up the very center of your vision, so even if overall clarity suffers it&#8217;s better to have a wide field of vision. The robust analysis of the visual system in the brain intuits things like edges and motion even from sparse inputs.</p>
<p>This demonstration showed that the implant&#8217;s parameters are theoretically sound and the team can start working toward human trials. That&#8217;s not something that can happen in a hurry, and while this approach is very promising compared with earlier, wired ones, it will still be several years even in the best case scenario before it&#8217;s possible it could be made widely available. Still, the very prospect of a working retinal implant of this type is an exciting one and we&#8217;ll be following it closely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google this week announced its was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">cutting the commissions</a> it charges Android app developers who publish on its Google Play marketplace, following a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/developers-can-now-enroll-in-apples-small-business-program-for-reduced-app-store-fees/">similar move by Apple last year</a> aimed at fending off antitrust claims. According to Google&#8217;s own estimates, 99% of its developers who sell goods and services would see their fees cut in half, as a result of the move that reduces the 30% commission to 15% on the first million dollars a developer earns. Now, data shared by App Annie helps to further illustrate the distribution of earnings on the Google Play Store, as well as how that compares with Apple&#8217;s counterpart.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">According to App Annie, the vast majority (97.9%) of Google Play publishers made less than $1 million in annual consumer spend in 2020, which allows them to qualify for this reduced commission. But it&#8217;s worth noting that</span> the way Google has implemented its new policy is different from Apple, as it will reduce the commission on the &#8220;first&#8221; $1 million in revenue made during the year &#8212; not make $1 million the threshold that triggers a commission increase, like Apple is doing. That means more developers could benefit from Google&#8217;s policy change.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see how few developers across Google Play will ever have to worry about the higher commission bracket. The majority are seeing very small returns from their paid downloads, in-app purchases or subscription offering, the data indicates. This has been an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">ongoing trend for Android apps</a>, in fact, reflecting Android&#8217;s traction in emerging markets where consumers don&#8217;t often spend on apps, which has forced many developers to lean on ads in addition to in-app purchases to generate revenues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2127053" style="width: 639px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127053" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2127053" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-12.18.40-PM.jpg?w=629" alt="" width="629" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-12.18.40-PM.jpg 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-12.18.40-PM.jpg?resize=139,150 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-12.18.40-PM.jpg?resize=278,300 278w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-12.18.40-PM.jpg?resize=768,830 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-12.18.40-PM.jpg?resize=629,680 629w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-12.18.40-PM.jpg?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2127053" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>According to App Annie, 85,381 Google Play developers in 2020 generated less than $100,000 in consumer spend. 3,404 generated $100,000 to $500,000.</p>
<p>Only 568 developers began to even near the $1 million figure, with consumer spend of $500,000 to $750,000 in 2020. Then there were just 359 developers making $750,000 up to that first million.</p>
<p>The groups that would actually see the 30% commission apply to some of their sales were very small.</p>
<p>Just 215 developers saw consumer spend of $1 million to $1.25 million. Only 512 developers made between $1.25 million and $2 million. And then there&#8217;s the most profitable group, where 1,308 developers made over $2 million in revenue in 2020.</p>
<p>This distribution pattern where the largest group of developers is making under $100,000 and a sliver of the market was pulling in larger figures, including the over $2 million bracket, was similar to Apple&#8217;s App Store in 2020. But in Apple&#8217;s case, it sees more developers earning a decent income in the other sub-$1-million brackets than Google Play does.</p>
<p>The reason why Apple may have decided to charge a higher commission for developers making over $1 million is also reflected in these charts. Apple simply has more developers who qualify by making over $1 million per year. (On iOS, 3,611 developers make $1 million or more on the App Store versus 2,035 developers on Google Play).</p>

<p>In other words, these policy changes help a large majority of mobile app developers by allowing them to take home more money, and they give Apple and Google a good way to demonstrate to regulators that they&#8217;re not wielding their market power against the &#8220;little guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, App Annie says that publishers making up to $1 million in consumer spend only comprised 5% of total Google Play consumer spend in 2020, even though 94% of Google Play apps offer some sort of in-app purchase mechanism.</p>
<p>But ultimately, the new policies have far less impact on the revenue the platforms themselves are pulling in via commissions. However, Google&#8217;s rule makes it simpler and more fair for developers who are still trying to grow their businesses despite crossing the $1 million threshold.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Whether it's bundling bookings, payments or just trip planning, startups are offering new mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) products intended to make transit agencies the backbone of urban mobility.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, St. Louis Metro Transit was struggling to keep customers. Uber and Lyft, along with dockless shared bikes and scooters, had flooded streets, causing ridership to fall more than 7% in a single year.</p>
<p>The agency didn&#8217;t try to fight for attention. Instead, it embraced its competitors.</p>
<p>Metro Transit dropped its internal trip-planning app, which had been developed with the Trapeze Group and directed riders to Transit, a private third-party app that offers mapping and real-time transit data in more than 200 cities. That app also included micromobility and ride-hailing information, allowing customers to not just look up bus schedules, but see how they might get to and from stops &#8212; or ignore the bus altogether.</p>
<p>The following year, Metro Transit partnered with mobile ticketing company Masabi and added a payment option on some bus routes. Now, the agency is planning an all-in-one app — via third-party providers Transit and Masabi — where customers could plan and book end-to-end trips across trains, buses, bikes, scooters and taxis.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we do best is transporting large volumes of people on vehicles and managing mass transit,&#8221; said Metro Transit executive director Jessica Mefford-Miller. &#8220;On the software side, there are a lot of players out there doing great stuff that can help us meet our customers where they are and make trip planning as easy as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>St. Louis Metro Transit isn&#8217;t an outlier. As transit agencies seek to win back riders, a flurry of platforms &#8212; some backed by giants like Uber, Intel and BMW &#8212; are offering new technology partnerships. Whether it&#8217;s bundling bookings, payments or just trip planning, startups are selling these mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings as a lifeline to make transit agencies the backbone of urban mobility.</p>

			Whether it&#8217;s bundling bookings, payments or just trip planning, startups are selling mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings as a lifeline to make transit agencies the backbone of urban mobility.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Third-party platforms have become more appealing to transit agencies as they scramble to keep buses, trains and rail full of customers. According to the <a href="https://www.apta.com/wp-content/uploads/APTA-2020-Fact-Book.pdf">American Public Transportation Association</a> (APTA), ridership and total miles traveled has declined since 2014, including a 2.5% drop from 2017 to 2018. The COVID-19 pandemic could accelerate this trend as more people continue working from home or shy away from crowding into buses and trains.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is like Expedia, the idea of seeing multiple airlines in one place to comparison shop,&#8221; said Regina Clewlow, CEO of transportation management firm Populus. &#8220;A lot of operators are looking at the question of whether that would give them more rides.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that the private growth could come at a cost, potentially injecting private concerns into what should be a public good, Metro Transit&#8217;s Mefford-Miller cautioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we let the market handle this planning on its own, a company might only do it for someone with a digital device or a bank account or only help people who don&#8217;t need special accommodation,&#8221; Mefford-Miller said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we have as an underpinning an equitable and accessible system. It&#8217;s the underpinning before we choose any tools we use.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The players</h2>
<p>Amid the swarm of new startups there are a few giants. One of the biggest established players is <a href="https://www.cubic.com/">Cubic Corp.</a>, a San Diego-based defense and public transportation company. The firm already controls payments and back-end software for hundreds of transit agencies, including in Chicago, New York and San Francisco, and in January launched a <a href="https://www.cubic.com/news-events/news/cubic-announces-global-launch-umo-platforms-enhance-urban-mobility">suite of new products</a> under the brand name Umo to expand their offerings.</p>
<p>The package includes a customer-facing multimodal app, a fare collection platform, a contactless payment system, a rewards program, a behind-the-scenes management platform and a MaaS marketplace for public and private offerings. Mick Spiers, general manager of Umo, said the goal is to offer a &#8220;connected, integrated journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re uniquely placed as an independent, trusted third party that can be the data broker for a journey focused around the needs of the user,&#8221; Spiers added. &#8220;The journey we create has no commercial interest for us.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The explosion in productivity software amid a broader remote work boom has been one of the pandemic&#8217;s clearest tech impacts. But learning to use a dozen new programs while having to decipher which data is hosted where can sometimes seem to have an adverse effect on worker productivity. It&#8217;s all time that users can take for granted, even when carrying out common tasks like navigating to the calendar to view more info to click a link to open the browser to redirect to the native app to open a Zoom call.</p>
<p><a href="https://slapdash.com/">Slapdash</a> is aiming to carve a new niche out for itself among workplace software tools, pushing a desire for peak performance to the forefront with a product that shaves seconds off each instance where a user needs to find data hosted in a cloud app or carry out an action. While most of the integration-heavy software suites to emerge during the remote work boom have focused on promoting visibility or re-skinning workflows across the tangled weave of SaaS apps, Slapdash founder Ivan Kanevski hopes that the company&#8217;s efforts to engineer a quicker path to information will push tech workers to integrate another tool into their workflow.</p>

<p>The team tells TechCrunch that they&#8217;ve raised $3.7 million in seed funding from investors that include <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">S28 Capital, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Quiet Capital, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Quarry Ventures, UP2398 and </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Twenty Two Ventures. Angels participating in the round include co-founders at companies like Patreon, Docker and Zynga.</span></p>

<p>Kanevski says the team sought to emulate the success of popular apps like Superhuman, which have pushed low-latency command line interface navigation while emulating some of the sleek internal tools used at companies like Facebook, where he spent nearly six years as a software engineer.</p>
<p>Slapdash&#8217;s command line widget can be pulled up anywhere, once installed, with a quick keyboard shortcut. From there, users can search through a laundry list of indexable apps including Slack, Zoom, Jira and about 20 others. Beyond command line access, users can create folders of files and actions inside the full desktop app or create their own keyboard shortcuts to quickly hammer out a task. The app is available on Mac, Windows, Linux and the web.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not trying to displace the applications that you connect to Slapdash,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You won&#8217;t see us, for example, building document editing, you won&#8217;t see us building project management, just because our sort of philosophy is that we&#8217;re a neutral platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company offers a free tier for users indexing up to five apps and creating 10 commands and spaces; any more than that and you level up into a $12 per month paid plan. Things look more customized for enterprise-wide pricing. As the team hopes to make the tool essential to startups, Kanevski sees the app&#8217;s hefty utility for individual users as a clear asset in scaling up.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you anticipate rolling this out to larger organizations, you would want the people that are using the software to have a blast with it,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We have quite a lot of confidence that even at this sort of individual atomic level, we built something pretty joyful and helpful.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shortly after Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/twitter-cropped-image-previews-test/">announced</a> it would begin testing a better way to display images on its app, it&#8217;s now doing the same for YouTube videos. According to a new <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1372592575849189381?s=20">post</a> on Twitter&#8217;s Support account, the company will today start testing a way to watch YouTube videos directly from your home timeline within the Twitter iOS app. That means you&#8217;ll be able to click and play a video without having to leave the conversation you&#8217;re currently viewing.</p>
<p>Before this change, YouTube videos wouldn&#8217;t show a preview on iOS, so you&#8217;d have to click the link to start watching. This would take you out of the conversation to another screen where you could play the video or tap again to open the YouTube iOS app, if you preferred.</p>
<p>Now, you&#8217;ll be able to scroll and watch videos without losing your place on the Twitter timeline.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Starting today on iOS, we’re testing a way to watch YouTube videos directly in your Home timeline, without leaving the conversation on Twitter. <a href="https://t.co/V4qzMJMEBs">pic.twitter.com/V4qzMJMEBs</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1372592575849189381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 18, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter says it&#8217;s using the YouTube iFrame Player API for this test, which will initially be live on iOS in the U.S., Japan, Canada and Saudi Arabia before rolling it out globally. It didn&#8217;t offer a time frame for when this would be available to all Twitter users.</p>
<p>The company had announced earlier this month it would be working toward a better media-viewing experience on its app, including for both sharing and viewing media, like photos and videos. With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/twitter-cropped-image-previews-test/">the photo preview test</a> launched to iOS and Android last week, Twitter is now giving users a more accurate preview of what images look like, for example. Before, it would crop images automatically &#8212; often hiding key portions of a photo.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Qdq0c6NOt2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/twitter-cropped-image-previews-test/">Twitter is testing better image previews and fewer cropped photos</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter is testing better image previews and fewer cropped photos&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/twitter-cropped-image-previews-test/embed/#?secret=Qdq0c6NOt2" data-secret="Qdq0c6NOt2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Twitter also recently <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1369680674672807940">announced</a> the ability for users to upload 4K images on both Android and iOS, accessible through a new feature in your &#8220;Data Usage&#8221; settings in the Twitter app.</p>
<p>These changes are not only welcome from a user annoyance perspective, they&#8217;re also tied into Twitter&#8217;s newly announced ambitions to become a platform that serves creators. The company said it&#8217;s soon introducing a new subscription-based service<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/"> called &#8220;Super Follow&#8221;</a> that will allow creators to publish subscriber-only content on Twitter, like newsletters, deals and other exclusive content, which likely includes exclusive media. But in order to support creators, who often have their content spread across social platforms around the web, Twitter has to make the process of sharing that content &#8212; whether photos, videos or anything else &#8212; feel seamless and native to the app.</p>
<p>Twitter will likely have a few more updates on this front in the days and weeks to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Challenger banks continue to make significant advances in attracting customers away from the big incumbents by providing more modern, user-friendly tools to manage their money. Today, one of the trailblazers in this area, <a href="http://kuda.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kuda Technologies</a>, is announcing funding to continue building out its specific ambition: to provide a modern banking service for Africans and the African diaspora, or as co-founder and CEO Babs Ogundeyi describes them, &#8220;every African on the planet, wherever you are in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company, which currently offers mobile-first banking services in Nigeria, has picked up $25 million in a Series A being led by Valar Ventures, the firm co-founded and backed by Peter Thiel, with Target Global and other unnamed investors participating. This is the first time that Valar &#8212; which has <a href="https://valar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invested</a> in a number of fintech startups, including N26, TransferWise, Stash and, just in the last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/blockfi-lands-a-350m-series-d-at-3b-valuation-for-its-fast-growing-crypto-lending-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlockFi</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/crypto-exchange-bitpanda-closes-52m-series-a-from-valar-ventures-backed-by-peter-thiel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BitPanda</a> &#8212; has backed an African startup.</p>
<p>Kuda currently provides services for consumers to save and spend money, and it has recently introduced overdrafts (essentially revolving credit for individuals). Ogundeyi said in an interview that the plan is to use these new funds to continue expanding its credit offerings, to build out services for businesses, to add in more integrations and to move into more markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is coming on the heels of very strong growth for Kuda, which is co-headquartered in London and Lagos.</p>
<p>When we last wrote about the startup, four months ago, it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/nigerias-kuda-raises-10m-to-be-the-mobile-first-challenger-bank-for-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just closed a seed round of $10 million</a> led by Target Global. That was, at the time &#8212; and I think still is &#8212; the largest-ever seed round raised by a startup out of Africa, and thus as much of a milestone for the tech industry there as it was for Kuda itself.</p>
<p>At the time of the seed round, Kuda had registered 300,000 customers: now, that figure has more than doubled to 650,000, and tellingly, that base is spending more money through the Kuda app.</p>

<p>&#8220;In November we were doing about $500 million in transactions per month,&#8221; Ogundeyi said, for services like bill payments, card transactions and phone top-ups. &#8220;We closed February at $2.2 billion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuda, as we described in our profile of the company when covering its seed round, is following in the footsteps of a number of other so-called &#8220;neobanks&#8221;, building a suite of banking services with a more accessible user interface and a more modern approach: you interact with the bank using a mobile app, and in addition to basic banking services, it provides tools to help people manage their money more intelligently.</p>
<p>But Kuda is also different from many of these, specifically because it taps into some financial practices that are unique to its market.</p>
<p>As Ogundeyi describes it, most people who are employed by companies will have &#8220;salary accounts&#8221; at banks, where companies pay in a person&#8217;s wages on a regular basis. These will typically be at incumbent banks, but they do not offer the same ranges of services to customers. No mobile apps, no facilities to buy mobile top-ups or make other kinds of bill payments, no AI-based calculators to figure out your monthly spend and provide suggestions on how to manage your budget, and so on.</p>
<p>That has opened a gap in the market for others to provide those services in their place. Kuda&#8217;s deposits, Ogundeyi said, typically start as basic transfers that people make from those &#8220;salary accounts&#8221; elsewhere. These start out small, maybe 20% of a person&#8217;s wages, but as those users find themselves using Kuda&#8217;s payment and other tools more, they are increasing how much they transfer in each payment period.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the trust increases you’re naturally more comfortable having money with Kuda,&#8221; he said. The next stage from that will be people depositing money directly with Kuda. A small minority already do this, he added, although the startup &#8220;has a bit more work to do&#8221; to get more companies integrated into its platform. (This is one of the areas that will be developed with this latest round of funding.)</p>
<p>In turn, having more money in Kuda accounts is likely to spur another wave of services being turned on at the startup, such as loans with more competitive interest rates, because they will not just be based on how much money people have but also their spending histories on the platform. &#8220;We can offer loans to salaried customers instantly as long as their salary is with Kuda,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Much of this is being enabled because of how Kuda is built. A lot of challenger banks have tapped into a world of finance and banking APIs built by another wave of fintech startups, partnering with other banks to provide backend deposit and other services: their value-add is in building efficient customer service and tools to help people manage and borrow money in smarter ways.</p>
<p>Kuda, on the other hand, has its own microfinance banking license from the central bank of Nigeria. This means that on top of building those same money management services, Kuda can also issue<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> debit cards (in partnership with Visa and Mastercard), manage </span>p<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ayments and transfers, and build all of the services in the stack itself, including those salary account services and loans. (Kuda does have partnerships with incumbent banks, specifically Zenith Bank, Guaranteed Trust and Access Bank, for people to come in for physical deposits and withdrawals when needed.)</span></p>
<p>While the service is still only live in Nigeria, the &#8220;vision is still to serve all Africans in Africa as well as outside of it,&#8221; Ogundeyi said.</p>
<p>The first step of that will likely be Nigerians outside of Nigeria &#8212; most likely in the U.K., where Kuda already has a headquarters, and where it has a ready market: London alone has been estimated to be home to upwards of 1 million Nigerian immigrants and people of Nigerian descent (the number of U.K. residents actually born in Nigeria is considerably smaller, more like <a href="https://www.worldremit.com/en/stories/story/2019/10/29/nigerians-in-the-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200,000</a>: that is the diaspora at work).</p>
<p>He added that the startup is also at work on preparing for the next countries on the continent to expand its service, another area where this funding will go: &#8220;It will let us fast-track teams, on-the-ground operational teams,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The bigger picture is that the market for financial services targeting Africans has been on a significant upswing and so we will be seeing a lot more activity coming out of the region, not just from home-grown startups, but also out of other tech companies increasingly doing more business in that part of the world.</p>
<p>Cases in point: In addition to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe acquiring Nigerian payments company Paystack last year</a>, just earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/flutterwave-and-paypal-partner-to-allow-african-merchants-to-accept-and-make-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal announced a deal with Flutterwave</a> to bring PayPal services to more merchants in the region &#8212; specifically so that PayPal customers can pay merchants in the region using PayPal rails. Square&#8217;s CEO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/05/into-africa-tech-leaders-weigh-in-on-jack-dorseys-planned-move-to-the-continent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Dorsey, meanwhile, never did make his intended move to the continent</a> &#8212; COVID-19 has derailed many plans, as we all know &#8212; but it shows that the company is trying not to overlook opportunities there, either.</p>
<p>PayPal, to be clear, has been active in Nigeria <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2014/06/17/paypal-extends-payment-services-to-nigeria-9-other-countries/?sh=2c7a198f649b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2014</a>, but partnering with a significant player in the region represents an important step for it: Flutterwave itself earlier this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $170 million</a> and became Africa&#8217;s latest unicorn, in what is still a pretty small list.</p>
<p>The fact that there is so much more to be done with payments and more financial services leaves the door open wide for Kuda to move in a number of different directions if it chooses. Having customers in two countries, especially with one foot in the developed market and another in an emerging market, for example, gives the company an interesting window into the world of remittances.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Which neobanks will rise or fall?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/embed/#?secret=Fzvf7uTYIK" data-secret="Fzvf7uTYIK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Money transfer has been one of the very biggest, and most important financial services for African diasporas &#8212; alongside those from many other emerging markets.</p>
<p>Even in cases where people are &#8220;unbanked&#8221; and have no other financial footprints, they have been turning to remittance services to send money home to their families from abroad. Kuda, with its integrations into people&#8217;s salaries, could easily become an efficient, one-stop-shop conduit for that activity too. (That&#8217;s one reason, likely, that remittance startup, Remitly, has also moved into starting to offer accounts to its users in originating countries.)</p>
<p>All of this to say that Valar&#8217;s making a new kind of bet here, but one laden with possibilities and a differentiated approach compared to the rest of its investment activities.</p>
<p>“Nigeria is at a tipping point in the adoption of digital banking,&#8221; noted Andrew McCormack, a general partner and co-founder at Valar, who led its investment here. &#8220;With the rapidly growing, youthful population who are open to new financial alternatives, Kuda is well-positioned to benefit and will transform the landscape of African banking. We are excited to lead their Series A and continue on the journey alongside Kuda.”</p>
