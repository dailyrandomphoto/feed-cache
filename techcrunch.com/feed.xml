										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amy Yin doesn&#8217;t foresee startups resuming a five-day-a-week in-office work schedule, even after COVID-19 has been battled back. It&#8217;s probably a safe bet. Many companies have learned this year that employees can be just as productive, working from home. More, employees &#8212; much as they might miss their own desks &#8212; no longer want to sit in a traditional office all the time. According a survey of 2,300 tech employees conducted this past summer, just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/a-look-at-tech-salaries-and-how-they-could-change-as-more-employees-go-remote/">7% of respondents</a> said they wanted to head into work every day.</p>
<p>Yin experienced the shift to remote work firsthand as a senior engineer at Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange, which was early to send its employees home as the pandemic took hold in the U.S.</p>
<p>Working from home for the first time in her career &#8212; she&#8217;d previously been a software engineer with the recruitment platform Hired and, before that, a growth engineer at Facebook &#8212; she found herself working on her own schedule entirely and loving the flexibility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By August, she says, she decided she could help Coinbase &#8212; and the growing number of other companies to adopt a remote-first organizational strategy &#8212; by starting up <a href="https://officetogether.com/">OfficeTogether</a>, her now five-month-old, San Francisco-based, software-as-a-service company.</p>
<p>Its proposition is simple. With software that integrates with Slack, Google Calendar, and Okta (and soon to be Workday), OfficeTogether helps employees plan time in the office, see their teammates&#8217; schedules, and also to take an automated health and symptom questionnaire that ensures that no one has a fever or has traveled in last 14 days.</p>
<p>The idea is largely to prevent employees from showing up to an office that is already at capacity, or stumbling into a sales team meeting when what&#8217;s really needed is quiet.</p>
<p>Impressively, the company already has paid annual contracts in the U.S., Europe and Canada, says Yin, who wasn&#8217;t comfortable discussing pricing in a call earlier today but who says that OfficeTogether isn&#8217;t competing on price with other competitors, like the workplace management software companies <a href="https://spaceiq.com/">SpaceIQ</a> and <a href="https://www.officespacesoftware.com/">OfficeSpace</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, she says, while rivals are more focused on work space utilization and using occupancy data to forecast capacity limits, OfficeTogether is focused around employees and, as a result, not wedded to a particular space so much as on ensuring that teams can come together when they want, whether that&#8217;s helping them organize a week at a co-working space or several days at a hotel.</p>
<p>&#8220;At some point,&#8221; she notes, &#8220;some companies might decide it’s cheaper to rent out hotel rooms than rent office space, which is expensive to manage.&#8221; She predicts that &#8220;flexible spaces for people to meet will be a big part of every company&#8217;s strategy. If you&#8217;re only meeting once a month for a week,&#8221; you can make do with less, she suggests.</p>
<p>Investors certainly seem to agree. A growing number of startups has been receiving funding that turn all kinds of locations into work spaces. Among them is <a href="https://www.codi.com/">Codi</a>, a San Francisco-based startup that connects people with daytime workspaces in private homes and just today announced $7 million in funding.</p>
<p>In the meantime, OfficeTogether &#8212; which is run by Yin, a designer in San Francisco, and a handful of engineers in Romania &#8212; has just raised its own first institutional round: $2.2 million in seed funding. Defy led the round, joined by Neo, MGV and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/jane-vc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="jane-vc">January Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> along with numerous angel investors who&#8217;ve met Yin through Coinbase; through her alma mater, Harvard; or through other connections.</p>
<p>Among those angels is former Sequoia partner <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/amy-sun" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="amy-sun">Amy Sun, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> who is right now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/former-sequoia-partner-amy-sun-has-already-raised-millions-for-her-stealthy-startup/">launching her own startup</a> in Austin, Texas. Says Yin of Sun and some of the other individuals who&#8217;ve written her a check: &#8220;A lot of my friends are starting companies and it&#8217;s really fun to have people who are launching things&#8221; involved with one&#8217;s own startup. &#8220;We&#8217;re all invest in each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for where that new capital will be spent, Yin says it will go almost entirely to adding to the number of engineers on staff. As for possible marketing spend to spread the word about OfficeTogether, Yin says that her focus instead is on &#8220;enterprise B2B sales &#8212; running a sales process and ensuring the right people hear about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does she have a salesperson yet, we wonder? She laughs. For now, she says, &#8220;You&#8217;re talking to her.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a young age, Will Bruey, the co-founder and chief executive of <a href="https://blog.varda.com/">Varda Space Industries</a>, was fascinated with space and running his own business.<br />
</span></p>
<p>So when the former <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> engineer was tapped by Delian Asparouhov and Trae Stephens of Founders Fund to work on Varda he didn&#8217;t think twice.</p>
<p>Bruey spent six years at SpaceX. First working on the Falcon and Dragon video systems and then the bulk of the systems actuators and controllers used in the avionics for the crewed Dragon capsule (which recently docked at the International Space Station). `</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to Asparouhov, that background, and the time that Bruey spent running his own angel syndicate and working at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bank-of-america" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bank-of-america">Bank of America <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> getting a grounding in finance and startups, made him an ideal candidate to run the next startup to be spun out of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/founders-fund" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="founders-fund">Founders Fund <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Like other <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/founders-fund" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="founders-fund">Founders Fund <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> companies, Palantir and Anduril, Varda takes its name from the novels of J.R.R. Tolkien. Named for the Elf queen who created constellations, the company has set itself no less lofty a task than bringing manufacturing to space.</p>
<p>News of the funding <a href="https://www.axios.com/varda-space-9-million-manufacturing-space-0b9970c4-4394-4e61-a0a1-c4980e12acf9.html">was first reported by Axios</a>.</p>
<p>While companies like <a href="https://spacetango.com/">Space Tango</a> and <a href="https://madeinspace.us/">Made In Space</a> already are attempting to make a viable business out of space manufacturing, they focus on small scale pilots and experimental projects. Varda separates itself by its loftier ambition &#8212; to manufacture commercially viable products at scale in space.</p>
<p>To be economically viable, these products have to be very very high value, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/4-products-that-make-sense-to-manufacture-in-orbit">and according to the IEEE</a> there are already some goods that fit the bill. Things like carbon nanotubes and fiber optic cables, organs, and novel materials are all potential targets for a space manufacturing company, because they can conceivably justify the high cost of material transportation.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Manufacturing is the next step for commercialization in space,&#8221; said Bruey. &#8220;The primary driver that makes us economical is success in the launch business.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>With now-established companies like SpaceX, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rocket-lab" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rocket-lab">Rocket Lab <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/blue-origin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="blue-origin">Blue Origin, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and upstarts like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/relativity-space" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="relativity-space">Relativity Space, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Spinlaunch, and the newly launched Aevum Space all driving down the cost of launching objects into space, the next wave of commercialization is coming.</p>
<p>Varda&#8217;s backers, which put $9 million into the company, were led by Founders Fund and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lux-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lux-capital">Lux Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Additional participation came from Fifty Years, Also Capital, Raymond Tonsing, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/justin-mateen" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="justin-mateen">Justin Mateen, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Naval Ravikant.</p>
<p>These investors are all placing a bet that the biggest returns could be in manufacturing. As a result of their investments, Founders Fund partner Trae Stephens and Lux Capital co-founder Josh Wolfe are both taking seats on the company&#8217;s board.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The first things we will manufacture are things with high dollar per-unit-mass value,&#8221; said Bruey. &#8220;As we establish our manufacturing platform that will ramp into the longer term vision of offloading manufacturing for all space operations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>There are two categories of space manufacturing in the industry to come, according to Bruey and Asparouhov and those are additive manufacturing for making products to be used in space, and manufacturing in space for terrestrial applications. It&#8217;s the second of these that Varda focuses on. &#8220;Nothing we will be doing will be 3D printing,&#8221; said Asparouhov. &#8220;We will be focused on making things in space that we can bring back to earth.</p>
<p>The company may not be working on 3D printing, but its manufacturing facilities won&#8217;t look like anything on Earth. Initially, they&#8217;ll be unmanned, according to a blog post published by Fifty Years. Then they&#8217;ll manufacture things in space that benefit from low gravity. Finally, the company intends to build the first inrastructure that can harvest source materials for new products in-space via asteroid mining.</p>
<p>&#8220;Varda can make manufacturing sustainable by eliminating the need to destructively extract earth&#8217;s resources, help cure chronic diseases, deepen our understanding of biology, help connect more people to the Internet, and usher in higher-throughput and lower energy methods of computation,&#8221; Fifty Years co-founder <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/seth-bannon" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="seth-bannon">Seth Bannon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wrote in a direct message. &#8220;Bringing human industry into the stars &#8212; this is entrepreneurship at its boldest! Varda is the sort of big swing ambition venture capital was invented for.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Federal Trade Commission has sued to block Procter &amp; Gamble’s acquisition of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/billie" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="billie">Billie, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a NY-based startup that sells razors and body wash.</p>
<p>In the notice, the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-trade-commission" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-trade-commission">FTC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> alleged that the merger would “eliminate innovative nascent competitors for wet shave razors” to the loss of consumers.</p>
<p>Billie was founded in 2017 with the goal of fighting the “pink tax” on goods marketed to women, including razors and body wash. It went up against companies like P&amp;G and Edgewell Personal Care by offering high-quality and cheap razors. The company announced its intent to be acquired by P&amp;G after raising just $35 million in venture capital in June.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="41S5OEkPTV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/billie-which-wants-to-destroy-the-pink-tax-closes-a-6m-seed-round-for-its-razor-subscription-service/">Billie, which wants to eliminate the &#8220;pink tax,&#8221; closes a $6M seed round for its razor subscription service</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Billie, which wants to eliminate the &#8220;pink tax,&#8221; closes a $6M seed round for its razor subscription service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/billie-which-wants-to-destroy-the-pink-tax-closes-a-6m-seed-round-for-its-razor-subscription-service/embed/#?secret=41S5OEkPTV" data-secret="41S5OEkPTV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“As its sales grew, Billie was likely to expand into brick-and-mortar stores, posing a serious threat to P&amp;G. If P&amp;G can snuff out Billie’s rapid competitive growth, consumers will likely face higher prices,” Ian Conner, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition said in a statement.</p>
<p>P&amp;G has been on a buying spree as of late. Along with the Billie news, Procter &amp; Gamble acquired Walker &amp; Company, which created Bevel, a grooming line for men of color, and Form, a hair-care line for women of color. In February 2019, P&amp;G announced plans to acquire This is L, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190205005592/en/PG-Acquires-This-Is-L.-One-of-the-Fastest-Growing-Feminine-Care-Brands-in-the-U.S.">a feminine-care brand </a>that sells tampons, pads and wipes.</p>
<p>If the FTC wins, this is another blow for direct-to-consumer brands on the base of competition dynamics. In May 2019, Edgewell Personal Care announced it intended to buy Harry&#8217;s, another direct-to-consumer shaving brand. In February 2020, the FTC filed a lawsuit to block the deal from happening, similarly citing how the deal would limit competition and innovation in the razor market.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GWBVf7ZARU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/edgewell-acquires-harrys/">Razor startup Harry&#8217;s will be acquired by Edgewell Personal Care for $1.37B</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Razor startup Harry&#8217;s will be acquired by Edgewell Personal Care for $1.37B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/edgewell-acquires-harrys/embed/#?secret=GWBVf7ZARU" data-secret="GWBVf7ZARU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Unlike Harry&#8217;s, Billie was bought before it broke into brick-and-mortar retail stores. If the deal doesn’t close, Billie lost precious time it could have used to expand into new locations and markets &#8212; and P&amp;G will lose some of its competitive advantage in the women’s shaving world.</p>
<p>Harry&#8217;s and Billie’s blocks could negatively trickle down to hurt direct-to-consumer products looking at health and wellness more broadly.</p>
<p>Note that exit market isn’t as dull for all companies in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) world. We&#8217;ve seen deals close like Blue Bunny&#8217;s buy of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-09-16/halo-top-ice-cream-company-is-sold-to-blue-bunny">Halo Top</a>, Mars&#8217; acquisition of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/business/dealbook/kind-bars-acquired-mars-snickers.html">Kind Bars</a> and, of course, Unilever&#8217;s $1 billion acquisition of Dollar Shave Club.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/iiiitsandrea">Andrea Hernández</a>, a founder and <a href="http://snaxshot.com">consultant on food and beverage CPG</a>, says that DTC companies often need to partner with mega-businesses to get the distribution scale they need, focusing more on omni-channel presence versus a single seller point.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s very limited for these companies to scale at the same level and grow without incurring debt or needing constant injections of [money],&#8221; she said. &#8220;Or [you can go] the preferred route which is having BigDaddyCorp come whisk you away. You get a success story and the resources to continue your journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, the coronavirus has even impacted food CPG companies by forcing them to <a href="https://twitter.com/gooderdle/status/1336414556873224194?s=20">slash SKUs</a> (or stock keeping units) and prioritize essential goods. Whereas before, CPG companies might stock a variety of goods for a variety of customer needs, they&#8217;re now prioritizing a smaller slice of the pie to manage uncertainty among consumer behavior. Long-term, this means that CPGs might be buying fewer of the Billies and Harry&#8217;s of the world and just focusing on what&#8217;s working now.</p>
<p>Selene Cruz, the founder of Restore which gives DTC brands an offline presence, said that she&#8217;s a&#8221;bit surprised to see the FTC claiming the acquisition kills competition. Billie going into brick &amp; mortar doesn&#8217;t mean instant success enough to take on a major conglomerate.&#8221;</p>
<div>&#8220;If the FTC&#8217;s goal is to not kill competition then I&#8217;d advise them not to diminish exit prospects for investors and founders,&#8221; Cruz added. &#8220;This would hurt investment in the space and that&#8217;s the real fear for innovators.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Additionally, Clearbanc founder Michele Romanow said that  &#8220;while this isn&#8217;t at all ideal for Billie, it means other growing D2C brands have a better chance to build a strong brand and gives consumers more options.&#8221;</div>
<p>Regardless of how this plays out, today&#8217;s news shows that the FTC is paying more attention than ever to consumer and tech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We already knew that Halo Infinite was delayed until next year. Initially intended to launch alongside the new Xboxes, Microsoft announced back in August that it would instead ship in 2021.</p>
<p>Exactly <em>when</em> in 2021, though, was still anyone&#8217;s guess. A <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/inside-infinite-december-2020">new blog post</a> from 343 Industries narrows it down a bit: it&#8217;ll be released in Fall.</p>
<p>Assuming they mean Fall in the Northern Hemisphere (which, well, they probably do,) this narrows the launch window to sometime between the end of September and the end of December. So it&#8217;ll be a while&#8230; but a late game is better than a bad game, right?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>343 <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/inside-infinite-december-2020">has a blog post and interview</a> outlining the team&#8217;s thinking on the timing (and a bit about what they&#8217;re still working on) but it really all boils down to one point: they &#8220;needed more time to do things right.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/ada-ventures-launches-with-a-34m-fund-aimed-at-super-charging-diverse-global-founders/">A year ago</a> this week <a href="https://www.adaventures.com/">Ada Ventures</a> — a U.K./Europe-focused VC with an &#8220;impact twist&#8221; aiming to invest in diverse founders tackling societal problems — launched onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt. (You can watch the video of that launch below.)</p>
<p>Today Ada announces that it has closed its first fund at $50 million. Cornerstone LPs in the fund include <a href="https://bigsocietycapital.com/">Big Society Capital</a>, an entity owned by the U.K. government, as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Business_Bank">British Business Bank</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/check-warner" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="check-warner">Check Warner, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a co-founding partner, said the raise was oversubscribed: &#8220;We weren&#8217;t even sure we&#8217;d be able to raise $30 million. And then to actually get to £38 million then $50 million, which was over our initial hard cap of 35 is, is really, really big.” All of the fund was raised on video calls during the 2020 pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Geared as a &#8220;first-cheque&#8221; seed fund, Ada is trying to tackle that thorny problem that to a large extent the VC industry itself created: the &#8220;mirroring&#8221; that goes on when white male investors invest in other white men, thus ignoring huge swathes of society. Instead, it’s aiming to invest in the best <em>talent</em> in the U.K. and Europe, regardless of race, gender or background, with the specific aim of &#8220;creating the most diverse pipeline, and portfolio, on the continent&#8221;, while tackling issues including mental health, obesity, workers rights and affordable childcare.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kjtxIeZZza"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/ada-ventures-launches-with-a-34m-fund-aimed-at-super-charging-diverse-global-founders/">Ada Ventures launches with a $34M fund aimed at super-charging diverse global founders</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ada Ventures launches with a $34M fund aimed at super-charging diverse global founders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/ada-ventures-launches-with-a-34m-fund-aimed-at-super-charging-diverse-global-founders/embed/#?secret=kjtxIeZZza" data-secret="kjtxIeZZza" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It appears to be well on its way. In 2020, Ada invested in eight seed-stage companies tackling the above issues. Four of the eight companies have female CEOs. This brings the total portfolio size to 17, including the &#8220;pre-fund&#8221; portfolio.</p>
<p>In terms of portfolio progress: Huboo Technologies raised a £14 million Series A, which was led by Stride VC and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hearst-interactive-media" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hearst-interactive-media">Hearst Ventures; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Bubble delivered tens of thousands of hours of free childcare to NHS staff; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/organise/">Organise</a> grew their members from 70,000 to more than 900,000, and campaigned for the government to provide support for the self-employed during COVID-19.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://findingada.com/">Ada Lovelace Day</a> this October, Ada launched its own Angel program, enabling five new Angel investors to write their first cheques. This is not dissimilar to similar Angel programs run by other VCs. It also has a network of 58 &#8220;Ada Scouts&#8221; resulting in around 20% of deal flow, with two investments now made across the portfolio that were scout-sourced.</p>
<p>This is no ordinary scout network, however. Ada&#8217;s Scout community includes the leaders of Hustle Crew, a for-profit working to make the tech industry more inclusive, and Muslamic Makers, a community of Muslims in tech.</p>
<p>In 2021, Ada says it will continue to grow its network of Ada Scouts across the U.K., with a focus on the LGBTQ+ community, disabled entrepreneurs and regions outside of London.</p>
<p>And the Scout network is not just &#8220;for show&#8221;, as Warner told me: “We have spoken to the Iranian Women&#8217;s Association and Islamic makers and all these groups that are underrepresented within tech and VC. And they bring us companies. And if we end up investing in these companies, we pay them both an upfront cash fee and also a carried interest share. So there are quite a few things that make it distinct from other scout programs. Many other scout programs just take existing investors like existing angels, and give them more capital and double up their investments. We&#8217;re actually enabling a whole new group of people who wouldn&#8217;t otherwise be able to get access to VC. We involve them in our due diligence process, we get their insight into markets that we wouldn&#8217;t necessarily understand, like the Shariya finance market, for example. So there are quite a few things that we&#8217;re doing differently. And we now have 58 of these scouts, who drive between 10 and 20% of our deal flow on any given month.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warner continued: &#8220;When we launched we couldn’t have predicted the seismic changes and tragedy brought on by COVID-19, or the social dislocation precipitated by the killing of George Floyd. These events have provided the backdrop of the first year of deployment from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ada-vemtires" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ada-vemtires">Ada Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Fund I. In light of these events, the Ada Ventures strategy feels more poignant — and urgent — than it has perhaps ever been.”</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Warner and co-founder Matt Penneycard admitted the fund is not labeled as an &#8220;Impact fund&#8221; but that it shares a similar orientation.</p>
<p>Penneycard said: “The difference, the difference is often in the eye of the beholder. In that, it&#8217;s the way the investor wants to bucket it. Some investors might see us as an impact fund if they want to, and that&#8217;s fine. Other investors see the massive financial arbitrage that you get with a fund like ours, just because you&#8217;re looking in very different places to other funds. So, you&#8217;ve got more coming in the top of the funnel, if you&#8217;ve got a decent process, you should get a better outcome. And so with some of our investors, that&#8217;s kind of one of the primary reasons they&#8217;re investing, they think we&#8217;re going to generate superior returns to other funds, because of where were are looking. It isn&#8217;t pure impact. It&#8217;s a real fund, it just happens to have the byproduct of quite deep, meaningful social impact.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has used a speech to European lawmakers and privacy regulators today to come out jabbing at what SVP Craig Federighi described as dramatic, &#8220;outlandish&#8221; and &#8220;false&#8221; claims being made by the adtech industry over a forthcoming change to iOS that <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">will give users the ability to decline app tracking. </span></p>
<p>The iPhone maker had been due to introduce the major privacy enhancement to the App Store this fall but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/apple-delay-ios-14-privacy-ad-tracking/">delayed</a> until early 2021 after the plan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">drew fire from advertising giants</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook, for example, warned the move could have a major impact on app makers which rely on its in-app advertising network to monetize on iOS, as well as some impact on its own bottom line.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since then four online advertising lobby groups have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-advertisting-france-idUSL1N2HJ237">filed an antitrust complaint</a> against Apple in France &#8212; seeking to derail the privacy changes on competition grounds.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9vs7nppjnl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">Facebook isn&#8217;t happy about Apple&#8217;s upcoming ad tracking restrictions</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook isn&#8217;t happy about Apple&#8217;s upcoming ad tracking restrictions&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/embed/#?secret=9vs7nppjnl" data-secret="9vs7nppjnl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However Apple made it clear today that it&#8217;s not backing down.</p>
<p>Federighi described online tracking as privacy&#8217;s &#8220;biggest&#8221; challenge &#8212; saying its forthcoming App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature represents &#8220;the front line of user privacy&#8221; as far as it&#8217;s concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never before has the right to privacy &#8212; the right to keep personal data under your own control &#8212; been under assault like it is today. As external threats to privacy continue to evolve, our work to counter them must, too,&#8221; he said in the speech to the European Data Protection &amp; Privacy Conference.</p>
<p>The aim of ATT is &#8220;to empower our users to decide when or if they want to allow an app to track them in a way that could be shared across other companies’ apps or websites&#8221;, according to Federighi.</p>
<p>Civic society&#8217;s objection to the adtech industry&#8217;s tracking &#8216;dark art&#8217; is that it sums to hellishly opaque mass surveillance of the mainstream Internet.</p>
<p>While harms attached to the practice include the risk of discrimination; manipulation of vulnerable groups; and election interference, to name a few.</p>
<p>Federighi took clear aim in his own attack &#8212; returning to a descriptor that Apple&#8217;s CEO Tim Cook used in a speech to an earlier European privacy conference <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/apples-tim-cook-makes-blistering-attack-on-the-data-industrial-complex/">back in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mass centralization of data puts privacy at risk &#8212; no matter who’s collecting it and what their intentions might be,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;So we believe Apple should have as little data about our customers as possible. Now, others take the opposite approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;They gather, sell, and hoard as much of your personal information as they can. The result is a data-industrial complex, where shadowy actors work to infiltrate the most intimate parts of your life and exploit whatever they can find &#8212; whether to sell you something, to radicalize your views, or worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since Cook wooed EU lawmakers by denouncing the &#8220;data-industrial complex&#8221; &#8212; and simultaneously lauding Europe&#8217;s pro-privacy approach to digital regulation &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/gdpr-adtech-complaints-keep-stacking-up-in-europe/">scores</a> of individual and collective complaints have been lodged against the adtech infrastructure that underpins behavioral advertising under the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>Yet regional regulators still haven&#8217;t taken any enforcement action over these <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">adtech complaints</a>. Turning the cookie-tracking tanker clearly isn&#8217;t a cake walk.</p>
<p>And while the adtech lobby may have been heartened by remarks made yesterday by Commission EVP and competition chief, Margrethe Vestager &#8212; who told the OECD Global Competition Forum that antitrust enforcers should be &#8220;vigilant so that privacy is not used as a shield against competition&#8221; &#8212; there was a sting in the tail as she expressed support for a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling/"> &#8216;superprofiling&#8217; case against Facebook</a> in Germany, which combines the streams of privacy and competition in new and interesting ways, with Vestager dubbing the piece of regulatory innovation &#8220;inspiring and interesting&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KtFQw1NDJ5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling/">Antitrust case against Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;super profiling&#8217; back on track after German federal court ruling</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Federighi urged Europe&#8217;s lawmakers to screw their courage to the sticking place where privacy is concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gdpr" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gdpr">GDPR <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and other policies &#8212; many of which have been implemented by Commissioner Jourová, Commissioner Reynders, and others here with us today &#8212; Europe has shown the world what a privacy-friendly future could look like,&#8221; he said, lathering on the kind of &#8216;geopolitical influencer&#8217; praise that&#8217;s particularly cherished in Brussels.</p>
<p>He also reiterated Apple&#8217;s support for a GDPR-style &#8220;omnibus privacy law in the U.S.&#8221; &#8212; something Cook called for two years ago &#8212; aka: a law that &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">empowers consumers to minimize collection of their data; to know when and </span>why it is being collected; to access, correct, or delete that data; and to know that it is truly secure&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s already clear that some companies are going to do everything they can to stop [ATT] &#8212; or any innovation like it &#8212; and to maintain their unfettered access to people’s data. Some have already begun to make outlandish claims, like saying that ATT &#8212; which helps users control when they’re tracked &#8212; will somehow lead to greater privacy invasions,&#8221; he went on, taking further sideswipes at Apple&#8217;s adtech detractors.</p>
<p>&#8220;To say that we’re skeptical of those claims would be an understatement. But that won’t stop these companies from making false arguments to get what they want. We need the world to see those arguments for what they are: a brazen attempt to maintain the privacy-invasive status quo.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another direct appeal to EU lawmakers, Federighi suggested ATT &#8220;reflects both the spirit and the requirements of both the ePrivacy Directive, and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/07/eprivacy-an-overview-of-europes-other-big-privacy-rule-change/">planned updates in the draft ePrivacy Regulation</a>&#8221; &#8212; displaying a keen insight into the (oftentimes fraught) process of EU policymaking. (The ePrivacy update has in fact been stalled for years &#8212; so the subtle suggestion in Apple&#8217;s appeal is its technology levers being flipped to enable greater user privacy <em>could</em> help unblock the EU&#8217;s bunged up policy levers.)</p>
<p>&#8220;ATT, like ePrivacy, is about giving people the power to make informed choices about what happens to their data. I hope that the lawmakers, regulators, and privacy advocates here today will continue to stand up for strong privacy protections like these,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Earlier in the speech Federighi also made some plainer points: Likening ATT to the Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) feature Apple added to its Safari browser back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-adds-a-tracker-blocker-to-desktop-safari/">2017</a> &#8212; pointing out that despite similar objections from adtech then the industry as a whole has posted revenue increases every year since.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as with ITP, some in the ad industry are lobbying against these efforts &#8212; claiming that ATT will dramatically hurt ad-supported businesses. But we expect that the industry will adapt as it did before &#8212; providing effective advertising, but this time without invasive tracking,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, some advertisers and tech companies would prefer that ATT is never implemented at all. When invasive tracking is your business model, you tend not to welcome transparency and customer choice,&#8221; he added, taking another swipe at the industry&#8217;s motives for objecting to more choice and privacy for iOS users.</p>
<p>At the same time Federighi did acknowledge that the iOS switch to requiring user permission for app tracking &#8220;is a big change from the world we live in now&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s one that will likely bring transitionary pain to iOS developers, too.</p>
<p>But on this his messaging stood firm: He made it clear Apple may wield the stick at developers who don&#8217;t get with its user privacy upgrade program, warning: &#8220;Early next year, we’ll begin requiring all apps that want to do that to obtain their users’ explicit permission, and developers who fail to meet that standard can have their apps taken down from the App Store.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was interesting to note that the speech contained both specific appeals to regional lawmakers to stay the course in regulating to protect data and privacy; and more amorphous appeals to (unnamed) competitors &#8212; to follow Apple&#8217;s lead and innovate around privacy.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re a tech giant being accused of anti-competitive behaviour by a self-interested adtech clique, framing your desire for increased competition in the (lucrative) business of enhancing user privacy is a nice rebuttal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don’t define success as standing alone. When it comes to privacy protections, we’re very happy to see our competitors copy our work, or develop innovative privacy features of their own that we can learn from,&#8221; said Federighi.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Apple, we are passionate advocates for privacy protections for all users. We love to see people buy our products. But we would also love to see robust competition among companies for the best, the strongest, and the most empowering privacy features.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course if more iOS developers have to rely on in-app subscriptions to monetize their wares, because users refuse app tracking, it&#8217;ll mean more money passing through the pearly App Store gates and straight into Apple&#8217;s coffers. But that&#8217;s another story.</p>

<p>The Apple SVP also took gentle aim at any EU policymakers who may be imagining it&#8217;s a clever idea to crack open the pandora&#8217;s box of end-to-end encryption &#8212; urging them to strengthen the bloc&#8217;s commitment to robust security. Duh.</p>
<p>The backstory here is there&#8217;s been some recent chatter around the topic. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/whats-all-this-about-europe-wanting-crypto-backdoors/">Last month</a> a <a href="https://files.orf.at/vietnam2/files/fm4/202045/783284_fh_st12143-re01en20_783284.pdf">draft resolution</a> made by the Council of the European Union triggered press coverage that suggested EU legislators are on the cusp of banning e2e encryption.</p>
<p>Although, to be fair, the only &#8216;b&#8217; word the Commission has used so far is &#8216;balanced&#8217; &#8212; when it said its new EU security strategy will “explore and support balanced technical, operational and legal solutions, and promote an approach which both maintains the effectiveness of encryption in protecting privacy and security of communications, while providing an effective response to serious crime and terrorism”.</p>
<p>&#8220;I also hope that you will strengthen Europe’s support for end-to-end encryption. Apple strongly supported the European Parliament when it EU parliament <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/european-meps-want-to-ban-states-from-backdooring-encryption/">proposed</a> a requirement that the ePrivacy Regulation support end-to-end encryption, and we will continue to do so,&#8221; Federighi added, tone set to &#8216;don&#8217;t disappoint&#8217;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/doordash-sells-shares-at-102-in-ipo-pricing-above-range.html">to media</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/doordash-poised-to-tap-torrid-ipo-market-11607442406">reports</a>, food-delivery giant DoorDash priced its IPO at $102 per share, ahead of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/doordash-amps-its-ipo-range-ahead-of-blockbuster-ipo/">final IPO pricing range of $90 to $95 per share</a>.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s debut has been warmly anticipated by public investors, as evinced by the company raising its range from an initial target of $75 to $85.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re still waiting for official pricing, the price point makes <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="doordash">DoorDash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> worth $32 billion at the time of its IPO price on a non-diluted basis (we&#8217;re using the company&#8217;s final S-1/A share count of 317,656,521). That valuation rises if one includes options that have vested but not been exercised, and even more if shares set aside for future compensation are also tallied. CNBC calculates DoorDash&#8217;s valuation to be $38.7 billion on a diluted basis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How COVID-19 accelerated DoorDash&#8217;s business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/how-covid-19-accelerated-doordashs-business/embed/#?secret=QS1jyZxiGB" data-secret="QS1jyZxiGB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Regardless, any of the valuation marks for DoorDash at $102 per share are far and away greater than its final pre-IPO valuation of around $16 billion, set this summer when the company took on additional capital. The unicorn raised more money during a growth boom, allowing it to add to its cash reserves ahead of its IPO with limited dilution.</p>
<p>DoorDash, which doubled its private startup valuation, is now incredibly well-capitalized to take on rivals Uber Eats and others. And at a price far above its raised range, it has more cash than it probably hoped for. How it uses that cash to preserve pandemic-driven gains will be a key narrative from the company in 2021.</p>
<p>More when we get official numbers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Senate today confirmed the appointment of Nathan Simington to the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-communications-commission" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-communications-commission">FCC, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-will-step-down-to-make-way-for-the-biden-administration/">imminent departure of Chairman Ajit Pai</a> sets up the agency for years of deadlock unless Democrats take the Senate. The last-minute appointment breaks with political norms, and the vote was entirely on party lines after Democrats objected to the nomination.</p>
<p>Simington has been a senior adviser at the Commerce Department&#8217;s National Telecommunications and Information Administration, where recently he helped craft the public-relations effort there around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/trump-section-230-ndaa/">Trump&#8217;s attacks on Section 230</a>, the law that prevents companies like Twitter and Amazon from being liable for things posted on them by users. (The outgoing president primarily objects to the frequent labeling of his tweets as misleading or outright false.)</p>
<p>The rush to confirm a new Commissioner follows the unceremonious dumping of Mike O&#8217;Rielly, a Republican Commissioner who has generally fallen in line with this administration&#8217;s policies but made the fatal error of speaking out against the effort to change Section 230. Due to be nominated for another term, he was instead dropped in favor of Simington, who has demonstrated no scruple about using the FCC as a muzzle for social media.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Numerous Democratic senators objected to Simington, questioning his qualifications for the job. Senator Blumenthal (D-CT) noted that &#8220;during his confirmation hearing even the most basic questions about FCC issues seemed to trip [him] up,&#8221; while Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) said his &#8220;only qualification is his eagerness to defend the president&#8217;s attacks on the First Amendment and Sec. 230.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3wfxwYhFV0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/fcc-invites-public-comment-on-trumps-attempt-to-nerf-section-230/">FCC invites public comment on Trump&#8217;s attempt to nerf Section 230</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;FCC invites public comment on Trump&#8217;s attempt to nerf Section 230&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/fcc-invites-public-comment-on-trumps-attempt-to-nerf-section-230/embed/#?secret=3wfxwYhFV0" data-secret="3wfxwYhFV0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Indeed, considering his lack of experience, it seems to be purely for political purposes that Simington has been nominated and confirmed for a five-year term in such short order.</p>
<p>Traditionally what would happen at this point would be that O&#8217;Rielly would continue on until the new administration nominated and confirmed him along with its pick for a new chair and Democratic Commissioner (the FCC is balanced 3-2 in favor of the administration&#8217;s party, but is technically independent).</p>
<p>However, with Republicans as likely as not to control the Senate come January — depending entirely on the outcome of the run-off in Georgia — there is an opportunity here for the party to obstruct the FCC&#8217;s work by rushing a single nomination and confirmation, establishing a 2-2 tie that could be maintained by declining to confirm any nomination by the Biden administration.</p>
<p>In such a situation, the FCC would essentially be frozen. Without a majority, neither side would be able to pass rules and regulations, since it&#8217;s nearly certain that the opposing two Commissioners would vote against them. While some work could occur at the bureau level, and ordinary business like collecting fees and so on could happen, there would be no big moves like reestablishing net neutrality or establishing consumer protections from broadband companies. If desired, this deadlock could potentially last for years.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the only possible outcome, of course. Should the Democrats win the day in Georgia, the 50-50 split in the Senate, with ties broken by Vice President-elect Harris, would allow for them to confirm a full slate at this and other agencies. It&#8217;s also conceivable that even with control of the Senate, the Republicans could allow a nomination through in return for various concessions, like sympathetic appointees at other independent agencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber has offloaded its air taxi enterprise Elevate to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/joby-aviation" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="joby-aviation">Joby Aviation, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the last of several moonshots to be sold by the ride-hailing company in a pursuit to stick to its core business and reach profitability.</p>
<p>The transaction announced Tuesday is part of a complex deal that includes Uber investing $75 million into Joby and an expanded partnership between the two companies. Last year, Uber and Joby, which is developing an all-electric, vertical take-off and landing passenger aircraft, signed on as a vehicle partner for Uber’s Elevate initiative. Joby was the first partner to commit to deploying air taxi services by 2023.</p>
<p>The $75 million investment comes in addition to a previously undisclosed $50 million investment made as part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/joby-aviation-raises-590-million-led-by-toyota-to-launch-an-electric-air-taxi-service/">Joby&#8217;s Series C financing round in January 2020</a>, Uber said. To date, Joby Aviation has raised $820 million. Uber has invested a total of $125 million into the startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Joby Aviation raises $590 million led by Toyota to launch an electric air taxi service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/joby-aviation-raises-590-million-led-by-toyota-to-launch-an-electric-air-taxi-service/embed/#?secret=Z7egCDhnOU" data-secret="Z7egCDhnOU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Under the deal, which is expected to close in early 2021, the two parent companies have agreed to integrate their respective services into each other&#8217;s apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Advanced air mobility has the potential to be exponentially positive for the environment and future generations,&#8221; Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement. &#8220;This deal allows us to deepen our partnership with Joby, the clear leader in this field, to accelerate the path to market for these technologies.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Joby is considered one of the leaders, Elevate did play a role in shaping the nascent industry, including establishing some of the benchmarks used by competitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The team at Uber Elevate has not only played an important role in our industry, they have also developed a remarkable set of software tools that build on more than a decade of experience enabling on-demand mobility,&#8221; Joby Aviation CEO JoeBen Bevirt said in a statement.&#8221; These tools and new team members will be invaluable to us as we accelerate our plans for commercial launch.&#8221;</p>
<p>One year ago, Uber’s business model could be categorized as an “all of the above approach,” a strategy to generate revenue from all forms of transportation, including ride-hailing, micromobility, logistics and package and food delivery. The COVID-19 pandemic and Khosrowshahi&#8217;s focus on profitability prompted the company to dump its moonshots and double down on delivery with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/uber-takes-out-postmates/">its acquisition of Postmates</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Uber is a company focused on ride-hailing and delivery while keeping its hand in micromobility, logistics and autonomous vehicles through a series of deals struck in 2020.</p>
<p>The Joby-Elevate terms are similar to two other Uber deals this year. In the spring, Uber led a $170 million funding round in micromobility startup Lime. As part of the deal, Lime acquired Uber&#8217;s micromobility subsidiary Jump. The majority of Jump&#8217;s 400 employees were laid off. Earlier this week, autonomous vehicle startup Aurora Innovation reached an agreement with Uber to buy the ride-hailing firm&#8217;s self-driving unit in a complex deal that will value the combined company at $10 billion.</p>

<p>Just like Uber&#8217;s deals with Lime and now Joby, Aurora isn&#8217;t paying cash for Uber ATG, a company that was last valued at $7.25 billion. Instead, Uber is handing over its equity in ATG and investing $400 million into Aurora, which will give it a 26% stake in the combined company, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Uber said in October that it sold off a $500 million stake in its Uber Freight business to an investor group led by New York-based investment firm Greenbriar Equity Group. The deal valued the unit at $3.3 billion on a post-money basis. Uber has maintained its majority stake in Uber Freight, unlike the Jump, Elevate and ATG deals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fireeye" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fireeye">FireEye, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> normally the first company that cyberattack victims will call, has now admitted it too has fallen victim to hackers, which the company called a &#8220;sophisticated threat actor&#8221; that was likely backed by a nation-state.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/fireeye-shares-details-of-recent-cyber-attack-actions-to-protect-community.html">a blog post</a> confirming the breach, the company&#8217;s chief executive Kevin Mandia said the nation-backed hackers have &#8220;top-tier offensive capabilities,&#8221; but did not attribute blame or say which government was behind the attack.</p>
<p>Mandia, who founded <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mandiant" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mandiant">Mandiant, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the incident response firm acquired by FireEye in 2014, said the hackers used a &#8220;novel combination of techniques not witnessed by us or our partners in the past&#8221; to steal hacking tools used typically by red teams, which are tasked with launching authorized but offensive hacking campaigns against customers in order to find weaknesses or vulnerabilities before malicious hackers do.</p>
<p>&#8220;These tools mimic the behavior of many cyberthreat actors and enable FireEye to provide essential diagnostic security services to our customers,&#8221; said Mandia. &#8220;None of the tools contain zero-day exploits. Consistent with our goal to protect the community, we are proactively releasing methods and means to detect the use of our stolen red team tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>But if stolen, these tools could make it easier for hackers to launch attacks against their victims.</p>
<p>Two years ago, hackers breached and stole similarly offensive hacking tools from the National Security Agency, which the spy agency used to collect intelligence on foreign suspected terrorists. But the exploit was later published and was used to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/the-wannacry-sinkhole/">infect thousands of computers</a> with the WannaCry ransomware, causing millions of dollars’ worth of damage.</p>
<p>Mandia said that FireEye has developed hundreds of countermeasures to minimize the impact that these tools pose in the event that the hackers use the tools, but that FireEye has seen no evidence that the tools have been abused.</p>
<p>Although the motives of the hackers are unknown, Mandia said that the hackers appeared to seek information related to its government customers.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not clear exactly when the breach happened, or how FireEye was alerted to the incident. A spokesperson for FireEye declined to comment beyond the blog post when reached by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>FireEye, valued at about $3.5 billion, saw its stock tank by more than 7% in after-hours trading. The company has gained a reputation as one of the most well-resourced cybersecurity firms on the market, often brought in to understand how a breach happened and what may have been taken.</p>
<p>In this case, FireEye said it had reported the incident to the FBI and alerted industry partners, like Microsoft, to the breach. Microsoft said it was assisting with FireEye&#8217;s investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This incident demonstrates why the security industry must work together to defend against and respond to threats posed by well-funded adversaries using novel and sophisticated attack techniques,&#8221; said Microsoft&#8217;s Jeff Jones. &#8220;We commend FireEye for their disclosure and collaboration, so that we can all be better prepared.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Elon Musk said Tuesday that he has moved to Texas, confirming months of speculation that the billionaire would leave California, a state of which he has become increasingly critical. Musk confirmed the move during an interview at the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-to-discuss-teslas-banner-year-despite-pandemic-silicon-valleys-future-11607449988">The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council annual summit</a>.</p>
<p>His remarks confirmed a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-plans-to-move-to-texas-friends-and-associates-say.html">CNBC report</a> that Musk had told friends of his intent to move to Texas.</p>
<p>The move coincides with a number of SpaceX and Tesla-related projects in Texas, the sale of several of Musk&#8217;s Los Angeles homes as well as his disagreement with how California public officials have handled the COVID-19 pandemic. In May, Musk filed a lawsuit against Alameda County and threatened to move its headquarters and future programs to Texas or Nevada immediately. The lawsuit stemmed from Tesla&#8217;s escalating fight with health officials over whether its factory in Fremont could reopen during a stay-at-home order enacted due to the coronavirus.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During the interview, Musk said California was taking its winning position for granted and becoming complacent.</p>
<p>Speculation that Musk would move to Texas picked up after Tesla picked and started construction on a site near Austin for a factory that will build its Cybertruck and the Model 3 and Model Y. His other privately held company, SpaceX, is planning a launch site in Boca Chica, Texas. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/texas-hold-em-musk-moves-his-foundation-to-the-lone-star-state">Bloomberg reported</a> Monday that Musk had moved his foundation to Austin, another signal that he had or was about to make the jump to Texas.</p>

<p>Texas has become a hotspot in recent years, with Austin, Houston and Dallas seeing spikes of growth. During the pandemic, that pace accelerated as California-based tech workers fled expensive areas such as Silicon Valley and San Francisco.</p>
<p>The state has another important perk for Musk: no state income tax.</p>
<p>California is still a major hub of SpaceX and Tesla operations. SpaceX headquarters are in Hawthorne and Tesla&#8217;s headquarters are in Silicon Valley. The company&#8217;s main factory, which assembles the Model 3, Model X and Model S and Model Y, is in Fremont.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/aws-releases-sagemaker-to-make-it-easier-to-build-and-deploy-machine-learning-models/">three years after it was first launched</a>, Amazon Web Services&#8217; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker">SageMaker platform</a> has gotten a significant upgrade in the form of new features, making it easier for developers to automate and scale each step of the process to build new automation and machine learning capabilities, the company said.</p>
<p>As machine learning moves into the mainstream, business units across organizations will find applications for automation, and AWS is trying to make the development of those bespoke applications easier for its customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the best parts of having such a widely adopted service like SageMaker is that we get lots of customer suggestions which fuel our next set of deliverables,&#8221; said AWS vice president of machine learning, Swami Sivasubramanian. &#8220;Today, we are announcing a set of tools for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> SageMaker that makes it much easier for developers to build end-to-end machine learning pipelines to prepare, build, train, explain, inspect, monitor, debug and run custom machine learning models with greater visibility, explainability and automation at scale.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Already companies like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/3m" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="3m">3M, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/adp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="adp">ADP, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/astrazeneca" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="astrazeneca">AstraZeneca, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Avis, Bayer, Capital One, Cerner, Domino&#8217;s Pizza, Fidelity Investments, Lenovo, Lyft, T-Mobile and Thomson Reuters are using SageMaker tools in their own operations, according to AWS.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s new products include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-sagemaker-data-wrangler-a-new-data-preparation-service-for-machine-learning/">Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler</a>, which the company said was providing a way to normalize data from disparate sources so the data is consistently easy to use. Data Wrangler can also ease the process of grouping disparate data sources into features to highlight certain types of data. The Data Wrangler tool contains more than 300 built-in data transformers that can help customers normalize, transform and combine features without having to write any code.</p>

<p>Amazon also unveiled the Feature Store, which allows customers to create repositories that make it easier to store, update, retrieve and share machine learning features for training and inference.</p>
<p>Another new tool that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon-web-services" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> touted was Pipelines, its workflow management and automation toolkit. The Pipelines tech is designed to provide orchestration and automation features not dissimilar from traditional programming. Using pipelines, developers can define each step of an end-to-end machine learning workflow, the company said in a statement. Developers can use the tools to re-run an end-to-end workflow from SageMaker Studio using the same settings to get the same model every time, or they can re-run the workflow with new data to update their models.</p>
<p>To address the longstanding issues with data bias in artificial intelligence and machine learning models, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/aws-announces-sagemaker-clarify-to-help-reduce-bias-in-machine-learning-models/">Amazon launched SageMaker Clarify</a>. First announced today, this tool allegedly provides bias detection across the machine learning workflow, so developers can build with an eye toward better transparency on how models were set up. There are open-source tools that can do these tests, Amazon acknowledged, but the tools are manual and require a lot of lifting from developers, according to the company.</p>

<p>Other products designed to simplify the machine learning application development process include SageMaker Debugger, which enables developers to train models faster by monitoring system resource utilization and alerting developers to potential bottlenecks; Distributed Training, which makes it possible to train large, complex, deep learning models faster than current approaches by automatically splitting data across multiple GPUs to accelerate training times; and SageMaker Edge Manager, a machine learning model management tool for edge devices, which allows developers to optimize, secure, monitor and manage models deployed on fleets of edge devices.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Amazon unveiled SageMaker JumpStart, which provides developers with a searchable interface to find algorithms and sample notebooks so they can get started on their machine learning journey. The company said it would give developers new to machine learning the option to select several pre-built machine learning solutions and deploy them into SageMaker environments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drivers cruising along an off-the-beaten track might stumble upon an unusual sight in the coming months: a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rivian-automotive" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rivian-automotive">Rivian <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> electric charging station.</p>
<p>The electric automaker has designed and is now starting to build out a network of electric vehicle charging stations throughout the United States as it prepares for the first deliveries of its R1T pickup truck and R1S sport utility vehicle. The network will include fast-chargers located along interstates, a strategy employed by Tesla and Electrify America, the entity set up by Volkswagen as part of its settlement with U.S. regulators over its diesel emissions cheating scandal.</p>
<p>Rivian is adding a second layer to its electric vehicle charging game plan that&#8217;s atypical of the industry. The company will set up dozens of EV chargers designed to power up its electric vehicles while parked at adventurous destinations, from mountain bike and hiking trails to kayaking spots and maybe even near popular climbing crags. It&#8217;s a direct appeal to Rivian&#8217;s customer base and one required to build confidence in the brand and electric vehicles, in general, Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe told TechCrunch in a wide-ranging interview about charging, batteries and automated driving.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re excited about the opportunity to create Rivian charging locations that aren&#8217;t on the interstate, that help draw you or enable you to go to places that normally are not the kinds of places that invite or welcome electric vehicles because of charging infrastructure,&#8221; Scaringe said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spent a lot of time thinking about how you can essentially create these curated drives where, depending on your point of interest, you can pick different paths. If you want to stop midway through the trip for a one-mile, two-mile or five-mile hike, you know, here&#8217;s a route that you want to take and here&#8217;s a charging location right next to it.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>An &#8220;all of the above&#8221; approach</h2>
<p>The Rivian consumer-facing network is essentially two-tiers that will offer fast charging along the interstate where drivers need it, and strategically located destination chargers for when speed isn&#8217;t as important. It has created what Scaringe described as a &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">really interesting and challenging real estate&#8221; problem as the company figures out where those points of interest are and the best spots to locate charging stations along a particular route.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building the Rivian network has been more than a test of consumer brand awareness and real estate wits. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The electric automaker, which has raised about $6 billion, developed the tech in-house, including the high-speed DC charger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We haven&#8217;t talked about this really, but that charger, the power electronics module — or the backbone of those chargers — is something that we&#8217;re going to be deploying at scale,&#8221; Scaringe said, adding that the high-speed DC charger will be capable of up to 140 miles in about 20 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This hardware, and accompanying charging software, will be most visible in the consumer-facing Rivian network. However, the platform and the hardware around it also will be used for a fleet-based product, said Scaringe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you think of commercial vans, the charger and the dispenser may look a little different, but the guts of these </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">power modules that are used to build up the charging capability are identically applied in these very different applications,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the reasons we built all that core competency, so we can build both fleet-based B2B charging solutions and the consumer-facing adventure network for Rivian customers.</span></p>
<h2>Controlling the experience</h2>
<p>Rivian has spent years and hundreds of millions of dollars to bring the R1T and R1S to market. And while it has raised $6 billion to date, those funds could easily be spent on developing technology and scaling up manufacturing. Scaringe argues that the Rivian network is a necessary undertaking if the automaker hopes to build confidence by controlling the entire ownership experience.</p>
<p>There are numerous third-party charging companies in operation today, including ChargePoint, EVConnect, EVGo, Electrify America and Greenlots. Legacy automakers have created partnerships and even made strategic investments in these businesses ahead of their own electric vehicle rollouts. But Scaringe isn&#8217;t willing to rely completely on third-party networks.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The challenge is we don&#8217;t control those networks, so the payments platforms, the uptime, the performance, the ability to reserve a charger — all those things that take the friction of charging away — we don&#8217;t truly control,&#8221; said Scaringe. &#8220;With the Rivian Adventure Network, we have 100% control of that; we get to know what vehicles are charging or how they&#8217;re charging, the rates. We can be really creative in terms of locations, so it can allow us to get to places that are very specific and unique to Rivian.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Open or shut?</h2>
<p>The Rivian network is clearly being built for Rivian customers. However, it doesn&#8217;t mean this will necessarily be a closed proprietary system like Tesla&#8217;s Supercharger network.</p>
<p>The two common connectors used for rapid charging are Combined Charging System (CCS) or CHAdeMO. CCS, a direct current connector that Rivian uses, is an open international standard that in recent years has gained popularity in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>This means that Rivian trucks and SUVs can also use any third-party CCS charging station without having to use an adapter. It also means that theoretically other electric vehicles with the CCS standard could use the Rivian network, although software could block their use.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rivian to begin deliveries of electric pickup truck in June 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/rivian-to-begin-deliveries-of-electric-pickup-truck-in-june-2021/embed/#?secret=aC7gROMfyK" data-secret="aC7gROMfyK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Scaringe wouldn&#8217;t say exactly how many charging stations would be open by this summer, when the first deliveries of the electric pickup and SUV are expected to begin. He noted that dozens of charging stations — each station having an average of six charging connectors — will be erected in the U.S. in 2021.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As that network is built it will take some of the pressure off the need to have the very large battery packs,&#8221; Scaringe said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every Rivian R1T and R1S comes standard with a battery pack that has more than 300 miles of range. The company plans to make a pack with more than 400 miles of range available in the R1T beginning in January 2022. A longer range R1S </span>with both five and seven-passenger seating will be announced following start of production, the company has previously said. Rivian is also planning to eventually offer a smaller 250-mile range pack for a lower-priced R1T and R1S.</p>
<p>Even without specific numbers, it&#8217;s clear that Scaringe&#8217;s aspirations and plans extend well beyond &#8220;dozens&#8221; of the Rivian stations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;The scale of a network is not something that you can turn on overnight,&#8221; he said. It takes months of time to get full coverage of the U.S. and years of time to get dense coverage, which by 2023 or 2024, we will certainly have.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the biggest games of the year, &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cyberpunk-2077-a-retro-futuristic-fantasy-with-huge-potential-if-you-can-ignore-the-cyberjank/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>,&#8221; is about to be released, but developer CD Projekt Red is already under fire for an early game sequence with the potential to induce seizures. Players with epilepsy should be warned that there is currently no way to skip this, and the visual feature will be repeated throughout the game.</p>
<p>Strobing lights can induce seizures in some people prone to them, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped many high-profile games from including them for effect. Usually there is a boilerplate warning on boot saying this is a possibility, but in most games it&#8217;s more of a warning that there may potentially be flashing lights of this type, for example if several flashbang grenades went off one after the other. Many games also offer an option to reduce the intensity of flashing lights or otherwise change their appearance, along with other options for accessibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyberpunk&#8221; seems to tread especially dangerous territory fundamentally, as its game world is full of the kind of seedy, flickering-neon lighting one associates with a grimy, futuristic dystopia. But within the first few hours of the game there is a much more severe and thoughtlessly designed event that has already <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/12/07/cyberpunk-2077-epileptic-psa">caused a reviewer at Game Informer to experience a seizure</a>. It involves the (otherwise quite interesting) &#8220;braindances,&#8221; or BDs, which let your character relive experiences recorded by others, by donning a special headset&#8230; that boots up with intense flashing lights:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>When &#8220;suiting up&#8221; for a BD, especially with Judy, V will be given a headset that is meant to onset the instance. The headset fits over both eyes and features a rapid onslaught of white and red blinking LEDs, much like the actual device neurologists use in real life to trigger a seizure when they need to trigger one for diagnosis purposes. If not modeled off of the IRL design, it&#8217;s a very spot-on coincidence, and because of that this is one aspect that I would personally advise you to avoid altogether. When you notice the headset come into play, look away completely or close your eyes. This is a pattern of lights <em>designed </em>to trigger an epileptic episode and it very much did that in my own personal playthrough.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can see the event referred to in the screenshot above (taken afterwards, but you can see the device). I recall this moment quite clearly from my own playthrough, and remember thinking it was rather an intense lightshow indeed. Unfortunately for this person, it caused a serious episode and could do so for many others upon its release on the 10th.</p>
<p>Among the many options for changing the appearance of &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077,&#8221; there isn&#8217;t one for reducing flashing lights that I could find. I&#8217;ve asked CD Projekt Red about this and hopefully they can ship something to mitigate the issue at or near launch. The company did <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1336389181988343812">say on Twitter that it was looking into a solution</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more and more alternative investment marketplaces pop up around specific verticals like art or collectibles, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/indie-gogo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="indie-gogo">Indiegogo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> founder Slava Rubin is launching a Kayak-like platform called <a href="https://www.withvincent.com/">Vincent</a> which helps curious investors get a handle on what the entire asset class has to offer.</p>
<p>Rubin and co-founders Evan Cohen, Eric Cantor and Ross Cohen have raised $2 million for the venture with backing from investors including Uncommon Denominator, ERA Ventures, The Fund and Rubin&#8217;s own firm Humbition. Vincent launched in beta this July but the firm is now ready to take the platform wide with a public launch. Rubin says the team has assembled the &#8220;most comprehensive database of alternate investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rubin has been a driving force behind alternative investments since his Indiegogo days and has helped guide some of the existing legislation that has made investments in alternative assets more tenable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Part of the buzz around alternative investments in 2020 is the result of evolving guidance from stateside regulatory bodies, while added attention comes from the boom around investment platforms that bring users more approachable tools to access financial institutions. Specific verticals may be hoping to build up a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/robinhood" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="robinhood">Robinhood <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-like brand and following around their particular niche, but Vincent is aiming to benefit from rising tides and users eyeing diversification.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Our partners] are really heads down often on a lot of curation around a specific deal and trying to become experts in that space,&#8221; Rubin tells <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/techcrunch" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="techcrunch">TechCrunch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve learned is that the investor is thinking more about trying to get exposure to alternative investments and not only do they want exposure to one alternative investment, they want exposure to the entire asset class.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company currently has partnerships with about 50 platforms, Rubin tells me, including platforms like WeFunder, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sharespost" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sharespost">SharesPost, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Rally Rd. and Otis. The deals which span real estate, venture, collectibles, and art, among others, bring Vincent users access to $2 billion worth of investments, the company says. Users visiting Vincent are asked whether or not they are accredited which routes them to the list of deals they have access to.</p>
<p>Similar to Kayak, people are using Vincent to source the deals, but once they find an asset that tickles their fancy, they&#8217;ve being redirected to the partner platform&#8217;s site or app in order to actually carry out the deal. Vincent collects fees when users are redirected to a partner platform.</p>
<p>Vincent&#8217;s main challenge is building up a brand that resonates with users without actually managing the actual investments themselves. Most of these partner platforms, as Rubin notes, are built around curating and developing an expertise around a specific niche, whether that works in a broader scenario is the big question.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole goal of an aggregator is to really simplify an experience where the market is massively fragmented,&#8221; Rubin says.</p>
<p>Vincent is also aiming to be more than an aggregator, serving up editorial content with a blog and newsletter that the team hopes can make the platform more of a one-stop-shop for investors looking to educate themselves on alternative assets. For his part, Rubin hopes that the gold rush of startups building alternative investment platforms is the perfect time for a player to come in that focuses on streamlining everything.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A third-party contacts app you&#8217;re not using may be handing out your home address to its users. In November, former Yahoo CEO and Google veteran Marissa Mayer and co-founder Enrique Muñoz Torres introduced their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/marissa-mayers-startup-launches-its-first-official-product-sunshine-contacts/">newly rebranded startup Sunshine</a>, and its first product, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sunshine-contacts/id1448555773">Sunshine Contacts.</a> The new iOS app offers to organize your address book by handling duplicates and merges using AI technology, as well as fill in some of the missing bits of information by gathering data from the web &#8212; like LinkedIn profiles, for example.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://twitter.com/freialobo/status/1334689238328217600">some users </a>were surprised to find they suddenly had home addresses for their contacts, too, including for those who were not already Sunshine users.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Sunshine to better understand the situation, given the potential privacy concerns.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We understand there are several ways that users may encounter someone&#8217;s home address in the Sunshine app. A user may already have the address on file in their phone&#8217;s address book, of course, or they may have opted in to allow Sunshine to scan their inbox in order to extract information from email signature lines. This is a feature common to other personal CRM solutions, too, like <a href="https://evercontact.com/">Evercontact</a>.</p>
<p>In the event that someone had signed an email with their home address included in this field, that data could then be added to their contact card in the Sunshine app. In this case, the contact card is updated in the Sunshine Contacts app, which then syncs with your phone&#8217;s address book. But this data is not distributed to any other app users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2075408" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2075408" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2075408" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2075408" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sunshine</p></div></p>
<p>The app also augments contact cards with information acquired by other means. For example, it may use the information you do have to complete missing fields &#8212; like adding a last name, when you had other data that indicated what someone&#8217;s full name is, but hadn&#8217;t completed filling out the card. The app may also be able to pull in data from a LinkedIn profile, if available.</p>
<p>For home addresses, Sunshine is using the Whitepages API.</p>
<p>The company confirmed to TechCrunch it&#8217;s augmenting contact cards with home addresses under some circumstances, even if that contact is not a Sunshine Contacts user. Sunshine says it doesn&#8217;t believe this to be any different from a user going to Google to look for someone&#8217;s contact information on the web &#8212; it&#8217;s just automating the process.</p>
<p>Of course, some would argue when you&#8217;re talking about automating the collection of home addresses for hundreds or potentially thousands of users &#8212; depending on the size of your personal address book database &#8212; it&#8217;s a bit different than if you went googling to find your aunt&#8217;s address so you can mail a Christmas card or called your old college roommate to find out where to send their birthday gift.</p>
<p>However, Sunshine clarified to TechCrunch that it won&#8217;t add the home address except in cases when it determines you have a personal connection to the contact in question.</p>
<p>Here, though, Sunshine enters a gray area where the app and its technology will try to figure out who you know well enough to need a home address.</p>
<p>Before adding the address, Sunshine requires you to have the contact&#8217;s phone number on file in your address book, not just their email. That would eliminate some people you only have a loose connection with through work, for instance. And it only updates with the home address if the partner API is able to associate that address with a phone number you have.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2075413" style="width: 537px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2075413" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2075413" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-4.png?w=527" alt="" width="527" height="671" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-4.png 527w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-4.png?resize=118,150 118w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-4.png?resize=236,300 236w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-4.png?resize=39,50 39w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2075413" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sunshine</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, Sunshine says that it&#8217;s generally able to understand the type of phone number you have on file &#8212; like if it&#8217;s a residential or business line, or if it&#8217;s a landline or mobile number. (It uses APIs to do this, similar to <a href="http://www.strikeiron.com/product-list/phone/mobile-number-detection/">StrikeIron&#8217;s</a> though not that particular one.) It also knows who the phone number belongs to. Using this information and further context, the app tries to determine if a phone number is a personal or a professional number and it will try to understand your relationship with the person who owns that number.</p>
<p>In practice, what this means is that if all the information you had on file for a contact was professional information &#8212; where they worked, a job title, a work email and a phone number, perhaps &#8212; then that person&#8217;s contact card would <em>not</em> be updated to include their home address, too.</p>
<p>And because many people use their personal cell for work, Sunshine won&#8217;t consider someone a &#8220;personal&#8221; relationship just because you have their mobile phone number. For example, if you had only a contact&#8217;s name and a cell number, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to use the app to get their home address.</p>
<p>The result of all this automated analysis is that Sunshine, in theory, only updates contact cards with home addresses where it&#8217;s determined there&#8217;s a personal relationship.</p>
<p>This, of course, doesn&#8217;t take into account some scenarios like bad exes, stalking or a general desire for privacy. Arguably, there are times when someone may have a lot of personal information for a contact in their address book, but the contact in question would rather not have their home address distributed to that person.</p>
<p>The only way to prevent this, presumably, would be to opt out at the source: Whitepages.com. (Once you have your profile URL from the Whitepages website, you can <a href="https://www.whitepages.com/suppression-requests">use this online form</a> to have your information suppressed.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2075407" style="width: 456px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2075407" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2075407" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iPhone-perspective-2.png?w=446" alt="" width="446" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iPhone-perspective-2.png 672w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iPhone-perspective-2.png?resize=98,150 98w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iPhone-perspective-2.png?resize=197,300 197w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iPhone-perspective-2.png?resize=446,680 446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iPhone-perspective-2.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2075407" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sunshine</p></div></p>
<p>The way the app functions raises questions about what is truly private information these days.</p>
<p>Sunshine points out that people&#8217;s home addresses are not as hidden from the world as they may think, which makes them fair game.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that our home addresses are often publicly available. Although it&#8217;s been years since most of us have had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_directory">telephone directory</a> dropped on our doorstep with phone and address listings for people in our city, home addresses today are relatively trivial to find when you know where to look online.</p>
<p>In addition to public records &#8212; like voter registration databases &#8212; there are web-based people finders, too.</p>
<p>Sunshine&#8217;s partner, Whitepages.com, makes visitors pay for its data, but others like TruePeopleSearch.com don&#8217;t have the same paywall. With someone&#8217;s first and last name and city, its website provides access to someone&#8217;s home address, prior addresses, cell phone, age and the names of family members and other close associates. (TruePeopleSearch is not a Sunshine partner, we should clarify.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Marissa Mayer&#8217;s startup launches its first official product, Sunshine Contacts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/marissa-mayers-startup-launches-its-first-official-product-sunshine-contacts/embed/#?secret=GYNX3RjrS7" data-secret="GYNX3RjrS7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Even though this data is &#8220;public,&#8221; it&#8217;s uncomfortable to see it casually distributed in an app, as that makes it even easier to get to than before.</p>
<p>Plus, after years of being burned by data breaches and data privacy scandals, people tend to be more protective of their personal information than before. And, had they been asked, many would probably decline to have their home addresses shared with Sunshine&#8217;s user base. Generally speaking, people appreciate the courtesy of having someone come ask for a home address, when it&#8217;s needed &#8212; they may not want an app creeping the web to find it and hand it out.</p>
<p>Sunshine Contacts is in an invite-only beta in the U.S., so the company has time to reconsider how this feature is implemented based on user feedback before it becomes widely available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Palantir&#8217;s push into federal health work continues. The data analytics company just picked up a new U.S. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/food-and-drug-administration" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="food-and-drug-administration">Food and Drug Administration <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> contract which will span three years for a <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_75F40121F80001_7524_GS35F0086U_4730">total of $44.4 million</a>. The company&#8217;s shares, which have doubled in value over the last two months, are up around 20% on the news.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/palantir-wins-fda-contract-to-power-drug-review-and-inspections?sref=ctSjKj2N">Bloomberg reports</a>, Palantir will help the FDA review drugs, including those developed for COVID-19 treatment, and assess the safety of other FDA-regulated health products like hand sanitizer. The contract will also bring Palantir&#8217;s data analysis software to the FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Oncology Center of Excellence, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>In late September, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/palantir-unilateral-voting-power/">much back and forth with the SEC</a> over its S-1, Palantir went public through a direct listing rather than a traditional IPO. The secretive company, co-founded by Silicon Valley iconoclast Peter Thiel, has attracted unwanted attention in recent years for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/palantir-s1-ice-contract-public-criticism/">ongoing work with ICE</a>, the federal law enforcement agency that carries out deportations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The FDA sits within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which has already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/palantir-covid-19-va-contract/">tapped Palantir</a> for work on the coronavirus crisis. In April, Palantir secured two contracts with HHS for its software, which the White House&#8217;s Coronavirus Task Force used to track trends and make decisions about the pandemic. Palantir also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/palantir-coronavirus-cdc-nhs-gotham-foundry/">worked with the CDC</a> to model the spread of the virus as early as mid-March.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Palantir provides COVID-19 tracking software to CDC and NHS, pitches European health agencies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/palantir-coronavirus-cdc-nhs-gotham-foundry/embed/#?secret=MKxTkhrWEp" data-secret="MKxTkhrWEp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Although it isn&#8217;t clear if the Biden administration will continue to expand federal work with Palantir, the process of distributing vaccines provides another logistical opportunity for the controversial company. Tracking which individuals have received both doses of a vaccine is work that sounds very much in Palantir&#8217;s wheelhouse.</p>
<p>Palantir relies heavily on federal contracts in the U.S., but it also shops its software platforms to governments abroad. In November, the U.K. was considering its software to<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-talks-contact-tracing-u-223245734.html"> aid contact-tracing efforts</a>, though with vaccines already in distribution there it&#8217;s not clear that those talks have continued.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s S-1 filing revealed that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/leaked-palantir-s-1-shows-company-has-125-customers-after-17-years/">Palantir only has 125 clients</a>, with a little over half of its revenue coming from government contracts. While the focus tends to be on Palantir&#8217;s relationships in the U.S., 60% of its business is international, though many of its clients remain unknown both at home and abroad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The aerospace industry has seen an explosion of activity from the world of startups, where bright engineers are foregoing jobs at large corporations and opting instead to raise funding from increasingly ambitious venture capitalists to build their own startups to turn moonshots into business realities. In the latest development, a startup out of Munich has raised the largest round to date in European space tech.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.isaraerospace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isar Aerospace</a>, which is building a micro-satellite launcher significantly smaller and thus lower in price than bigger launchers on the market today, has picked up €75 million ($91 million) in funding. It plans to use the money to continue its research, development and production en route to its first commercial launches, planned for early 2022.</p>
<p>The launcher is not just significant for its design innovation, but if it proves successful, it would make Isar the first European space company to build a successful satellite launcher to compete in the global satellite market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2084404" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The round, a Series B, is being led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lakestar" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lakestar">Lakestar, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with previous backers Earlybird and Vsquared Ventures also contributing significantly, the company said. Earlybird and strategic backer Airbus Ventures led Isar&#8217;s <a href="https://www.isaraerospace.com/article.php?id=2019121001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous round of $17 million</a> in December 2019.</p>
<p>The startup is a spinout of TUM &#8212; the famous Munich Technical University &#8212; where co-founders Daniel Metzler, Josef Fleischmann and Markus Brandl all studied engineering. Fleishmann had a small claim to fame before Isar: he was <a href="https://www.tum.de/nc/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/details/34832/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">part of the team from TUM</a> that built the winning vehicle for the famous Hyperloop competition in the U.S. It was an achievement that landed him a very interesting job offer with a high-profile venture in the U.S. that will go unnamed; he opted to come back to Germany to build his own company, which became Isar.</p>
<p>As Metzler described it in an interview, there is a lot of pent-up demand among companies that need or would like to use satellite technology to augment or replace other data sources. This comes from not just the usual suspects of government or communications entities, but also navigation, GPS and mapping specialists, agribusiness interest, media and internet companies, and any organizations that need the kind of high-speed, far-reaching data access that can only be achieved from space.</p>
<p>The issue is that today&#8217;s technology makes launching satellites into orbit a costly and time-sucking operation.</p>
<p>Launchers are large and go up infrequently, so reserving space on them takes a lot of lead time and investment, and even then a launch can hit a snag over a technical or weather issue.</p>
<p>That issue has somewhat been addressed by the growth of private companies like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which are building more rockets to address demand; and a proliferation of more launch centers in a larger range of locations to increase the number of launch events.</p>
<p>Isar, on the other hand, is taking a very different approach, building not just a new kind of launchpad but a new kind of rocket that will be smaller and less expensive. The idea being that by doing so, it will make it cheaper, easier and more flexible for more organizations to book satellite launches. The aim will be to carry a payload of more than 1,000 kilograms.</p>

<p>As Metzler describes it, the innovations that Isar has built into its system includes the propulsion systems with a design that relies on a different, lighter fuel than what is typically used today in launchers. It&#8217;s also taking a different, simplified approach to the design to further reduce the cost of production.</p>
<p class="p1">Metzler said that typically the price for a satellite launch today can be in the range of between $30,000 and $40,000 per kilogram. &#8220;We aim to go more in the direction of $10,000 per kilogram,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The proposition is interesting enough that Isar says it has already racked up $500 million in &#8220;customer inquiries&#8221; &#8212; essentially a loose commitment for sales as and when it gets its launchers ready to run.</p>
<p class="p1">The company sees satellite launches as an obvious bottleneck that needs addressing.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Going to space once a week is very different from planning launches three years in advance,&#8221; he said of how Isar envisions the future to look, versus how it looks now. And just to note, he said that Isar is building with sustainability in mind: If a piece does not return to earth to be re-used, it&#8217;s designed to be broken up and burned in the atmosphere, leaving no trace of the launcher.</p>
<p>Longer term, Isar might also consider space exploration and other areas of development, an ambitious road map (or sky map, as the case may be) that investors seem willing to support.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud to accompany <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/isar-aerospace" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="isar-aerospace">Isar Aerospace <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as the largest institutional investor on its way to commercially develop space for Europe. Micro-satellites in the low Earth orbit will become a key platform technology with enormous innovation and business potential in the coming decades. That is why we need a competitive space industry in Europe if we do not want to witness the next technological leaps as a spectator,&#8221; said Hendrik Brandis, co-founding partner of Earlybird. &#8220;I am particularly pleased that we are able to back a financing round of this magnitude entirely with German money. This is a clear sign of how successfully the startup and VC industry has developed in this country in recent years.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French President <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/emmanuel-macron" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sat down with Niklas Zennström for an interview on the European tech ecosystem. Macron listed everything that’s needed to create European tech giants that compete with the biggest American and Chinese tech companies.</p>
<p>According to him, Europe needs to focus on “financing, integration of our markets and an actual single market, regulation for privacy and technological innovation, and having European data, a European cloud and European technologies to be sure that we don’t depend on others,” Macron said.</p>
<p>Zennström founded Skype and is currently running prolific investment firm <a href="https://www.atomico.com">Atomico</a>. As Zennström isn’t a reporter, he wasn’t particularly confrontational during the pre-recorded interview. Earlier today, his firm released its annual <a href="https://2020.stateofeuropeantech.com">State of European Tech report</a> and held a virtual conference that featured Macron&#8217;s interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the report, you can see that French startups attracted more than $5 billion in funding rounds in 2020. Macron listed some of the reasons why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/27/the-year-of-the-french-unicorns/">French startups have been growing</a>, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/05/france-overhauls-its-special-visa-for-tech-talent/">French Tech Visa</a>, some tax reforms (flat tax on capital gains and the end of the wealth tax except on real estate), some private efforts to improve diversity, such as Station F and Ecole 42, etc.</p>
<p>But Zennström didn’t come to the Elysée Palace for Macron’s year-end performance review. Macron wants to foster a truly European tech ecosystem without borders. “We need European financing, European solutions, European talent. Now, when you look at the map, we have what we call the GAFA in the U.S., the BATX in China and GDPR in Europe,” Macron said.</p>
<p>“We have regulation, fair point. But we don’t have the equivalent of these very, very large caps,” he added.</p>
<p>According to him, it starts with European financing. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">Last year</a>, the French government convinced institutional investors to invest more heavily in late-stage tech companies. Other countries should follow suit to create more public tech companies in Europe.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the French government unveiled an ambitious <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/france-announces-4-3-billion-plan-to-support-startups/">support plan</a> for startups during the economic crisis. “It’s been copied by other European countries,” a source close to the president said.</p>
<p>But Macron doesn’t want to be the inspiration for other countries. He wants to position himself as the leader of a single European tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>“We need an actual European digital market. Today, a lot of entrepreneurs have to deal with 27 regulations. This is why the different directives arriving in the coming weeks, around mid-December — for digital services and digital markets — are critical,” he said.</p>
<p>And yet, the current economic crisis has shown us that European governments all have their own stimulus plans. In Europe, when it comes to taking ambitious economic decisions, it’s hard to find common ground. Let&#8217;s see if the same is true with tech ecosystems.</p>
