										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spending on cosmetics has usually weathered economic crises, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/18/how-covid-19-upended-the-lipstick-index-pandemic-cosmetic-sales-makeup-skincare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that changed during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, with stay-at-home orders and masks tempering people’s desire to wear makeup. This forced retailers to accelerate their online strategies, finding new ways to capture shoppers&#8217; attention without in-store samples. Virtual beauty try-on technology, like the ones developed by Perfect Corp., will play an important role in this shift to digital. The company announced today it has raised a Series C of $50 million led by Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Based in New Taipei City, Taiwan and led by chief executive officer Alice Chang, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/perfect-corp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="perfect-corp">Perfect Corp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. is probably best known to consumers for its beauty app, YouCam Makeup, which lets users &#8220;try on&#8221; virtual samples from over 300 global brands, including ones owned by beauty conglomerates Estée Lauder and L’Oreal Paris. Launched in 2014, YouCam Makeup now counts about 40 million to 50 million monthly active users and has expanded from augmented selfies to include live-streams and tutorials from beauty influencers, social features and a &#8220;Skin Score&#8221; feature.</p>
<p>Perfect Corp.&#8217;s technology is also used for in-store retail, e-commerce and social media tools. For example, its tech helped create a new augmented reality-powered try-on tool for Google Search that launched last month (its was previously used for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/youtubes-new-ar-feature-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-while-watching-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube’s makeup try-on features</a>, too). It also <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201210005585/en/Perfect-Corp.-and-Snap-Inc.-Partner-to-Support-Interactive-AR-Try-On-Experiences-for-Beauty-Brands" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked with Snap </a>to integrate beauty try-on features into Snapchat.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google now lets you virtually try on makeup using AR, shop from influencer videos&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-now-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-using-ar-shop-from-influencer-videos/embed/#?secret=r5eLp1WDiT" data-secret="r5eLp1WDiT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new funding brings Perfect Corp.’s total raised so far to about $130 million. Its last funding announcement <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171018005623/en/Beauty-App-Developer-Perfect-Corp.-Closes-25-Million-Series-A-Funding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was a $25 million Series A in October 2017</a>. The Series B will be used to further develop Perfect Corp.’s technology for multichannel retail and open more international offices (it currently has operations in 11 cities).</p>
<p>In a press statement, Xinyi Feng, a managing director in the Merchant Banking Division of Goldman Sachs, said, &#8220;The integration of technology through artificial intelligence, machine learning and augmented reality into the beauty industry will unlock significant advantages, including amplification of digital sales channels, increased personalization and deeper consumer engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perfect Corp. will also be part of the investment firm’s <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/what-we-do/investing-and-lending/launch-with-gs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Launch with GS</a>, a $500 million investment initiative to support a diverse, international cohort of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The company uses facial landmark tracking technology, which creates a &#8220;3D mesh&#8221; around users’ faces so beauty try-ons look more realistic. In terms of privacy, chief strategy officer Louis Chen told TechCrunch that no user data, including photos or biometrics, is saved, and all computing is done within the user’s phone.</p>
<p>The vast majority, or about 90%, of Perfect Corp’s clients are cosmetic or skincare brands, while the rest sell haircare, hair coloring or accessories. Chen said the goal of Perfect Corp’s technology is to replicate the experience of trying on makeup in a store as closely as possible. When a user virtually applies lipstick, for example, they don’t just see the color on their lips, but also the texture, like matte, glossy, shimmer or metallic (the company currently offers seven lipstick textures, which Chen said is the most in the industry).</p>
<p>While sales of makeup have dropped during the pandemic, interest in skincare has grown. A <a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2020/more-u-s--women-are-using-facial-skincare-products-today--reports-the-npd-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 2020 report from the NPD Group</a> found that American women are buying more types of products than they were last year, and using them more frequently. To help brands capitalize on that, Perfect Corp. recently launched a tool <a href="https://www.perfectcorp.com/consumer/news/detail?id=1457" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called AI Skin Diagnostic solution</a>, which it says verified by dermatologists and grades facial skin on eight metrics, including moisture, wrinkles and dark circles. The tool can be used on skincare brand websites to recommend products to shoppers.</p>
<p>Before COVID-19, YouCam Makeup and the company’s augmented reality try-on tools appealed to Gen Z shoppers who are comfortable with selfies and filters. But the pandemic is forcing makeup and skincare brands to speed up their adaption of technology for all shoppers. As a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Consumer%20Packaged%20Goods/Our%20Insights/How%20COVID%2019%20is%20changing%20the%20world%20of%20beauty/How-COVID-19-is-changing-the-world-of-beauty-vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McKinsey report about the impact of COVID-19 on the beauty industry </a>put it, &#8220;the use of artificial intelligence for testing, discovery and customization will need to accelerate as concerns about safety and hygiene fundamentally disrupt product testing and in-person consultations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Depending on the geography of the brand, in the past probably only 10%, no more than 20%, of their business was direct to consumer, while 80% was going through retail distribution and distribution partnerships, the network they already built over the year,&#8221; said Chen. But beauty companies are investing more heavily in e-commerce now, and Perfect Corp. capitalizes on that by offering its technology as a SaaS.</p>
<p>Another way Perfect Corp. has adapted its offerings during the pandemic is offering remote consultation tools, which means beauty and skincare consultants who usually work in salons or a store like Ulta can demonstrate makeup looks on clients through video calls instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every single thing we are building now is not a siloed technology,&#8221; said Chang. &#8220;It’s now always combined with video-streaming.&#8221; In addition to one-on-one chats, this also means live-cast shopping, which is extremely popular in China and gradually taking off in other countries, and the kind of AR technology that was integrated into YouTube and Snapchat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eating less meat is the easiest way for anyone to lower their carbon footprint and the prepared food delivery startup, <a href="https://www.thistle.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thistle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has just raised $10.3 million to make that choice even easier for consumers. </span></p>
<p>The company delivers plant-based full menus (with meat options available for customers that want them) for its customers along with a range of juices and sides.</p>
<p>That pitch of making tweaks to customer behavior for more conscious consumerism and healthy eating was enough to attract Series B funding from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/powerplant-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="powerplant-ventures">PowerPlant Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from Siddhi Capital, Alumni Ventures Group, and the venture arm of Rich Products Corp.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said it would use the financing to expand geographically &#8212; setting up a production facility on the East Coast to bring its healthy prepared meals to potential customers along the Eastern seaboard.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With this funding, we’ll be able to support even more people through scientific, evidence-based principles of nutrition that lead to optimal wellness, enjoyable eating, and a healthier planet,&#8221; said Ashwin Cheryian, Co-Founder and CEO of Thistle in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch seven years ago, Thistle has served over 5 million meals and is intent to not just launch in new geographies, but provide more robust services for its customers. Those services will include virtual consultations with an in-house registered Thistle dietitian who can give customers guidance on the best diet for their needs, the company said.   </span></p>
<p>The new offering was born from customer feedback, according to chief operating officer and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/thistle" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="thistle">Thistle <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> co-founder Shiri Avnery.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We tested the program last fall, and the responses were overwhelmingly positive. We’re excited to be able to officially roll out the program to our customers this month, with the primary goal to further support our customers along each stage of their wellness journey,&#8221; Avnery said. </span></p>
<p>The husband and wife duo offer menu plans starting at $42 a week or $11.50 per meal, according to the company&#8217;s website and all meals are gluten and dairy free (with vegan options available).</p>
<p>The financing for Thistle comes during a plant-based food boom that&#8217;s been sweeping the nation &#8212; and the nation&#8217;s investors.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eating a plant-forward diet is the single most impactful way to reduce your overall environmental footprint, reducing climate change, pollution, resource consumption, and species extinction,” said Dan Gluck, Managing Partner of PowerPlant Ventures, in a statement. “Consumer demand for plant-based foods is outperforming total food growth today, and this trend is expected to increase over the next decade as more people realize that eating more plants is a critical component to the long-term health of both the planet and our population.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sports have been among some of the most popular and lucrative media plays in the world, luring broadcasters, advertisers and consumers to fork out huge sums to secure the chance to watch (and sponsor) their favorite teams and athletes.</p>
<p>That content, unsurprisingly, also typically costs a ton of money to produce, narrowing the production and distribution funnel even more. But today, a startup that&#8217;s cracked open that model with an autonomous, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ai">AI <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-based camera that lets any team record, edit and distribute their games, is announcing a round of funding to build out its business targeting the long tail of sporting teams and fixtures.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/veo-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="veo-2">Veo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Technologies, a Copenhagen startup that has designed a video camera and cloud-based subscription service to record and then automatically pick out highlights of games, which it then hosts on a platform for its customers to access and share that video content, has picked up €20 million (around $24.5 million) in a Series B round of funding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is being led by Danish investor Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker, with participation from US-based Courtside VC, France&#8217;s Ventech and Denmark&#8217;s SEED Capital. Veo&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Henrik Teisbæk said in an interview that the startup is not disclosing its valuation, but a source close to funding tells me that it&#8217;s well over $100 million.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Teisbæk said that the plan will be to use to the funds to continue expanding the company&#8217;s business on two levels. First, Veo will be digging into expanding its US operations, with an office in Miami. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Second, it plans to continue enhancing the scope of its technology: </span>The company started out optimising its computer vision software to record and track the matches for the most popular team sport in the world, football (soccer to US readers), with customers buying the cameras &#8212; which retail for $800 &#8212; and the corresponding (mandatory) subscriptions &#8212; $1,200 annually &#8212; both to record games for spectators, as well as to use the footage for all kinds of practical purposes like training and recruitment videos. The key is that the cameras can be set up and left to run on their own. Once they are in place, they can record using wide-angles the majority of a soccer field (or whatever playing space is being used) and then zoom and edit down based on that.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1880730" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Veo-on-grass.png?w=680" alt="Veo on grass" width="680" height="396" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Veo-on-grass.png 2172w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Veo-on-grass.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Veo-on-grass.png?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Veo-on-grass.png?resize=768,448 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Veo-on-grass.png?resize=680,396 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Veo-on-grass.png?resize=1536,895 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Veo-on-grass.png?resize=2048,1194 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Veo-on-grass.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Now, Veo is building the computer vision algorithms to expand that proposition into a plethora of other team-based sports including rugby, basketball and hockey, and it is ramping up the kinds of analytics that it can provide around the clips that it generates as well as the wider match itself.</p>
<p>Even with the slowdown in a lot of sporting activity this year due to Covid &#8212; in the UK for example, we&#8217;re in a lockdown again where team sports below professional leagues, excepting teams for disabled people, have been prohibited &#8212; Veo has seen a lot of growth.</p>
<p>The startup currently works with some 5,000 clubs globally ranging from professional sports teams through to amateur clubs for children, and it has recorded and tracked 200,000 games since opening for business in 2018, with a large proportion of that volume in the last year and in the US.</p>
<p>For a point of reference, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/veo-raises-6m-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2019</a>, when we covered a $6 million round for Veo, the startup had racked up 1,000 clubs and 25,000 games, pointing to customer growth of 400% in that period.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has indeed altered the playing field &#8212; literally and figuratively &#8212; for sports in the past year. Spectators, athletes, and supporting staff need to be just as mindful as anyone else when it comes to spreading the coronavirus.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not just led to a change in how many games are being played, but also for attendance: witness the huge lengths that the NBA went to last year to create an extensive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_Bubble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">isolation bubble in Orlando, Florida</a>, to play out the season, with no actual fans in physical seats watching games, but all games and fans virtually streamed into the events as they happened.</p>
<p>That NBA effort, needless to say, came at a huge financial cost, one that any lesser league would never be able to carry, and so that predicament has led to an interesting use case for Veo.</p>
<p>Pre-pandemic, the Danish startup was quietly building its business around catering to the long tail of sporting organizations who &#8212; even in the best of times &#8212; would be hard pressed to find the funds to buy cameras and/or hire videographers to record games, not just an essential part of how people can enjoy a sporting event, but useful for helping with team development.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a perception that football is already being recorded and broadcast, but in the UK (for example) it&#8217;s only the Premier League,&#8221; Teisbæk said. &#8220;If you go down o<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ne or two steps from that, nothing is being recorded.&#8221; Before Veo, to record a football game, he added, &#8220;you need a guy sitting on a scaffold, and time and money to then cut that down to highlights. It’s just too cumbersome. But v</span>ideo is the best tool there is to develop talent. Kids are visual learners. And it&#8217;s a great way to get recruited sending videos to colleges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those use cases then expanded with the pandemic, he said. &#8220;Under cornavirus rules, parents cannot go out and watch their kids, and so video becomes a tool to follow those matches.&#8221;</p>
<h2>&#8216;We&#8217;re a Shopify, not an Amazon&#8217;</h2>
<p>The business model for Veo up to now has largely been around what Teisbæk described as &#8220;the long tail theory&#8221;, which in the case of sports works out, he said, as &#8220;There won’t be many viewers for each match, but there are millions of matches out there.&#8221; But if you consider how a lot of high school sports will attract locals beyond those currently attached to a school &#8212; you have alumni supporters and fans, as well as local businesses and neighborhoods &#8212; even that long tail audience might be bigger than one might imagine.</p>
<p>Veo&#8217;s long-tail focus has inevitably meant that its target users are in the wide array of amateur or semi-pro clubs and the people associated with them, but interestingly it has also spilled into big names, too.</p>
<p>Veo&#8217;s cameras are being used by professional soccer clubs in the Premier League, Spain&#8217;s La Liga, Italy&#8217;s Serie A and France&#8217;s Ligue 1, as well as several clubs in the MLS such as Inter Miami, Austin FC, Atlanta United and FC Cincinnati. Teisbæk noted that while this might never be for primary coverage, it&#8217;s there to supplement for training and also be used in the academies attached to those organizations.</p>
<p>The plan longer term, he said, is not to build its own media empire with trove of content that it has amassed, but to be an enabler for creating that content for its customers, who can in turn use it as they wish. It&#8217;s a &#8220;Shopify, not an Amazon,&#8221; said Teisbæk.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not building the next ESPN, but we are helping the clubs unlock these connections that are already in place by way of our technology,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to help help them capture and stream their matches and their play for the audience that is there today.&#8221;</p>
<p>That may be how he views the opportunity, but some investors are already eyeing up the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Vasu Kulkarni, a partner at Courtside VC &#8212; a firm that has focused (as its name might imply) on backing a lot of different sports-related businesses, with The Athletic, Beam (acquired by Microsoft), and <a href="http://courtsidevc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many others</a> in its portfolio &#8212; said that he&#8217;d been looking to back a company like Veo, building a smart, tech-enabled way to record and parse sports in a more cost-effective way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent close to four years trying to find a company trying to do that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been a believer in sports content captured at the long tail,&#8221; he said. Coincidentally, he himself started a company called Krossover in his dorm room to help somewhat with tracking and recording sports training. <a href="https://www.hudl.com/blog/krossover-joins-hudl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Krossover eventually was acquired by Hudl</a>, which Veo sees as a competitor.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never have the NBA finals recorded on Veo, there is just too much at stake, but when you start to look at all the areas where there isn&#8217;t enough mass media value to hire people, to produce and livestream, you get to the point where computer vision and AI are going to be doing the filming to get rid of the cost.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that the economics are important here: the camera needs to be less than $1,000 (which it is) and produce something demonstrably better than &#8220;a parent with a Best Buy camcorder that was picked up for $100.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kulkarni thinks that longer term there could definitely be an opportunity to consider how to help clubs bring that content to a wider audience, especially using highlights and focusing on the best of the best in amateur games &#8212; which of course are the precursors to some of those players one day being world-famous elite athletes. (Think of how exciting it is to see the footage of Michael Jordan playing as a young student for some context here.) &#8220;AI will be able to pull out the best 10-15 plays and stitch them together for highlight reels,&#8221; he said, something that could feasibly find a market with sports fans wider than just the parents of the actual players.</p>
<p>All of that then feeds a bigger market for what has started to feel like an insatiable appetite for sports, one that, if anything, has found even more audience at a time when many are spending more time at home and watching video overall. &#8220;The more video you get from the sport, the better the sport gets, for players and fans,&#8221; Teisbæk said.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The decision to suspend the account of a high profile national broadcaster appears to have been related to its policies on COVID-19 misinformation. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-talkradio-youtube/uk-broadcaster-talkradio-reinstated-on-youtube-idUSKBN29A1MO">Reuters</a> reports that some of its presenters have been critical of government measures to slow the spread of coronavirus as excessive or ill-targeted.</p>
<p>However the tech giant&#8217;s decision to ban a national broadcaster was quickly criticized by cabinet minister, Michael Gove, who went on TalkRadio yesterday to defended its right to ask questions about government policy vis-a-vis the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The ban also triggered an intervention from News Corp&#8217;s executive chairman, Rupert Murdoch, according to the <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/media/youtube-talkradio-ban-rupert-murdoch-google-coronavirus-817954">i newspaper</a>, which reports that Murdoch accused the Google-owned service of setting a &#8220;dangerous precedent&#8221; and &#8220;censorship of free speech and legitimate national debate&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a statement today confirming it has reinstated TalkRadio&#8217;s account, a YouTube spokesperson told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>TalkRadio’s YouTube channel was briefly suspended, but upon further review, has now been reinstated. We quickly remove flagged content that violate our <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.youtube.com_about_policies_-23community-2Dguidelines&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=tq9bLrSQ8zIr87VusnUS9yAL0Jw_xnDiPuZjNR4EDIQ&amp;r=QG4rkcc0D0I4SyAPUH8dxPk-FdbvhI19Et6JtUy6WK8&amp;m=m2TQMTm-yb1Th9dgpnh3GDMcQQVYvYeEhUa4OlY7EXk&amp;s=AaLzoOqFX4Oia0zXLRymTgf3BAYyvc5GYhXRUtmv3qM&amp;e=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u%3Dhttps-3A__www.youtube.com_about_policies_-23community-2Dguidelines%26d%3DDwMFaQ%26c%3Dtq9bLrSQ8zIr87VusnUS9yAL0Jw_xnDiPuZjNR4EDIQ%26r%3DQG4rkcc0D0I4SyAPUH8dxPk-FdbvhI19Et6JtUy6WK8%26m%3Dm2TQMTm-yb1Th9dgpnh3GDMcQQVYvYeEhUa4OlY7EXk%26s%3DAaLzoOqFX4Oia0zXLRymTgf3BAYyvc5GYhXRUtmv3qM%26e%3D&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610014445764000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqqWPC6f8o5SqlZwR_96kfeo356A">Community Guidelines</a>, including COVID-19 content that explicitly contradict expert consensus from local health authorities or the World Health Organization. We make exceptions for material posted with an educational, documentary, scientific or artistic purpose, as was deemed in this case.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear which type of exception YouTube is applying in TalkRadio&#8217;s case to justify reinstating the station &#8212; given opinionated radio could span all categories, depending on the specific content.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/media/youtube-talkradio-ban-rupert-murdoch-google-coronavirus-817954">i</a>, TalkRadio had received earlier strikes in October and December for YouTube policy breaches. The third strike that led to its (brief) suspension is thought to relate to an interview between one of its hosts, Julia Hartley-Brewer, and former National Education Union president, Amanda Martin, about whether teachers should be given the highest priority for COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove tells Julia on talkRADIO that big tech companies should not censor those who question the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic: &quot;It&#39;s important their voices are heard.&quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/JuliaHB1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JuliaHB1</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelgove?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@michaelgove</a> <a href="https://t.co/j2skQCW8he">pic.twitter.com/j2skQCW8he</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The TalkRadio ban-reversal is just the latest in a long-running saga of tech giant moderation decisions colliding with concerns for freedom of expression &#8212; even as the stuff that platforms choose to leave up can often be no less controversial. (Although concern about risks to public health from coronavirus misinformation spreading and being amplified online have undoubtedly added extra pitfalls to platform moderation business as usual.)</p>
<p>The common thread of concern is powerful, private entities &#8212; which are not regulated in the same way (UK) broadcasters are &#8212; continue to have their hands on the &#8216;acceptable speech&#8217; lever.</p>
<p>Change is coming in the UK, though: The government is working on a legislative proposal that will bring big tech under <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ofcom" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ofcom">Ofcom&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> regulatory umbrella. (And as TalkRadio points out in its earlier statement its output is already regulated by Ofcom.)</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Under the plan Ofcom will oversee platforms compliance and get the power to block non-compliant digital services from being accessed, as well as the ability to levy huge fines for breaches.   </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sentibio.com/">Senti Biosciences</a>, a company developing cancer therapies using a new programmable biology platform, said it has raised $105 million in a new round of financing led by the venture arm of life sciences giant, Bayer.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s technology uses new computational biological techniques to manufacture cell and gene therapies that can more precisely target specific cells in the body.</p>
<p>Senti Bio&#8217;s chief executive, Tim Lu, compares his company&#8217;s new tech to the difference between basic programming and object oriented programming. &#8220;Instead of creating a program that just says &#8216;Hello world&#8217;, you can introduce &#8216;if&#8217; statements and object oriented programming,&#8221; said Lu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By building genetic material that can target multiple receptors, Senti Bio&#8217;s therapies can be more precise in the way they identify genetic material in the body and deliver the kinds of therapies directly to the pathogens. &#8220;&#8221;Instead of the cell expressing a single receptor&#8230; now we have two receptors,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is initially applying its gene circuit technology platform to develop therapies that use what are called chimeric antigen receptor natural killer (CAR-NK) cells that can target cancer cells in the body and eliminate them. Many existing cell and gene therapies use chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, which are white blood cells in the body that are critical to immune response and destroy cellular pathogens in the body.</p>
<p>However, T-cell-based therapies can be toxic to patients, stimulating immune responses that can be almost as dangerous as the pathogens themselves. Using CAR-NK cells produces similar results with fewer side effects.<br />
That&#8217;s independent of the gene circuit,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;The gene circuit gets you specificity&#8230; Right now when you use a CAR-T cell or a CAR-NK cell&#8230; you find a target and hope that it doesn&#8217;t affect normal cells. We can build logic in our gene circuits in the cell that means a CAR-NK cell can identify two targets rather than one.&#8221;</p>
<p>That increased targeting means lower risks of healthy cells being destroyed alongside mutations or pathogens that are in the body.</p>
<p>For Lu and his co-founders &#8212; fellow MIT professor <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jim-collins-3" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jim-collins-3">Jim Collins, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boston-university" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boston-university">Boston University <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> professor, Wilson Wong, and longtime synthetic biology operator, Phillip Lee &#8212; Senti Bio is the culmination of decades of work in the field.</p>
<p>&#8220;I compare it to the early days of semiconductor work,&#8221; Lu said of the journey to develop this gene circuit technology. &#8220;There were bits and pieces of technology being developed in research labs, but to realize the scale at which you need, this has to be done at the industrial level.&#8221;</p>
<p>So licensing work from MIT, Boston University and Stanford, Lu and his co-founders set out to take this work out of the labs to start a company.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the company was started it was a bag of tools and the know-how on how to use them,&#8221; Lu said. But it wasn&#8217;t a fully developed platform. </span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s what the company now has and with the new capital from Leaps by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bayer-ag-germany" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bayer-ag-germany">Bayer <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and its other investors, Senti is ready to start commercializing.</p>
<p>The first products will be therapies for acute myeloid leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, and other, undisclosed, solid tumor targets, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Leaps by Bayer’s mission is to invest in breakthrough technologies that may transform the lives of millions of patients for the better,” said Juergen Eckhardt, MD, Head of Leaps by Bayer. “We believe that synthetic biology will become an important pillar in next-generation cell and gene therapy, and that Senti Bio’s leadership in designing and optimizing biological circuits fits precisely with our ambition to prevent and cure cancer and to regenerate lost tissue function.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu and his co-founders also see their work as a platform for developing other cell therapies for other diseases and applications &#8212; and intend to partner with other pharmaceutical companies to bring those products to market.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Over the past two years, our team has designed, built and tested thousands of sophisticated gene circuits to drive a robust product pipeline, focused initially on allogeneic CAR-NK cell therapies for difficult-to-treat liquid and solid tumor indications,&#8221; Lu said in a statement. &#8220;I look forward to continued platform and pipeline advancements, including starting IND-enabling studies in 2021.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new financing round brings Senti&#8217;s total capital raised to just under $160 million and Lu said the new money will be used to ramp up manufacturing and accelerate its work partnering with other pharmaceutical companies. </span></p>
<p>The current timeframe is to get its investigational new drug permits filed by late 2022 and early 2023 and have initial clinical trials begun in 2023.</p>
<p>Developing gene circuits is new and expanding field with a number of players including Cell Design Labs, which was acquired by Gilead in 2017 for up to $567 million. Other companies working on similar therapies include <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/crispr-therapeutics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="crispr-therapeutics">CRISPR Therapeutics, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Intellius, and Editas, Lu said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Covid-19 pandemic and specifically need for social distancing to slow the spread of the virus have continued to keep many of us away from the office. Now, increasingly, many organizations and people believe that it could usher in a more permanent shift to remote, distributed and virtual work. Today, a startup that has built a set of tools specifically to help salespeople with that change &#8212; by way of digital sales &#8212; has raised a substantial growth round to meet that demand.</p>
<p><a href="http://salesloft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SalesLoft</a>, a sales platform based out of Atlanta, Georgia that provides AI-baseed tools to help salespeople run their sales process virtually &#8212; from finding and following up on leads, through to helping them sell with virtual coaching tools, and then assisting in the post-sales process &#8212; has closed $100 million in funding.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Kyle Porter confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is now valued at $1.1 billion post-money, a substantial hike on its previous valuation. In April 2019, well before any global health pandemics, the company had raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/25/salesloft-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Series D of $70 million at around a $600 million valuation</a> (a figure we confirmed at the time with sources close to the company).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest round is being led by Owl Rock Capital, with previous investors Insight Partners, HarbourVest, and Emergence Capital &#8212; a VC focused specifically on enterprise startups, which notably was an early backer of Zoom and many others &#8212; also participating.</p>
<p>SalesLoft has now raised some $245 million, an impressive sum for any startup, but also worth pointing out for the fact that its not based out of the Valley but Atlanta, Georgia (a state in the news for other reasons at the moment, as the focus of a hotly contested US Senate runoff election).</p>

<p>The company has been on a growth tear for several years now, as one of the big players in the area of so-called sales engagement: tools to help salespeople sell better to clients (or would-be clients), which can include real-time monitoring of interactions to provide coaching to improve the process, suggestions for supplementary content to enhance the pitch, and more basic software simply to manage records and communications.</p>
<p>Even before the pandemic hit, this was a key growth area in enterprise software, with both in-person and online/digital salespeople relying on these kinds of products to help them get more of an edge with their work, but a lot of the focus had really been on inside sales (B2B sales focusing on bigger purchases). Porter described the effect of Covid-19 as a &#8220;tailwind&#8221; propelling that already strong trend.</p>
<p>&#8220;The effects of Covid have been a tailwind due to the effects of digital selling,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All sellers immediately became remote. But now the genie is out of the bottle and not going back in. It&#8217;s meant that inside sales are now all sales. Whether the opportunities are mid-funnel or upgrades or renewals, we are establishing ourselves as the engagement platform of record because it&#8217;s all becoming digital and all sellers are finding more success.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that SalesLoft&#8217;s own sales cycle has improved by 40% since the pandemic, a reflection, he said, of the &#8220;urgency and need&#8221; for tools like those that the startup develops.</p>
<p>Another shift has been in terms of the kinds of customers SalesLoft works with. The company originally was focused on the mid-market, but that has changed with more larger enterprises also coming on board. Google, LinkedIn (which backs SalesLoft and is in a strategic partnership with it), Cisco, Dell and IBM are all customers, and Porter said that more &#8220;mainstream&#8221; businesses like Cargil, 3M and Standard &amp; Poor are also increasingly becoming clients.</p>
<p>That is leading the startup to building out bigger solutions, beyond the basic pitch of &#8220;sales engagement&#8221; that has been SalesLoft&#8217;s mainstay up to now. The company competes against a plethora of others including of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/06/clari-platform-aims-to-unify-go-to-market-data/">Clari</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/chorus-ai-rings-up-33m-for-its-platform-that-analyses-sales-calls-to-close-more-deals/">Chorus.ai</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/gong-an-ai-based-language-tool-to-help-sales-and-customer-service-reps-nabs-20m/">Gong</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/conversica-which-uses-ai-to-replicate-sales-agents-raises-31m-now-valued-around-300m/">Conversica</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/afiniti-crm-ai/">Afiniti</a> and <a href="https://www.outreach.io/">Outreach</a>, as well as biggies like Salesforce. Outreach, notably, had a big mid-Covid round of its own, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/outreach-nabs-50m-at-a-1-33b-valuation-for-its-sales-engagement-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raising at a $1.3 billion valuation in June last year</a>, a mark of that wider market demand. Porter notes that SalesLoft&#8217;s big selling point is that it offers an increasingly end-to-end sales solution to customers, meaning less shopping around.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Business-to-business marketplace <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/udaan" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="udaan">Udaan <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has raised $280 million from new and existing investors as the Indian startup builds a war-chest to accelerate its growth and fend off rivals.</p>
<p>The new capital is not part of a new financing round but is an extension of Series D. The Bangalore-based startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/udaan-series-d/">secured $585 million prior to the new capital</a> as part of its Series D round and has overall raised $1.15 billion to date, is now valued at over $3.1 billion, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Octahedron Capital and Moonstone Capital are financing the fresh capital, with participation from existing investors <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lightspeed-financial" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lightspeed-financial">Lightspeed <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Venture Partners, partners of DST Global, GGV Capital, Altimeter Capital, and Tencent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Much of the business-to-business market in India remains unorganized. This means that merchants in the nation today have to travel to other cities &#8212; where all the major dealers operate &#8212; to stock up their inventory. But these merchants don’t have much leverage to negotiate, so they struggle to find best-value for money and access to a wider selection of catalog.</p>
<p><a href="https://udaan.com/">Udaan</a>, co-founded by three former Flipkart executives, is solving this problem by connecting small retailers with wholesalers and traders. The startup today serves over 3 million retailers and small and medium-sized businesses and it has signed up thousands of brands including Coca Cola, PepsiCo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/indian-electronics-and-lifestyle-brand-boat-raises-100-million-from-warburg-pincus/">Boat Lifestyle</a>, Micromax, HP, LG, ITC, HUL, and P&amp;G.</p>
<p>Amod Malviya, co-founder of Udaan, said in a statement that the coronavirus pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to order a nationwide lockdown and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/amazon-prioritizes-essential-products-in-india-temporarily-discontinues-lower-priority-items/">put restrictions on e-commerce firms</a>, underscored the significance of small businesses and mom-and-pop shops (popularly known as kiranas) in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Udaan is at the forefront of this uniquely Indian e-commerce opportunity, emerging in the last 4 years as one of the largest e-commerce platforms in India, while taking an India-first mobile-first approach to e-commerce. This financing enables us to further our journey of taking e-commerce to the depth and breadth of the country, with Udaan’s unique low-cost model for core middle India,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Other than the inventory problem, Udaan also helps merchants secure working capital. Small businesses, especially mom-and-pop shops, rely on money they secure from selling their existing inventory for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/drip-capital-seriesb/">buying their next batch</a>. Since Udaan is able to see the engagement of different merchants on the platform, it is able to determine who all it could safely grant working capital ahead on time.</p>
<p>These decades-old challenges also present a massive potential reward to firms. &#8220;The unaddressed SME credit demand in India is ~US$300-$350 billion, with more than 90% of current demand being met by banks. A typical digital SME lender focusses on Rs1-5 million ($13,575 to $67,875) ticket size with no collateral, average tenure ~12-18 months, and with some ecosystem anchor,” analysts at Bank of America wrote in a recent equity research report, obtained by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;While growth potential in theory is high, despite much higher yields, we don’t find their economics to be much superior to banks even in a steady state. Overall, steady state ROE (return on equity) for an average digital SME lender is unlikely to be much more than 18% levels — not meaningfully higher than a big private bank,&#8221; they wrote.</p>
<p>Udaan said it will deploy the fresh capital in further creation of the market, and expanding the selection of products and categories it offers. Additionally, the four-year-old startup said it will expand its financing capabilities for small businesses and extend its supply chain network.</p>
<p>The fresh fundraise &#8220;reflects the long-term truly transformative and fundamental value creation potential that Udaan platform offers for the lives and businesses of Indian MSMEs, who are major job creators and form the backbone of our economy and the society,&#8221; said Malviya. “Participation of existing and new investors in this financing highlights the increasing recognition of capital markets of this unique nature of the Indian market, and the opportunity it offers.</p>
<p>In the past two years, scores of startups and giants such as Reliance, and Amazon have started to explore the business-to-business market in India, which is currently dominated by Udaan.</p>
<p>For instance, India&#8217;s largest retail chain Reliance Retail, which serves more than 3.5 million customers each week through its nearly 10,000 physical stores in more than 6,500 cities and towns in the country, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/30/reliance-retail-jiomart-launch/">entered the e-commerce space with JioMart</a> in late 2019 through a joint venture with sister subsidiary telecom giant Jio Platforms. By mid last year, JioMart had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/jiomart-the-e-commerce-venture-by-indias-richest-man-launches-in-additional-cities/">established presence in over 200 Indian cities and towns</a> &#8212; though currently its reach within those cities and customer service leave a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Reliance Retail also maintains a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/26/reliance-and-facebook-pilot-jiomart-orders-on-whatsapp/">partnership with Facebook for WhatsApp integration</a>. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook, </a>which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">invested $5.7 billion in Jio Platforms earlier this year</a>, has said that it will explore various ways to work with Reliance to digitize the nation’s mom and pop stores, as well as other small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>For JioMart, Reliance Retail is working with retail shops, giving them a digital point-of-sale machine to make it easier for them to accept money electronically. It is also allowing these shops to buy their inventory from Reliance Retail, and then using their physical presence as delivery points. The platform is currently largely focused on grocery delivery, however. In a recent report to clients, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated that Reliance could become the largest player in online grocery within three years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://bibit.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bibit</a>, a robo-advisor app that wants to make investing more accessible in Indonesia, has raised $30 million from Sequoia Capital India. Returning investors East Ventures, EV Growth, AC Ventures and 500 Startups also participated.</p>
<p>This funding is a growth round and comes after <a href="https://east.vc/stockbit/stock-robo-advisor-stockbit-series-a/">Bibit&#8217;s May 2019 Series A</a>. It brings the company&#8217;s total funding so far to $45 million, chief executive officer Sigit Kouwagam told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Part of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stockbit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stockbit">Stockbit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Group, about 90% of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bibit-2065" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bibit-2065">Bibit’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> users are millennials and first-time investors. Like other robo-advisors, the aim of Bibit is to make it easier to create a portfolio tailored to each person’s risk profile and investment goals. Other investment apps in Indonesia tapping into growing demand for retail investment producgts include Bareksa and <a href="https://e27.co/online-investment-startup-ajaib-secures-us2-1m-from-softbank-20190109/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoftBank Ventures-backed</a> Ajaib.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bibit claims that over the past year, it has registered more than one million first-time investors. As an example of market potential, the company cites data from the Indonesian Stock Exchange and Indonesia Central Securities Depository that showed the number of retail investors in the country grew 56% year-over-year in 2020, with about 92% of new investors aged between 21 to 40. But only about 2% of Indonesians have participated in the stock market.</p>
<p>Kouwagam said most Indonesians invest their money in term deposit bank accounts or leave it in low-yield checking accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditionally, they also invest real estate or physical godl bars,&#8221; he added, but millennial and Gen Z investors are shifting toward &#8220;higher-yielding liquid investments that are also convenient to manage and can be started with a lower ticket size.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pandemic has also prompted more users build an emergency fund, with more Indonesians looking at the capital market for higher-yielding assets as an alternative to low-interest bank accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the world continues to await the arrival of safe, reliable and cost-effective self-driving cars, one of the pioneers in the world of autonomous vehicle software has raised some substantial funding to double down on what it sees as a more immediate opportunity: providing technology to industrial companies to build off-road applications.</p>
<p><a href="http://oxbotica.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxbotica</a>, the Oxford, England startup that builds what it calls &#8220;universal autonomy&#8221; &#8212; flexible technology that it says can power the navigation, perception, user interfaces, fleet management and other features needed to run self-driving vehicles in multiple environments, regardless of the hardware being used &#8212; has picked up $47 million in a Series B round of funding from an interesting mix of strategic and financial investors.</p>
<p>Led by bp ventures, the investing arm of oil and gas giant <a href="http://bp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bp</a>, the round also includes BGF, safety equipment maker Halma, pension fund HostPlus, IP Group, Tencent, Venture Science and funds advised by Doxa Partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oxbotica-ltd" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oxbotica-ltd">Oxbotica <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said it plans to use the capital to fuel a raft of upcoming deployments &#8212; several that will be coming online this year, according to its CEO &#8212; for clients in areas like mining, port logistics and more, with its lead investor bp an indication of the size of its customers and the kinds of projects that are in its sights.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The question, CEO Ozgur Tohumcu said in an interview, is &#8220;Where is the autonomy needed today? If you go to mines or ports, you can see vehicles in use already,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We see a huge transformation happening in the industrial domain.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The funding and focus on industry are interesting turns for Oxbotica. The startup has been around since about 2014, originally as a spinout from Oxford University co-founded by academics Paul Newman and Ingmar Posner &#8212; Newman remains at the startup as its CTO, while Posner remains an AI professor at Oxford.</p>
<p>Oxbotica has been associated with a number of high-profile projects &#8212; early on, it <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a52821f6-d368-11e6-b06b-680c49b4b4c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">provided sensor technology</a> for Nasa&#8217;s Mars Rover, for example.</p>
<p>Over time, it has streamlined what it does to two main platforms that it calls Selenium and Caesium, covering respectively navigation, mapping, perception, machine learning, data export and related technology; and fleet management.</p>
<p>Newman says that what makes Oxbotica stand out from other autonomous software providers is that its systems are lighter and easier to use.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where we are good is in edge compute,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our radar-based maps are 10 megabytes to cover a kilometer rather than hundreds of megabytes&#8230; Our business plan is to build a horizontal software platform like Microsoft&#8217;s.&#8221; That may underplay the efficiency of what it&#8217;s building, however: Oxbotica also has worked out how to efficiently transfer the enormous data loads associated with autonomous systems, and is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oxbotica-and-cisco-to-solve-autonomous-vehicle-data-challenge-with-pioneering-openroaming-platform-301012266.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working with companies like Cisco</a> to bring these online.</p>
<p>In recent years Oxbotica has been synonymous with some of the more notable on-road self-driving schemes in the U.K. But, as you would expect with autonomous car projects, not everything has panned out as expected.</p>
<p>A self-driving pilot <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/21/addison-lee-and-oxbotica-ink-self-driving-deal-will-offer-autonomous-car-services-in-london-by-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxbotica kicked off with London-based car service Addison Lee in 2018 projected that it would have its first cars on the road by 2021</a>. That project was quietly shut down, however, when <a href="https://www.addisonlee.com/addlib/a-new-chapter-for-alg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Addison Lee was sold on by Carlyle last year</a> and the company abandoned costly moonshots. Another effort, the publicly backed <a href="https://www.projectendeavour.uk/partners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Endeavour</a> to build autonomous car systems across towns in England, appears to still be in progress.</p>

<p>The turn to industrial customers, Newman said, is coming alongside those more ambitious, larger-scale applications. &#8220;Industrial autonomy for off-road refineries, ports and airports happens on the way to on-road autonomy,&#8221; he said, with the focus firmly remaining on providing software that can be used with different hardware. &#8220;We’ve always had this vision of &#8216;no atoms, just software,&#8217; &#8221; he said. &#8220;There is nothing special about the road. Our point is to be agnostic, to make sure it works on any hardware platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may claim to have always been interested in hardware- and application-agnostic autonomy, but these days it&#8217;s being joined by others that have tried the other route and have decided to follow the Oxbotica strategy instead. They include FiveAI, another hyped autonomous startup out of the U.K. that originally wanted to build its own fleet of self-driving vehicles but instead last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/five-the-self-driving-startup-raises-41m-and-pivots-into-b2b-away-from-building-its-own-fleet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pivoted</a> to providing its software technology on a B2B basis for other hardware makers.</p>
<p>Oxbotica has now raised about $80 million to date, and it&#8217;s not disclosing its valuation but is optimistic that the coming year &#8212; with deployments and other new partnerships &#8212; will bear out that it&#8217;s doing just fine in the current market.</p>
<p>“bp ventures are delighted to invest in Oxbotica &#8211; we believe its software could accelerate the market for autonomous vehicles,&#8221; said Erin Hallock, bp ventures managing partner, in a statement. &#8220;Helping to accelerate the global revolution in mobility is at the heart of bp’s strategy to become an integrated energy company focused on delivering solutions for customers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Contrary <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90591066/googles-ios-apps-havent-been-updated-in-weeks-apples-privacy-labels-could-be-the-reason-why">to reports</a>, Google is not delaying updates to its iOS apps because it doesn&#8217;t want to comply with Apple&#8217;s recently announced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=em8fm29e">App Store Privacy Labels policy</a>. The new policy, a part of the company&#8217;s larger privacy push, requires developers to disclose how data is collected from App Store users and used to track them. TechCrunch confirmed Google is not taking a stand against the labels. It is, in fact, preparing to roll out privacy labels across its sizable iOS app catalog as soon as this week or the next.</p>
<p>TechCrunch looked into the situation with Google&#8217;s apps following a story by<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90591066/googles-ios-apps-havent-been-updated-in-weeks-apples-privacy-labels-could-be-the-reason-why"> Fast Company</a> today that speculated that Google&#8217;s slowdown on releasing iOS app updates could be because it was not ready to be transparent about the data it collects from its users. The report stated that <em>&#8220;not a single one&#8221;</em> of Google&#8217;s apps had been updated since December 7, 2020 &#8212; coincidentally, just one day before <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=em8fm29e">Apple&#8217;s new privacy label requirements</a> went into effect on the App Store.</p>
<p>It went on to suggest the late November to early December time frame when many of Google&#8217;s iOS apps were updated was another indication that Google was trying to squeeze in a few last updates before the app privacy label deadline.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are a few problems with speculation, however.</p>
<p>For starters, Google actually did update two of its apps after the deadline &#8212; but those updates didn&#8217;t include privacy labels.</p>
<p>Google Slides, the slideshow presentation app and one of Google&#8217;s more significant apps in the productivity space, was updated on December 14, 2020. And Socratic by Google, a homework helper and the No. 7 free app in the Education category, was updated on December 15. (We fact-checked this data with Sensor Tower&#8217;s assistance, as Google&#8217;s iOS catalog is nearing 100 iPhone apps!)</p>
<p>While it may seem Google is skirting Apple&#8217;s new rules, we must also be careful about reading too much into the update timing. A slowdown in December app updates isn&#8217;t unusual by any stretch. Nor is it suspicious to see app changes pushed out to the public in the weeks before Christmas and New Year&#8217;s because the Apple&#8217;s App Store itself shuts down over the holidays. This year, The App Store closed from December 23 through December 27, 2020 for its annual break.</p>
<p>And like other large companies, Google goes on a code freeze in late December through early January, so as not to cause major issues with its products and services over the holidays when staff is out.</p>
<p>Google also isn&#8217;t the only major app publisher that delayed an immediate embrace of app privacy labels. Amazon and Pinterest haven&#8217;t yet updated with privacy labels as of the time of writing, for example.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this is to say that app privacy labels aren&#8217;t a concern for Google, given its primary business is advertising. In fact, they&#8217;re being taken quite seriously &#8212; with execs attending meetings to discuss that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Apple may or may not have given Google some leeway on the matter in terms of Google&#8217;s apps being updated after the deadline without submitting the privacy label information.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, a Google spokesperson confirmed the company has a plan to add privacy labels across its app catalog. They also confirmed the labels are expected to begin rolling out as soon as this week or next week, though an exact date is not yet available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/">OpenAI&#8217;s latest strange yet fascinating creation is DALL-E</a>, which by way of hasty summary might be called &#8220;GPT-3 for images.&#8221; It creates illustrations, photos, renders or whatever method you prefer, of anything you can intelligibly describe, from &#8220;a cat wearing a bow tie&#8221; to &#8220;a daikon radish in a tutu walking a dog.&#8221; But don&#8217;t write stock photography and illustration&#8217;s obituaries just yet.</p>
<p>As usual, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/openai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="openai">OpenAI&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> description of its invention is quite readable and not overly technical. But it bears a bit of contextualizing.</p>
<p>What researchers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/openai-makes-an-all-purpose-api-for-its-text-based-ai-capabilities/">created with GPT-3</a> was an AI that, given a prompt, would attempt to generate a plausible version of what it describes. So if you say &#8220;a story about a child who finds a witch in the woods,&#8221; it will try to write one — and if you hit the button again, it will write it again, differently. And again, and again, and again.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some of these attempts will be better than others; indeed, some will be barely coherent while others may be nearly indistinguishable from something written by a human. But it doesn&#8217;t output garbage or serious grammatical errors, which makes it suitable for a variety of tasks, as startups and researchers are exploring right now.</p>
<p>DALL-E (a combination of Dali and WALL-E) takes this concept one further. Turning text into images has been done for years by AI agents, with varying but steadily increasing success. In this case the agent uses the language understanding and context provided by GPT-3 and its underlying structure to create a plausible image that matches a prompt.</p>
<p>As OpenAI puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p>GPT-3 showed that language can be used to instruct a large neural network to perform a variety of text generation tasks. Image GPT showed that the same type of neural network can also be used to generate images with high fidelity. We extend these findings to show that manipulating visual concepts through language is now within reach.</p></blockquote>
<p>What they mean is that an image generator of this type can be manipulated naturally, simply by telling it what to do. Sure, you could dig into its guts and find the token that represents color, and decode its pathways so you can activate and change them, the way you might stimulate the neurons of a real brain. But you wouldn&#8217;t do that when asking your staff illustrator to make something blue rather than green. You just say, &#8220;a blue car&#8221; instead of &#8220;a green car&#8221; and they get it.</p>
<p>So it is with DALL-E, which understands these prompts and rarely fails in any serious way, although it must be said that even when looking at the best of a hundred or a thousand attempts, many images it generates are more than a little&#8230; off. Of which later.</p>
<p>In the OpenAI post, the researchers give copious interactive examples of how the system can be told to do minor variations of the same idea, and the result is plausible and often quite good. The truth is these systems can be very fragile, as they admit DALL-E is in some ways, and saying &#8220;a green leather purse shaped like a pentagon&#8221; may produce what&#8217;s expected but &#8220;a blue suede purse shaped like a pentagon&#8221; might produce nightmare fuel. Why? It&#8217;s hard to say, given the black-box nature of these systems.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2092558" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/dall-e-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092558" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2092558 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/dall-e-1.gif" alt="" width="800" height="451" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2092558" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: OpenAI</p></div></p>
<p>But DALL-E is remarkably robust to such changes, and reliably produces pretty much whatever you ask for. A torus of guacamole, a sphere of zebra; a large blue block sitting on a small red block; a front view of a happy capybara, an isometric view of a sad capybara; and so on and so forth. You can play with all the examples at the post.</p>
<p>It also exhibited some unintended but useful behaviors, using intuitive logic to understand requests like asking it to make multiple sketches of the same (non-existent) cat, with the original on top and the sketch on the bottom. No special coding here: &#8220;We did not anticipate that this capability would emerge, and made no modifications to the neural network or training procedure to encourage it.&#8221; This is fine.</p>

<p>Interestingly, another new system from OpenAI, CLIP, was used in conjunction with DALL-E to understand and rank the images in question, though it&#8217;s a little more technical and harder to understand. <a href="https://openai.com/blog/clip/">You can read about CLIP here</a>.</p>
<p>The implications of this capability are many and various, so much so that I won&#8217;t attempt to go into them here. Even OpenAI punts:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the future, we plan to analyze how models like DALL·E relate to societal issues like economic impact on certain work processes and professions, the potential for bias in the model outputs, and the longer term ethical challenges implied by this technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, like GPT-3, this technology is amazing and yet difficult to make clear predictions regarding.</p>
<p>Notably, very little of what it produces seems truly &#8220;final&#8221; — that is to say, I couldn&#8217;t tell it to make a lead image for anything I&#8217;ve written lately and expect it to put out something I could use without modification. Even a brief inspection reveals all kinds of AI weirdness (<a href="https://aiweirdness.com/">Janelle Shane&#8217;s specialty</a>), and while these rough edges will certainly be buffed off in time, it&#8217;s far from safe, the way GPT-3 text can&#8217;t just be sent out unedited in place of human writing.</p>
<p>It helps to generate many and pick the top few, as the following collection shows:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2092586" style="width: 875px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/greatjob.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092586" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2092586" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/greatjob.png" alt="AI-generated illustrations of radishes walking dogs." width="865" height="701" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/greatjob.png 865w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/greatjob.png?resize=150,122 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/greatjob.png?resize=300,243 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/greatjob.png?resize=768,622 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/greatjob.png?resize=680,551 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/greatjob.png?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2092586" class="wp-caption-text">The top eight out of a total of X generated, with X increasing to the right.

<p>That&#8217;s not to detract from OpenAI&#8217;s accomplishment here. This is fabulously interesting and powerful work, and like the company&#8217;s other projects it will no doubt develop into something even more fabulous and interesting before long.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://hingehealth.com/">Hinge Health</a>, the San Francisco-based company that offers a digital solution to treat chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions — such as back and joint pain — has closed a $310 million in Series D funding, according to sources.</p>
<p>The round is led by Coatue and Tiger Global, and values 2015-founded Hinge at $3 billion post-money, people familiar with the investment tell me. It comes off the back of a 300% increase in revenue in 2020, with investors told to expect revenue to nearly triple again in 2021 based on the company&#8217;s booked pipeline.</p>
<p>I also understand that Hinge&#8217;s founders &#8212; Daniel Perez and Gabriel Mecklenburg &#8212; retain voting control of the board. I&#8217;ve reached out to CEO Perez for comment and will update this post should I hear back.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hinge&#8217;s existing investors include <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bessemer-venture-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bessemer-venture-partners">Bessemer Venture Partners, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/hinge-health-series-c/">the company&#8217;s $90 million Series C</a> round in February, along with Lead Edge Capital, Insight Partners (which led the Series B), Atomico (which led the Series A), 11.2 Capital, Quadrille Capital and Heuristic Capital.</p>

<p>Originally based in London, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hinge-health" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hinge-health">Hinge Health <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> primarily sells into U.S. employers and health plans, billing itself as a digital healthcare solution for chronic MSK conditions. The platform combines wearable sensors, an app and health coaching to remotely deliver physical therapy and behavioral health.</p>
<p>The basic premise is that there is plenty of existing research to show how best to treat chronic MSK disorders, but existing healthcare systems aren’t up to the task due to funding pressures and for other systematic reasons. The result is an over tendency to use opioid-based painkillers or surgery, with poor results and often at even greater cost. Hinge wants to reverse this through the use of technology and better data, with a focus on improving treatment adherence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hinge&#8217;s jump in valuation is significant. According to sources, the company&#8217;s February round produced a valuation of around $420 million, so the new valuation is more than a 6x increase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Georgia is the only state in the U.S. right now where <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> allows political ads to run, but after Tuesday&#8217;s polls close that&#8217;s set to change.</p>
<p>According to Facebook&#8217;s site detailing changes to its ad policies and a story from <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-resume-political-ad-ban-georgia-df566911-7b7a-4d42-94a2-37b42d44c67f.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_content=1100">Axios</a>, the company will no longer allow political and social issue ads anywhere in the country, Georgia included, beginning early tomorrow.</p>
<p>Facebook told TechCrunch that the decision to toggle political ads in Georgia off again brings that state in line with its current &#8220;nationwide pause&#8221; on social issue, election and politics ads. A Facebook spokesperson declined to say when political ads will again be allowed or if permanently blocking them from the platform is under consideration.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company first hit pause on those ad categories November 4 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/facebook-election-ad-ban-delegitimize-election-results/">as a precaution</a> designed to reduce misinformation in the U.S. presidential election. On December 16, the company re-allowed political ads in Georgia, inviting eager campaigns to pay to get their messages in front of Facebook users. It appears that some politicians, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ted-cruz-is-pocketing-the-money-hes-raising-for-georgia-gopers-hes-not-alone">Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) among them</a>, pounced on Facebook&#8217;s Georgia loophole to raise money for themselves in spite of restrictions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LxOJJihqoJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/facebook-election-ad-ban-delegitimize-election-results/">Facebook won&#8217;t accept ads that &#8216;delegitimize&#8217; US election results</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook won&#8217;t accept ads that &#8216;delegitimize&#8217; US election results&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/facebook-election-ad-ban-delegitimize-election-results/embed/#?secret=LxOJJihqoJ" data-secret="LxOJJihqoJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">When political ads came flooding back in for Georgians, they edged out mainstream news sources, according to </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/01/05/in-georgia-facebooks-changes-brought-back-a-partisan-news-feed">new reporting from The Markup</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. While that result is fairly intuitive, it does underline the outsized influence of targeting political advertising in Facebook&#8217;s information ecosystem.</span></p>
<p>Plenty of politicians and political groups are likely eager to get back to fundraising on Facebook. The company&#8217;s decision to keep the pause in place suggests that it&#8217;s still evaluating how — and perhaps if — it wants to handle political ads in the future. But Facebook also might be waiting for the storm to pass in light of the misinformation that plagued November&#8217;s drawn-out process of calculating election results.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that Facebook&#8217;s head of advertising integrity Rob Leathern <a href="https://twitter.com/robleathern/status/1345133179263475714">left the company</a> at the end of December, calling his team&#8217;s work on the 2020 U.S. election the &#8220;culmination of a huge amount of effort over several years.&#8221; Leathern helped sculpt the company&#8217;s policies around political advertising — decisions that were often controversial due to the prevalence of paid misinformation sweeping through the platform throughout 2020.</p>
<p>Because they will decide control of the Senate, the unusual pair of runoff races in a state that just flipped blue are high-stakes for both political parties. With a Democratic Senate, the Biden administration&#8217;s ambitious plans for things like COVID relief and the climate crisis will have a much better shot at becoming a reality. And for Republicans looking to stymie the president-elect&#8217;s policy priorities, extended control of the Senate would put a powerful barrier in Biden&#8217;s way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On New Year’s Eve, TechCrunch Japan’s Editor-in-Chief Hirohide Yoshida passed away at age 49. In addition to being a tremendously valuable member of our international team who helped build the site’s presence on the international stage, Hiro-san was a thoughtful, warm and kind colleague who impacted the lives of those of us who had the pleasure to work with him.</p>
<p>I worked alongside Hiro-san at two consecutive TechCrunch Tokyo events. The size and scope of the shows were impressive testaments to the team he led, as well as his own passion for technology. Throughout it all, he was an ideal ambassador for an electric startup community and tech journalism &#8212; a passion evident in every aspect of his work and life. He continued that vision as he helped transform the conference into a virtual event amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, two young children and a site and staff that will continue to bear his mark for a long time to come.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch Japan published its own reflections on the life and career of Hirohide Yoshida <a href="https://jp.techcrunch.com/2021/01/03/yoshidasan-mataaimasyou/">that you can read here</a>. We’ve asked the site’s editor, Takya Kimura, to share additional thoughts below:</p>
<blockquote><p>He started his career at KADOKAWA / ASCII. He had been writing articles about Apple and tech companies for over 20 years. With his deep knowledge, he became Editor-in-Chief of<em> MacPeople</em>, a magazine for Apple fans, and <em>ASCII Weekly</em>, publications he led for eight years.</p>
<p>In 2018, he became Editor-in-Chief of TechCrunch Japan. He was an incredibly hard worker, with long term vision, who never voiced a complaint about work. As Editor-in-Chief of TCJ, his team ran TechCrunch Tokyo, the biggest startup event in Japan for three consecutive years, including its first online event &#8220;TechCrunch Startup Battle Online 2020.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until the last moment, he loved his wife, his newborn twins, his cat and TechCrunch Japan. After his long journey, he now rests in peace, wearing his beloved TechCrunch Japan t-shirt.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Any teacher in the San Francisco Unified School District who needs a second monitor <a href="https://www.sfusd.edu/about/news/sfusd-teachers-offered-gift-second-screen-support-distance-teaching">can request one free of charge</a> from Two Screens for Teachers, the nonprofit that recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/two-screens-for-teachers-will-outfit-all-educators-in-seattle-public-schools-with-a-second-monitor/">extended a similar privilege to Seattle educators.</a> If you&#8217;re a teacher in SF, <a href="https://www.twoscreensforteachers.org/request-monitor">you can sign up here</a>.</p>
<p>Having a second monitor may sound like a power user move or luxury to some, but for teachers, whose days are essentially one giant group call, it&#8217;s a huge benefit to be able to put the call on one screen while the lesson and other tools are on another.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jjk8w61ryHY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/two-screens-for-teachers" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="two-screens-for-teachers">Two Screens for Teachers <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was started in September by Walk Score&#8217;s Matt Lerner and Mike Mathieu, and the first effort of simply <a href="https://www.twoscreensforteachers.org/buy-monitor">connecting teachers in need to people who had a hundred bucks to spare</a> quickly grew into something larger.</p>
<p>By tapping local businesses and VCs, they were able to secure enough money that any teacher in Seattle had a monitor available for the asking. Turns out it&#8217;s more efficient to do it that way. Lerner and his team have negotiated bulk pricing with Dell and others, which significantly lowers the necessary amounts for a given district.</p>
<p>San Francisco was a natural next location to try to get enough dollars together, and they&#8217;ve now collected enough for that city as well as Oakland, Redwood City and Contra Costa County. (San Jose is still a little short.)</p>
<p>This remarkable map, both hopeful and terrifying, shows the scale of what&#8217;s needed versus what&#8217;s been accomplished.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2092533" style="width: 846px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/help-teachers.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092533" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2092533" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/help-teachers.png" alt="" width="836" height="565" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/help-teachers.png 836w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/help-teachers.png?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/help-teachers.png?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/help-teachers.png?resize=768,519 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/help-teachers.png?resize=680,460 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/help-teachers.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 836px) 100vw, 836px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2092533" class="wp-caption-text">A map showing where and how many teachers need a second monitor. Image Credits: Two Screens for Teachers</p></div></p>
<p>Yet even though the idea of hooking up more than 150,000 teachers with monitors seems gargantuan, it must be pointed out that in the few months since its humble beginnings, Two Screens for Teachers has rustled up more than 20,000, for both big cities and tiny towns. One order of magnitude is nothing!</p>
<p>The final cost for equipping teachers across the country with essential equipment is about $23 million. It seems an almost ridiculously low number for a single billionaire, perhaps one of the many whose net worth has grown by 10 times that amount in the last year, to provide with a single check. Here&#8217;s something with which one could buy genuine cross-country goodwill, cheap at the price.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Throughout 2019, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> experimented with building a real-world, augmented reality Minecraft game designed in the same vein as Pokémon GO. Called Minecraft Earth, they finally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/minecraft-earth-is-live-so-get-tapping/">opened it up to everyone</a> in November of 2019.</p>
<p>In just a few months, it&#8217;ll shut down and all player data will be deleted.</p>
<p>So what happened? Writes the Minecraft Earth team:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Minecraft Earth was designed around free movement and collaborative play – two things that have become near impossible in the current global situation. As a result, we have made the difficult decision to re-allocate our resources to other areas that provide value to the Minecraft community and to end support for Minecraft Earth in June 2021.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words: This game just isn&#8217;t going to work in a pandemic. Pokémon GO might be doing just fine thanks to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/how-niantic-evolved-pokemon-go-for-the-year-no-one-could-go-anywhere/">strong foundation of super-dedicated players</a> and a steady stream of curious newcomers, but it&#8217;d be pretty damned hard to go from zero to 60 with a real-world game when everyone is supposed to be staying at home.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="N9bx9qK8U3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/minecraft-earth-is-live-so-get-tapping/">Minecraft Earth is live, so get tapping</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Minecraft Earth is live, so get tapping&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/minecraft-earth-is-live-so-get-tapping/embed/#?secret=N9bx9qK8U3" data-secret="N9bx9qK8U3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>What happens next:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The team is releasing one final patch that removes all in-app purchases and makes all in-game mechanics easier/faster to make the most of any remaining play time.</li>
<li>On June 30th, the game shuts down. Even if you&#8217;ve got it installed already, it&#8217;ll stop working.</li>
<li>On July 1st, they&#8217;re deleting all player data.</li>
<li>Anyone who has spent any money in Minecraft Earth is getting a free copy of Minecraft Bedrock version, and players who have unused paid Minecraft Earth rubies will get an unspecified amount of Minecoins that&#8217;ll work in Minecraft-proper&#8217;s marketplace.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s a disappointing end to what was really a pretty cool concept — but if they&#8217;re announcing its shutdown barely a year after launch, the data probably suggest there&#8217;s not much else they can do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/virgin-orbit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="virgin-orbit">Virgin Orbit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is wasting no time in 2021 getting back to active flight testing: The company has a window for its next orbital demonstration launch attempt that opens on Sunday, January 10, and that continues throughout the rest of the month. This follows an attempt last year made in May, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/25/virgin-orbits-first-orbital-test-flight-cut-short-after-rocket-released-from-carrier-aircraft/">ended before the LauncherOne rocket reached orbit</a> &#8212; shortly after it detached from the Cosmic Girl carrier aircraft, in fact.</p>
<p>While that mission didn&#8217;t go exactly as Virgin Orbit had hoped, it was a significant milestone for the small satellite launch company, and helped gather a significant amount of data about how the vehicle performs in flight. LauncherOne was able to briefly light its rocket booster before safety systems on board automatically shut it down. The company had been looking to fly this second test before the end of last year, but issues including COVID-19 meant that they only got as far as the wet dress rehearsal (essentially a run-through of everything leading up to the flight with the vehicles fully fueled).</p>

<p>This next mission will once again attempt an orbital launch, and this time, the stakes are somewhat higher because actual customer payloads from NASA are on board. They include a number of small satellite science experiments and demonstrations, and while they&#8217;re specifically selected for the mission profile (meaning it&#8217;s not a tremendous loss if the launch fails), it still would make everyone happiest to actually get them to their target destination.</p>
<p>The nature of the launch window means that Virgin Orbit will likely wait for conditions to be as good as possible before taking off from the Mojave Air and Space Port in California, so take that January 10 date as the earliest possible launch time, but not necessarily the most likely. If successful, Virgin Orbit will join a select group of private small launch vehicles that have made it to orbit, so the industry will definitely be watching the next time Cosmic Girl takes off with LauncherOne attached.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dell" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dell">Dell&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> latest monitors reflect the growing need for simple, solid solutions to video conferencing needs, with a clever pop-up camera and a perhaps too clever by half Teams integration. The new displays integrate a number of advanced features — but they&#8217;re still made strictly with offices in mind.</p>
<p>The new Dell 24, 27 and 34 Video Conferencing Monitors are clearly meant to be a turnkey solution to the need at many companies for video-capable setups that don&#8217;t cost a fortune.</p>
<p>The most interesting feature is a pop-up camera at the top; this isn&#8217;t the first one of these by far (we&#8217;ve seen them going back a few years) or even the first by Dell, but it is the first of theirs in a monitor as opposed to an all-in-one system, and it is probably the best one yet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2092432" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/dell-popup.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092432" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2092432" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/dell-popup.gif" alt="Dell's monitor has a pop-up camera." width="800" height="434" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2092432" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dell</p></div></p>
<p>The five-megapixel camera (which translates to somewhat more than 1080p, likely around 3K) won&#8217;t blow any minds, so if you want things like optical background blur and improved lighting, you&#8217;ll have to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/how-to-get-your-nice-camera-set-up-as-a-high-quality-webcam/">build your own setup</a>. But it should be perfectly fine for work calls and having it slip away when not in use is reassuring to the privacy-conscious.</p>
<p>An additional, nonobvious reason to like this setup is it means the camera isn&#8217;t confined to the bezel of the monitor itself, possibly allowing for a better lens and bigger sensor. I&#8217;ve asked Dell for the detailed specs and I don&#8217;t expect anything extraordinary, but it&#8217;s always better to have space than to pack the camera module into the margins.</p>

<p>At the bottom of these new screens is a pleasantly felted speaker bar, with just enough wattage for calls to sound fine — it won&#8217;t work for bangers, though.</p>
<p>But on the left side of that speaker are some interesting, if not entirely practical, new buttons. Most prominent is a dedicated <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Teams button, along with call, volume and mute buttons.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I wouldn&#8217;t want one of those. And not just because we don&#8217;t use Teams.</p>
<p>Maybe this is just me, but I don&#8217;t like the idea of reaching forward and whacking my monitor, which I&#8217;ve carefully positioned, every time I want to adjust the volume or answer a call, or mute myself — good luck doing it subtly when the whole view shakes every time. Even if I did, I wouldn&#8217;t want a button dedicated specifically to a single brand of video conferencing. Seems limiting when so many video platforms are in play.</p>
<p>I would be far more likely to pay for a puck with those controls on it as well as a mono speaker for voices and mic that&#8217;s closer to me. And by the way, it might be better to leave noise cancellation to the software side of things — calling apps often integrate their own, and who knows how built-in noise blocking interacts with those.</p>
<p>No doubt this is a simpler product solution, of course, and also presumably one that Microsoft and Dell worked together on. The pop-up webcam also has an IR camera that works with Windows Hello, the face-recognition login method I didn&#8217;t realize existed until very recently.</p>
<p>Obviously this is Dell and Microsoft going after enterprise customers who are already in their ecosystem. But as a Dell monitor lover myself, I wouldn&#8217;t mind having a pop-up camera — minus the unnecessary sound bar and Teams button. Where&#8217;s the love, Dell?</p>
<p>The new video conferencing monitors will be available next month, starting at $520 for a 24-inch, then going up to $720 for the 27-inch and $1,150 for the (curved) 34-inch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. government says hackers &#8220;likely Russian in origin&#8221; are responsible for breaching the networks of at least 10 U.S. federal agencies and several major tech companies, including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fireeye" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fireeye">FireEye <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Microsoft.</p>
<p>In a joint statement published Tuesday, the FBI, the NSA and Homeland Security&#8217;s cybersecurity advisory unit, CISA, said that the government was &#8220;still working to understand the scope&#8221; of the breach, but that the breaches are likely an &#8220;intelligence gathering effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>The compromises are &#8220;ongoing,&#8221; the statement said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The statement didn&#8217;t name the breached agencies, but the Treasury, State and the Department of Energy are among those <a href="https://www.fedscoop.com/solarwinds-recap-federal-agencies-caught-orion-breach/">reported to be affected</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;The [joint agency effort] will continue taking every necessary action to investigate, remediate, and share information with our partners and the American people,&#8221;</p>
<p>News of the widespread espionage campaign emerged in early December after cybersecurity giant FireEye, normally the first company that cyberattack victims call, discovered its own network <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cybersecurity-firm-fireeye-says-it-was-hacked-by-a-nation-state/">had been breached</a>. Soon after, it was reported that several government agencies had also been infiltrated.</p>
<p>All of the victims are customers of U.S. software firm <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/solarwinds" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="solarwinds">SolarWinds, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> whose Orion network management tools are used across the U.S. government and Fortune 500 companies. FireEye <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html">said that hackers</a> broke into SolarWinds&#8217; network and pushed a tainted software update to its customers, allowing the hackers to easily break into any one of thousands of companies and agencies that installed the backdoored update.</p>
<p>Some 18,000 customers downloaded the backdoored software update, but the government&#8217;s joint statement said that it believes only a &#8220;much smaller number have been compromised by follow-on activity on their systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several news outlets have previously reported that the hacks were carried out by a Russian intelligence group known as APT 29, or Cozy Bear, which has been linked to several espionage-driven attacks, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/russian-cyberops-are-targeting-covid-19-vaccine-rd-intelligence-agencies-warn/">attempting to steal coronavirus vaccine research</a>.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s joint statement would be the first time the government acknowledged the likely culprit behind the campaign.</p>
<p>Russia had previously denied involvement with the hacks.</p>
