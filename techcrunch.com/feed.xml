										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The meteoric rise of collaborative design startup Canva &#8212; now valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$40 billion</a> &#8212; and conversely, the viral interest we&#8217;ve been seeing in the market for NFTs where you can &#8220;buy&#8221; a share of a limited-edition digital asset, are two examples of how the tech world today revolves around &#8212; and values &#8212; catchy ways of engaging with visual media online. Today, another startup that&#8217;s built a business around tackling the same concept &#8212; as it applies specifically to brand management for organizations &#8212; is announcing some funding as it finds some traction of its own.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frontify</a>, which provides a cloud-based platform for businesses to centralize and distribute all of their brand assets to those who work in and with their companies, has closed an equity round of $50 million, funding that the Swiss startup (based out of St Gallen) will be using both to invest in building out its technology, as well as to move deeper into new markets like the U.S.</p>
<p>Revaia (the VC formerly known as Gaia Capital Partners) led the round with new backer High Sage Ventures and previous backers EQT Ventures, Blossom Capital, and Tenderloin Ventures also participating. EQT led the company&#8217;s previous round of $22.3 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/frontify-raises-22-3m-to-help-businesses-manage-how-their-brands-and-logos-get-used/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 2020</a>.</p>
<p>That last round was just ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic going global, and as with other tech companies built on the concepts of distributed, cloud-based and remote work, that disaster ironically turned out to work in Frontify&#8217;s favor: the company picked up some 300 customers as the pandemic hit. It now has 5,000 customers in total.</p>
<p>For some context on that number and the startup&#8217;s growth, in January 2020 it had around 2,500 organizations were already using the Frontify platform &#8212; companies it discloses publicly include Facebook, Pepsi, Lufthansa, Sennheiser and Vodafone.</p>
<p>Frontify&#8217;s platform today provides a repository for companies to manage and distribute brand assets used both in-house and by external partners. But what is notable about it &#8212; and what sets it apart from a number of other companies providing digital asset management tools (others in same space include Bynder and Canto) &#8212; is that it covers not just digital media files but how they can be and are getting used.</p>
<p>In other words, Frontify is not just a storage folder for fonts and logos, but focuses a lot of its business on being a wider collaboration suite that tracks usage, and the status of projects where those assets are appearing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In areas like digital advertising, for example, it allows companies to create templates that lock in certain design details so that they can remain consistent as a company looks to create multiple versions of one piece of artwork for a larger campaign, and critically it&#8217;s set up to allow for this kind of work in a distribute way, by design, which is one reason why it has gained a foothold in the current market, where teams that might have previously been centralized are now working in as distributed a way as they used to work with external partners.</p>
<p>All of this can be used via the web or <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/frontify-launches-the-first-desktop-app-for-company-brand-content-301181306.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desktop app</a>, and <a href="https://www.frontify.com/en/developer-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developers can build their own templates</a> and other use cases on top of its platform.</p>
<p>The bigger picture for digital media online is a rapidly changing one. NFTs may or may not end up being a speculative flash in the pan, the Twenties&#8217; answer to Tulipmania, but they have put a strong focus on how the market wants and strives to &#8220;control&#8221; visual artifacts. Canva, meanwhile, is at the other end of the spectrum, a huge respository for designing and sharing work that will live in the digital world. Frontify has essentially created a B2B platform that lives in the same realm: it has identified the value of the asset, and the value in being able to collaborate with it in a way that lines up with an organization&#8217;s wider design goals.</p>
<p>And in keeping with the concept of design consistency, this is very much in line with how Frontify has seen itself from the start. As Roger Dudler, Frontify&#8217;s CEO and founder, described to me back in January 2020, “We think design tools might change rather quickly [while] the single source of truth for all brand resources will stay,” he said. “That’s why we bridge that gap by integrating with as many existing tools as possible.” He described the templating features that the company created to expand beyond basic digital asset management as tools to “bring Canva-like functionality to brands with a much more targeted offering for complex enterprise needs.” (Frontify integrates with all of the standard software used in the design industry, including Figma, Sketch and Adobe XD.)</p>
<p>“We instantly got excited about <span class="il">Frontify</span>’s brand management platform and its capacity to capture the whole branding process in one place, making it the single source of truth for employees and collaborators,” said Elina Berrebi, Founding Partner of Revaia, in a statement. “They have demonstrated their ability to convince some of the most trusted brands globally in all industries, while delivering strong and efficient revenue growth. We’re also buying into the passion and the people at <span class="il">Frontify</span>, and are thrilled to contribute to building its global leadership.”</p>
<p>The company is not disclosing its valuation, but we have asked.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish electric motorcycle manufacturer Cake has announced the close of a $60 million Series B that the company will use to help set up manufacturing facilities in Europe, North America and Asia, as well as scale up its retail capabilities.</p>
<p>“We are in the process of implementing initiatives to scale the business, structuring and laying the base for rapid growth,&#8221; said Stefan Ytterborn, founder and CEO of Cake, in a statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/electric-motorbike-company-cake-launches-the-makka-an-e-moped-for-city-riding-at-3500/">Cake recently launched the Makka</a>, an electric moped for city riding, which demonstrates a shift in direction of Cake&#8217;s product platforms. Its first two vehicles,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/cake-brings-a-swedish-take-on-e-motorcycle-design-to-the-u-s/"> the Kalk</a> and the Ösa, are made for heavier duty, off-road riding and utility, so the Makka has helped to expand Cake&#8217;s user base within B2C and B2B, says Ytterborn.</p>
<p>The new manufacturing facilities across three continents will help Cake be more sustainable and efficient as it aims to ship its vehicles direct-to-consumer worldwide, according to the company. Until recently, the bikes were only assembled in Taiwan and shipped to warehouses in the U.S., Canada and Europe or directly to customers in  Australasia. Each shipping container from Taiwan could fit 25 bikes. Now, Cake can ship enough components from Taiwan to its European or North American facilities to equal 150 bikes per container, reducing shipping volume by more than 80%, a Cake spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The European assembly has been up and running since July, and the company aims to have North American assembly begin in the first half of next year, according to the company.</p>
<div>&#8220;Efficiency wise we will be able to assemble an order with two weeks delivery time instead of ordering eight months beforehand, reflecting what anticipated demand will be: high inventory risk and cash flow heavy,&#8221; said the spokesperson.</div>
<p>With the fresh funding, Cake will also begin to set up a retail presence, with showrooms popping up in major cities beginning this fall, says Ytterborn.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew we were entering a space with increasingly strong tailwinds when we got started back in 2016, but we couldn&#8217;t dream of the pace in which things are now happening, for the good of people, planet and business,&#8221; he continued.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round consists of convertible notes of $14 million and a $46 million financing round. The latter was led by Swedish pension fund AMF, according to Cake. A handful of new investors also participated in the round, as well as existing stakeholders, Creandum and Headline, two VCs that participated in Cake&#8217;s $14 million Series A in 2019.</p>
<p>“Cake&#8217;s obsession with creating a superior user experience has been ingrained in the company&#8217;s DNA from day one and is something we can fully identify with,&#8221; said Staffan Helgesson, general partner at Creandum Advisor, in a statement. &#8220;We are very happy to continue to support the team for the long term in their ambition to become the category leader in the premium two wheeler electric vehicle segment.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish electric vehicle maker Polestar is reportedly preparing to go public via special purpose acquisition with Gores Guggenheim Inc., reports the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gores-guggenheim-spac-nears-deal-to-combine-with-polestar-11632694281">Wall Street Journal</a> citing people familiar with the matter. The SPAC deal, which sources say could be reached by Monday, would value Polestar at $21 billion.</p>
<p>Polestar falls under Volvo Car Group&#8217;s electric performance brand, but both Polestar and Volvo are owned by Chinese car maker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. Existing investors, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio, will receive an additional $250 million investment as part of the SPAC deal, sources say.</p>
<p>If this deal goes through, Polestar will be joining a hoard of other EV and EV-related companies to go SPAC over the last two years, including Arrival, Nikola, EVgo, Proterra, Lucid Motors, Bird and many more.</p>
<p>Polestar aims to create a life cycle assessment framework for the electric car manufacturing industry, one in which the entire manufacturing, sales and end-of-life process is so transparent and traceable that the company can create <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/polestar-will-have-to-question-everything-in-order-to-build-the-first-climate-neutral-ev/">carbon-neutral vehicles</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/polestar-to-build-its-first-all-electric-suv-in-the-united-states/">The automaker announced its plans in June</a> to manufacture its first SUV, the Polestar 3, in the United States, production of which is expected to begin globally in 2022. High quality parts and a manufacturing facility in the States are not cheap endeavors. If the reports are true, going public might be a way for Polestar to get the funds needed to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>The deal would also help the automaker get to market in the U.S. faster so Polestar could compete with Tesla. The automaker has positioned its Polestar 2, a sedan, as a better car than the Tesla, but it&#8217;ll need the capital in order to make it the same sort of household name in the EV industry, and one that&#8217;s trustworthy. Last year,<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34276283/polestar-2-ev-recall/#:~:text=Polestar%20has%20recalled%20all%20of,updated%20to%20fix%20the%20issue."> Polestar had to recall all of its global vehicles over faulty components</a>.</p>
<p>The SPAC company, Gores Guggenheim, <a href="https://news.spacconference.com/2021/04/23/gores-guggenheim-adds-50m-over-allotment-to-total-800m-ipo/">raised $800 million in a March IPO</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bloomberg+guggenheim+polestar&amp;oq=bloomberg+guggenheim+polestar+&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6607j1j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Bloomberg reported</a> it was in talks with Polestar in July.</p>
<p>Polestar has not yet responded to requests for clarification from TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ascendcorp.com/">Ascend Money</a>, the Thailand-based fintech startup behind TrueMoney, an e-wallet service, announced today it has raised a $150 million Series C round at a valuation of $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>The Series C round was led by <a href="https://www.cpgroupglobal.com/">Charoen Pokphand Group</a>, which is a major shareholder of Ascend Money, with participation from <a href="https://bowwavecap.com/">Bow Wave Capital Management</a> and returning backer <a href="https://www.antgroup.com/en">Ant Group</a>.</p>
<p>Ascend Money will use the proceeds to grow its e-wallet application – TrueMoney Wallet – and expand its digital financial services ranging from digital lending and digital investment to cross border remittances in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2013, also continues to strengthen its global operations across six countries &#8212; Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Since the coronavirus outbreak, e-payments via TrueMoney Wallet have grown exponentially because of social distancing measures and growing public awareness of contactless transactions across the region, Tanyapong Thamavaranukupt, co-President of Ascend Money told TechCrunch. Its users in Thailand have grown from 17 million in early 2021 to 20 million as of now, while the transactions of its online payment use case surged over 75%, Thamavaranukupt said.</p>
<p>“The growth in e-payment suggests changing consumers’ spending habits as Southeast Asia moves toward a digital economy and a cashless society,” Thamavaranukupt said.</p>
<p>“The pandemic’s disruptive effects have accelerated the growth of the digital economy across Southeast Asia,” Itai Lemberger, founder and CEO of Bow Wave Capital Management said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its total payment volume stood at $14 billion in 2020 across the six countries in Southeast Asia, representing 84% growth between 2019 and 2020, according to its statement. About 70% came from Thailand while 30% came from the international market, the co-President Thamavaranukupt said. In Thailand, Ascend Money has about 70% of market share based on its own research, Thamavaranukupt said.</p>
<p>Ascend Money tells TechCrunch it has amassed a total of 50 million users so far through TrueMoney and offline channels including approximately 88,000 TrueMoney agent networks, which is its core strength for regional expansion.</p>
<p>The e-wallet service also serves as a payment channel for B2B, ranging from big brands to local SME owners as well as street market entrepreneurs. TrueMoney Wallet platform provides digital loans service to the customers including small business entrepreneurs, who don’t have traditional credit scores to access the digital loans, along with the payment service, Thamavaranukupt said.</p>
<p>“Apart from e-wallet, we are an agent-based payment and remittance service provider. Since last year, we’ve also rolled out TrueMoney Wallet for agent [networks] and migrated our offline agent to the online platform, which would help enhance and digitize their operations,” Thamavaranukupt said.</p>
<p>True Money agents are local entrepreneurs, who registered with Ascend Money to earn additional income by being their agents to provide services like bill payment, phone top-up and domestic and cross-border remittance services, he explained.</p>
<p>“We provide TrueMoney Wallet and the TrueMoney Agent service in some other countries outside Thailand. Most users are unbanked and the underbanked population with limited access to basic financial services,” Thamavaranukupt said.</p>
<p>“Ascend Money provides a financial platform of opportunity for those financially excluded as well as SMEs around the region. The company’s success is also a testament to Thailand’s capability and strong ecosystem to support domestic fintech firms and startups for overseas expansion,” Ascend Money founder and chairman of the board Suphachai Chearavanont said.</p>
<p>Last year, Ascend Money opened a service for expatriates like Myanmarese and Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand, enabling them to register on TrueMoney Wallet and transfer money to their family in the homeland, Thamavaranukupt said.</p>
<p>Ascend Money considers going public after hitting $1.5 billion of its valuation, co-President Monsinee Nakapanant told TechCrunch without providing exact timeline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">After working as an investment banker in Canada for a decade, Halima Iqbal moved back to Pakistan in 2017 and quickly realized how difficult it is for women to access financial services. “I had a really hard time opening up a basic bank account. It took me about three and a half months,” Iqbal told TechCrunch. She began researching how Pakistani women deal with money—for example, how do they save or take out credit?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Then she met product designer and entrepreneur Farwah Tapal, who had recently returned to Pakistan from Spain, and the two created <a href="https://www.oraan.com/">Oraan</a> in 2018 to help women access financial services. The startup announced today it has raised $3 million in funding, co-led by returning investor Zayn Capital and Wavemaker Partners, with participation from Resolution Ventures, i2i Ventures, Hustle Fund, Haitou Global, Plug and Play and angels like Claire Diaz-Ortiz, a former investing partner at Magma Partners and early Twitter employee.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Oraan has now raised just over $4 million in funding. Iqbal and Tapal said they are the first women entrepreneurs in Pakistan’s fintech space to raise a seed round.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2208358" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208358" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2208358" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Oraan.jpg?w=453" alt="Oraan founders Farwah Tapal and Halima Iqbal" width="350" height="525" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Oraan.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Oraan.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Oraan.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Oraan.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Oraan.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Oraan.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208358" class="wp-caption-text">Oraan founders Farwah Tapal and Halima Iqbal</p></div></p>
<p class="p1">“There was an opportunity, how can we understand the saving space and informal economy in Pakistan, and where can we capture that?” Iqbal said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Oraan decided to start with ROSCAs (rotating credit and savings associations), or committees of people who contribute money to a pool that is distributed to a member each month. It will expand into more financial services, with plans to become a digital bank.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Based on Oraan’s research, only about 7% of Pakistani women are financially included, meaning they have at least a basic bank account. For many women, trying to access financial services means facing logistical and social barriers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">“When a woman goes into a bank, the first question we get asked is ‘why do you even need bank account?,’ especially if you’re a freelancer or micro-entrepreneur or unemployed homemaker,” Iqbal said, adding that women are often asked to provide their husband or a male relative’s information so they can serve as a guarantor. “These kinds of restrictions have hindered women from having the kind of financial mobility that they require to be able to contribute equally to the economic growth of the country.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Traditionally, ROSCAs are formed within communities, for example among family members, friends or neighbors. Then each person puts in a set amount of money per month. Who gets each month’s pool of money is decided by the committee, sometimes by a vote or random draw.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Iqbal and Tapal decided to start with ROSCAs because almost everyone they know had participated in an informal one. Based on Oraan’s research, about 41% of the Pakistani population has participated in a ROSCA and $5 billion gets rotated through them on an annual basis.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“The scale of use and what it provided to the user was just so fascinating,” Iqbal said. “This is a goldmine to create something valuable for the end user, as well as a business opportunity.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Oraan formalizes ROSCAs, offering five-month or ten-month plans. One of the main differences between Oraan’s ROSCAs and informal ones is that users can pick which month they want the pool of money, because the app’s treasury management backend forms committees based on members’ needs and ability to pay.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">By participating in ROSCAs through Oraan, users also have the opportunity to join committees with people outside of their communities and social networks. Before accepting people onto Oraan, the app vets them, and it also manages each ROSCA, collecting and disbursing funds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“Generally in Pakistan, there is no concept of credit scoring and that’s why financial inclusion or access to liquidity becomes a problem,” Tapal said. Oraan partners with other providers to assess creditworthiness based on verified IDs, where users live, proof of income and personal references.</p>
<p class="p1">Some of the reasons Oraan’s users have participated in ROSCAs include financing their children’s education, paying for IVF treatments or leaving abusive relationships, Iqbal said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">As people participate in committees in Oraan, they also build a payment history, which can open the door to other financial services in the future. The startup’s ultimate goal is become an online bank, said Iqbal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“We take this culturally, religiously, socially acceptable tool, which is committees, digitize them and bring women into a more formal space where they can open bank accounts,” said Iqbal. Other verticals Oraan plans to launch include savings, credit, insurance and educational financing, as well as investment products that will allow women to save money in mutual funds and other different asset classes. It also plans to build online communities for its users.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“We want to become a full-fledged neobank and very heavily based on community because that’s where we see that women want a sense of belonging,” said Iqbal. “When it comes to financial transactions, that’s one of the things they feel they lack, that sense of belonging.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Covid-19 really put the kibosh on live events in the last 18 months, but in the world of tech, it also meant that live event startups that found a way to survive and grow throughout the period got a lot of attention. In the latest development, <a href="https://dice.fm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dice</a> &#8212; a London company that has built a platform to help people discover and attend live events that might be of interest to them &#8212; has raised $122 million, a funding round that sources tell us values the company at $400 million.</p>
<p>SoftBank Vision Fund 2 is leading the round, a Series C, with iPod &#8220;father&#8221; and Nest co-founder Tony Fadell (by way of Future Shape), Blisce, French entrepreneur Xavier Niel, Mirabaud, Cassius and Evolution &#8212; all previous backers &#8212; also participating. (Previous investors in the company also include DeepMind co-founders Mustafa Suleyman and Demis Hassabis, notable given the company&#8217;s early focus on data science and recommendation algorithms.) Prior to this round Dice had raised around $45 million, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/97614-73/company/profile#deal-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> estimates.</p>
<p>Dice focuses these days mostly on live music, and in the peak of the pandemic, as everyone was locked down, it rejigged its business model to focus on live streaming: now with some 6,400 live streamed events and thousands more in-person events under its belt, to appeal to a wider audience with a wider range of needs, it is expanding around a multi-modal strategy, providing options to discover and attend/buy tickets to both streamed and in-person live events.</p>
<p>The new funds will be going towards expanding Dice&#8217;s geographic footprint with a special focus on the U.S. since this is where Dice&#8217;s business seems to be growing the fastest at the moment, as cities and consumers gradually come out of pandemic hibernation to spend time together again, in some cases at a frenetic pace. Phil Hutcheon, Dice&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, said that in New York alone, over 1 million people used Dice to find and attend events in the single month of August.</p>
<p>(Sidenote on investors and founders: Hutcheon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/18/dice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-founded Dice in 2014 with Ustwo</a>, the agency that also spawned Monument Valley, helped incubate Tray.io and has worked on number of other creative projects alongside its digital agency business: I&#8217;ve confirmed that Ustwo, which hadn&#8217;t had an operational role in Dice in years, has also sold its shares in the startup in this round.)</p>
<p>Giants like Ticketmaster, Live Nation, StubHub and Eventbrite dominate the landscape for ticketing for events, but Hutcheon contends that these and other legacy platforms are too static and not fit for the modern age, and specifically modern demands.</p>
<p>They are expensive both for event organizers and attendees to use, and they have been slow to address both some of the more damaging parts of the event industry, such as ticket touting and counterfeiting; and some of the more promising aspects of it, such as providing better insights to event organizers based on all the data that can been gleaned from the average event browser and consumer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The world has been opaque around live performance, but it&#8217;s now 2021,&#8221; Hutcheon said in an interview. &#8220;The answer to shift it all is transparency. [Legacy ticket companies] make it all much more complicated than it should be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dice&#8217;s answer has been to focus on three areas, Hutcheon said. First is making ticketing easy and secure for users and venues. Second is discovery: making sure people who are interested in a particular performance are given reliable recommendations of other events they might like, in locations that are realistic for them to visit. And third is community. In Dice&#8217;s case, this originally (and still) means finding like-minded people on the site, as well as visiting Dice and knowing what your friends or people like you might be interested to see. Now, on top of this, is a wider mandate for community, Hutcheon said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn’t think about in beginning, but loneliness has been a big issue,&#8221; he said, noting that one-third of 17-21 year-olds, a sweet consumer spot for the company, have reported loneliness during the pandemic. &#8220;Getting out to see culture brings people together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dice took a very tech approach to addressing all of this. First, it focused on building a network of venues and promoters with which it works very closely on ticketing &#8212; currently there are over 3,600 of them, covering not just music venues and promoters but also theaters and their ecosystems. Alongside this, it has a built data set of its own, created around those who visit the site and shop for events, which in turn is used to help build and recommend events to &#8220;lookalike&#8221; visitors to Dice.</p>
<p>Then, the tech stack that this sits on is focused around digital, mobile-based ticketing to prevent reselling and counterfeiting and provide a legal way to resell tickets where the venue can refund a purchase and resell itself over Dice. And it continually provides analytics to venues, artists and promoters so that they can better understand how and where they are seeing demand for specific gigs and artists, when to consider larger or smaller venues, and more.</p>
<p>All of this helps Dice stand out in what is otherwise a pretty crowded market that has on top of that been toiling through dicey times. And just like Hopin and its huge boost due to virtual events, it&#8217;s helped Dice attract investors.</p>
<p>“The concert business is a tangled mess of archaic tools and taxing ‘industry standards&#8217; where artists are paid last. Venues shell out for marketing and are beholden to ticket conglomerates. Fans have to hunt for shows and regularly buy overpriced tickets from secondary markets or scalpers. This doesn’t make sense!” said Fadell in a statement. &#8220;DICE re-engineers the entire live industry, not just a part of it: Venues are connected to fans and artists. Artists get transparency, access and control. Fans easily discover local shows and global live streams, and buy scalper-safe tickets with a single click.” Fadell is</p>
<p>All this was neither quick nor easy to build and scale. Dice, now active in dozens of cities, has been deliberate about those city launches: it chooses a place to build relationships with multiple venues so that, as Hutcheon described it, a rich picture of a city&#8217;s music (and other) events can be sketched out and filled in &#8212; and subsequently feed the recommendations for more events. The recommendations are a lucrative part of its business, with discovery driving more than 40% of tickets sold on Dice.</p>
<p>Hutcheon believes that Dice&#8217;s recommendation algorithms &#8220;are a huge advantage&#8221; but so is its selectivity. &#8220;We’re pretty careful about what gets onto Dice. The big question for us was, how do you scale curation? Our solution has been to partner with the best organizations and venues, and great bookers or artists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pointedly, Dice doesn&#8217;t tap social graph data from other platforms, which partly meant that Dice took some 3.5 years to get its own platform off the ground.</p>
<p>Building its own dataset, Hutcheon said, &#8220;was seen as stupid at the beginning. ‘You could get there so much faster if you used Facebook&#8217;s Open Graph,&#8217; people told us. But now it&#8217;s seen as smart for a couple of reasons: it gives us more control, but it&#8217;s also pro-privacy. If a site visitor doesn’t want recommendations, and only wants to see what is popular, then that&#8217;s fine, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dice doesn&#8217;t tap social data from other platforms, but it does leverage them to bring more audience to its service: it counts Spotify among its partners in that regard.</p>
<p>The next stages for Dice will be about not just expanding to more cities and netting in more live, in-person events &#8212; provided pandemic R-numbers being controllable &#8212; but also to continue innovating on the live streaming side. There is a lot of room for improvement there.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were seeing artists on Instagram doing pretty amateurish, lame performances, so we simply appealed to artists by saying: get paid and do this properly,&#8221; Hutcheon said. The focus so far has been not just on any performance, but trying to create iconic and distinctive ones: think Nick Cave <a href="https://www.nickcave.com/releases/idiotprayer/idiot-prayer-nick-cave-alone-at-alexandra-palace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playing</a> in London&#8217;s Alexandra Palace.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that people were buying tickets in advance for livestreams made me realize that people needing things to look forward to,&#8221; he added. And he still thinks that will continue even as venue doors reopen. Dice&#8217;s live events data shows that for in-person events where tickets are purchased on its platform, about 80-85% of all tickets were sold to people living in major cities close to the event. But when it came to virtual live streams, only 39% came from major cities: &#8220;Older consumers, or younger kids, who couldn&#8217;t have gone to see Nick Cave in Ally Pally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now they can, and that kind of &#8220;special&#8221; stream that isn&#8217;t a replication of anything a ticket buyer could see in person will be what Dice focuses on ahead. &#8220;This why we built the live-streaming stack. The future is hybrid broadcasting,&#8221; said Hutcheon.</p>
<p>“We believe DICE’s technology has the capacity to transform the future of live entertainment,” said Yanni Pipilis, managing partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “Alongside the flexibility and security of seamless ticketing, the platform connects fans, artists and venues in a completely new way&#8230; We are excited to partner with DICE to help create remarkable event experiences for fans all over the world.”</p>
<p>Dice says that it is currently on track to have 49,000 artists and creators using its platform by the end of 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://aspireapp.com/">Aspire</a>, the Singapore-based neobank that wants to become an “end-to-end financial operating system” for Southeast Asian businesses, is moving closer to its aspirations with a $158 million Series B. The round consisted of $58 million in equity and $100 million in debt, and was led by an undisclosed global fintech-focused growth equity investor, with participation from DST Global Partners, CE Innovation Fund, B Capital Partners and returning investors MassMutual Ventures, Picus Capital, AFG and Hummingbird Ventures. The debt capital was provided by hedge fund Fasanara Capital.</p>
<p>The round also included angel investors from some notable fintech startups, like Wise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus; Qonto co-founders Alexandre Port and Steve Anavi; Uala founder Pierpaolo Barbieri; Xendit co-founder Moses Lo; Payfazz co-founder Hendra Kwik; and Clara co-founder Gerry Colyer.</p>
<p>Aspire was founded in 2018 to provide working capital loans for small- to medium-sized businesses, but soon after its founding, it began taking a multi-product strategy. Its portfolio of services now include bank accounts for cross-border businesses, corporate cards and automated invoice processing, all of which are connected to financial management software. The company also operates an incorporation service for Singaporean companies called Aspire Kickstart.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 business accounts have been opened on Aspire, and in total they transact about $2 billion annually, doubling<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/aspires-business-accounts-reach-1b-in-annualized-transaction-volume-one-year-after-launching/"> in five months from May</a>.</p>

<p>“What we’re trying to do is connect traditional banking services with software because we realize the biggest problem is that these two are completely disconnected,” co-founder and chief executive officer Andrea Baronchelli told TechCrunch. “So you have access to accounts, cards, but those are not powered by software. By putting them together, our vision is to move beyond the concept of digital banking and basically create an operating system where this banking product and software will co-exist.”</p>
<p>In addition to Singapore, Aspire also operates in Indonesia and Vietnam and is laying the groundwork, including regulatory, to expand into other Southeast Asian markets, though Baronchelli said it’s too early to announce what markets Aspire is focused on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Based on the company’s product research and interviews with businesses, Baronchelli said that the average SME uses seven providers for their bank accounts, credit solutions, foreign exchange, invoice and payroll management and accounting. Aspire’s goal is to become a one-stop, end-to-end solutions for SMEs. Most of Aspire’s customers sign-up when they need their first business account or corporate card, and then start using its other products as they grow.</p>
<p>For larger SMEs that already have business accounts, Aspire tries to capture their attention with value-added products, like its expense management software or credit solutions.</p>
<p>Aspire’s credit cards and working capital loans usually start at around $50,000 and can go up to $300,000, but can be customized as businesses grow to increase credit lines. “We had to do that because we realized our segment is a moving target by definition,” Baronchelli said. “We cannot be extremely tied with amounts because our businesses and clients grow.”</p>
<p>The company’s plans to build an end-to-end ecosystem is how it differentiates from other fintechs that offer business accounts, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/singapore-based-volopay-raises-2-1-million-seed-round-to-build-a-financial-control-center-for-businesses/">Volopay</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/wise-announces-plans-to-go-public-via-direct-listing/">Wise</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/revolut-confirms-a-fresh-800m-in-funding-at-a-33b-valuation-to-supercharge-its-financial-services-superapp/">Revolut</a>. Aspire is currently working on building out its payroll system, because many of its clients have employees in different countries. It is also adding more features to its invoice management tool to make reconciling payments with account balances easier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.ninjavan.co/">Ninja Van</a>, a Singapore-based logistics startup, has closed a $578 million Series E round to support its operations infrastructure and technology systems growth.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Investors include China’s Alibaba Group as well as existing investors <a href="https://www.dpd.com/group/en/company/geopost/">DPDgroup’s GeoPost</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/07/b-capital-first-close-406-million/">Facebook co-founder Eduardo Savering’s B Capital Group</a>, Monk’s Hill Ventures, and Zamrud, a sovereign wealth fund controlled by Brunei, based on its statement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The latest round topped at a valuation of more than $1 billion prior to a potential initial public offering as early as next year, according to media reports. The company&#8217;s spokesperson declined to comment on the valuation.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The Series E brings the firm&#8217;s total funding up to $976.5 million, the spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This round comes after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/singapores-logistics-startup-ninja-van-raises-279m/">its $279 million Series D round</a> at about $750 million of valuation in April 2020 and a $87million Series C round in Jan 2018.</p>
<p>Ninja Van will use the proceeds to strengthen its operations including micro supply chain solutions to optimize e-commerce opportunities in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ninja Van claims it delivers approximately 2 million parcels a day, with more than 1.5 million active shippers and around 100 million recipients.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2014 by CEO Lai Chang Wen, CTO Shaun Chong and CPO Boxian Tan, the company operates its business across Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It currently employs more than 61,000 staff.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We strongly believe in the potential of e-commerce in Southeast Asia, in particular the power of technology-enabled logistics to fuel e-commerce growth. With Ninja Van&#8217;s vast presence and extensive local insights in the region, we are confident that our partnership with Ninja Van would enable us to better serve participants in the e-commerce ecosystem across the region.” said Mr. Kenny Ho, Head of Investment for Southeast Asia, Alibaba Group.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/">TechCrunch’s China roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">On Friday, Huawei&#8217;s chief financial executive Meng Wanzhou was released from house arrest in Vancouver after reaching a breakthrough deal with the U.S. Justice Department. Chinese startups that announced major funding rounds this week include Momenta, a Daimler-backed autonomous driving startup, Nreal, an augmented reality company, and Hai Robotics, a warehouse robotics maker.</p>
<h2>Landmark deal</h2>
<p>Meng, the daughter of Huawei&#8217;s founder Ren Zhengfei, entered an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/huawei-cfo-wanzhou-meng-admits-misleading-global-financial-institution">agreement</a> with the U.S. Justice Department in which she admitted to some wrongdoing while prosecutors deferred wire and bank fraud charges against her and could dismiss the indictment in 2022.</p>
<p>In 2018, Meng was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/huawei-cfo-arrested-in-canada-awaits-us-extradition/?utm_source=tctwreshare&amp;sr_share=twitter">arrested</a> in Vancouver, Canada on suspicion she violated U.S. trade sanctions against Iran. Over the years, her case has become an irritant in straining U.S.-China relations. Around the time Meng took off for Shenzhen, home to Huawei&#8217;s headquarters, on Friday, China released two Canadians who have been detained on spying charges. Beijing has repeatedly denied connections between the detention of the two Canadians and Meng&#8217;s arrest.</p>
<p>Through a remote court appearance via video on Friday, Meng pleaded <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/24/huawei-meng-wanzhou-new-york-court-hearing-514134">not guilty</a> to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/huawei-cfo-wanzhou-meng-admits-misleading-global-financial-institution">charges</a> of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, bank fraud and wire fraud. However, she admitted to the basic facts underpinning the DOJ&#8217;s charges, which include &#8220;multiple material misrepresentations to a senior executive of a financial institution regarding Huawei’s business operations in Iran in an effort to preserve Huawei’s banking relationship with the financial institution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Huawei Technologies, admitted today that she failed to tell the truth about Huawei’s operations in Iran, and as a result, the financial institution continued to do business with Huawei in violation of U.S. law. Our prosecution team continues to prepare for trial against Huawei, and we look forward to proving our case against the company in court,&#8221; said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the DOJ&#8217;s Criminal Division in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/huawei-cfo-wanzhou-meng-admits-misleading-global-financial-institution">release</a>.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s news outlets have largely left out Meng&#8217;s confirmation of wrongdoings and internet users rushed to triumph the Huawei executive&#8217;s release after three years. Within hours, posts hashtagged #MengWanzhouReturningToMotherland have garnered <a href="https://s.weibo.com/weibo?q=%23%E5%AD%9F%E6%99%9A%E8%88%9F%E5%8D%B3%E5%B0%86%E5%9B%9E%E5%88%B0%E7%A5%96%E5%9B%BD%23">over 1 billion views</a> on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We look forward to seeing Meng Wanzhou returning home safely to be reunited with her family. Huawei will continue to defend itself against the allegations in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York,&#8221; the company said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Huawei/status/1441674650606473222">statement</a>.</p>
<p>Ment <a href="https://www.scmp.com/video/china/3150085/meng-wanzhou-returns-china-and-canadians-freed-after-us-court-reaches-deal">said</a> upon her release the past three years have been &#8220;a disruptive time&#8221; for her as &#8220;a mother, a wife and a company executive.&#8221; In a <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-09-25/Huawei-s-Meng-Wanzhou-releases-statement-detailing-her-feelings-13QoRMK0kiQ/index.html">statement</a>, she said support from China, both at the governmental and civil level, gave her faith and kept her going during the &#8220;dark moments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meng&#8217;s return might boost employee morale at Huawei but the telecom equipment and smartphone giant continues to suffer from the aftershocks caused by U.S. sanctions. Huawei will see revenue from its smartphone business drop by at least $30-40 billion in 2021, its chairman Eric Xu <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/huawei-2021-smartphone-revenue-drop-by-least-30-40-bln-rotating-chairman-2021-09-24/">said Friday</a>. Once a global handset leader, Huawei has fallen out of the top ranks and been unseated by its Chinese rivals, with Xiaomi overtaking Apple as the second best-selling brand worldwide <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/xiaomi-global-shipments-push-past-apple-for-no-2-spot/">in Q2</a>.</p>
<p>In 2019, Huawei lost access to critical chip components and software after the Trump Administration<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/us-commerce-department-adds-46-huawei-affiliates-to-entity-list/"> put it on an export blacklist</a>. The firm has since stepped up efforts to make its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/huawei-uncertainties-new-us-chip-rules-tsmc/">handset chips</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/huawei-officially-launches-android-alternative-harmonyos-for-smartphones/">operating system</a> but these technologies have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/huawei-uncertainties-new-us-chip-rules-tsmc/">proven hard to come by</a> in a short span of time.</p>

<h2>Fundings</h2>
<p>In other news, General Motors said it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/gm-invests-300m-in-chinas-first-self-driving-car-unicorn-momenta/">pour $300 million</a> into Chinese autonomous driving technology provider <strong>Momenta</strong>, which already counts Toyota, Chinese state-backed SAIC Motor and Mercedes-Benz AG among its investors.</p>
<p>Substantial funding has become necessary for competing in China&#8217;s autonomous driving race, and coalition with entrenched automakers are even more important as robotaxi upstarts begin testing their commercial viability by deploying advanced or autonomous driving solutions in trucks, buses and passenger cars.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we&#8217;ve seen Momenta&#8217;s rivals <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-pony-ai-hits-5-3-billion-valuation/">Pony.ai</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/weride-310-million-series-c/">WeRide</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/china-roundup-beijing-is-tearing-down-the-digital-walled-gardens/">Deeproute</a> securing financings in the hundreds of million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Nreal</strong>, founded by Magic Leap veteran Xu Chi, said it has raised $100 million to expand overseas and develop new AR products. We covered its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/08/chinas-nreal-raises-15m-to-shrink-augmented-headsets-to-size-of-sunglasses/">$15 million Series A round</a> back in 2019 and the startup has reportedly reached a staggering $700 million valuation as of the current raise, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/23/chinese-ar-glasses-firm-nreal-raises-100-million-in-new-funding.html">according to CNBC</a>. Nreal has been touting headsets that are more affordable and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/08/chinas-nreal-raises-15m-to-shrink-augmented-headsets-to-size-of-sunglasses/">lightweight</a> to its Western peers.</p>
<p>Lastly, Hai Robotics, a Shenzhen-based startup that makes case handling robots for warehouses, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/hai-robotics-picks-up-200m-for-its-warehouse-robot/">just raised $200 million</a>. Industrial robots are in demand in China as the government calls for greater efficiency to deal with labor shortage in its manufacturing sector. As Huang He, an investor focused on industrial autoamtion, previously told me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Youngsters these days would rather become food delivery riders than work in a factory. The work that robots replace is the low-skilled type, and those that still can’t be taken up by robots pay well and come with great benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, he warned that the market might be overheated:</p>
<blockquote><p> There’s this bizarre phenomenon in China, where the most funded and valuable industrial robotic firms are generating less than 30 million yuan in annual revenue and not really heard of by real users in the industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>In August, another warehouse robotics startup, Syrius, which is also based in the hardware haven of Shenzhen, announced it had raised <a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/syrius-robotics-completes-series-b-funding-round/">over $20 million</a> led by ByteDance.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Facebook recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/facebook-debuts-its-ray-ban-stories-smart-sunglasses/">announced</a> its highly anticipated wearable sunglasses that can record video from a user’s perspective. Despite many of our legitimately squeamish reactions to this new product, one of Facebook’s decisions in this launch is likely to make it a success where Google Glass failed.</p>
<p>Taking a page from the business school curriculum, Facebook leveraged an <em>effectual approach</em> to its launch by partnering with Ray-Ban &#8212; a lesson all new product managers would do well to remember.</p>
<p>To best understand this, we need to first revisit Google Glass. It launched in 2011 as a prototype for only select users. Consistent with Google’s approach with beta launching at the time, these users paid $1,500 for their chance to play and test out what looked and felt like the future.</p>
<p>Despite being named one of <a href="https://techland.time.com/2012/11/01/best-inventions-of-the-year-2012/slide/google-glass/">Time Magazine’s</a> best inventions of the year, Google Glass was riddled with problems and very much an unfinished product. Many have commented previously on how one of the key failures of Google Glass was that it was a classic example of putting out new technology without a clear use case. What were people to do with Google Glass?</p>
<p>Another important aspect of the Google Glass launch was that the design of the product was done in-house and marketing was carried out by a somewhat unintentional public relations campaign led by co-founder Sergey Brin, seen wearing them everywhere from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/style/why-google-glass-broke.html">Silicon Valley to Fashion Week</a>. Effectively, Google was surfing on the wave of its success and offering up a new toy that seemed to be inevitable — but had no clear use.</p>
<p>Fast forward to earlier this month. Facebook launched new wearable sunglasses that are immediately and often compared to Google Glass. The question on everyone’s mind (other than whether the person next to me will be recording me without my permission) is whether Facebook’s attempt will tank like Google Glass. However, the decision to partner with top sunglass maker Ray-Ban to utilize one of the most <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-sunglasses-brands">recognized brands</a>, the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/03/ray-ban-wayfarer/">Wayfarer glasses</a>, as the actual wearable is likely to make Facebook’s version a success.</p>
<p>While Facebook is more than a decade from its entrepreneurial beginnings, like many large technology companies, it necessarily must explore at the edges of innovation in order to prevent the product or service from making its platforms outdated. This means that many of the product launches that Facebook considers require them to navigate not risky nor unknown situations — but unknowable ones. What’s the difference?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The issue that Facebook and many technology futurists face is what many refer to as Knightian uncertainty. In 1921, Frank Knight published <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2010/explained-knightian-0602">research</a> that emphasized an important difference between risk and uncertainty. For the Big Four technology companies, the risk is the management of revenue to ensure that the market share between Facebook’s ad revenue growth next year continues to outpace Google’s.</p>
<p>Both companies have a track record of revenue growth, so we can utilize some historical data to make fairly decent predictions about the future. The key here is that tools of prediction have strength and thus are leveraged in decision-making.</p>
<p>Now comparing that situation to whether Facebook’s glass will be successful is an entirely different situation. What historical records can we draw from? Will demand be similar to Apple Watch in its first year? Or will it be more like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22238668/microsoft-zune-fans-mp3-music-player-subreddit">Zune</a>, Microsoft’s attempt at competing with the iPod? The point is that the demand for this product is unknowable, and there is very little value to prediction in unknowable situations — which we can also refer to as Knightian uncertainty.</p>
<p>So why will Facebook be more successful? Because while Facebook is no longer a startup, it leveraged a key entrepreneurial method to improve its chances. Namely, it leveraged an effectual approach to its launch of the Facebook glass by partnering with Ray-Ban.</p>
<p>While Google tried to invent the design of its new glasses — using its imagination about what people wanted &#8212; Facebook leveraged a design that already has some certainties around it. When a company or entrepreneur is launching a new product or service, working collaboratively is a key way to gain control of outcomes when predictive tools fail. Effectuation is an entrepreneurial method that encourages entrepreneurs to leverage aspects that are in or can be in their control.</p>
<p>You do this by starting with who you are, what you know and who you know. Instead of trying to predict what people will like in a pair of glasses and instead of learning itself how to market those glasses, Facebook chose to leverage the know-how of the largest player in the market.</p>
<p>Facebook moved forward through the unknowable by finding someone it knew to help it navigate a key uncertainty of its new product. For that reason alone, it has a better chance of success.</p>
<p>Ultimately, new consumer product innovations are incredibly uncertain (not risky), and most will fail. That means that even with Ray-Ban’s partnership, it can easily flop on so many other parameters, but like a good entrepreneur, Facebook has upped its chances by leveraging a key entrepreneurial approach to its product launch — improving its chances of success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h3>Epic Games dares Apple to let Fortnite for iOS back in the App Store</h3>

<p>Following the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/"> judge&#8217;s ruling</a> in the Epic-Apple antitrust lawsuit, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/fortnite-likely-isnt-coming-back-to-the-app-store-anytime-soon/"> asked Apple to reinstate Epic&#8217;s developer account</a>. But as Epic said, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">aims to appeal the court&#8217;s ruling</a>, Apple informed the company that it won&#8217;t be reinstating Epic&#8217;s account until the appeals have been resolved. In effect, that means Fortnite may not return to iOS for years, if Epic is forced to wait for the appeal&#8217;s decision to be made final.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sweeney made the request public by <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440711772483186690">tweeting</a> out a letter he sent to Apple making the request and the company&#8217;s response. The letter promises Apple that Fortnite would play by the rules &#8212; something that it didn&#8217;t do before, when it breached its contract with Apple by implementing its own payments to force the lawsuit. The letter also noted it had already disabled Epic payments server-side since it can&#8217;t update the app on users&#8217; devices. And it said it paid Apple the $6 million in fees ordered by the court, which had been gained as a result of routing around Apple&#8217;s in-app purchases with its own system.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208071" style="width: 570px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://twitter.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1440771699679498246"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208071" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2208071" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-24-at-11.42.24-AM.jpg?w=560" alt="" width="560" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-24-at-11.42.24-AM.jpg 1192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-24-at-11.42.24-AM.jpg?resize=123,150 123w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-24-at-11.42.24-AM.jpg?resize=247,300 247w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-24-at-11.42.24-AM.jpg?resize=768,933 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-24-at-11.42.24-AM.jpg?resize=560,680 560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-24-at-11.42.24-AM.jpg?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2208071" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1440771699679498246" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Sweeney on Twitter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>But what makes the letter interesting is that it&#8217;s not just Epic asking for re-entry. It&#8217;s daring Apple to follow the current court order.</p>
<p>The judge&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">decision</a> deemed Apple &#8220;not a monopoly,&#8221; which Apple then jubilantly celebrated, saying it&#8217;s something &#8220;we&#8217;ve known all along,&#8221; quoting the judge&#8217;s statement that Apple&#8217;s success was &#8220;not illegal.&#8221; However, the one part of the case where Epic won was where the judge declared Apple&#8217;s current in-app purchase (IAP) system anticompetitive. The court&#8217;s decision was that Apple would now have to accommodate developers by giving them the choice to include buttons or links to other places where users could pay for their in-app purchases outside the App Store, in addition to Apple&#8217;s IAP option.</p>
<p>Sweeney&#8217;s letter tells Apple Fortnite will play by the rules if Apple will. That is, if Apple follows the court&#8217;s guidelines to allow buttons and external links to other purchasing mechanisms, then Epic would resubmit the Fortnite app. In other words, Epic is ready to take advantage of the now legal option to route around Apple&#8217;s IAP system.</p>
<p>Apple, though, wasn&#8217;t having it. Apple&#8217;s legal team called Epic&#8217;s behavior in the past &#8220;duplicitous&#8221; when it breached its contract, and Apple saw no reason to reinstate the account until the court&#8217;s decision is made final. And of course, Sweeney <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440711772483186690">tweeted</a> that too, noting that appeals may take up to five years. (So bad news, Fortnite players.)</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s decline may help to signal to other developers not to try to break its rules, but for Epic it sets the stage for the next battle &#8212; one where it&#8217;s not just daring Apple to let it back in based on the new terms, but one where it&#8217;s also daring Congress to act, too. After all, Epic&#8217;s position seems to be, if Apple can boot out a multibillion-dollar company that made amends for breaking rules it believed to be illegal, then what hope would smaller developers have to ever fight back against the tech giant? And once kicked out, there is no other path to iOS. This seems to try to position Apple as the monopolist that the court said it wasn&#8217;t &#8212; which is what the appeal is all about.</p>

<p>A new forecast from (the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/">recently busted</a>) App Annie indicates the third quarter will be another good one for the app economy. Consumers worldwide will spend $34 billion on apps and games in Q3, a 20% year-over-year increase in spending. The jump indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on consumer habits and behavior is having a lasting effect when it comes to how people are now using apps for entertainment, shopping, work and education. Consumer spending on iOS apps grew 15% year over year to $22 billion, and 15% year-over-year on Google Play, to reach around $12 billion. Most of this revenue is generated by gaming apps, which account for 66% of the spend across both app stores. In terms of non-gaming apps, iOS commands 76% of consumer spending</p>
<p>Downloads in Q3 will also grow by 10% year-over-year to reach a record high of 36 billion, driven by Google Play and particularly downloads in emerging markets like India and Brazil, and others.</p>

<li><strong>Apple released the public versions of <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/ios-15-is-available-today/">iOS 15</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/ipados-15-is-available-today/">iPadOS 15</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/watchos-8-is-available-today/">watchOS 8.</a></strong> iOS 15 adds a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/ios-15-adds-all-the-little-features-that-were-missing/">number of new features</a>, most notably Focus modes, which allow you to personalize your experience based on your current context (work, sleep, driving, etc.); a revamped (and sort of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apple-walks-back-controversial-safari-changes-with-ios-15-beta-6-update/">controversial)</a> Safari update; improvements to Apple&#8217;s core apps; and more.</li>
<li><strong>Apple also <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/358512/ios-15-1-features-shareplay-release-date-how-to-install.html">released</a> to developers iOS 15.1, beta 1.</strong> The new beta adds SharePlay, the co-viewing feature for FaceTime, which did not make it in time for the public release of iOS 15. It also allows users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/ios-15-vaccine-card-wallet-app/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">store their vaccination records</a> in the Health app by taking a photo. (Or, if your health provider syncs your medical records, it may be in there already.)</li>
<li><strong>But! New data from <a href="https://mixpanel.com/trends/#report/ios_15">Mixpanel</a> indicates users are taking longer to upgrade to iOS 15 compared with iOS 14 at launch</strong>. In its first two days, iOS 14 had been adopted by 14.5% of users, compared with 8.5% for iOS 15.</li>
<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=1mmydqta">rolled out StoreKit 2</a> and new in-app purchase capabilities</strong>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/apples-storekit-2-simplifies-app-store-subscriptions-and-refunds-by-making-them-accessible-inside-apps/">StoreKit 2 adds</a> new Swift-based APIs that allow developers to determine product entitlements and eligibility for offers, get a user’s history of in-app purchases, find out the latest status of a subscription, provide a way to request refunds and manage subscriptions from within an app, and more. An App Store Server API is also in production for getting users&#8217; IAP history and subscription status. App Store server notifications, which provide real-time updates on IAPs to enable developers to create customized experiences, are coming soon.</li>
<li><strong>iOS 15 brings a major ASO update to the App Store.</strong> Now, the store will hide the screenshots for the apps you already have installed on your phone, which allows other apps and games to gain more visibility. This will be particularly important for those that appear in searches for major brands.</li>

<li><strong>Uber Eats <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uber-eats-adds-map-feature-so-users-can-find-nearest-restaurants-for-pickup/">added a new map feature</a> that allows users to search for food nearby by typing in either words or an emoji.</strong> That is, you could type in an emoji of a hamburger <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f354.png" alt="🍔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, and the map would display the exact distance from your location. The company said the change was introduced because a majority of users would switch to other map apps to find nearby food. Users will also be able to see delivery and pickup options within Uber Eats and the Uber app itself.</li>

Some of the features are arriving now, others in the weeks and months ahead. And the rollout itself is staggered so you might not see the update right away, either.</li>

<li><strong>Twitter continued to accelerate its product releases with this week&#8217;s introduction of even more features, including those in the crypto space.</strong> The company added support for <strong>Bitcoin tipping</strong> in its recently launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">“Tip Jar” feature</a>, which allows users to receive one-time payments through third-party services. Now, users will be able to add a Bitcoin Lightning wallet (via <a href="https://strike.me/api">Strike&#8217;s API</a>) or their Bitcoin address to accept crypto tips. Twitter also plans to support <strong>NFT authentication</strong> so creators could connect their crypto wallets to Twitter to showcase their NFTs.

Some users were concerned it gave the appearance of something akin to Twitter&#8217;s verified badge, offering an elevated status. Tumblr has since responded to user feedback by removing the blue Post+ badge that appeared next to the names of users who enabled the feature.<img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2205759" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-Shot-29.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-Shot-29.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-Shot-29.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-Shot-29.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-Shot-29.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-Shot-29.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-Shot-29.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-Shot-29.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></li>

The latter new addition could be particularly useful for creators, as admins will be able to record video and audio directly from a livestream or video chat.

The app introduces the concept of virtualized &#8220;desks&#8221; showing the time of day for that individual. It also offers &#8220;rooms&#8221; that can be organized by the company&#8217;s org chart or projects, or the rooms can be virtual representations of physical spaces &#8212; like a meeting room for gatherings or company cafeteria, where employees could hang out virtually. Desks and rooms can be locked and made private or they can be unlocked and open. Lounge also adopts features from consumer social apps like photo-sharing and drop-in audio for virtual &#8220;desk visits,&#8221; and displays employee&#8217;s participation in company-wide events, like steps or meditation challenges.

<p>With iOS 15, there are a number of new and improved Safari extensions now available. But one worth checking out is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amplosion-redirect-amp-links/id1585734696">Amplosion</a>, created by Christian Selig, also the developer of popular Reddit client app Apollo. The extension allows you to easily redirect from Google AMP pages to their normal, non-AMP counterparts. If, however, you prefer the AMP versions of some websites, you can add them to an in-app Allowlist. The extension will show you how many pages it&#8217;s blocked via an in-app counter and home screen widgets. There&#8217;s even an Easter egg in the form of a digital dog named Lord Waffles that lives in the app who has his own widget too. The extension is also fully open source for transparency. The app is a $2.99 download on the App Store.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here. </em></a></p>
<p>And just like that, TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 has come to an end. I’m exhausted, but it’s hard not to feel optimistic for the future after spending three days hearing vulnerable thoughts from some of the brightest minds in tech, from Canva CEO Melanie Perkins to comic-turned-creator Alexis Gay.</p>
<p>If I had to distill a singular takeaway from the hours of programming, demo floor and Startup Battlefield, it would be this: Disruption needs direction. We’re in the middle of unprecedented times, and while that’s been good news for some entrepreneurs (and bad news for very many), focus may be what leads us out of it.</p>
<p>The theme kept popping up in the panels that I hosted or tuned into. For example, when I bugged BBG Ventures’ Nisha Dua about how to best spend first-check capital, she kept homing in on the need for entrepreneurs to invest their north star, aka the most defensible and innovative part of their business, over flashier alternatives. When I bugged Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn about where his now-public company is going next, he drew a line that stopped right before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/duolingo-doesnt-want-to-disrupt-the-college-degree/">disrupting the college degree.</a> And of course, when I asked Reid Hoffman about how early-stage founders can better attract capital, he outlined why it’s important to have an opinion and stick by it — controversy preferred. Even Nth Cycle, the runner up of TC Battlefield, wants to revolutionize metals processing by complementing existing processes, not ignoring them altogether.</p>
<p>It was refreshing to hear grounded yet inventive perspectives throughout the week. For those who missed it, we’ll be publishing recaps of all panels over the next week. Here are some of my favorite panels so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2021-is-cellino/">And the winner of Startup Battlefield at Disrupt 2021 is… Cellino</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/how-ryan-reynolds-has-mastered-authentic-marketing/">How Ryan Reynolds has mastered authentic marketing</a></li>

<h2>Bootstrapping 101</h2>

<p>Mailchimp’s sale sparked a conversation about bootstrapping, so my colleagues Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm dug into what it means to skip capital and grow off of revenues (imagine!). In their latest collab, the duo explained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/bootstrapping-in-2021-goes-a-long-way/">what bootstrapping is like today</a> — in a world of infinite APIs, well-trained techies and ample demand for better software services.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>They argue that the money is reaching farther than it ever has in the past.</p>
<blockquote><p>But startups that don’t need — or perhaps simply do not want — to raise expensive equity capital while scaling have more tools within arm’s reach than ever before. Revenue-based financing is now an established concept. Some companies are taking it even further. Pipe has built a marketplace where companies can sell revenue — or perhaps we should describe it as a marketplace where revenue can be traded. A more active market for the buying and selling of revenue should help with price discovery, perhaps resulting in more attractive prices for founders and a more liquid market for their future receipts; the more capital that founders can access by selling top line instead of shares, the more viable bootstrapping may prove.</p></blockquote>

<p>China’s central bank said that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/china-says-all-cryptocurrency-related-transactions-are-illegal/">all cryptocurrency-related transactions are illegal in the country </a>and must be banned. The crackdown, within the world’s most populated nation, will limit internal, financial and payment companies from facilitating trading on their platforms, reports Manish Singh.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know, according to Singh: “</strong>Regulators in China have been weighing a ban on crypto mining for several years. But in recent quarters, several local firms have started to embrace crypto. Chinese app maker Meitu bought Bitcoin and Ether worth $40 million in March.” It’s unclear if this ban will be different from other tensions, or if the home of the largest crypto mining services will soon be chilled.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Hello everyone! Disrupt was this week, which meant that I spent more time than usual with my feet up, watching panels and startup pitches. It was good fun, but also meant that I had fewer calls than I might in a more regular week. So, what follows is an abbreviated newsletter that is a touch more observational than reported, if you follow. Let’s have some fun!</p>
<h2>Observation one: NFT speculation is good fun</h2>
<p>I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/the-nft-on-ramp-is-still-too-steep/">recently dipped a single toe into the world of NFTs</a>. After covering the space, it was time to participate in a very minor fashion as you can learn a lot more by doing than merely reading. Of course I try to avoid any and all possible ethical quandaries, but I don’t think that my owning two-figures&#8217; worth of crypto so that I could attempt to purchase a low-cost JPEG will really upset the apple cart.</p>
<p>It all went to hell, but an NFT that a kind Twitter user sent me is racking up bids. While I have not derived much pleasure from the particular image that I now own the digital signature to on a particular blockchain more than, say, most other online images, it has been sporting to watch folks try to buy it off me.</p>
<p>Several bids worth hundreds of dollars have cropped up (the latest sitting at $382.94), which made me sit back and wonder who really wants my image. I presume that I’m seeing speculation over value collection in the offers, but I do now better understand why NFT fans are stoked by their cottage industry. After all, who doesn’t want to magically generate real-world value from an image that, until recently, would have had essentially zero value? It feels like cheating. (To be clear, I am not selling my NFT as I don’t want to bother with the taxes, and it <em>does</em> seem like selling it for profit would generate some sort of ethics issue. So I guess I will hodl? Forever?)</p>
<h2>Observation two: This is a great moment for fintech IPOs</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/it-turns-out-fintech-is-worth-as-much-as-saas/">scalding public-market reception for Boston-based fintech unicorn Toast</a> this week showed the world that it is possible to get software-like valuations for payments revenues, provided a sufficiently quick growth rate. Our read was that the warmth with which Toast was welcomed to the stock market indicated that it’s a great time for fintech unicorns to get off their collective duffs and go public.</p>
<p>I stand by that. But what I had perhaps missed was just how much value is sitting by the sidelines. Not in terms of valuation &#8212; we already know those numbers &#8212; but in terms of user numbers. Observe the following tweet:</p>

<p>I wouldn’t have guessed that Chime was in fifth place, but those figures imply simply huge payment flows which, as we have recently seen, are currently valued like rivers of gold. So NuBank and Chime and Dave and others, let’s do this thing? Please?</p>
<h2>Observation three: Chinese tech is increasingly toxic</h2>
<p>News this week broke that <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/zooms-mega-merger-five9-hitting-135739068.html">the Zoom-Five9 deal could be in for regulatory issues</a> over the acquiring company’s Chinese roots. If Zoom having R&amp;D operations in China means that it’s megabuy of Five9 goes poof, it would be an indicator not only of increasing distance between the two globally leading economies, but also a door-closing moment on a possible source of tech liquidity.</p>
<p>Also this week Lithuania warned that hardware from Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi is able to detect and block certain terms that China’s government likes to censor. Now, maybe that’s just how Xiaomi makes all its phones, but it’s not a <em>great</em> look. The country has “told its civil servants to jettison their Chinese-made smartphones after experts found they contained automatic censorship software and other security flaws,” <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lithuania-orders-civil-servants-to-hang-up-chinese-smartphones-over-spyware-fears-30vm86xnw">The Times reported</a>.</p>
<p>Again, toxic.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trutledge/">Tom Rutledge</a> is a co-founder of <a href="https://www.wapanda.co/">Wapanda</a>, a startup dedicated to realizing the goal of city-led innovation in the taxi and ride-share industry.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">If saving the environment is merely a lifestyle choice, the automakers and their latest electric vehicles have got us covered. Tesla’s Plaid touts performance. Leafs, Priuses and Volts preach humility. And Ford is flexing its muscle with launches of electric Mustangs and F-150s.</p>
<p>But if consumers’ choices are going to contribute to a greener future &#8212; if they’re going to opt for energy efficiency over flash &#8212; they need the ability to make smart purchasing decisions. To enable that, an old-fashioned measuring stick from the gasoline era could come in handy: the concept of miles per gallon.</p>
<p>In the electric vehicle (EV) era, car shopping is no longer a simple matter of finding a high-MPG car and a cheap gallon of gas. Electricity costs are confusing. Price and efficiency information is hard to find and harder to understand. And ultimately, you have to do the math.</p>
<p>That means getting to know electric energy’s unit of choice: the kilowatt-hour, or kWh &#8212; a string of characters better suited to an engineering textbook. To determine their costs and carbon footprints, drivers must solve the brain teasers that turn kWh into dollars and miles.</p>
<p>If you don’t do that, you’re trusting the automakers to do the right thing for you and the environment.</p>
<p>The government can lead on this problem. In fact, it has, and it does. Gas pumps have long been required to list the price of a gallon, gallons pumped and total fill-up cost. A vehicle’s EPA-mandated miles-per-gallon rating &#8212; displayed on dashboards and on every new car’s MPG sticker &#8212; ties it all together.</p>
<p>So maybe we already have a common denominator for the EV age. A familiar, tangible energy unit that gives us an apples-to-apples way to think about cost, efficiency and pollution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fellow Americans, say hello &#8212; again &#8212; to the gallon. Even as we leave the gas-powered car behind, we can keep its energy unit. It’s tangible, and if it works for the energy contained in gas, we can make it work for electricity.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/otaq/gvg/learn-more-fuels.htm">a gallon of unleaded gas contains about 34 kWh of energy</a>. Knowing that, you can easily deduce how much your energy purchase costs and how far it can take you. The gallon can even help you better understand your other electricity usage, putting your home energy costs on an apples-to-apples basis with your automobile’s energy costs.</p>
<p>When I gallon-ized my energy bills for the month of August, I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>My house used 56 gallons (1,888 kWh) worth of electricity.</li>
<li>My average home electricity cost was $6.34 per gallon.</li>
<li>At a Tesla supercharger, I paid $8.43 per gallon (25 cents per kWh).</li>
</ul>
<p>The government already publishes <a href="https://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/fuel-economy-and-environment-label-examples">an MPG equivalent for electric and hybrid vehicles</a>. Using MPG, it becomes clear that electric vehicles make up for a lot of that high cost-per-gallon in efficiency, often with ratings over 100 MPG.</p>
<p>MPG is already good for more than car shopping. <a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1123364_nyc-taxi-mpg-requirements-also-cut-pollution-study-confirms">New York City’s MPG mandates have doubled taxis’ fuel efficiency since 2009</a>. (The city also reserves a portion of taxi licenses &#8212; medallions &#8212; for hybrids.) Uber and Lyft have announced green initiatives, but their lightly regulated status has let them avoid MPG standards.</p>
<p>Smart energy shopping alone will not solve climate change. Energy watchdogs also need to monitor the industry’s carbon impact from both electricity generation and EV-related hardware manufacturing.</p>
<p>All else equal, though, using less energy means less pollution. And common units can steer us toward smart choices that encompass far more than our cars. Should I buy batteries so I can stock up on electricity when it’s cheapest? Do solar panels make sense? What about better insulation or more efficient appliances?</p>
<p>A high-MPG vehicle and a home that also goes a long way on a gallon? Together, that would be a solid lifestyle choice.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for September 24, 2021. Hanging in there, everyone? It was more than a busy week, but the TechCrunch team is still ticking along, covering the startup world just for you. If you need to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-is/">catch up on who won Battlefield this year</a>, the Equity podcast crew has you covered. And with that, let’s begin! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/china-says-all-cryptocurrency-related-transactions-are-illegal/"><strong>China bans crypto (again):</strong></a> If you have paid any attention to the larger world of cryptocurrencies, you’re familiar with bad news from China. Over the past few years, the country has put an increasingly wet blanket on its place in the international crypto economy. More of the same from China today was enough to ding the value of major cryptos &#8212; not a great note to end the week on if you were Coinbase or Robinhood.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/latin-america-finds-a-champion-in-softbank-international-group-ceo-marcelo-claure/"><strong>SoftBank triples down on Latin America:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The battle to build the next great tech company is a global scrap, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/?tpcc=ECTW2020">few regions are as hot as Latin America</a>. One reason that LatAm has done so well in recent quarters has been a huge influx of capital from SoftBank. And as we learned this week, the Japanese telco and startup mega-investor has billions more earmarked for Latin American startups.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/bootstrapping-in-2021-goes-a-long-way/"><strong>It’s a good time to bootstrap:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Looking back at a few Disrupt panels on alternative fundraising, going public and more, TechCrunch took a look at today’s bootstrapping economy. With more ways for startups to rake in capital than ever, the need to raise venture capital could be in decline for certain startup types &#8212; even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">as global venture capital totals shoot higher</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/hungryroot-co-founders-new-venture-noops-a-plant-based-pudding-startup-raises-another-2m/"><strong>Will consumes say “nope” to Noops?</strong></a> Well, the plant-based pudding company Noops certainly hopes not. It just raised $2 million after raising $2 million just a few months ago. The market for alt-milks is big. Perhaps oat milk puddings will become the next oat milk? Lerer Hippeau provided the new capital.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/operations-observability-platform-avenue-launches-with-4m/"><strong>Say hello to OpsObs:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Avenue thinks that “operations observability” is going to be a hot ticket, and after launching its product last week, the startup announced that it has raised $4 million. Per TechCrunch reporting, the goal of Avenue is “give operations their own tools to monitor teams” via a “command center” of sorts. As someone who has never seen a chart in a UI I didn’t want to read, I presume that this will quickly become a trillion-dollar business.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/as-remote-work-becomes-normal-ukio-raises-9m-for-premium-long-term-rentals/"><strong>Ukio raises $9M for longer-stay rentals:</strong></a><strong> </strong>One thing that Airbnb noticed during the pandemic was that while short stays were taking a whacking, longer-term rentals rose in popularity. Ukio is a startup-sized bet on the observation, offering units with rental schemes with terms of a month or longer. So, do you want to go work in Spain for a month? Ukio might have just the spot for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Ryan Reynolds has mastered authentic marketing</h2>
<p>Most people know Ryan Reynolds from his movies, but he also owns a majority stake in Mint Mobile, a mobile virtual network operator, which has grown more than 50,000% in the past three years. He also invested in Aviation Gin before selling it for a staggering $600 million last year.</p>
<p>He’s also a founder of Maximum Effort, the marketing firm that promotes the “Deadpool” franchise, Aviation Gin, Mint Mobile and that viral Match.com <a href="https://youtu.be/qmb5ENInqVk">ad featuring Satan and the year 2020</a> as a match made in hell.</p>
<p>He spoke to Jordan Crook about how startups can adapt his concept of “fast-vertising” to use real-time cultural moments as a springboard for building their own brand buzz, among other things.</p>
<p>“When we lead with creative and we have an idea or are inspired by something, we get quite aggressive with our excitement and try to make something infectious around it,” said Reynolds.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/fcc-showers-schools-across-the-u-s-with-1-2b-from-emergency-connectivity-fund/"><strong>U.S. doles out $1.2B for underserved internet connectivity:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Tired of all the bad news in the world? We are too. In <em>good</em> news, the U.S. regulatory body responsible for domestic internet connectivity is rolling out big funds to help school districts get more kids online. It’s hard to do homework or participate in remote school without a connection, and not every kid has one. There’s more money coming as well, TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/uks-ai-strategy-is-ambitious-but-needs-funding-to-match-says-facultys-marc-warner/"><strong>Will the U.K. fund its ambitious AI strategy?</strong></a><strong> </strong>The U.K. government wants the island nation to be a world leader in AI. Fair enough. But questions remain about just how much that will cost and if the same government is going to put up the required duckets. To be a leader in the global AI race, one merely has to beat out China, the United States and the EU for supremacy. Let’s see what Boris has planned.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/amazon-assembles-video-streaming-apps-to-fight-with-netflix-and-disney-in-india/"><strong>Amazon brings Prime Video Channels to India:</strong></a> Indian Amazon customers can now subscribe to eight different digital channels in their country, including “Discovery+ [for] $4 per year, Mubi $27, Hoichoi $8.2, DocuBay $6.8, ErosNow $4, Lionsgate Play $9.5, manoramaMax $9.5 and ShortsTV $4,” TechCrunch reports. Amazon’s digital media ambitions appear undaunted, so expect more on this theme in coming quarters from both the Indian market and others.</li>
</ul>
<p>And to close us out, Chris Pratt is apparently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/nintendo-announced-that-chris-pratt-will-play-mario-on-the-big-screen/">taking on the voice role for famous digital character Mario</a> in an upcoming movie. We don’t get it either.</p>

<p>Duolingo CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn has appeared at TechCrunch Disrupt before, but this year was his first time representing a public company.</p>
<p>A few months ago, reporter Natasha Mascarenhas described Duolingo’s debut as the “bellwether edtech IPO of the year,” so she was well-equipped with questions about the company’s plans for boosting revenue. For example, is premium content in the cards?</p>
<p>“If we wanted to make more money in the short-term, we could probably start paywalling things, but I think that would stifle our growth,” von Ahn says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“If we start charging for some aspects of language learning, eventually we’re just gonna charge for everything.”</p>
<p>Here’s a recap, along with a video that captures the entire interview.</p>

<p>The amount of plastic pouring into our oceans is set to triple by 2040, and most un-recycled plastic in the world is generated by consumer packaged goods.</p>
<p>As people look to minimize the waste they produce, startups are coming up with novel solutions to help people and companies meet sustainability goals.</p>

<p>Connie Loizos asked Erin Schneider, regional director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s San Francisco office, about crypto lending and the potential for new regulations covering SPAC companies and NFTs, but Schneider was clear from the outset that she was limited in what she could say.</p>
<p>“She did, however, share insight into her personal thinking about a range of these issues, which, given her position, seems very much worth knowing,” writes Connie.</p>

<p>The U.S. healthcare system is a contentious topic, an uncomfortable truth that became evident when Darrell Etherington moderated a conversation with Cityblock Health president and co-founder Toyin Ajayi, Forward CEO and founder Adrian Aoun, and Carbon Health‘s Eren Bali.</p>
<p>“We keep saying that these companies are kind of consumer-centric,” Aoun says.</p>
<p>“But in many ways I think one of the things that you realize is that when you get in bed with the insurance companies, which, whether it’s a Carbon or a Cityblock, at the end of the day, [if] you get in bed with the insurance companies, unfortunately, your incentive is basically not to go build a good consumer product.”</p>
<p>Said Darrell: “Let’s just say this conversation got heated — fast.”</p>

<p>Peloton CEO John Foley discussed broader safety issues with the category, noting that the unfortunate circumstances behind a recent recall forced the company to take a closer look at product safety, as well as whether the company will maintain its pandemic-boosted growth as cities reopen.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing a lot more people get excited about Peloton and say, ‘I’m not going back to the gym, the gym was a failed model. It was a failed contract between the member and the business, and actually, I didn’t go to the gym. It wasn’t convenient, I didn’t want to go drive somewhere and shower outside my home and take that extra time away from my family,’” the CEO says.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm has spilled much ink about the Toast IPO in recent weeks, but he kept at it Thursday, comparing the debut of the Boston-based software-and-payments company to Remitly’s Wednesday evening flotation.</p>
<p>Seattle-based fintech Remitly, like Toast, priced above its proposed range.</p>
<p>“At $43 per share, Remitly is valued less like a fintech company with gross margins in the 50% to 60% range and more like a middle-tier public SaaS firm, flush with recurring revenues and net-dollar retention north of 100%,” Alex writes.</p>
<p>“The lesson from today’s public markets appears to be that revenue growth matters more than near-term margins for fintech companies, allowing them to secure valuations that far surpass their final private marks.”</p>

<p>“When we first shared LatAm’s digital acceleration story in last year’s Latin America Digital Transformation Report, we believed we were at the peak of digital growth catalyzed by the pandemic,” Julio Vasconcellos, the managing partner of Latin America-focused VC fund Atlantico, writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“But with 2021 came all the second- and third-order effects of the crisis, further accelerating a continentwide tech expansion to a pace beyond any projections.”</p>
<p>Vasconcellos breaks down the details from this year’s report. Just one eye-popping stat: Eight new unicorns have already been minted in the region this year, nearly hitting the 2020 rate by midyear.</p>

<p>Design software startup Canva has experienced “staggering growth,” Managing Editor Jordan Crook writes in a recap of her conversation with Canva CEO Melanie Perkins.</p>
<p>With a fresh $200 million and a $40 billion valuation, could Canva utilize acquisitions to continue that explosive growth?</p>
<p>“As a company with huge goals — to empower anyone in the world to design, and as a result of that, to become one of the most valuable companies in the world — anyone who helps Canva ‘leapfrog’ toward those goals is particularly interesting as an acquisition target,” Jordan wrote of her chat with the CEO.</p>

<p>Ingrid Lunden began with a simple question when she sat down with Calendly founder and CEO Tope Awotona: If the product works well, how do you take it to the next level — and frankly, why should you?</p>
<p>Calendly raised $350 million at a $3 billion valuation earlier this year, but little has changed despite the infusion of cash.</p>
<p>“The question I had at the time [of that funding round] was, will the company take it as a distraction and become enamored with the publicity that comes with that? Or will we stay focused and continue to work really hard for our customers and partners and ourselves?” Awotona says.</p>
<p>“Nine months later, it’s very clear that we’ve done the latter. Our culture and values have more or less remained the same.”</p>

<p>Slack founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield and Salesforce COO Bret Taylor discussed their $28 billion merger, how they’re integrating the two companies, and the ongoing competition it faces from Microsoft Teams, which has grown faster than Slack, and which Butterfield once said was “unhealthily obsessed with killing Slack.”</p>
<p>“Over the last year, maybe even 18 months, I think Microsoft’s preoccupation with Slack has shifted somewhat to a preoccupation with killing Zoom, because Teams turns out to not really [be] so much of a direct competitor,” Butterfield says.</p>

<p>When is the right time to hire someone to oversee a company’s security efforts?</p>
<p>In an interview with Security Editor Zack Whittaker, Twitter CISO Rinki Sethi talked about the modern role of a chief information security officer and how the next generation of CISOs can stay ahead.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to be the security idealist and say you need to invest in security before the product or business features, but I think there’s a really strong balance,” Sethi says. “If you think about building security right from the beginning, I think you do have a really strong competitive advantage.”</p>

<p>It took a global pandemic for BioNTech to become a household name: The technology it had been plugging away at meant it “happened to be positioned extremely well to use its mRNA technology to address the novel coronavirus, in part because it already had a partnership in place with Pfizer to develop a flu inoculation.”</p>
<p>BioNTech co-founder and CEO Uğur Şahin spoke with News Editor Darrell Etherington about the company’s start and its “broader vision,” which extends beyond the use of mRNA.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, BioNTech’s mission is to make treatments that are optimized not only to specific patient needs, but also to time and place,” Etherington writes in a recap for Extra Crunch. “All the treatments in the company’s pipeline are about refining the approach to addressing disease, making the process much more like a metaphorical scalpel than a bludgeon.”</p>
<p>“We can develop classical pharmaceuticals like a vaccine [in the case of COVID], but on the other side, also really continue to follow our vision,” Şahin says.</p>

<p>Many celebrities have turned their personal interests into thriving commercial concerns: Ryan Reynolds owns Aviation Gin, Jessica Alba founded nontoxic goods startup The Honest Company, and George Clooney will earn as much as $1 billion for selling his tequila company.</p>
<p>This year, actor Seth Rogen co-founded Houseplant, which sells pottery, cannabis and related accessories.</p>
<p>“We’ve sold house goods in all 50 states at this point,” Rogen explained. “That’s us, developing a relationship and trust with customers in places where weed is not legal yet.”</p>
<p>In a conversation with Managing Editor Matt Burns, Rogen, CEO Mike Mohr and chief commercial officer Haneen Davies discussed some of the challenges of brand-building within the confines of a strict regulatory environment.</p>
<p>“I think the merger of house and plant is what’s going to help us establish a brand name that goes beyond the limiting restrictions you have to abide by to communicate cannabis,” Davies says.</p>

<p>No one roots for a global pandemic, but WarnerMedia launched HBO Max just as cities and states across the U.S. restricted in-person gatherings as COVID-19 spread.</p>
<p>In many ways, the service seemed well-positioned, even in a crowded sector. HBO Max brought decades of critically acclaimed series, coupled with pricey acquisitions like the “Friends” and “South Park” back catalogs.</p>
<p>COO Andy Forssell joined TechCrunch Disrupt to discuss the fascinating 17.5 months of the service’s life so far:</p>
<p>“The early impacts were all negative, though, I think we, along with everyone in the industry, learned to roll with them,” he says. “Everybody had to work from home. That was tough, though I think we made the transition better than everyone thought. We were at launch mode at that point.”</p>

<p>Most people know Ryan Reynolds from his movies, but he also owns a majority stake in Mint Mobile, a mobile virtual network operator, which has grown more than 50,000% in the past three years. And he also invested in Aviation Gin before selling it for a staggering $600 million last year.</p>
<p>He’s also a founder of Maximum Effort, the marketing firm that promotes the “Deadpool” franchise, Aviation Gin, Mint Mobile, and that viral Match.com ad featuring Satan and the year 2020 as a match made in hell.</p>
<p>He spoke to Jordan Crook about how startups can adapt his concept of “fast-vertising” to use real-time cultural moments as a springboard for building their own brand buzz, among other things.</p>
<p>“When we lead with creative and we have an idea or are inspired by something, we get quite aggressive with our excitement and try to make something infectious around it,” Reynolds says.</p>

<p>Since first announcing it was planting a stake in the ground in the region in early 2019, SoftBank has plugged more than $5 billion into Latin America and expects that number to top $8 billion by year’s end.</p>
<p>Its capital contributions are meaningful. In 2019, startups across Latin America raised $5.3 billion in funding, according to CB Insights. In 2020, they raised roughly the same amount.</p>
<p>This year, the pace of dealmaking has shifted into overdrive, with $9.3 billion being invested in Latin American startups in the first six months of the year. SoftBank Group CEO Marcelo Claure believes that by 2023, close to $30 billion will be invested in the region annually.</p>
<p>“Finally, the world has realized that Latin America has size,” Claure, a native of Bolivia, said this week at TechCrunch Disrupt.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim have spent a lot of time unpacking this year’s staggering venture capital numbers, but they ended the week with a look at the value of startups eschewing VC.</p>
<p>“After all, not all successful startups are in a good position to IPO, and we are facing an IPO traffic jam that even SPACs are failing to solve,” they write.</p>
<p>“But funded unicorns can’t escape it: They need to provide liquidity to their investors, and it’s too late for them to pursue a different route. Their bootstrapped counterparts, in contrast, have options.”</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyanka-srinivas-tlgc/">Priyanka Srinivas</a> is the co-founder and CEO of<a href="https://www.thelivegreenco.com/"> Live Green Co</a>, a Chilean food tech startup that uses artificial intelligence to suggest plant-based alternatives for meat and artificial additives in food. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to gender equality in the business world, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1191968-but-knowing-that-things-could-be-worse-should-not-stop">hit the nail on the head</a>: “Knowing that things could be worse should not stop us from trying to make them better.”</p>
<p>While access to opportunities, funding and support has improved for women in the startup space over the last couple of decades, there is still a long way to go. In fact, women early-stage entrepreneurs receive an average of<a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet"> $1 million</a> less in funding than men do, despite performing better on average. Leaders across the board openly advocate for female-founded businesses receiving more venture capital and entrepreneurship support, but few are taking decisive actions to close this glaring gender gap.</p>
<p>The problem lies not in the fact that women don’t want to build million-dollar businesses, but in the disconnect between our dreams and the industry support we receive — or lack thereof. As the world embraces a new way of working and strategizes for a post-pandemic world, it’s vital to investigate new ways of supporting women’s entrepreneurship. Here are the key questions that we need to ask — and how we can go about resolving them.</p>
<h2>What are the systemic difficulties that women face today?</h2>
<p>Few business leaders will openly state that they have little interest in a more gender-equal world. However, the gap between intention and outcome illustrates that nowhere near enough decisive action has been taken to make this the case.</p>
<p>Women founders face obstacles across the board. Even in my industry of environmentally and socially conscious brands, women leaders are worse off than their male counterparts: <a href="https://veganwomensummit.com/founder-survey">This 2020 Vegan Women Summit founder survey</a> found that 45% of respondents have faced bias while fundraising and 75% say they have dealt with gender bias specifically. Women have historically been <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/male-and-female-entrepreneurs-get-asked-different-questions-by-vcs-and-it-affects-how-much-funding-they-get">asked different questions by VCs</a> than their male counterparts, and, as a result, are seen as less ambitious and less focused on potential gains.</p>
<p>Even before decision-makers have met women job applicants, their subconscious bias is already coming into play. In <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/03/research-to-reduce-gender-bias-anonymize-job-applications">this study</a>, acceptance rates of women candidates rose from 18% to 30% by obscuring the gender in the application.</p>
<p>Women working in technology often face assumptions and questions about their family life, marital status and children, which leaders and VCs may consider to be obstacles to their progress within a company or a limit to their potential as a founder.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Combating these inequities requires a concerted effort from VCs and company leaders to invite more women into decision-making positions.</p>
<p>One way to do this would be to apply for <a href="https://bcorporation.net/">B Corporation certification</a>, making it essential for the company to work toward reducing inequality in its workforce. Another would be to introduce diversity quotas for women in leadership positions — an approach that has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-29/california-diversity-law-shows-quotas-work?sref=VLsP8x9g">seen success</a> since its legal implementation in California.</p>
<h2>How can we better support women to grow their companies?</h2>
<p>Women are consistently losing out when it comes to accelerator backing and VC support. In Chile, where I founded my company, 77% of women entrepreneurs use their own savings as financing, while only <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6817977057054642176/">14%</a> have obtained co-financing from state or private programs.</p>
<p>In my experience, while many groups attempt to improve the inclusion and representation of women, the majority of them fail to move beyond conversation and superficial resolutions.</p>
<p>For example, a commonly cited solution for more women founders in tech is to encourage more women to study STEM subjects. This is a start, but it seems that the issue requires more than simply adding women to the funnel. Instead, we need to better understand what’s holding women back from growing their businesses to their full potential.</p>
<p>Women lose out time and time again when it comes to startup funding. We need to better support women through the entire startup lifecycle, from seed to IPO, especially when it comes to raising external capital.</p>
<p>One initiative that’s doing important work in this area is Start-Up Chile’s <a href="https://www.startupchile.org/attention-female-entrepreneurs-start-up-chile-is-opening-the-application-process-for-the-s-factory/">The S Factory</a>, a pre-acceleration program specifically for female entrepreneurs that provides selected startups with mentoring, pitch training and workshops, along with a cash injection of $15,000. These types of initiatives should be expanded from seed to provide support for Series A, B and C rounds through IPO.</p>
<p>Given that women often <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90277129/the-hidden-networking-gap-between-men-and-women">lack access</a> to the same networking and mentoring opportunities that men are privy to in the tech world, organizations like <a href="https://thenextwomen.com/">TheNextWomen</a>, a global network of women-founded companies and female investors, are essential. TheNextWomen helps female founders benefit from a community of like-minded entrepreneurs and investors through knowledge-driven programs and inspirational events. <a href="https://womentechfounders.com/">Women Tech Founders</a> also champions the value of female-only networks, aiming to connect, inspire and advance women in tech through events and online resources.</p>
<p>These communities can be fundamental for women entrepreneurs and other women tech leaders seeking to build a support system around them and gain the skills necessary to grow their businesses.</p>
<h2>How do we fix funding?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethedwards/2021/02/24/check-your-stats-the-lack-of-diversity-in-venture-capital-is-worse-than-it-looks/?sh=2a2411db185d">lack of diversity</a> at VC funds is stark and remains an overwhelmingly contributing factor to the disproportionately <a href="https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/Q1_2020_PitchBook_NVCA_Venture_Monitor.pdf">low amount of VC funding</a> that women receive — a number that is <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vc-funding-female-founders-drops-low">not improving</a>. In fact, in the U.S., only <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/jh572x5wd4r0/7qRourAWPj0U9R7MN5nWgy/711a6d8344bcd4fbe0f1a6dcf766a3c0/WVC_Report_-_The_Untapped_Potential_of_Women-Led_Funds.pdf">4.9%</a> of VC partners are female, and in Europe, the picture isn’t much better: <a href="https://www.diversity.vc/diversity-in-vc-report/">83%</a> of U.K. firms have no women on their investment committees. It’s no surprise then that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/34bdff48-f6cb-11e8-af46-2022a0b02a6c">93%</a> of tech investment in Europe goes to companies with no female founders.</p>
<p>To fix funding, we need investors with a gender-neutral lens, evidenced by metrics that measure their progress on diversity and inclusion. On average, startups founded or co-founded by women generate 10% more in cumulative revenue over five years — yet they receive <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet">less than half</a> the average investment of men. These statistics will be key in demonstrating that investing in women is not taking a risk — in fact, it’s quite the opposite.</p>
<p>What’s more, female-focused investors are emerging as a way to lift women-founded companies and level the playing field. For example, the Female Founders Fund <a href="https://www.inc.com/christine-lagorio-chafkin/female-founders-fund-anu-duggal-melinda-french-gates.html">recently closed its third fund valued at $57 million</a>, making it the biggest seed fund for women in the world.</p>
<p>In Asia, many investors are also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-12/wealthy-families-lead-charge-into-gender-lens-investing-in-asia?srnd=premium-asia">seeing the value in backing women-led companies</a> — and reaping the rewards. Over 90% of SoGal Ventures’ portfolio companies have female co-founders, and the fund has generated an internal rate of return of over 80% over the last four years. Initiatives like these can help level the playing field for women and provide them with the opportunities to fulfill their potential.</p>
<p>When it comes to fixing the gender divide in the startup world, there’s no silver bullet. Closing the gap requires a concerted effort from all sides of the industry, from founders to investors.</p>
<p>Only by leaving behind inclusivity lip service and taking decisive actions to bring women into funds and encourage them as founders will we start to achieve gender equity in the startup world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to online calendars and calendar apps, services like Google Calendar and Outlook from Microsoft rule the roost with hundreds of millions of users globally. Now another company is hoping to ruffle some feathers with its own move into the space. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Yahoo is working on <a href="https://day.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Day</a>, a new standalone calendar app.</p>
<p>The company brought on Jeremy Le Van &#8212; who co-founded another calendaring app, Sunrise, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/04/microsoft-sunrise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually sold it to Microsoft for over $100 million</a> to make it the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/13/microsoft-updates-outlook-for-ios-with-sunrise-inspired-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backbone</a> of Microsoft&#8217;s own very popular calendar platform in Outlook &#8212; to consult on designing it. Many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/31/sunrise-was-the-best-calendar-app-ever-and-now-i-feel-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lamented</a> the sunset of Sunrise; now it looks like they might have a shot at getting Sunrise 2.0, so to speak &#8212; although to be clear, Le Van was not working at Yahoo full time, but acting as a consultant, and he is no longer on the project.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: Yahoo is owned by the same company as TechCrunch.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We are exploring different ways to better serve consumers and that includes new ideas around mobile-first time management, calendar and events,&#8221; a Yahoo spokesperson said in response to our question.</p>
<p>The service is currently in an invite-only closed alpha as it gears up for a bigger launch (you can also sign up on the site).</p>
<p>Calendars serve as the backbone for how many of us organize our days, whether it&#8217;s for work or leisure. And arguably, the more our activities, and the planning of them, move to digital platforms, the more powerful calendars can become, too.</p>
<p>This means that for platforms, having a calendar feature or app as part of a bigger service is a good way of keeping users engaged on the wider platform, and it&#8217;s a way for the platform to glean more knowledge about user behavior. Google&#8217;s Calendar, for example, is very tightly, and often automatically, integrated with its wider suite of productivity and information services, giving the company one more spoke in its wheel to keep users sticking around.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And it&#8217;s not only Yahoo that might be interested in doing more here. Facebook <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/7/26/17615946/facebook-acquisition-redkix-workplace-email-messaging-subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired Redkix</a> in 2018 allegedly to bring more calendar and other productivity tools to Workplace. In the end, Workplace integrates with existing offerings from third parties, and so it doesn&#8217;t have its own standalone calendar app. Facebook also doesn&#8217;t have a standalone calendar feature in the main consumer app, either. But with people planning so much else on Facebook&#8217;s properties (not just through Events on Facebook, but across Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger), it seems that it&#8217;s an area it could feasibly still expand into at some point.</p>
<p>Yahoo itself, in fact, already has a pared-down <a href="https://calendar.yahoo.com/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9sb2dpbi55YWhvby5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHE7T5C_0tisZ4OSdCAyCAuBBAuyLNRCM8lQlhSuyRFcsFDxqxcIdIWMTwepdDz9_A_FfWV8L7gkyCPeRrY8RygnEcR2I_eTprXTijTRGkPLlNmrw1TZX-KFjSki8vL8DJb8FsAChWqmDOU9Zx0h6sfYQwcawPwSGpEXMdmFmTzR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calendar widget</a> that you can access through Yahoo Mail. It&#8217;s not clear how popular it is, especially since it&#8217;s very easy these days to integrate one&#8217;s email to most other calendar apps.</p>
<p>The question, then, will be how Day might hope to differentiate itself, and how it will hope to compete.</p>
<p>From what we understand, in contrast to how Google, Microsoft or even Yahoo itself currently integrate calendar features into their wider productivity suites, this isn&#8217;t the approach that Yahoo is taking with Day.</p>
<p>The app is being built by people in its Mail team, but it&#8217;s being treated &#8220;like a startup&#8221; in the operation, we&#8217;ve heard, and has been given license to develop it independently: it has no special Yahoo branding, nor with any Yahoo integrations whatsoever. The plan is to keep it separate, not unlike the many calendar apps &#8212; like Sunrise once was &#8212; that exist in app stores, and make it something that can integrate with whatever other email or other tools that a person users. Over time there also may be efforts to use Mail &#8212; which still has around 200 million users &#8212; to help market Day.</p>
<p>The move underscores how Yahoo &#8212; which has effectively lost out to Google in areas like search, email, video and advertising &#8212; believes that with the right approach, there is still room for more innovation in this crowded market, even as it has a number of misses in its history of trying to do just that in other areas, <a href="https://www.uctoday.com/collaboration/rip-yahoo-together-chat-tool-gone-for-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like messaging</a>.</p>
<p>But as we noted in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/how-calendly-is-building-a-platform-by-turning-scheduling-into-a-center-stage-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent story about Calendly</a> &#8212; a $3 billion startup that&#8217;s proven to be a big hit with people who need to schedule meetings &#8212; calendar apps can be challenging for another reason. They are well-used, yes, but also somewhat under the radar: calendars are never the destination for a person, just a place to mark when, how and with whom you will get there. Can there be more ways of enhancing that basic functionality?</p>
<p>Yahoo seems to believe there are, and that people will want to use an app that does so.</p>
<p><em>Updated and corrected to clarify that Le Van is not working at Yahoo but came on as a consultant on the app and is no longer involved.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year has been one of the busiest yet in terms of new commercial launch companies coming online, with companies like Astra and Firefly Aerospace actually getting rockets up and running (if not flying as designed quite yet), and with landmark human spaceflight missions from Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic and SpaceX. And with more constellations in operation, built out of satellites equipped with sensors capable of providing new and more detailed data for commercial use back on Earth, the timing is right for startups everywhere to leverage a new data Gold Rush to build businesses based on in-space resources that just weren’t available before.</p>
<p>Joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?display=true">TC Sessions: Space</a> happening December 14-15 is <strong>Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners</strong>, who focuses largely on frontier technology and specifically on the commercialization of space, drones, autonomous vehicles and the future of agriculture and food technology.</p>
<p>Hatch brings a lot of expertise to the table. She studied aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan before earning her Master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics engineering from Stanford. She then continued on to Boeing, then SpaceX, where she worked with the government on integrating its payloads with the Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to hear from her at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?display=true">TC Sessions: Space</a>. Grab your tickets to join us and save $100!</p>
