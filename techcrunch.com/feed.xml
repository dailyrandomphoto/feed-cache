					<description><![CDATA[Cribl is developing unified data pipelines, called “observability pipelines,” to parse and route any type of data that flows through a corporate IT system.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At a time when remote work, cybersecurity attacks and increased privacy and compliance requirements threaten a company’s data, more companies are collecting and storing their observability data, but are being locked in with vendors or have difficulty accessing the data.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://cribl.io/">Cribl</a>. The San Francisco-based company is developing an “open ecosystem of data” for enterprises that utilizes unified data pipelines, called “<a href="https://cribl.io/blog/the-observability-pipeline/">observability pipelines</a>,” to parse and route any type of data that flows through a corporate IT system. Users can then choose their own analytics tools and storage destinations like Splunk, Datadog and Exabeam, but without becoming dependent on a vendor.</p>
<p>The company announced Wednesday a $200 million round of Series C funding to value Cribl at $1.5 billion, according to a source close to the company. Greylock and Redpoint Ventures co-led the round and were joined by new investor IVP, existing investors Sequoia and CRV and strategic investment from Citi Ventures and CrowdStrike. The new capital infusion gives Cribl a total of $254 million in funding since the company was started in 2017, Cribl co-founder and CEO Clint Sharp told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pVV4CvsNaH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/splunk-acquires-network-observability-service-flowmill/">Splunk acquires network observability service Flowmill</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Splunk acquires network observability service Flowmill&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/splunk-acquires-network-observability-service-flowmill/embed/#?secret=pVV4CvsNaH" data-secret="pVV4CvsNaH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Sharp did not discuss the valuation; however, he believes that the round is “validation that the observability pipeline category is legit.” Data is growing at a compound annual growth rate of 25%, and organizations are collecting five times more data today than they did 10 years ago, he explained.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, they want to ask and answer questions, especially for IT and security people,” Sharp added. “When Zoom sends data on who started a phone call, that might be data I need to know so I know who is on the call from a security perspective and who they are communicating with. Also, who is sending files to whom and what machines are communicating together in case there is a malicious actor. We can also find out who is having a bad experience with the system and what resources they can access to try and troubleshoot the problem.”</p>
<p>Cribl also enables users to choose how they want to store their data, which is different from competitors that often lock companies into using only their products. Instead, customers can buy the best products from different categories and they will all talk to each other through Cribl, Sharp said.</p>
<p>Though Cribl is developing a pipeline for data, Sharp sees it more as an “observability lake,” as more companies have differing data storage needs. He explains that the lake is where all of the data will go that doesn’t need to go into an existing storage solution. The pipelines will send the data to specific tools and then collect the data, and what doesn’t fit will go back into the lake so companies have it to go back to later. Companies can keep the data for longer and more cost effectively.</p>
<p>Cribl said it is seven times more efficient at processing event data and boasts a customer list that includes Whole Foods, Vodafone, FINRA, Fannie Mae and Cox Automotive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sharp went after additional funding after seeing huge traction in its existing customer base, saying that “when you see that kind of traction, you want to keep doubling down.” His aim is to have a presence in every North American city and in Europe, to continue launching new products and growing the engineering team.</p>
<p>Up next, the company is focusing on go-to-market and engineering growth. Its headcount is 150 currently, and Sharp expects to grow that to 250 by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Over the last fiscal year, Cribl grew its revenue 293%, and Sharp expects that same trajectory for this year. The company is now at a growth stage, and with the new investment, he believes Cribl is the “future leader in observability.”</p>
<p>“This is a great investment for us, and every dollar, we believe, is going to create an outsized return as we are the only commercial company in this space,” he added.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DzSx621L0x"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/its-time-for-security-teams-to-embrace-security-data-lakes/">It’s time for security teams to embrace security data lakes</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;It’s time for security teams to embrace security data lakes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/its-time-for-security-teams-to-embrace-security-data-lakes/embed/#?secret=DzSx621L0x" data-secret="DzSx621L0x" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Scott Raney, managing director at Redpoint Ventures, said his firm is a big enterprise investor in software, particularly in companies that help organizations leverage data to protect themselves, a sweet spot that Cribl falls into.</p>
<p>He feels Sharp is leading a team, having come from Splunk, that has accomplished a lot, has a vision and a handle on the business and knows the market well. Where Splunk is capturing the machine data and using its systems to extract the data, Cribl is doing something similar in directing the data where it needs to go, while also enabling companies to utilize multiple vendors and build apps to sit on top of its infrastructure.</p>
<p>“Cribl is adding opportunity by enriching the data flowing through, and the benefits are going to be meaningful in cost reduction,” Raney said. “The attitude out there is to put data in cheaper places, and afford more flexibility to extract data. Step one is to make that transition, and step two is how to drive the data sitting there. Cribl is doing something that will go from being a big business to a legacy company 30 years from now.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://bodo.ai">Bodo.ai</a>, a parallel compute platform for data workloads, is developing a compiler to make Python portable and efficient across multiple hardware platforms. It announced Wednesday a $14 million Series A funding round led by Dell Technologies Capital.</p>
<p>Python is one of the top programming languages used among artificial intelligence and machine learning developers and data scientists, but as Behzad Nasre, co-founder and CEO of Bodo.ai, points out, it is challenging to use when handling large-scale data.</p>
<p>Bodo.ai, headquartered in San Francisco, was founded in 2019 by Nasre and Ehsan Totoni, CTO, to make Python higher performing and production ready. Nasre, who had a long career at Intel before starting Bodo, met Totoni and learned about the project that he was working on to democratize machine learning and enable parallel learning for everyone. Parallelization is the only way to extend <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-moores-law.html">Moore’s Law</a>, Nasre told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EGEJc406DU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/sentry-launches-new-performance-monitoring-software-for-python-and-javascript/">Sentry launches new performance monitoring software for Python and JavaScript</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sentry launches new performance monitoring software for Python and JavaScript&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/sentry-launches-new-performance-monitoring-software-for-python-and-javascript/embed/#?secret=EGEJc406DU" data-secret="EGEJc406DU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Bodo does this via a compiler technology that automates the parallelization so that data and ML developers don’t have to use new libraries, APIs or rewrite Python into other programming languages or graphics processing unit code to achieve scalability. Its technology is being used to make data analytics tools in real time and is being used across industries like financial, telecommunications, retail and manufacturing.</p>
<p>“For the AI revolution to happen, developers have to be able to write code in simple Python, and that high-performance capability will open new doors,” Totoni said. “Right now, they rely on specialists to rewrite them, and that is not efficient.”</p>
<p>Joining Dell in the round were Uncorrelated Ventures, Fusion Fund and Candou Ventures. Including the new funding, Bodo has raised $14 million in total. The company went after Series A dollars after its product had matured and there was good traction with customers, prompting Bodo to want to scale quicker, Nasre said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nasre feels Dell Technologies Capital was “uniquely positioned to help us in terms of reserves and the role they play in the enterprise at large, which is to have the most effective salesforce in enterprise.”</p>
<p>Though he was already familiar with Nasre, Daniel Docter, managing director at Dell Technologies, heard about Bodo from a data scientist friend who told Docter that Bodo’s preliminary results “were amazing.”</p>
<p>Much of Dell’s investments are in the early-stage and in deep tech founders that understand the problem. Docter puts Totoni and Nasre in that category.</p>
<p>“Ehsan fits this perfectly, he has super deep technology knowledge and went out specifically to solve the problem,” he added. “Behzad, being from Intel, saw and lived with the problem, especially seeing Hadoop fail and Spark take its place.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with the new funding, Nasre intends to triple the size of the team and invest in R&amp;D to build and scale the company. It will also be developing a marketing and sales team.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Now may be the best time to become a full-stack developer&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/now-may-be-the-best-time-to-become-a-full-stack-developer/embed/#?secret=IE9Lk1iQFG" data-secret="IE9Lk1iQFG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company is now shifting from financing to customer- and revenue-focused as it aims to drive up adoption by the Python community.</p>
<p>“Our technology can translate simple code into the fast code that the experts will try,” Totoni said. “I joined Intel Labs to work on the problem, and we think we have the first solution that will democratize machine learning for developers and data scientists. Now, they have to hand over Python code to specialists who rewrite it for tools. Bodo is a new type of compiler technology that democratizes AI.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fitness band market share is undoubtedly contracting, thanks in no small part to the massive popularity of smartwatches. But 13.1 million overall shipments in Q1 2021 is nothing to sneeze at. People are still buying non-watch fitness trackers, due to their lower price and non-invasiveness.</p>
<p>Announced this morning via the Google Keyword blog, the latest version of Fitbit’s Charge line looks to further blur the line line between the categories. The latest version of the premium fitness band adds a color touchscreen, along with ECG (heart) and EDA (stress) sensors.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="givDuDL9CY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/fitbit-adds-gps-and-spotify-control-for-the-the-charge-4/">Fitbit adds GPS and Spotify control for the Charge 4</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fitbit adds GPS and Spotify control for the Charge 4&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/fitbit-adds-gps-and-spotify-control-for-the-the-charge-4/embed/#?secret=givDuDL9CY" data-secret="givDuDL9CY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Naturally those sorts of smartwatch-level features also come with a $30 price increase, up to $180 &#8212; putting it at the same price point as 2019’s Versa 2 and $50 less than the Versa 3. Like I said, the lines have blurred. Fitbit also offers a number of cheaper trackers, including the $100 Inspire 2, though the company is well aware that it can’t really compete on the super low end of the market.</p>
<p>The addition of ECG monitoring brings a feature to the band that has largely been the realm of pricier smartwatches. It’s been popular with both users and doctors, who often recommend it for day to day monitoring of conditions like a-fib. That’s in addition to heart rate monitoring, which can be used around the clock, courtesy of a battery that’s rated at a full week (though the always-on option for the full-color AMOLED touchscreen will undoubtedly eat into that).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193483" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193483" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2193483" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193483" class="wp-caption-text">Still photography of Fitbit Charge 5. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fitbit</p></div></p>
<p>EDA monitoring, which Fitbit first offered on the Sense last fall, is designed to detect a wearer’s stress levels by way of their finger sweat glands. That’s coupled with a “Stress Management Score” available through the Fitbit app, “so you can see each morning if you’re mentally ready to take on more challenges, or if you need to recharge.” The idea of viewing my own stress numbers over the past year is likely enough to drive them up even higher.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of that feeds into the larger Health Metrics dashboard, which the company is setting up as a kind of one-stop shop that also includes sleep and standard fitness. The Charge also offers integration with third-party mindfulness apps like Ten Percent Happier and Calm, the latter of which is a part of a new partnership that brings the wildly popular meditation app’s content to Fitbit Premium members.</p>
<p>Premium also gets a new feature called Daily Readiness Score, which Fitbit describes thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coming soon to Premium is our new Daily Readiness Score, which will use insights from your body via your Fitbit device, including your activity, heart rate variability (HRV) and recent sleep, to help you assess when you’re ready to push yourself physically — in other words, if you should workout or prioritize recovery. By wearing your Fitbit device daily (including while you sleep), you’ll receive a personalized score each morning along with details on what impacted it, with suggestions like a recommended activity level and Premium content to help you make the best decisions for your body and make your workouts more efficient.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, and here’s a picture of Fitbit’s new brand ambassador, for good measure. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/the-future-of-action-cinema-with-ang-lee-and-will-smith/">Looks familiar:</a></p>

<p>The Charge 5 is the first major release since Fitbit officially became a part of Google. We haven’t seen a lot of major changes yet (though CEO James Park is now officially “VP, GM &amp; Co-founder,” per his billing). Expect to see something more significant on that front when the company unveils its next smartwatch.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Forward Kitchens provides a turnkey tool for restaurants to set up an online presence.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.forwardkitchens.com/">Forward Kitchens</a> was working quietly on its digital storefront for restaurants and is now announcing a $2.5 million seed round.</p>
<p>Raghav Poddar started the company two years ago and was part of the Y Combinator Summer 2019 cohort. Poddar told TechCrunch he has been a foodie his entire life. Lately, he was relying on food delivery and pickup services, and while visiting with some of the restaurant owners, he realized a few things: first, not many had a good online presence, and second, these restaurants had the ability to cook cuisine representative of their communities.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BCTKKrEy91"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/">10 proptech investors see better era for residential and retail after pandemic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 proptech investors see better era for residential and retail after pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/embed/#?secret=BCTKKrEy91" data-secret="BCTKKrEy91" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That led to the idea of Forward Kitchens, which provides a turnkey tool for restaurants to set up an online presence, including food delivery, where they can create multiple digital storefronts easily and without having to contact each delivery platform. The company ran pilot programs in a handful of restaurants, and this is the first year coming out of stealth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It’s an expansion of what they have on the menu, but is not immediately available in the neighborhood,” Poddar added. “Kitchens can keep the costs and headcount the same, but be able to service the demand and get more orders because it is fulfilling a need for the neighborhood, which is why we can grow so fast.”</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: Forward Kitchens goes into a restaurant and takes into account its capacity for additional cooking and the demographic area, as well as what food is available near it, and helps the restaurant create the storefront.</p>
<p>Each restaurant is able to build multiple storefronts, for example, an Italian restaurant setting up a storefront just to sell its popular mac n’ cheese or other small plates on demand. A couple hundred digital storefronts were already created, Poddar said.</p>
<p>A group of investors, including Y Combinator, Floodgate, Slow Ventures and SV Angel and angel investors Michael Seibel of YC, Ram Shriram and Thumbtack’s Jonathan Swanson, were involved in the round.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to expand the company’s footprint and reach, and to hire a team in operations, sales and engineering to help support the product.</p>
<p>“Forward Kitchens is empowering independent kitchens to create digital storefronts and receive more online sales,” Seibel said via email. “With Forward Kitchens, a kitchen can create world-class digital storefronts at the click of a button.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.knoetic.com">Knoetic</a>, a startup that has built a software analytics platform for chief people officers, emerged from stealth today with $18 million in Series A funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the unacquainted, chief people officers are also known as heads of human resources, or HR.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel led the financing, which notably also included participation from over 100 angel investors, including a number of executives, VCs and former and current chief people officers (CPOs) of companies such as Mozilla, Pinterest, Gusto, Box, Twilio, Fitbit, Kickstarter, Looker, Hired and GitHub.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For founder and CEO Joseph Quan, the fact that so many people who worked in the industry put money in the round as angels was huge validation that Knoetic is on the right track.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in March 2020, the New York City-based startup has built a platform that combines a social network and a SaaS analytics tool for chief people officers. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit last year, human resources leaders found themselves in a position they’d never before been &#8212; hiring talent remotely and having to work virtually to retain workers that previously came to an office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quan himself </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has worked in a variety of roles in the HR technology space, including at <a href="https://www.twinelabs.com/">Twine</a>, Knoetic’s predecessor company. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193668" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193668" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2193668 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joseph-Quan-Headshot-Copy.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joseph-Quan-Headshot-Copy.jpg 1297w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joseph-Quan-Headshot-Copy.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joseph-Quan-Headshot-Copy.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joseph-Quan-Headshot-Copy.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joseph-Quan-Headshot-Copy.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joseph-Quan-Headshot-Copy.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joseph-Quan-Headshot-Copy.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joseph-Quan-Headshot-Copy.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joseph-Quan-Headshot-Copy.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joseph-Quan-Headshot-Copy.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193668" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Knoetic; Founder and CEO Joseph Quan</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason we exist was really born out of the pandemic. We noticed in our ecosystem of chief people officers that their role was thrust into the spotlight and it was a really tough time for them, and also a really lonely time,” Quan told TechCrunch. “Everyone was kind of scrambling for answers and we just realized this was a time to actually put together a network that allows all these people to commiserate and tackle some of their hardest questions, and then from that, form the basis for a broader vision.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 1,000 HR professionals are members of Knoetic’s social community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which the company has embedded directly into its </span><a href="https://www.knoetic.com/analytics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">people analytics software</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The result, Quan said, is an “Insight Engine” designed to give CPOs both quantitative and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">qualitative insights with the goal of helping them make “smarter, holistic” decisions about their workforce. The network is a referral-only community aimed at giving HR professionals a forum to discuss best practices and their “most pressing challenges,” such as how to navigate the COVID Delta variant and transition to and from remote work, Quan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chief people officers can also use Knoetic to do things like build board decks and present data to their CEOs. The company also claims the platform can help CPOs improve employee retention, compensation and hiring. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a short amount of time, Knoetic has built an impressive customer and community base, including the likes of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lyft, Squarespace, Amplitude, Discord, Dollar Shave Club and Zapier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vas Natarajan of Accel believes that Knoetic </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is solving “a deep pain point.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see how overstretched people teams are trying to wrangle information to make organizational decisions,” he wrote via email. “Across our best companies is a strong people function backed by great data to help inform all kinds of decisions around compensation, performance, and diversity and inclusion, among other things. Knoetic is uniformly solving this for everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup will use its new capital toward building out new products and hiring. It currently has about 25 employees, and Quan expects that number to grow to “north of 40” by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to build the single greatest network for HR professionals and build a dedicated community team,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Down the line, Quan also envisions creating an analytics engine that is “prescriptive and predictive” and can do things like tell HR leaders what kind of turnover their companies are seeing, what they can do about it and how to improve retention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And then it would be predictive as we gather more big data points as more people use the platform,” he added. “Then we could use that data to proactively predict who’s going to be a fast-rising company or who’s going to trip over the next 12 months. We’re starting to build those kinds of models on the back end.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meditation app Headspace this morning <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210825005262/en/Ginger-and-Headspace-Will-Merge-to-Meet-Escalating-Global-Demand-for-Mental-Health-Support">announced plans to merge</a> with on-demand mental health service, Ginger. Barring unforeseen regulatory roadblocks, the two companies will combine to form Headspace Health. The new organization would sport a combined value of $3 billion and a headcount of more than 800+.</p>
<p>The merger comes during accelerated usage of both parties, as a seemingly endless pandemic has put a strain on mental health across the globe and many have turned to virtual solutions to address the growing problem.</p>
<p>“We are witnessing a mental health crisis unlike anything we’ve experienced in our lifetimes, yet the majority of mental healthcare today is neither broadly accessible nor affordable,” Headspace CEO CeCe Morken said in a statement. “Together, as Headspace Health, we will address the systemic challenges of access and affordability in a fundamentally different way by creating the world’s most holistic, scalable, and effective mental health and wellbeing company.”</p>
<p>Morken will become the President of Headspace Health, while current CEO Russell Glass will serve as the new company’s CEO.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193743" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193743" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2193743" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="537" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg 2401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg?resize=1536,805 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg?resize=2048,1074 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HS-Ginger-Announcement-PressRelease@2x.jpeg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193743" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p>
<p>“Headspace and Ginger have a shared recognition that the mental health crisis can’t be solved by simply hiring more therapists or moving care online,” Glass said. “Through this merger, we can uniquely tackle the full spectrum of mental health needs &#8212; from prevention to clinical care &#8212; all from one integrated platform.”</p>
<p>Ginger announced a $50 million Series D roughly one year ago and a $100 million Series E this March, bringing its total funding north of $220 million. Headpace, meanwhile, has raised $216 million, courtesy of last year’s $100.7 million Series C. Headspace is one of the top global meditation apps, along with chief competitor, Calm. The new company would find it pushing well beyond its current mindfulness focus to, &#8220;provide the full spectrum of proven, effective virtual support &#8211; from mindfulness and meditation, to text-based behavioral health coaching, to video-based therapy and psychiatry &#8211; for all types of patient populations.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just as importantly, the combined company would push beyond a direct to consumer model, including a corporate and Medicaid plan focus.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Further details of the deal have not been disclosed. The deal is expected to close in Q4.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Los Angeles delivery robot startup Coco this week has announced $36 million in funding. The Series A was led by Sam Altman, Silicon Valley Bank and Founders Fund, with participation from Sam Nazarian, Ellen Chen and Mario Del Pero. It brings the company&#8217;s total funding up to around $43 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;I strongly believe the delivery service industry in its current state is massively under-serving merchants. We have an enormous opportunity to create a better experience for hundreds of thousands of merchants and their customers, today,&#8221; co0founder and CEO Zach Rash said in a release. &#8220;This is not a research program experimenting with technology to be productized at some unknown point in the future.”</p>

<p>The UCLA spinout, formerly known as Cyan Robotics, is operating in a crowded field that includes names like Starship, Nuro and UC Berkeley alum Kiwibot. Rather than pushing for full autonomy, Coco’s solution utilizes remote drivers (which are a more popular solution than many companies care to admit).</p>
<p>Coco is still young, having launched in February 2020. The company currently has a headcount of 120, with plans to &#8220;grow to over 1,000&#8221; by end of year, as the pandemic continues to fuel additional interest in robotic deliveries. The new funding will also go toward hardware and additional city launches.</p>
<p>Coco says it has been able to operate with a 97% on-time rate, while reducing delivery times for its clients by around 30%. The company lacks a massive partner like Nuro’s work with Domino&#8217;s, though California-based Umami Burger is probably the largest on a list of 18 restaurant partners currently listed on Coco’s site.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are currently operating in Santa Monica and in five different L.A neighborhoods,&#8221; the company tells TechCrunch.  &#8220;Later this year we are expanding into a number of other major U.S. cities. We have partnered with national restaurant brands like SBE (Umami Burger) and are actively scaling across many locations, and we are serving a wide range of family operated restaurants like Bangkok West Thai in Santa Monica and San Pedro Brewing Company in Los Angeles. We are out of the pilot phase and are launching with dozens of new merchants every day.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture capital firm <a href="https://myelin.vc/">Myelin</a> on Wednesday launched its second fund, Myelin II, that will invest in some 40 early-stage technology companies in North America, Europe and Latin America.</p>
<p>The firm was started in 2020 by serial entrepreneurs Matías Nisenson, Martin Varsavsky and Alec Oxenford, who lead the firm remotely from Argentina, New York and Spain. They are joined by Cesar Levene, an international tax and law expert.</p>
<p>Nisenson previously founded and sold two startups, Tiempy, a social media tool, and Experimental, a blockchain-based online gaming company, while Varsavsky has founded eight companies, and currently is founder of Goggo Network, developer of autonomous mobility networks.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why global investors are flocking to back Latin American startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/embed/#?secret=qBPiz9IXuw" data-secret="qBPiz9IXuw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“As an entrepreneur, I build ‘unicorns,’ and now I’m searching for them with Myelin,” said Varsavsky in a written statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Oxenford is founder and former CEO of letgo, an online secondhand marketplace. He told TechCrunch that Nisenson and Varsavsky were good friends that were successful and smart, so it made sense to join them in the firm. Though he has made over 100 investments, he is also a founder and said he wanted to help other entrepreneurs not make the same mistakes he did.</p>
<p>The firm aims to raise between $25 million and $50 million for the second fund, Oxenford said. The fund is industry agnostic, but they are attracted to seed and Series A startups in biotech, fintech, proptech, femtech and food tech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It also partners with large portfolios and networks for leads. An average check size for the firm is $250,000 to $500,000 for a first check, and $1 million to $3 million for follow-on funding.</p>
<p>However, Oxenford sees check sizes increasing as valuations, especially in Latin America, are rising and more capital is flowing. This also makes it more difficult to identify the companies with substance.</p>
<p>“Having been founders — all three of us — we can understand a bit better than others whether there is substance, and the projects have true potential,” he added. “We look for unicorn potential, some revenue, a serial entrepreneur and a good culture that is data-driven. We are taking a special approach that is founders helping founders in various stages of their careers.”</p>
<p>The new fund follows Myelin I, which invested several millions into 23 startups, including CookUnity and Buenbit. Nisenson says the first fund was “mostly proof-of-concept,” and was his first time as a fund manager, though Varsavsky had worked on other funds. They decided to have a very small fund and co-invest with larger funds.</p>
<p>“We found that nano funds can outperform big funds because you can invest in every deal,” Nisenson added. “The big funds don’t care because you are not competing with them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Apple and Google continue to face increasing scrutiny over the rules they set for how third-party apps in their app stores charge for services, a significant development in that story is going down in South Korea.</p>
<p>South Korea’s parliamentary committee passed on Wednesday (25 August) a landmark bill to prevent Google and Apple from charging software developers’ commissions on in-app purchases, the first of its kind in the world. The final vote by all members of the National Assembly &#8211; required to pass and activate the proposal &#8211; which was expected to be held in a plenary session on the same day, was delayed until further notice.</p>
<p>The plenary session was tentatively delayed to 30 August, according to a media.</p>
<p>South Korea will be the first country to prohibit such global tech giants from imposing billing systems on in-app purchases if voted into law.</p>
<p>The bill, dubbed the “Anti-Google Law”, was approved by the legislation and judiciary committee of the National Assembly to revise the Telecommunication Business Act, seeking to restrict Google and Apple from requiring app developers to use their billing system.</p>
<p>Google said in September 2020 it would impose its billing system on all app developers, collecting up to 30 percent commission for all in-app purchases.</p>
<p>In July 2021, Google decided to defer its new billing policy to the end of March 2022 upon request by app developers and lowered its play store commission to 15 percent, <a href="https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?sc=30800028&amp;year=2021&amp;no=249500&amp;_ga=2.17139193.1386304125.1629894068-2059292691.1629894068">based on local media reports</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple said in its statement, “The proposed Telecommunications Business Act will put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases, and features like &#8216;Ask to Buy&#8217; and Parental Controls will become less effective. We believe user trust in App Store purchases will decrease as a result of this proposal—leading to fewer opportunities for the over 482,000 registered developers in Korea who have earned more than KRW8.55 trillion to date with Apple.”</p>
<p>Apple and Google of course argue that there are bigger issues around better and safer user experience that come with mandating their own in-app payment systems. And this is the argument that it falls on here too.</p>
<p>Google did not immediately respond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Xiaomi reported a second-quarter net income of $1.28 billion on revenue of $13.56 billion following the Chinese technology giant&#8217;s strong surge in smartphone market share globally.</p>
<p>During the quarter that ended in June, Xiaomi said it saw a 64% year-on-year growth in revenue, and its net income surged over 80% from the same time a year ago.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-listed firm said its smartphone revenue grew to $9.1 billion, thanks to a just as impressive jump in its smartphone shipment to 52.9 million units in the quarter, in which it topped Apple to become <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/xiaomi-global-shipments-push-past-apple-for-no-2-spot/">the world’s second-largest smartphone vendor</a>, according to market intelligence firm Canalys.</p>
<p>The U.S. government’s sanctions against Huawei, Xiaomi’s chief domestic rival, has helped the younger firm &#8212; along with some other manufacturers &#8212; gain market share domestically as well as globally.</p>
<p>Xiaomi’s revenue from Internet of Things and lifestyle products category also saw a 36% jump in revenue to $3.2 billion.</p>
<p>Shortly after reporting its earnings results, the company said it will buy the four-year-old autonomous driving technology startup Deepmotion for about $77.3 million. The investment follows Xiaomi’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/xiaomi-ev-subsidiary/">bold plan to invest $10 billion over the next decade</a> in the electric vehicles space.</p>
<p>Xiaomi is the latest Chinese tech company to enter the EV industry. Chinese search engine giant Baidu earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/baidu-electric-car-making/">announced</a> that it would be making EVs with the help of automaker Geely. In November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/alibaba-saic-ev-brand/">Alibaba and Chinese state-owned carmaker SAIC Motor</a> said they had joined hands to produce electric cars. Ride-share leader Didi and EV maker BYD are also co-designing a model for ride-hailing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As my colleague Rita Liao reported earlier:</p>
<blockquote><p>The internet behemoths are competing with a raft of more specialized EV startups such as Xpeng, Nio and Li Auto, which have already debuted multiple models and are often compared to Tesla. They strive to differentiate from each other by investing in functions from in-car entertainment to autonomous driving.</p>
<p>For Xiaomi, the obvious advantage in making cars is its vast retail network and international brand recognition. Some of its smart devices, such as smart speakers and air purifiers, could be easily incorporated into its vehicles as selling points. The real challenge, of course, is in manufacturing. Compared to phone making, the automotive industry is more capital-intensive with a long and complex supply chain. We will see if Xiaomi will pull it off.</p></blockquote>
<p>Xiaomi said Wednesday its investment in Deepmotion will help the giant shorten the time to market for its products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BreachQuest, an early-stage startup with a founding team of cybersecurity experts building a modern <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/incident-response/">incident response</a> platform, has emerged from stealth with $4.4 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The investment was raised from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/slow-ventures/">Slow Ventures</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/lookout/">Lookout</a> founder Kevin Mahaffey, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/tinder/">Tinder</a> co-founders Sean Rad and Justin Mateen, who described BreachQuest as having a “disruptive vision and a world-class team.”</p>
<p>The latter is certainly true. BreachQuest is made up of former U.S. Cyber Command, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/nsa/">National Security Agency</a>, and Department of Defense employees that it sees as its biggest competitive advantage. The second is its Priori platform, which the Texas-based company believes will re-engineer the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/incident-response/">incident response</a> process and move incident preparedness into the future.</p>
<p>Currently, it takes most organizations thereabouts 280 days to detect a breach, the startup says, and the slow recovery process that typically follows means this largely manual process costs the average U.S. business just shy of $4 million. The startup&#8217;s Priori platform uses aims to improve on what the team sees as “unacceptable industry standards,” enabling organizations to detect intrusions and compromises far faster. That allows companies to near-instantly respond and contain the compromise, the startup says.</p>
<p>BreachQuest’s co-founder and CTO is Jake Williams, a former NSA hacker and founder of Rendition Infosec, an Augusta, Ga.-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> company that was acquired by BreachQuest. Williams told TechCrunch that while most other incident response firms are focused on preventing incidents, BreachQuest is focusing on preparing for the inevitable.</p>
<p>“It’s a reality that determined adversaries will get into your network regardless of what tools you put in place to keep them out,” he says. “That’s not [fear, uncertainty and doubt], it’s just a reality that if you’re targeted you’re going to be compromised. That’s what our mission is all about: preparation to facilitate response.”</p>
<p>BreachQuest, which will also assess the cybersecurity risks posed to an organization by potential <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mergers-and-acquisitions/">mergers and acquisitions</a>, believes it has little competition in the market right now because incident preparation is a tough market.</p>
<p>“We continuously see statistics about how IT managers think their security controls will prevent them from being breached, so selling incident response preparation tools and services to those organizations is a hard sell,” Williams said. “But given the landscape of ransomware and other cybersecurity threats being regular front-page news, we think the market is ready.”</p>
<p>BreachQuest will use its $4.4 million seed investment to accelerate the rollout and development of its Priori platform, with future plans to speed up its forensic evidence collection processes and improve response coordination across its disparate team members.</p>
<p>&#8220;Incident response is chaotic and it’s hard for people who infrequently work in these situations to address all the issues identified throughout the investigation,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;Fundamentally, the problem is a combination of the difficulties getting the right evidence in a timely manner and understanding the status of the response.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, MaxAB, the Egyptian B2B e-commerce platform that serves food and grocery retailers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/maxab-the-egyptian-b2b-food-and-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-40m-for-expansion/">raised one of the largest Series A on the continent</a>, to the tune of $40 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, it has raised a $15 million extension from existing investors &#8212; RMBV, IFC, Flourish Ventures, Crystal Stream Capital, Rise Capital, Endeavour Catalyst, Beco Capital and 4DX Ventures &#8212;  bringing its total Series A fundraise to $55 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, founded by</span><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/belal-el-megharbel-34718023"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Belal El-Megharbel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-ben-halim-46072511a"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohamed Ben Halim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018, manages procurement and grocery delivery to shops in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Store owners can use the platform to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> goods, request delivery or logistics to move the goods, and access a customer support team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When CEO El-Megharbel spoke to TechCrunch during its first Series A tranche, he said MaxAB, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">operates in Egypt alone, was looking to expand across the Middle East and North Africa besides launching new product offerings and growing its team</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s announcement marks MaxAB&#8217;s first step toward regional scale. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup is announcing the acquisition of Morocco-based B2B e-commerce and distribution platform WaystoCap for an undisclosed amount</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niama El Bassunie co-founded WaystoCap with Mehdi Daoui, Anis Abdeddine and Aziz Jaouhari Tissafi in 2015. The company was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">originally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a cross-border trade platform for transacting business goods in Africa. That business model got WaystoCap into Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter batch in 2017, making it the first company accepted from Morocco. The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/07/waystocap-raises-3m/"> raised a $3 million</a> seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WaystoCap took its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/07/waystocap-africa-cross-border/">cross-border services</a> to Ivory Coast and Togo, and at some point, was processing over $3 million worth of transactions per quarter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, since its pivot to a similar model to MaxAB, in that it connects retailers with suppliers across Morocco, WaystoCap has pulled out from both countries while growing to a network of over 8,000 retailers in Morocco</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El-Megharbel mentioned to TechCrunch that MaxAB&#8217;s plan to move into Morocco coincided with WaystoCap&#8217;s bid to raise new funding (the last time the company took venture capital was in 2017) and push further into the Moroccan market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But both companies agreed to work together rather than compete with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love the team. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They share the same values and they&#8217;re on a mission that is using a tech-enabled supply chain to optimize food distribution across the continent,&#8221; he said in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;For us, our strategy is to build a global team that can think local and execute </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">properly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And we figured out that they&#8217;re already a perfect fit for that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the acquisition signals MaxAB&#8217;s move into Morocco, it also shows the company&#8217;s entry into the Maghreb markets &#8212; Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia, where there&#8217;s little or no contest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MaxAB says more than 70,000 retailers across both platforms will &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefit from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its technology, expanded end-to-end supply chain solutions and business intelligence tools as well as WaystoCap’s knowledge and expertise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Bassunie will take over the position as the managing director at MaxAB Morocco. Commenting on the acquisition of her startup, she said, “&#8230; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are thrilled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to play a pivotal role in the new all-star team </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being created</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and led by experienced, innovative entrepreneurs to establish a regional market leader in food and grocery supply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are looking forward to continuing our close working relationship with our new team and taking the business to its next phase.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Maghreb market is new territory for MaxAB and the acquisition positions it as the most funded and largest B2B e-commerce platform for retailers and suppliers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morocco’s growing tech hub offers huge potential and the acquisition of WaystoCap empowers MaxAB to become a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> global team with a targeted local approach, setting the company on track to be the leading B2B retail and grocery platform in the Middle East and Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At the end of the day, what we want to do is build a tech-enabled supply chain, in all the African countries, in the Middle Eastern countries, and then connect them together</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That&#8217;s where the magic happens. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where we can actually have a real impact by putting the right amount of food at the right place at the right time, and minimizing the waste which MENA cannot afford,&#8221; said MaxAB CEO El-Meghabel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MaxAB&#8217;s acquisition of WaystoCap is the second local cross-border acquisition that has played out in Africa this week</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Nigeria and Canada-based mobility startup Plentywaka announced the acquisition of Stabus, its counterpart in Ghana, for an undisclosed amount</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a narrower consolidation perspective, Kenyan consumer experience platform Ajua acquired Kenyan AI and ML messaging and payments company WayaWaya, early in April</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.marathon.edu.vn/">Marathon Education</a> was created after its founders realized after-school education in Vietnam hadn’t evolved much since they were kids. Some of the most popular tuition centers in big cities teach hundreds of students at once. “They’re packed like sardines and that really has not changed in the past one or two decades when I went to these sorts of classes in Vietnam,” said co-founder Pham Duc.</p>
<p>Pham launched Marathon six weeks ago with his brother-in-law Tran Viet Tung to make after-school learning more accessible in Vietnam. Today the startup is announcing it has raised $1.5 million in pre-seed funding led by Forge Ventures (a new fund launched by Alto Partners), with participation from investors including Venturra Discovery and iSeed SEA.</p>
<p>Marathon is currently focused on math and science courses for grades six to 12 of the National Curriculum developed by Vietnam’s Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), and will eventually cover all MOET subjects.</p>
<p>Before founding Marathon, Pham was an investor at TPG Global, while Tran is a serial entrepreneur whose previous startups include travel platforms Triip.me and Christina’s. Both grew up in Hanoi and spent much of their childhoods going to after-school learning centers.</p>
<p>About 50% to 70% of K-12 students attend after-school classes, but the industry is very fragmented, says Pham. Many learning centers are run by former public school teachers, and are clustered in major cities.</p>
<p>“If you speak to students, I think the biggest issue we’re seeing is accessibility,” said Pham. “If you’re a student in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, there’s no guarantee that you’ll get into classes run by top tutors.” Meanwhile, students in other areas often travel to Tier 1 cities before major tests, like university entrance exams, staying in a hostel for about a month while attending prep courses.</p>
<p>For teachers, running a center means handling administrative tasks like marketing, admissions and parent communications, which cuts into the time they spend designing their courses. When the current COVID-19 lockdowns started a few months ago, they had to switch quickly to online teaching platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When teachers join Marathon, the company takes over administrative tasks. Its online model also means they can reach more students, including in other cities. Pham says teachers who switch from offline centers to Marathon can potentially increase their earnings two to three times.</p>

<p>Before joining Marathon, teachers go through a screening process, including how many of they previous students passed exams or improved their grades. Marathon pairs them with teaching assistants who work directly with groups of about 20 to 25 students during online lectures, answering questions through instant messenger, and then manage breakout rooms to go through the lessons in detail.</p>
<p>Marathon launched first in Ho Chi Minh City and its expansion strategy will take cultural differences between the north and south of Vietnam into account. For example, it will find tutors with regional accents, and adjust its marketing strategies.</p>
<p>“We are going to focus on the teachers and curriculum separately, because the two regions are quite different. Parents in the south are more experimental and more willing to try out new services. Parents in the north very much rely on their network and word-of-mouth, so they are more cautious about trying out what we’re doing,” Tran said. “So when we serve the north and south, we serve distinctive sets of customers.”</p>
<p>Marathon plans to continue its online-only model after lockdowns end and kids go back to in-person classes for regular school. “After one year in intermittent lockdowns, we’ve noticed there’s been a marked shift in parents’ behavior. They are much more receptive to online learning. Right now, even though there’s a lockdown, attendance rates are 99%,” said Pham. “In the future, I think online is the way to go and it’s much more scalable, so we want to focus our strategy around that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It hasn&#8217;t even been a week since Tesla hosted its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/top-five-highlights-of-elon-musks-tesla-ai-day/">AI Day</a>, a livestreamed event full of technical jargon meant to snare the choicest of AI and vision engineers to come work for Tesla and help the company achieve autonomous greatness, and already CEO Elon Musk is coming in with some hot takes about the &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; (FSD) tech.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just drove FSD Beta 9.3 from Pasadena to LAX. Much improved!</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1430038942909272071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a tweet on Tuesday, Musk said: &#8220;FSD Beta 9.2 is actually not great imo, but Autopilot/AI team is rallying to improve as fast as possible. We&#8217;re trying to have a single tech stack for both highway &amp; city streets, but it requires massive [neural network] retraining.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an important point. Many others in the autonomous space have mirrored this sentiment. Don Burnette, co-founder and CEO of Kodiak Robotics, says his company is exclusively focused on trucking for the moment because it&#8217;s a much easier problem to solve. In a recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/kodiak-robotics-founder-says-tight-focus-on-autonomous-trucks-is-working/">Extra Crunch interview</a>, Burnette said:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the unique aspects of our tech is that it’s highly customized for a specific goal. We don’t have this constant requirement that we maintain really high truck highway performance while at the same time really high dense urban passenger car performance, all within the same stack and system. Theoretically it’s certainly possible to create a generic solution for all driving in all conditions under all form factors, but it’s certainly a much harder problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because Tesla is only using optical cameras, scorning lidar and radar, &#8220;massive&#8221; neural network training as a requirement is not an understatement at all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite the sympathy we all feel for the AI and vision team that may undoubtedly be feeling a bit butthurt by Musk&#8217;s tweet, this is a singular moment of clarity and honesty for Musk. Usually, we have to filter Tesla news about its autonomy with a fine-tuned BS meter, one that beeps wildly with every mention of its &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; technology. Which, for the record, is not at all full self-driving; it&#8217;s just advanced driver assistance that could, we grant, lay the groundwork for better autonomy in the future.</p>
<p>Musk followed up the tweet by saying that he just drove the FSD Beta 9.3 from Pasadena to LAX, a ride that was &#8220;much improved!&#8221; Do we buy it? Musk is ever the optimist. At the start of the month, Musk said Tesla would be releasing new versions of its FSD every two weeks at midnight California time. Then he promised that Beta 9.2 would be &#8220;tight,&#8221; saying that radar was holding the company back and now that it&#8217;s fully accepted pure vision, progress will go much faster.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is always a lot of cleanup after a major code release. Beta 9.2 will be tight. </p>
<p>Still some fundamentals to solve for Beta 10, but now that we’re pure vision, progress is much faster. Radar was holding us back.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421564618258931715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Perhaps Musk is just trying to deflect against the flurry of bad press about the FSD system. Last week,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/"> U.S. auto regulators opened a preliminary investigation into Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot</a>, citing 11 incidents in which vehicles crashed into parked first responder vehicles. Why first responder vehicles in particular, we don&#8217;t know. But according to <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOA-PE21020-1893.PDF">investigation documents</a> posted on the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration’s website, most of the incidents took place after dark. Poor night vision is definitely a thing with many human drivers, but those kinds of incidents just won&#8217;t fly in the world of autonomous driving.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 24, 2021. Today’s news cycle was particularly beefy, so we have a lot of ground to cover. Especially if you want to know the latest from Spotify, Waymo and other large tech companies.</p>
<p>But before we do, Disrupt is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/techcrunch-disrupt-2021-kicks-off-in-less-than-a-month/">less than a month away</a> and will feature the two heirs apparent of Salesforce, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/stewart-butterfield-and-bret-taylor-are-coming-to-disrupt/">Stewart Butterfield and Bret Taylor</a>.

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/airbnb-to-provide-free-temporary-housing-for-20000-afghan-refugees/">Airbnb to house 20,000 Afghan refugees:</a> </strong>Corporate gimmicks are hollow gestures at best. What Airbnb is promising is the opposite. By offering free housing to tens of thousands of refugees from Afghanistan, the company is using its business network for material good. Other wealthy tech companies, what are you going to do?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">Ramp raises $300M at $3.9B valuation:</a> </strong>The startup war to own the growing corporate spend market heated up even more today with Ramp raising fresh funds. Brex and Ramp and Airbase are locked in a multiparty duel after erstwhile competitor Divvy sold to Bill.com. Ramp also made its first acquisition, it announced.</li>
<li>For more on the Ramp-Brex rivalry, and what their acquisitions may detail about their diverging strategies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-and-brex-draw-diverging-market-plans-with-ma-strategy/">head here</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bostons-startup-market-is-more-than-setting-records-in-scorching-start-to-year/">Boom times in Beantown:</a> </strong>The global startup scene is accelerating, but few markets have turned on the afterburners to the same degree as Boston. The venerable startup hub is putting up record venture capital tallies across more rounds than ever. And a bevy of local investors don’t see the momentum slowing in coming quarters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>So much happened in the last 24 hours that we’re forced to proceed in sections. Make sure you are following <a href="https://twitter.com/techcrunch">TechCrunch on Twitter</a> so that you can stay up to date all day long.</p>
<p>We start in India:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bankers-chase-byjus-for-ipo-valuation-pegged-up-to-50-billion/"><strong>Bankers hunt Byju’s:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Its IPO, that is. Per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc/">Manish Singh</a>, bankers are pitching the famous edtech startup, hoping to secure a piece of its future IPO action. And the numbers being thrown around are truly astounding: “Most banks have given Byju’s a proposed valuation in the range of $40 billion to $45 billion, but some including Morgan Stanley have pitched a $50 billion valuation if the startup lists next year,” he writes.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/indias-khatabook-raises-100-million-for-its-bookkeeping-platform-for-merchants/"><strong>Khatabook raises $100M more:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Now valued at around $600 million, Khatabook’s business of digitizing India’s myriad SMBs is doing well, it appears. The company’s fresh Series C will help power its 10 million monthly active users, and likely help it expand its staff of 200 people.</li>
</ul>
<p>To lead us into startup rounds more generally, our own <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas</a> published an article today <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/noredink-raises-50-million-series-b-to-help-students-become-better-writers/">digging into NoRedInk’s huge $50 million Series B</a>. Its goal is to help students become better writers. I asked her why she picked the round to cover, to which she said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Usually, I see edtech companies working on subjects that have one right answer, or at least can be sorted into a single category the way STEM or coding often are. NoRedInk caught my eye because it wants to bring tech to a highly emotional and subjective subject: writing. That&#8217;s a hard challenge, but it&#8217;s cool to see the education community bet on ambitious projects beyond teaching more students to code.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next up we have a few regular startup bulletins:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/substack-acqui-hires-team-behind-subscription-social-app-cocoon/"><strong>Substack buys the team behind Cocoon:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Substack is having quite the week. After hiring a general counsel, the startup announced that it has acquired the team at Cocoon, what TechCrunch described as “subscription social media app built for close friends.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/icon-lands-207m-series-b-to-construct-more-3d-printed-homes-after-400-yoy-revenue-growth/"><strong>Maybe 3D-printed homes will be a thing?</strong></a> Investors are betting that they will be, pouring $207 million into ICON after its 3D-printed home business saw revenue growth of 400%. In realistic terms, we have a national housing crisis. So if this leads to more, cheaper homes, it’s hard to oppose.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/soras-hr-automation-software-raises-14m-series-a/"><strong>Sora raises $14M for HR ops automation:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sora is back this year with a fresh capital raise, after scaling its customers by 7x and revenues by 8x since its 2020 seed round. Now flush with Series A cash, the startup has big plans to grow its team and double down on making the HR tech stack work in concert, cutting out busywork as it does so.</li>
<li>And in a slightly related area, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tango-dances-in-with-5-7m-to-making-employee-onboarding-easier/"><strong>Tango announced that it has raised $5.7 million to grow its process documentation service</strong></a>. The startup watches how employees execute a particular task, and then creates a how-to guide so that others can follow in their footsteps. For new employees, especially in a remote world, it could be a neat service.</li>
<li>Finally from startupland, Sara Mauskopf (CEO and co-founder of Winnie) and Elana Berkowitz (founding partner at Springbank Collective) <strong><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/its-time-for-the-vc-community-to-stop-overlooking-the-childcare-industry/">wrote an essay for TechCrunch</a></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> noting that one industry in particular is huge, yet somehow devoid of venture dollars: childcare.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Back to the suture: The future of healthcare is in the home</h2>
<p>It was once common practice for doctors to visit sick patients in their homes: In 1930, 40% of all consultations were house calls. By 1980, that figure was less than 1%.</p>
<p>Today, urgent care centers occupy Main Street storefronts and 33% of medical expenditures occur in hospitals. This leads to higher prices, but not necessarily better results, according to Sumi Das and Nina Gerson, who lead healthcare investments at Capital G.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can improve both outcomes and costs by moving care from the hospital back to the place it started — at home,&#8221; they write in a post that explores <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/back-to-the-suture-the-future-of-healthcare-is-in-the-home/">five innovations enabling at-home care</a> and identifies investment opportunities like acute care and infrastructure development.</p>

The dotcom boom company is among the most acquisitive companies in the world, making its approach to snagging startup talent and products worth understanding.</p>
<p>And now, the crush of Big Tech news:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/nso-pegasus-bahrain-iphone-security/"><strong>Your iPhone isn’t safe from this spyware:</strong></a> That’s the gist of the latest Zack Whittaker story, delving into how a zero-click attack executed by NSO software broke the security of a “Bahraini human rights activist’s iPhone.” Not good!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/peloton-tread-arrives-next-week-with-enhanced-safety-features-following-recall/"><strong>Peloton’s Tread is back, hopefully safer:</strong></a> One of the weirder self-inflicted wounds in the world of exercise tech came when Peloton tried to argue that its treadmills were safe. They weren’t. Peloton eventually relented and offered a recall. Now they are back!</li>

A service called TikTok Shopping is also coming to the U.S., the U.K. and Canada.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/spotifys-podcasts-subscriptions-service-is-now-open-to-all-u-s-creators/"><strong>All U.S. podcasters can now access Spotify’s subscription option:</strong></a> Paid podcasting is big in China, but less popular elsewhere in the world. Spotify is betting that the model will have legs into other markets as well. Now all U.S. podcasters can access the paid service if they so choose.</li>
<li>To round us out, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/waymo-launches-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/"><strong>Waymo is rolling out its self-driving car service to San Francisco</strong></a>. Given the City by the Bay’s inability to ever finish a roadworks project, this is big news. As someone who doesn’t want to drive, that’s great news.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Developing new packaged foods and consumer goods can take a couple years as companies research, prototype and test products. In a society that runs on social media, however, people expect to see trends land on store shelves much more quickly. Founded in 2018, <a href="https://www.aipalette.com/">Ai Palette</a> uses machine learning to help companies spot trends in real time and get them retail-ready, often within a few months. The startup, whose clients include Danone, Kellogg’s, Cargill and Dole, announced today it has raised an oversubscribed $4.4 million Series A co-led by pi Ventures and Exfinity Venture Partners. Both will join Ai Palette’s board.</p>
<p>The round also included participation from returning backers food tech venture firm AgFunder and Decacorn Capital, and new investor Anthill Ventures. It brings Ai Palette’s total raised to $5.5 million, including a seed round <a href="https://e27.co/exclusive-foodtech-startup-ai-palette-gets-us1m-seed-funding-from-decacorn-capital-others-20190823/">announced in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Ai Palette is based in Singapore, with an engineering hub in Bangalore. Its customer base started in Southeast Asia, before expanding into China, Japan, the United States and Europe.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The present and future of food tech investment opportunity&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/the-foodtech-investment-opportunity-present-and-future/embed/#?secret=cCXuLNmkSB" data-secret="cCXuLNmkSB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Its customer base started in Southeast Asia and India, and expanded to China, Japan, the United States and Europe. Ai Palette supports 15 languages, which the company claims is the most of any AI-based tool for predicting consumer packaged goods (CPG) trends. Its funding will be used to expand into more markets and fill engineering and data science roles.</p>
<p>Ai Palette was founded in 2018 by chief executive officer Somsubhra GanChoudhuri and chief technology officer Himanshu Upreti, who met through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/a-lof-of-efffing-money/">Entrepreneur First</a>, the “talent investor” that recruits and teams up potential founders.</p>
<p>Before Ai Palette, GanChoudhuri worked in sales and marketing at Givaudan, the world’s largest manufacturer of fragrances and flavors. This allowed him to see how product innovation is done for many types of consumer products, ranging from snacks and fast food to packaged goods. Many of the companies he worked with were beginning to realize that a two-year product innovation cycle could no longer meet demand. Upreti, an advanced machine learning and big data analysis expert, previously worked at companies including Visa, where he built models that can handle petabytes of data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uk2edHerlt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/a-lof-of-efffing-money/">EF raises $115M new fund, aiming to create another 300-plus startups in the next three years</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EF raises $115M new fund, aiming to create another 300-plus startups in the next three years&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/a-lof-of-efffing-money/embed/#?secret=uk2edHerlt" data-secret="uk2edHerlt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ai Palette’s first product is Foresight Engine, which tracks trends like ingredients or flavors, analyzes why they are popular and predicts how long demand will last. It also identifies “white space opportunities,” or situations where there is unmet demand. For example, GanChoudhuri said the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way people eat — they are now eating health snacks up to six times a day in front of screens — so companies have the chance to release new kinds of products.</p>
<p>Foresight Engine gives contextual information, said Upreti. “For example, is a food item eaten on the go, or at a café. Is a product consumed socially or individually? What’s trending at kids’ birthday parties? For a specific product or ingredient, images provide information on product pairings and product format.”</p>
<p>The platform uses data from sources like social media, search, blogs, recipes, menus and company data. “Data sets popular to each market are prioritized, like a local recipe or a food delivery app,” said GanChoudhuri. “And they are tracked over the years to determine growth trajectory with a strong degree of confidence.”</p>
<p>Some specific examples of how Ai Palette’s tech has translated into new products include brands that want to launch a new flavor, like for a potato chip or soda, in a specific country. They can use the Foresight Engine to not only see what trends are rising, but which ones have the potential to become long-term favorites, so they don’t invest in a product that will almost instantly lose its popularity.</p>
<p>Many of Ai Palette’s clients have used it to react to new trends and consumer behavior patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Not surprisingly, people in many markets are interested in healthy food or ones that are supposed to boost immunity. For example, in Southeast Asia there is more demand for lemon and garlic, while acerola and yerba mate are trending in the United States.</p>
<p>On the other hand, “in China, taste is paramount, even over health, because people are looking for food that brings back a sense of normalcy,” said GanChoudhuri. Meanwhile in India, there is demand for products with longer shelf life as people continue to cope with the pandemic, but many consumers are also seeking interesting snacks to ease the boredom of lockdown, with kimchi and other Korean flavors becoming especially popular.</p>
<p>Ai Palette’s ability to work with many languages is one of the ways it differentiates from other machine learning-based trend-prediction platforms. It currently supports English, simplified Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Bahasa Indonesian, Bahasa Melayu, Tagalog, Spanish, French and German, with plans to add more as it targets new European countries, Mexico, Latin America and the Middle East.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When is the last time your doctor treated you at home?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was once common practice for doctors to visit sick patients in their homes: In 1930, 40% of all consultations were house calls. By 1980, that figure was less than 1%.</p>
<p>Today, urgent care centers occupy Main Street storefronts and 33% of all medical expenditures occur in hospitals. It&#8217;s clear that the additional overhead is generating higher prices, but not necessarily better results, according to Sumi Das and Nina Gerson, who lead healthcare investments at Capital G.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can improve both outcomes and costs by moving care from the hospital back to the place it started — at home,&#8221; they write in a post that explores <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/back-to-the-suture-the-future-of-healthcare-is-in-the-home/">five innovations enabling at-home care</a> and identifies investment opportunities like acute care and infrastructure development.</p>
<p>Today, in-home care comprises just 3% of overall healthcare spending, but Gerson and Das estimate that will expand to 10% in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;To make these improvements, in-home healthcare strategies will need to leverage next-generation technology and value-based care strategies. Fortunately, the window of opportunity for change is open right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ritu Narayan founded Zūm with her two brothers in 2016 to disrupt student transportation, a space that hasn&#8217;t seen much innovation since pupils began finding their way to and from little red schoolhouses.</p>
<p>Since then, Zūm has inked partnerships with school districts around the country to create more efficient routes and reduce vehicle emissions.</p>
<p>By 2025, Narayan says her company will have 10,000 electric school buses and plans to put the fleet into service to generate power and feed it back to the grid.</p>
<p>To learn more about the company&#8217;s development, its immediate plans for the future and how the pandemic impacted operations, read on.</p>

<p>For The Exchange, Alex Wilhelm looked at recent financial data from scooter sharing service Bird, which &#8212; like Lyft, Uber, Airbnb and others &#8212; took a beating during the pandemic as potential riders stayed home.</p>
<p>Bird flipped its business model and its results improved, but it still has a ways to go. “In the bull case, Bird can get rid of its adjusted losses in a few years,” Alex writes.</p>
<p>“If any issues arise at the top of the company’s table — say, for example, that rides per scooter do not scale as the company rolls out more hardware, or merely slower than expected — the anticipated profitability results could evaporate or be pushed into the future.”</p>

<p>By 2030, India&#8217;s SaaS industry is estimated to comprise 4%-6% of the global market and generate between $50 billion and $70 billion in yearly revenue, according to a SaaSBOOMi/McKinsey report.</p>
<p>“With the right approach, it won’t be long before the Indian SaaS community becomes a large-scale employer of talent, a significant contributor to India’s GDP and a creator of unmatched products,&#8221; says Manav Garg, CEO and founder of Eka Software Solutions.</p>
<p>In a guest post, he lays out several key growth drivers, which include &#8220;the largest concentration of developers in the world&#8221; and the fact that &#8220;SaaS is not a winner-take-all market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even so, the region still faces challenges, since &#8220;growth requires a growth mindset.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Alex Wilhelm has repeatedly noted in The Exchange, neoinsurance companies, from healthcare to auto to home and rental, have taken a whacking by the market.</p>
<p>But he hadn’t quite figured out why until he chatted with Pie Insurance co-founder and CEO John Swigart, who had an interesting hypothesis.</p>
<p>Summing up their conversation in a single sentence: &#8220;From the public markets’ perspective, it’s the results, stupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ron Miller interviewed three Cisco executives to learn more about the company&#8217;s “rich history of buying its way to global success”:</p>
<ul>
<li>CFO Scott Herren</li>
<li>Derek Idemoto, SVP for corporate development and Cisco investments</li>
<li>Jeetu Patel, EVP and GM, Security and Collaboration</li>
</ul>
<p>Since its founding, Cisco has acquired 229 companies, buying more than 30 startups in the last four years that focus on everything from edtech to event management.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, one of the big reasons for all these acquisitions could be about maintaining growth,&#8221; writes Ron.</p>

<p>“Inflation may or may not prove transitory when it comes to consumer prices, but startup valuations are definitely rising — and noticeably so — in recent quarters.”</p>
<p>That’s Alex Wilhelm’s summation of a recent PitchBook report rounding up valuation data from U.S. startup funding events.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://moviesanywhere.com/">Movies Anywhere</a>, an app that allows you to centralize your digital movie collection from across services, is rolling out a new feature that will help you make better sense of your growing library. The company today introduced an AI-powered feature called &#8220;My Lists,&#8221; which automatically groups movies together based on any number of factors &#8212; like genre, actors, franchise, theme and more.</p>
<p>For digital movie collectors with larger libraries, the feature could make browsing through the available options feel more like scrolling through the recommendations you&#8217;d find on a modern-day streaming service, like Netflix. That is, instead of scrolling down through endless pages showing you all your purchased movies in order of purchase or alphabetically, as before, you can now quickly scan rows where the content is organized in ways that make it easier to discover what&#8217;s actually in your library.</p>
<p>For example, if you had purchased all the movies from a particular franchise, they would now be on their own row together. This is an improvement over how you had to locate these movies in your collection before &#8212; where they&#8217;d be sandwiched between the other titles you bought in between the franchise purchases.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u32yo8loS5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/streaming-services-face-their-real-test-in-2021/">Streaming services face their real test in 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Streaming services face their real test in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/streaming-services-face-their-real-test-in-2021/embed/#?secret=u32yo8loS5" data-secret="u32yo8loS5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>You may also discover that you own a lot of movies within a particular category, like &#8220;Action Thrillers,&#8221; or those with a central theme, like &#8220;strong female friendships,&#8221; which could help you narrow down your movie night selection.</p>
<p>These algorithmically created lists can also be edited, allowing you to add or remove titles &#8212; or even delete the list altogether.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193535" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193535" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2193535" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="490" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg 1737w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=768,553 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=680,490 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=1536,1106 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193535" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Movies Anywhere</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Plus, you can now make lists of your own, too. So you could make a list of favorites, movies you want to watch with your family, or however else you want to further organize your collection. You could even use the feature to make a &#8220;to watch&#8221; list of movies you&#8217;ve purchased, but hadn&#8217;t yet made time for.</p>
<p>The Movie Anywhere app has been around for years, but is now jointly operated by Disney, Universal, WB, Sony Pictures and 20th Century Fox, after migrating to a new platform back in 2017. Its biggest selling point for digital movie collectors is that you can in one place get to all the movies you bought from various services. That includes digital downloads offered by iTunes, Vudu, Prime Video, YouTube, Xfinity and others. Before, you would have to switch from app to app to figure out if you had ever purchased a given title.</p>
<p>My Lists is one of many features the company has added over time to keep its app feeling current. Last year, for instance, it introduced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/movies-anywhere-officially-launches-its-digital-movie-lending-feature-screen-pass/">digital movie lending feature called Screen Pass</a>, and it earlier had launched a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/movies-anywhere-watch-together-parties-163017748.html">co-watching feature called Watch Together</a>, which let users watch with up to nine friends.</p>
<p>The new My Lists is available today in the Movies Anywhere mobile app, desktop and on streaming devices from the navigation bar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Linktree, the popular “link in bio” service with more than 16 million users, is partnering with PayPal to expand its recently <a href="https://help.linktr.ee/en/support/solutions/articles/48001172633-what-are-commerce-links-">launched “Commerce Links” tools</a> for direct payment on Linktree globally. The Melbourne-based startup says creators in over 200 countries where PayPal operates can now accept payments through the transaction tools.</p>
<p>Launched in March, Commerce Links allow users to take payments directly on their Linktree profile without opening a new browser or tab. The new integration lets Linktree customers connect their PayPal account and receive payments from their followers or customers via PayPal, a debit card or a credit card. Linktree notes users can also access information regarding their transactions, payment conversion rate and more. The company says the available relevant data is meant to help creators manage their digital presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the creator economy grows, creators want new ways to collect payments and support from their audience with as little friction as possible,&#8221; said Linktree co-founder and CEO Alex Zaccaria in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to be collaborating with PayPal to further expand our solutions to our users globally and enable them to further manage and monetize their digital presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are two types of Commerce Links that creators can use to take payments from their followers and customers: A “Support Me Link” allows Linktree users to collect payments and donations from their visitors, while “Request Links” lets customers and followers request goods and services from creators directly from their Linktree profile.</p>
<p>Linktree says its collaboration with PayPal is the latest in a series of creator-focused efforts. The partnership announcement comes days after Linktree announced its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linktree-announces-acquisition-of-songlinkodesli-and-launches-music-link-feature-301358565.html">acquisition of automated music link aggregation platform Songlink/Odesli</a>. Linktree is integrating Songlink/Odesli into its newly launched “Music Link” feature, which automatically displays the same song or album across all music streaming services to let users listen to content on their preferred platform.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, Linktree now competes with several “link in bio” platforms, including Shorby, Linkin.bio and Beacons. In March, Linktree announced it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/link-in-bio-company-linktree-raises-45m-series-b-for-its-social-commerce-features/">raised $45 million in Series B funding</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ForgeRock</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">filed its form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this morning as the identity management provider takes the next step toward its IPO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company did not provide initial pricing for its shares, which will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FORG. The IPO is being led by Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., with the company being valued as high as $4 billion, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/digital-identity-startup-forgerock-files-ipo-as-losses-shrink">Bloomberg</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which is a significant uplift over the $730 million post-money value that</span><a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">PitchBook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had for the company after its last round in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the ever-increasing volume of cybersecurity attacks against organizations of all sizes, the need to secure and manage user identities is of growing importance. Based in San Francisco, ForgeRock has raised $233 million in funding across multiple rounds. The company&#8217;s last round was a</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/forgerock-nabs-93-5m-for-its-id-management-platform-gears-up-next-for-an-ipo/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$93.5 million Series E</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced in April 2020, which was led by Riverwood Capital alongside Accenture Ventures. At that time, CEO Fran Rosch told TechCrunch that the round would be the last before an IPO, which was also what former CEO Mike Ellis told us after the startup&#8217;s</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/identity-startup-forgerock-lands-88-million-series-d-investment/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$88 million Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the timing of its IPO might have been unclear over the last few years, the company has been on a positive trajectory for growth. In its</span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543916/000119312521254144/d127368ds1.htm"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">S-1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ForgeRock reported that as of June 30, its annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $155 million, representing 30% year-over-year growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While revenue is growing, losses are narrowing as the company reported a $20 million net loss down from $36 million a year ago. There certainly is a whole lot of room to grow, as the company estimates that the total global addressable market for identity services to be worth $71 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the many competitors that ForgeRock faces is Okta, which went public in 2017 and has been growing in the years since. In March, Okta</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cloud identity startup Auth0 for $6.5 billion in a deal that</span> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/making-sense-of-the-6-5b-okta-auth0-deal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised a few eyebrows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another competitor is Ping Identity, which went public in 2019 and is also growing, reporting on August 4 that its ARR hit $279.6 million in its quarter ended June 30, for a 19% year-over-year gain. There have also been a few big exits in the space over the years, including Duo Security, which was</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/02/cisco-is-buying-duo-security-for-2-35b-in-cash/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired by Cisco</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for $2.35 billion in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ForgeRock has a good access management tool and they continue to be a strong player in customer identity and access management (CIAM),” commented Michael Kelley, senior research director at Gartner.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelley noted that in 2020, ForgeRock converted most of its core access management services to a SaaS delivery model, which helped the company catch up with the rest of the market that already offered access management as SaaS. Also last year the company expanded into identity governance, introducing a brand new identity, governance and administration (IGA) product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think one of the more interesting products that ForgeRock offers is ForgeRock Trees, which is a no-code/low-code orchestration tool for building complex authentication and authorization journeys for customers, which is particularly helpful in the CIAM market,” Kelly added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ForgeRock was founded in 2010, but its roots go back even further to an open-source single sign-on project known as OpenSSO that was created by Sun Microsystems in 2005. When Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in early 2010, a number of its open-source efforts were left to languish, which is what led a number of former Sun employees to start ForgeRock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last decade, ForgeRock has expanded significantly beyond just providing a single sign-on to providing an identity platform that can handle consumer, enterprise and IoT use-cases. The company&#8217;s platform today handles identity and access management as well as identity governance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to scale is a key selling point that ForgeRock makes in the S-1, noting that its platform can handle over 60,000 user-based access transactions per second per customer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As of June 30, 2021, we had four customers with 100 million or more licensed identities, the company stated in the S-1. &#8220;Our ability to serve mission-critical needs in complex environments for large customers enables us to grow our base of large customers and expand within each of them. &#8220;</span></p>
