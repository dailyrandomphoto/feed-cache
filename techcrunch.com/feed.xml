										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s ever been a phone we knew more about before its official launch than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/google-revamps-its-smartphone-line-with-the-pixel-6/">Google&#8217;s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro</a>. But in a world of samey Android phones, Google made some interesting choices, especially with regards to the chips that power it all. For the first time, Google now offers a phone that is powered by an SoC of its own design.</p>
<p>Dubbed Tensor, Google first <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-tensor-debuts-new-pixel-6-fall/">talked about it</a> earlier this summer. It&#8217;s what powers all of the on-device AI smarts of the phone. It&#8217;s basically Google&#8217;s own AI/ML accelerator, coupled with relatively off-the-shelf Arm CPU and GPU cores, as well as Google&#8217;s new Titan 2 security core.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220409" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tensor_4K_002_1.max-1000x1000-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220409" class="size-full wp-image-2220409" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tensor_4K_002_1.max-1000x1000-1.png" alt="" width="1024" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2220409" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220294" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Google promises that Tensor will offer up to 80% faster performance than the chips that powered the Pixel 5, which, to be fair, was more of a mid-range phone but still feels perfectly smooth in everyday use. Leaked benchmarks ahead of today&#8217;s launch put it on par with modern Snapdragon mobile chips from Qualcomm &#8211; but those don&#8217;t include Google&#8217;s own AI/ML cores and the role these specialized cores play in making the Pixel 6 cameras and their complex computational photography feel snappy can&#8217;t really be captured in a standard benchmark.</p>
<p>What we do know from these early leaks, though, is that Tensor is powered by two Arm Cortex-X1 chips, Arm&#8217;s flagship performance-oriented mobile designs. In comparison, the Snapdragon 888 only features one of those. As usual in modern SoCs, there are also some lower-performance, battery-saving cores. Rumor has it, these are a mix of older A76-based cores and the more recent ultra-efficient A55 ones (all of which help to get the Pixel 6 to a promised 24-hour battery life). Google itself has remained perfectly quiet about those details, which makes sense, given that the company wants to put the full focus on the system&#8217;s AI capabilities.</p>
<p>And indeed, throughout today&#8217;s announcement, Google&#8217;s Rick Osterloh stressed these AI experiences, ranging from live translations to the phone&#8217;s photo and video capabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Google Tensor, we’re unlocking amazing new experiences that require state of the art ML — including Motion Mode, Face Unblur, Speech enhancement mode for videos and applying HDRnet to videos,&#8221; Google&#8217;s senior director for Google Silicon, Monika Gupta, writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;Google Tensor allows us to push the limits of helpfulness in a smartphone, taking it from a one-size-fits-all piece of hardware into a device that’s intelligent enough to respect and accommodate the different ways we use our phones.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/youtube-to-pilot-test-shopping-from-livestreams-with-select-creators/">announced</a> earlier this year it would begin pilot testing livestream shopping with a handful of select creators. Now, the company is ready for a larger test of its live shopping platform with plans to host a week-long live shopping event, &#8220;YouTube Holiday Stream and Shop,&#8221; starting on November 15. The event will allow viewers to shop new products, unlock limited-time offers, and engage with creators and other viewers via Q&amp;As and polls, the company says.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The company first <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/neal-innovation-series/">unveiled</a> its plans to invest in live shopping at the beginning of 2021, as part of a larger initiative around integrated shopping on YouTube. The initial tests had been focused on videos on demand before the livestream pilot <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/youtube-to-pilot-test-shopping-from-livestreams-with-select-creators/">kicked off this summer</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Since then, a number of YouTube creators have tried out livestream shopping with their fans, including </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/simplynailogical">Simply Nailogical,</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> who launched her </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7dllNiRQpQ">nail polish collection</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to 2.8 million fans on her </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnaXc7HBuxqyP5fwOTH58FQ">Simply Not </a><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnaXc7HBuxqyP5fwOTH58FQ">Logical channel</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">; </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Hyram">Hyram</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, who launched his ‘</span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLhd3fu9-2s">Selfless’ skincare line</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to his 4.5 million fans; and </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RavenElyseTV">Raven Elyse</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> who ran a livestream shopping session where she sold products in partnership with Walmart. (Walmart had earlier experimented with live shopping on TikTok across <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">multiple</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">events</a>.)</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220242" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A7dllNiRQpQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Other retailers also participated more directly, YouTube notes. </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx6Wixw7HXo&amp;t=905s">Sephora hosted a live Q&amp;A</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uNY4bllvAU&amp;t=139s">Target ran a live style haul</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> using the new features, for example. </span></p>
<p>The upcoming Stream and Shop event, which kicks off with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/merrelltwins" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/c/merrelltwins&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634656696941000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcKqdC0MmjgSp7KpqZsxNXipSXHw">Merrell Twins</a>, will also feature products from top retailers including Walmart, Samsung, and Verizon.</p>
<p>As part of its panel at Advertising Week, the company shared a few details from the research it has invested in to better understand the live shopping journey and how YouTube plays a role. In partnership with Publicis and TalkShoppe, YouTube study&#8217;s found that 75% of viewers used YouTube for shopping inspiration &#8212; for instance, by watching creators&#8217; #ShopWithMe videos. It also found that 85% of viewers trust creators&#8217; recommendations and that viewers valued information quality and quantity over the production value of the videos.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite the steps it&#8217;s been making towards live stream shopping, YouTube hasn&#8217;t yet made the feature broadly available. Instead, it&#8217;s continuing to test live shopping with individual creators.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, rival TikTok has moved forward with live shopping features of its own.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, TikTok began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tiktok-expands-shopify-partnership-pilots-tiktok-shopping-in-us-uk-and-canada/">piloting</a> TikTok Shopping in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, in partnership with Shopify. At an event last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">the company said it was expanding</a> shopping with new partners Square, Ecwid, PrestaShop, Wix, SHOPLINE, OpenCart and BASE. It <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/enter-tiktok-world-and-meet-the-next-era-of-marketing">also introduced a suite of solutions and features</a> under the brand TikTok Shopping, which includes ways to integrate products into videos, ads, and LIVE shopping support.</p>
<p>Facebook also ran its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/facebook-debuts-live-shopping-fridays-featuring-beauty-fashion-and-skincare-brands/">own series of live shopping events</a> this spring and summer, and now offers dedicated live shopping sections inside both its Facebook and Instagram apps&#8217; Shop sections.</p>
<p>YouTube plans to share more about its upcoming live shopping event as the date grows closer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">May of 2020 marked the end of an era for the Pixel. Google’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/top-members-of-googles-pixel-team-have-left-the-company/">team lost a few key players</a>, as it looked forward toward a transformative future. Understandably so. The Pixel has never been bad a phone (though it’s had some struggles through the years), so much as an unremarkable one. But in an era when it’s hard to buy a bad flagship smartphone, pretty good is not good enough.</p>
<p>Google’s attempts to differentiate themselves from the Apples and Samsungs of the world have largely come up short. The company has had decent success with its budget range A-Series, but dreams of going head-to-head with premium manufacturers have thus far fallen short. Last year’s Pixel 5 wasn’t the departure fans had hoped for, because revamping a product line takes time.</p>

<p>This morning, at the company’s virtual hardware event, however, Google is finally showing us what it means to pick up and start over again. In many ways, the Pixel 6 marks the most radical departure in the history of Google’s flagship devices &#8212; and its most serious attempt to take the fight to Samsung and Apple.</p>
<p>The company gave us our first glimpse of the device back in August. It was a surprisingly complete look at a device it would take another three and a half months to announce. Hardware head Rick Osterloh primarily focused on chips, design and the fact that Google was becoming the latest company to buck its reliance on Qualcomm by building its own in-house chip, Tensor.</p>
<p>“AI is the future of our innovation work, but the problem is we’ve run into computing limitations that prevented us from fully pursuing our mission,” the executive wrote. “So we set about building a technology platform built for mobile that enabled us to bring our most innovative AI and machine learning (ML) to our Pixel users. We set out to make our own System on a Chip (SoC) to power Pixel 6. And now, years later, it’s almost here.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216079" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216079" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2216079" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png" alt="Google Tensor image" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png 2551w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216079" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://store.google.com/magazine/google_pixel_6?hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> (Image has been modified)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And now it is. The Tensor had landed, alongside the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro it powers. I have the latter in my possession (review soon), and it’s immediately clear that this is a radically new direction for the Pixel line. Google’s clearly gone in a premium direction with the new device, which shares more common DNA with the likes of Samsung’s devices than any of the Pixels we’ve seen to date.</p>
<p>The Pixel 6 sports a 6.4-inch FHD+ OLED at 411 ppi – that bit, at least, is keeping with mid-range specs. The Pro bumps it up to a 6.7-inch QHD+ at 512 ppi. Those displays have refresh rates of 90 and 120 Hz, respectively, protected by a Gorilla Glass Victus cover, which curves on the edges.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219380" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219380" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2219380" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219380" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The rear, meanwhile, is covered in Gorilla Glass 6, with a large and distinctive camera bar that runs along the top third. It’s a sizable enough bump that the phone sits at an angle on its back, unless the phone is in a case [seen above], which keeps things more (but not perfectly ) flush. There’s a slight difference in the hues above and below the camera bar, in an effort to inject a bit more color into the device, now that the Pixel no longer sports the color pop power button. The focus on camera hardware is, in and of itself, a departure for the company. Google has long been so bullish on computational photography that it has implied that hardware is almost a moot point. Perhaps one day in the future, someone will be able to make a compelling version of this argument, where AI and ML are doing most or all of the heavy lifting here. For now, however, camera hardware is still important.</p>
<p>Look no further than the setup on the new Pixels. The 6 supports two lenses: a 50-megapixel wide-angle camera and 12-megapixel on the 6, plus a 48 megapixel telephoto on the 6 Pro. That last one does 4x optical or up to 20x Super Res, though even with computational photography, things are going to degrade pretty quickly. The front-facing camera, meanwhile, is eight megapixels on the 6 and 11 megapixels on the 6 Pro, with 84- and 94-degree fields of view, respectively.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s more info on the various camera features in some of our breakout posts, but here’s a list of what you’ll be able to do on both systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic Eraser</li>
<li>Motion Mode</li>
<li>Real Tone</li>
<li>Face Unblur</li>
<li>Panorama</li>
<li>Manual white balancing Locked Folder</li>
<li>Night Sight</li>
<li>Top Shot</li>
<li>Portrait Mode</li>
<li>Portrait Light</li>
<li>Super Res Zoom Motion autofocus Frequent Faces</li>
<li>Dual exposure controls Live HDR+</li>
<li>Cinematic Pan</li>
</ul>
<p>The most interesting new additions are Real Tone, Motion Mode, Magic Eraser and Face Unblur. The latter is pretty much what it sounds like, sharpening a subject&#8217;s face after shooting. Motion Mode is similar to Portrait Mode, creating a motion blur around a moving subject. Magic Eraser uses a Photoshop-like tool to remove unwanted subjects from the background of the photo, with AI filling in the gaps. Real Tone, meanwhile, is an effort to take better photos of subjects, regardless of skin color &#8212; something that&#8217;s been woefully lacking on smartphones to this point.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219381" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219381" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2219381" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219381" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The system sports a quick in-display fingerprint reader, and all of the sorts of first-party software you&#8217;d expect on a Pixel device. That includes Live Translate, Recorder and Android&#8217;s new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-offers-the-best-look-yet-at-android-12/">Material You</a>, which creates aesthetic consistency across the wallpaper and apps. The company described it thusly at the last I/O,</p>
<blockquote><p>Material You explores a more humanistic approach to design. One that celebrates the tension between design sensibility and personal preference, and does not shy away from emotion. Without compromising the functional foundations of our apps, Material You seeks to create designs that are personal for every style, accessible for every need, alive and adaptive for every screen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also new is Calling Assistance, a new feature, which, much like Duplex, is designed to ease the interaction between human and robot operators. Here, it offers projected call wait times for toll free numbers, based on day and time. Direct My Call, meanwhile, uses Google&#8217;s transcription feature to display text versions of audio menus that direct to the dial pad. Hold For Me, meanwhile, will wait on the call and notify you when a human picks up.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also improved Assistant Voice typing. Saying, &#8220;Hey Google, Type&#8221; will use Assistant to dictate text. &#8220;Stop&#8221; turns the feature off, and &#8220;Send&#8221; fires off a message. You can also spell out difficult words, letter by letter and dictate emojis.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219384" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219384" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2219384" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0445.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0445.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0445.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0445.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0445.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0445.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0445.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0445.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0445.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219384" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The company has addressed some of the battery issues that plagued earlier models. The 6 and 6 Pro feature 4,614 and 5,003mAh batteries, respectively &#8212; that&#8217;s a nice jump from the Pixel 5&#8217;s 4,080mAh (which, in turn, was a nice jump from the Pixel 4). Google says that should translate to around 24 hours of life, or nearly double that if you go into Extreme Battery Saver mode. On-board fast charging via the 30W USB-C plug (sold separately) should give you half a charge in half-an-hour. Both systems also support wireless charging via Qi.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219382" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219382" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2219382" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0454.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0454.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0454.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0454.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0454.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0454.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0454.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0454.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0454.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219382" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The Pixel 6 is available with 8GB of RAM and 128 or 256GB of storage, and the Pro comes with 12GB of RAM and 128, 256 or 512GB of storage. The company has still managed to keep the pricing low, with a $599 starting price for the Pixel 6 and $899 for the Pixel 6 Pro. They&#8217;re up for pre-order now and set to launch October 28.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this month, Citibanamex — Mexico&#8217;s second-largest bank — <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/citis-mexico-unit-takes-first-steps-toward-open-banking">announced</a> that it is building new APIs to allow fintech companies real-time access to information like its services and ATM locations. The move comes as Mexico’s fintech ecosystem flourishes so fiercely that traditional banks have to embrace them or risk lagging behind.</p>
<p>Mexico has been — and still is — leading the fintech charge in Latin America. The country was the first in the region to implement <a href="http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/ref/lritf.htm">a law</a> specific to the sector, and Mexican fintechs account for nearly <a href="https://www.informador.mx/economia/Mexico-segundo-pais-de-AL-que-mas-capital-obtuvo-para-fintech-en-el-2020-20210422-0023.html">20%</a> of total venture investment in the industry throughout Latin America. Not to mention, the Mexican population harbors both the talent and demand for fintech services. Mexico repeatedly tops most innovative fintech hub lists, and neobank and digital wallet transactions are consistently increasing — during COVID lockdowns they rose by an estimated <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/covid-spurs-greater-fintech-use-in-mexico-but-financial-inclusion-lags-58871441">80%</a>.</p>
<p>Considering that nearly 40 million people in Mexico (almost a third of the population) are unbanked, fintech has been a necessary vehicle for fresh routes for credit, insurance and remittances. And because many Mexicans have <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/12/10/mexicans-lack-access-to-credit">little trust</a> in banks, the transparency of fintech options has played a big part in people adopting the new technology.</p>
<p>There are no signs that fintech in Mexico is slowing down. More than a year into the global remote revolution, now is a good time to reflect on the country’s fintech journey, the local players that are having the biggest impact and what lies ahead for the industry.</p>
<h2>Mexico has long nurtured its fintech ecosystem</h2>
<p>Mexico’s fintech success is no coincidence &#8211; it’s due to a combination of factors that have made the country a fertile space to create and grow fintech solutions. This natural evolution has enabled people to gradually become familiar with fintech as a safe and streamlined solution.</p>
<p>For one, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/625424/smartphone-user-penetration-in-mexico/#:~:text=Mexico%3A%20smartphone%20users%20as%20share%20of%20population%202015%2D2025&amp;text=In%202019%2C%2060%20percent%20of,revenue%20in%20Mexico%20in%202019.">smartphone usage</a> and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379973/mexico-internet-user-penetration/">internet penetration</a> have both significantly improved in Mexico over recent years, shaping a tech savvy population that has become accustomed to managing money through devices. Paired with people’s aversion to traditional banks, this tech literacy makes fintech an attractive alternative.</p>
<p>The country’s fintech law (<em>Ley Fintech</em>) came into effect in 2018 and set the parameters for crowdfunding, cryptocurrencies, and APIs, alongside detailing regulatory sandboxes for fintech products. The law has done wonders to promote a healthy fintech sphere where users are protected and investors are more active thanks to the safety net of regulatory framework. Currently, <a href="https://www.milenio.com/negocios/suman-52-fintechs-autorizadas-operar-mexico-cnbv">52 fintechs</a> have been authorized to operate under the law, while 38 more are pending approval. The law is expected to be developed further this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is set to announce new Pixel phones today. The company is holding an event at <strong>10 AM PT (1 PM in New York, 6 PM in London, 7 PM in Paris)</strong>. And you’ll be able to watch the event right here as the company is streaming it live.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WNarpiGz3Kk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/16/what-to-expect-from-apple-google-and-samsungs-big-events/">already said</a> that it plans to unveil its own Tensor chip for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The company has also shared a ton of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/google-gives-the-world-its-first-glimpse-of-the-pixel-6/">details</a> about the new phones.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219407" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Pixel 6 will have a matte aluminum finish and a 6.4-inch display. The Pro models will have a bigger, 6.7-inch display and a polished aluminum finish.</p>
<p>As for cameras, the regular Pixel 6 will have two camera sensors while the 6 Pro will feature three different camera sensors. And if you’ve seen a photo of those devices already, you already know that they feature a camera bump like you’ve never seen before.</p>
<p>But specifications only tell you one part of the story. It’s going to be important to listen to what Google has to say about chipset performances and camera features. We’ll discover all that during Google’s event.</p>

The agencies did not name did not name [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A joint advisory issued by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Security Agency (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/nsa/">NSA</a>) has warned that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">BlackMatter ransomware group</a> has targeted &#8220;multiple&#8221; organizations deemed critical infrastructure, including two organizations in the U.S. food and agriculture sector.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-291a">agencies did not name</a> did not name the victims, but Iowa New Cooperative, an Iowa-based farm service provider, was last month hit by a ransomware attack that saw hackers demand a $5.9 million ransom to unlock their systems. The attack was followed by a <a href="https://www.crystalvalley.coop/about-us/news/article/cyber-attack-update">similar attack</a> on Crystal Valley, a Minnesota-based farm supply and grain marketing cooperative.</p>
<p>The advisory provides an overview of the BlackMatter threat, its tactics (which includes the wiping of backup data stores and appliances, rather than encrypting them), detection signatures, and mitigation best practices. It also lends credence to the wider belief that BlackMatter might be a &#8220;possible rebrand&#8221; of the now-defunct DarkSide ransomware operation, which the FBI said was behind the attack on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Colonial+Pipeline+techcrunch&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Colonial Pipeline</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220291" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>BlackMatter provides ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) that allows other groups to rent its infrastructure, and taking a cut of the ransom if a victim pays. The advisory notes that BlackMatter ransom demands have ranged from $80,000 to $15 million in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The advisory urges organizations, particularly those in critical infrastructure, to shore up cybersecurity defenses and to follow security best practices, including the use of strong passwords and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a>. The three agencies also recommend keeping all operating systems up to date, using a host-based firewall, and ensuring all backup data is encrypted.</p>
<p>The agencies also urge any organization hit by a ransomware attack to report it immediately and to refuse to pay the hackers&#8217; ransom demands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities,&#8221; the three agencies warned. &#8220;Paying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim&#8217;s files will be recovered.&#8221;</p>
<p>BlackMatter has also hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">Japanese technology giant Olympus</a> that forced the shutdown of its European, Middle East and Africa network.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">TechCrunch Live</a> (formerly Extra Crunch Live) has been <em>incredibly</em> educational over the past few months. We&#8217;ve learned how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/stephanie-zhan-walks-through-the-rec-room-pitch-deck-that-won-sequoias-investment/">Rec Room&#8217;s pitch landed investment from Sequoia</a>, how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/craft-your-pitch-deck-around-that-one-thing-that-can-really-hook-an-investor/">Wheel crafted a pitch deck that hooked Tusk Venture&#8217;s Jordan Nof</a>, how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/how-retail-ziplines-series-a-pitch-deck-ticked-every-box-for-emergence-capital/">Retail Zipline ticked every box for Emergence Capital</a> and how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/ceo-shishir-mehrotra-and-investor-s-somasegar-reveal-what-sings-in-codas-pitch-doc/">Coda made their pitch doc sing for Madrona Capital</a>.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s plenty more where that came from.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is specifically designed to help founders build better venture-backed businesses. We do this by bringing together startup founders and the investors who back them to talk about what, specifically, helped close the deal. What metrics are the investors looking at? What questions did the founders answer that made the VCs want to learn more? How did the founders communicate their grand vision, and their step-by-step plan to getting there?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217550" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We cover all this &#8212; complete with a look at these companies&#8217; early pitch decks, and more &#8212; on TechCrunch Live. TechCrunch Live is also home to the TCL Pitch-off, where founders in the audience can get on our virtual stage to pitch their startup to our esteemed guests and get their live feedback.</p>
<p>As with any TechCrunch event, this weekly series also features networking so you can meet and greet other attendees.</p>
<p>The event goes down every Wednesday at noon PT/3pm ET, and is free to attend. Only TechCrunch+ members get access to the complete library of on-demand content, so if you haven&#8217;t yet already, sign up now!</p>
<p>And without any further ado, here is a look at the outstanding guests joining us on TechCrunch Live in November.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Storing great pools of data is an increasingly figured-out challenge. Between public clouds, and data lakes more specifically, you can stick oceans of corporate data in any number of places. But leveraging that data into something useful is another challenge altogether.</p>
<p>The analogy that data is this era&#8217;s oil is at best half-baked. Oil takes ages to form, while data doesn&#8217;t, for example. But where the data:oil comparison does work to a degree is that crude oil is not good for that many things by itself. You have to refine it to get the plethora of products that still power the modern world.</p>
<p>Data isn&#8217;t too different. And at the upcoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=datapanelpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=datapanelpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Sessions: SaaS on October 27</a> event we&#8217;re hosting a panel to dig more deeply into the matter. Barr Moses, co-founder and CEO of Monte Carlo, will join DataRobot CEO Dan Wright and Jenn Knight, co-founder and CTO at AgentSync, to guide us through the topic.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219477" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Monte Carlo helps companies with their data ingestion through a product-set called data <em>observability. </em>AgentSync sits inside the world of insurance data, helping pass key information regarding brokers between different parties. And DataRobot, recently valued at $6.25 billion per Crunchbase data, has built a data platform that combines AI, automation and machine learning into a single package, making machine learning more efficient.</p>
<p>So, we&#8217;ll have folks with deep knowledge regarding how to make sure data arrives, how to link data to other platforms and how to massage it deeply to better understand its contours.</p>
<p>With that collected panel, we&#8217;ll dig into two main themes. The first dealing with their companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why there are so many startups attacking the data market from different angles, and when we may see consolidation in the market for data-related products</li>
<li>Building platforms versus building more targeted solutions</li>
<li>What&#8217;s ahead for the data market that founders may not be aware of</li>
</ul>
<p>And some more in-market questions regarding how modern companies are leveraging data today:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>How effectively startups are using machine learning today, and corporations more generally</li>
<li>How data can lead to better customer understanding, if at all</li>
<li>The tension between greater data collection, and analysis and privacy</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be a blast. I can&#8217;t wait to host, as I am going to learn a lot. Tickets start at just $35, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=datapanelpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=datapanelpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book yours today</a> before prices go up at the door. See you there!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">John Diener, the CEO of an aquaculture nutrition and genetics company, would visit hundreds of shrimp farms as part of his job. But gradually he became frustrated by some of the environmentally unsustainable practices used in many locations. One night, his wife bought some frozen shrimp to cook for dinner and he realized the industry he was involved in was poised to affect the health of his own family. Why? Because the shrimp was from a country that is known to use antibiotics on its shrimp farms. He decided enough was enough, and set about building a new model for seafood.</p>
<p>The result was <a href="http://verticaloceans.blue">Vertical Oceans</a>, a startup that grows sustainable shrimp in huge &#8220;aqua towers&#8221;, which can be located inside cities, potentially in facilities that even look like buildings. The towers can incubate shrimp without chemicals or antibiotics, and out of season. And let’s remember, Shrimp is a $50 billion a year market globally.</p>
<p>Coming out of IndieBio, Vertical Oceans has now closed a $3.5 million seed round with Khosla Ventures. This would appear to be the first time a major Silicon Valley fund has invested directly in an aquaculture startup (as far we know). Khosla led the round at $3 million and <a href="https://sosv.com/">SOSV</a> followed their pro-rata for the remaining $500,000.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220298" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So far the startup has had 10 harvests in the last six months from its small proof of concept facility in Singapore to demonstrate the core biological concept works and can produce a good product.</p>
<p>Competition-wise, there are two companies in Singapore with vertical aquaculture systems &#8212; Universal Aquaculture and Apollo Aquaculture. There is an indoor system in the U.S. called Tru Shrimp, which is not specifically vertical farming but is developing a scalable indoor farming technology.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220314" style="width: 707px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220314" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2220314" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iHAB-ISO-Cover.jpg" alt="Vertical Oceans tanks" width="697" height="330" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iHAB-ISO-Cover.jpg 697w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iHAB-ISO-Cover.jpg?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iHAB-ISO-Cover.jpg?resize=300,142 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iHAB-ISO-Cover.jpg?resize=680,322 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iHAB-ISO-Cover.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220314" class="wp-caption-text">Vertical Oceans tanks. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vertical Oceans</p></div></p>
<p>Diener says: “Our product tastes like fresh shrimp from the ocean, that&#8217;s really hard to achieve consistently in a recirculating aquaculture system. Because our product is so high-quality and fresh, we can sell on par with fresh wild-caught versus farmed frozen shrimp. This higher price more than offsets the costs of going vertical and urban.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since its earliest days, the Portal line has been plagued by one major question: why? Not so much why did Facebook make it (for that I give you the following: $$$), but rather, why should people be interested, given Amazon and Google’s respective head starts in both the smart assistant and display categories?</p>
<p>In addition to its integration with Facebook services, Portal’s original standout feature was smart panning, which used object detection to reframe its subjects. It was a clever addition &#8212; if not necessarily enough to justify purchasing a Facebook-produced product over the competition. Since then, however, Google, Amazon and even Apple have introduced their own versions of the technology, removing Facebook’s edge.</p>

<p>While the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/facebook-adds-a-battery-powered-smart-screen-to-the-portal-line/">Portal Go</a> doesn’t address the larger question of why, it does once again showcase Facebook’s ability to think outside the smart screen box by adding portability to the mix. Honestly, it’s one of those things I’m surprised the competition hasn’t gotten on board with. Amazon discontinued its portable Bluetooth speaker, the Tap, some time ago.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you’d have look to an Alexa-enabled Fire tablet or third-party devices for a similarly portable solution. Otherwise, the Amazon and Google solution has effectively been convincing users to simply stick a device in every room in which they plan to use it. Personally, I’ve always wondering why they’ve not embraced the flexibility of a battery-powered model.</p>
<p>The Go was built with portability in mind, right down to the inclusion of a built-in handle on the rear of the device. It’s a reasonably light three pounds (compared to, say, the 4.7-pound MacBook Pro that Apple just launched). Does anyone need a smart screen they can take with them? Certainly no more than anyone needs a smart screen period, but there’s a lot to be said for flexibility. For a device primarily designed for video, it’s genuinely nice to be able to pick it up and take it with you.</p>

<p>The key to this is a built-in battery and wireless charging. The latter relies on a proprietary three-pin charging pad with a USB-C plug on the other side. The charger may be my biggest complaint about product design here. I understand why Facebook decided not to go hardwired here, so you can simply pick it up and go without unplugging. But a wired charging option would have been nice, letting you top that battery up faster. At the very least, it would be great to have a charging pad that snaps into place magnetically, because it’s a pain getting the pins aligned to charge the thing.</p>

<p>The display is a 10-inch touchscreen, with 1280 x 800 resolution. Nothing to write home about there, but certainly adequate for a vast majority of what you need to do on this thing, from teleconferencing to watching bite-sized videos through Facebook. That’s coupled with a 12-megapixel front-facing camera and a four-mic array. Again, this isn’t going to compete with the teleconference setup you invested in when the world went to hell and all meetings went virtual, but it’s perfectly fine for calling family or even taking the occasional work meeting. The fabric-covered back of the device houses two rear-facing speakers and a woofer. The sound isn’t great. It&#8217;s a bit muffled. Not something I would use in everyday music listening, but it works in a pinch.</p>
<p>The device is chunkier than most smart displays. It’s got rounded corners and a sizable bezel, wrapped in a fabric covering that’s standard fare for home products these days. In fact, the design is something of a cross between an Echo or Nest-style home product and something targeted toward kids. The latter lends it a kind of robustness you’d want out of a portable product like this.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218427" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218427" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2218427" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218427" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It’s not rugged exactly, but it can probably handle the occasional accidental knocks and bumps better than, say, the Nest Home. That, combined with some of the storybook content, may make the Go better suited than most for a setting with younger kids around. There’s a physical shutter that slides over the front-facing camera. If you’re like me, you’re probably going to keep that on 90% of the time &#8212; essentially any time I’m not making a call. That doesn’t disable the microphone, but a circular button sitting next to the volume keys will. Clicking that will take the camera and microphone offline, denoted with a red light.</p>
<p>For Facebook calling in particular, the thing is a cinch. Say, “hey Portal, call such and such,” and it will show you a name and ask if it found the right person. This is really the heart of the product, offering a device specifically tailored to the sorts of conversations you would have through Facebook Messenger. You can add filters and watch videos or read story books together. The device’s strength has always been in these shared experiences, built specifically around Facebook&#8217;s software.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220179" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220179" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2220179 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg" alt="" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220179" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>There are shared storybooks, good for grandparents connecting remotely with grandkids. The selection of filters in the Facebook Messenger app is just okay. They’ll add funny hats and occasionally distort your voice, but aren’t really aimed at, say, smoothing perceived flaws, for better or worse. I found that they struggled a bit on slower Wi-Fi, ditto for the Facebook Watch videos &#8212; in some cases there was a lag, which can ruin the effect a bit.</p>
<p>The app selection beyond Facebook is limited. Spotify, Tidal, Deezer and Pandora are nice. The Go works as a portable Bluetooth speaker with a built-in display. I found myself turning off the camera, bringing it into the bedroom and listening to music by interacting with Spotify on the touchscreen. You’ve got a decent selection on the teleconferencing front, including Zoom, WebEx and Blue Jeans. It’s not a catchall, but that should cover a decent number of work meetings.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220178" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220178" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2220178" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220178" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It handles these well &#8212; in fact, that, combined with portability, is probably the most compelling use case of the bunch. The leading smart displays all have some compatibility with third-party teleconferencing apps, but it’s nice being able to move it around and not have to worry about finding an outlet if you don’t want to be stuck to your desk all day.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the app selection is bare-boned. There are a couple of news and cooking apps, while popular third-party services like YouTube are available as browser shortcuts. If you want to, say, watch Netflix, you can visit the site in the browser and watch it that way. Ultimately, much of it comes down to that. If you’re all in on Facebook apps (and all of the complications that brings), then one of these is probably the device for you.</p>
<p>On the portability side, there’s isn’t really any direct competition to the Go at the moment. The product doesn’t answer the broader questions of “why” for the Portal line, but at least it addresses the &#8220;where.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sixteen years in and now valued at $7.5 billion, Automattic has found a multitude of strides, even as it strives to own ever more of the media market.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s hard to build a publishing empire, and it&#8217;s just as easy to lose one. Newspaper magnates were mostly replaced by broadcast moguls, first radio and then TV and cable, and now of course, they are all fighting against the social media tycoons and streaming impresarios who want to capture our attention. Each generation of media titans dies off and is replaced, just as each medium finds its niche only to be supplanted by something novel.</p>
<p>So when it comes to <b>Automattic</b>, the leading commercial complement to the open-source <b>WordPress</b> publishing platform, time and longevity have a rather peculiar meaning in an industry littered with the gravestones of media sites of yore. Founded in 2005, the company continues to assiduously evolve and expand as it staves off that ambient and inclement sense of doom that pervades media.</p>
<p>Sixteen years in and now valued at $7.5 billion, Automattic has found a multitude of strides, even as it strives to own ever more of the media market. It’s a publisher, a social media network via its acquisition of Tumblr, an e-commerce giant with WooCommerce, a productivity tool with P2, and more. It reached this peak doing pretty much everything wrong, according to VCs, a strategy, as we will see, that proved to be exponentially effective in the long run.</p>
<p>The lead writer for this TC-1 (our slightly rechristened EC-1 to match our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/">TechCrunch+ rebrand</a>) is <b>Chris Morrison</b>. Chris has been among our most productive analysts of breakthrough companies, profiling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/roblox-ec1/">Roblox</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1/">Klaviyo</a> in previous entries of this series. In addition to writing and analyzing, he’s an independent game developer and brings his expertise in business development and engineering to bear in understanding Automattic and its open source focus. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b> and illustrations were created by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>Morrison has no financial ties to Automattic or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nothing has been automatic about the success of <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>.</p>
<p>Today, to those who haven’t been paying attention, the company looks a bit like an overnight success story. WordPress, the open source software behind the company, is now estimated to power roughly 42% of all websites on the internet. Automattic’s e-commerce plugin, <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/19/automattic-buys-woocommerce-the-popular-plugin-for-turning-wordpress-into-a-store/">which it purchased in 2015</a>, is believed to run more than a quarter of all online storefronts.</p>
<p>The company has 1,700 employees in a distributed, asynchronous, global workforce, and has raised nearly $1 billion, according to Crunchbase, <a href="https://ma.tt/2021/08/funding-buyback-hiring/">most recently at a $7.5 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_999732" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-999732" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-999732 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><p id="caption-attachment-999732" class="wp-caption-text">Automattic founder and CEO Matt Mullenweg at TechCrunch Disrupt 2014. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>But reaching this point has taken 16 years — or 18, if you count from the founding of WordPress. And over those many years, the company did pretty much everything wrong, if you ask the venture capitalists.</p>
<p>Automattic focused on media at a time when that industry was being demolished by the internet. It eschewed the kinds of walled gardens that turned Facebook, Apple and Google into monopolistic powerhouses and built its business on top of a volunteer-run, open source infrastructure that gave many investors serious pause.</p>
<p>Its workforce has always been fully remote and distributed — 16 years before last year’s pandemic spread that model throughout the corporate world. Automattic’s founder, Matt Mullenweg, was barely of American legal drinking age (21) when he began building, at a time when venture capitalists wanted “adult supervision” at their companies.</p>
<p>But in retrospect, doing everything wrong was exactly the right strategy — a fact that’s just now becoming apparent.</p>
<p>“With exponential growth, things look small until the end,” says Mullenweg. In his reckoning, Automattic isn’t yet close to the end, but the curve is starting to become visible.</p>
<p>It all began with a blog post.</p>
<h2>The jazz saxophonist who started a weblog revolution</h2>
<p>Massive changes often begin as ephemeral, uncertain ideas. The technology is unstable and experimental; the audience unclear; and the commercial applications murky or completely unknown.</p>
<p>Back in 2003, that was the context for the so-called weblog, which would shortly be elided to blog. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2003/02/why-did-google-want-blogger/">Blogger had just sold itself to Google</a> — for an undisclosed and presumably small price. The year before, political bloggers at Instapundit and Talking Points Memo had shaken up American politics when <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/12/blogs-make-the-headlines/">they managed to intensify attention on a story about Trent Lott</a>, forcing his resignation as the minority leader in the U.S. Senate. Yet, traditional media remained the undisputed king of communication, and the era of professional blogs (including the one you’re reading) was still a distant dream.</p>
<p>One early adopter was Matt Mullenweg, a 19-year-old jazz enthusiast in Texas. In a blog post that’s <a href="https://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">still online</a>, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>My logging software hasn’t been updated for months, and the main developer has disappeared, and I can only hope that he’s okay.</p>
<p>What to do?</p></blockquote>
<p>Mullenweg himself didn’t necessarily look like the person to come up with a solution. His interests were eclectic and wide-ranging — while he imagined himself as a future jazz saxophonist, he was also studying political science at the University of Houston, and spent a good deal of his time working on his photography (to this day, Mullenweg’s Twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt">@photomatt</a>). His tech hobbies, including open source software, were inspired by his father’s job as a professional programmer, but Mullenweg didn’t yet seem certain about following his father&#8217;s profession.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his post got the attention of a few other developers and the group set out to create the open source <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress project</a>, focused on blog publishing. The first version of WordPress was <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2003/05/wordpress-now-available/">released</a> in May 2003 and became the official version of b2, an older project that had been abandoned.</p>
<p>Mullenweg became the center point of a growing community. An October 2004 Houston Press <a href="https://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-blog-age-6574261">profile</a> of him noted that WordPress was running more than 29,000 blogs. Mullenweg’s own blog was the third most popular in the world, and all the attention he received resulted in an offer to leave college and become a senior product manager at CNET, a San Francisco media company. WordPress, though, was still referred to as a &#8220;hobby.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The good side of spam</h2>
<p>CNET turned out to be the perfect employer. The company’s job offer allowed Mullenweg to spend 20% of his time working on WordPress and also let him retain ownership of source code he wrote while at the company. The role also gave him an inside view of the internal systems of a large media organization.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The tech industry has made a full 180-degree turn with regard to open source in the 16 years since Matt Mullenweg founded Automattic, the commercial backer of open source CMS, WordPress.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The tech industry has made a full 180-degree turn with regard to open source in the 16 years since Matt Mullenweg founded <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, a major commercial backer of open source content management system <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft, whose executives once used phrases like “un-American” and “cancer” to describe open source, is now one of the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3121792/whos-no-1-in-open-source-microsoft.html">world’s largest contributors</a>. Elastic, Confluent and GitLab have proven that startups, too, can layer commercial success on top of open source projects.</p>
<p>Even true believers can be shocked by the extent to which open source has succeeded. “To me, one of the most incredible examples of this is Chromium being used not just by Brave, but by Internet Explorer,” Mullenweg, who is also CEO of Automattic, said. “That&#8217;s the tech equivalent of peace in the Middle East — it felt so far away and unimaginable.”</p>
<p>WordPress and Automattic are key leaders in this trend. WordPress remains a vibrant project: Around a thousand active “core” contributors engineer the product, while a massive, 55,000-strong group of “extender” contributors builds themes and plugins that expand the platform’s functionality. The more than <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/WordPress">28 million</a> WordPress sites represent about <a href="https://w3techs.com/blog/entry/40_percent_of_the_web_uses_wordpress">40%</a> of the web, making the project among the most deployed open source platforms.</p>
<p>Mullenweg, however, views all of this as merely a starting point. In his reckoning, WordPress could double its current scale in the coming years, a proposition that can make even the most bullish open source software engineer nervous.</p>
<p>To get there, Automattic has to shepherd and evolve its developer community even as it empowers more and more of its open source contributors to take leadership roles in the future of the WordPress ecosystem. That hasn’t always gone well, as we will see with a transition around a new version of WordPress called Gutenberg, but ultimately, the company is doubling down on community engagement, hoping that growth in the next 16 years of Automattic will be even faster than the last era.</p>
<h2>One company that doesn’t rule them all</h2>
<p>Both large and small companies contribute back code and time to the community, often following some version of Mullenweg’s <a href="https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/">Five for the Future</a> initiative, which asks organizations using WordPress to spend 5% of their resources contributing to its further development.</p>

<p>Automattic may be the largest contributor in the WordPress community, but there are many other companies who lend to the success of the ecosystem. The largest are mostly domain registrars such as GoDaddy and Bluehost, which use their lead generation from registrations to upsell customers on WordPress hosting.</p>
<p>Scores of other companies round out the ecosystem. Most are small design agencies and paid plugin developers, such as <a href="https://yoast.com/">Yoast</a>, a search engine optimization tool that has over 5 million users.</p>
<p>Then there are the thousands of individual contributors. Contrary to the perception that open source developers work exclusively for free, most open source communities include the concept of “sponsorship,” in which a commercial company like Automattic underwrites an open source developer to keep working on the project full time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020FOSSContributorSurveyReport_121020.pdf">In its annual open source contributor survey from 2020</a>, the Linux Foundation and The Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard found that more than half of core and frequent contributors to open source projects were financed for their work, either by their current employer or by a third party. That proportion is actually lower for WordPress, where only about a third of developers are believed to be sponsored.</p>
<h2>Founding privilege</h2>
<p>While thousands of individuals and companies contribute to the development of WordPress, it’s clear that Automattic plays the lead role in shaping the community, even though many paid contributors to the project are not even sponsored by the company.</p>
<p>One of the founding strengths of WordPress is that it was conceived without immediate commercial intent. The project started two years before Automattic, as we saw in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-origin/">part one</a> of this TC-1, so no company’s leadership was written into the project’s creation. Mullenweg was simply a co-founder of the project, albeit one of its most active public cheerleaders.</p>
<p>Even after Automattic launched, a few other startups seemed poised to lead the community. Hosting service <a href="https://wpengine.com">WP Engine</a>, for instance, was founded in 2010 and grew quickly, raising nearly $300 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wp-engine">according to Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>Automattic gained one sustainable advantage early on, however: It successfully secured the WordPress.com domain as a as a counterpart to the open source project’s WordPress.org. That ownership gave Automattic symbolic and long-lasting weight within the community.</p>
<p>“Because we were the first to do it, we had the name, and our service took off. The copies sat there for a while and gave up,” recalls Toni Schneider, who served as Automattic’s CEO during the company’s early years.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[WooCommerce began life as WooThemes, a small design firm that didn’t look very different from the many others that created WordPress themes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite Automattic’s respected position, awareness of its myriad businesses tends to be spotty.</p>
<p>“I spend a lot of time with investors, press and research analysts, and I&#8217;m always stunned that people say, ‘We know WordPress.’ But they don&#8217;t know Woo,” says Mark Davies, Automattic’s chief financial officer, referring to the company’s <a href="https://woocommerce.com">WooCommerce</a> subsidiary. “It&#8217;s always interesting when we say we&#8217;re doing $30 billion of payments volume through Woo and Automattic.”</p>
<p>Why should they care? For starters, WooCommerce is used by <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/shop/">more sites than Shopify</a> — which those same investors, press and analysts definitely know about.</p>
<p>It’s also the lifeline that Automattic needs this decade to rebuild the internet in an open direction. Sixteen years after its founding, the company has seen its valuation grow rapidly from $3 billion with a round led by Salesforce in 2019 to <a href="https://ma.tt/2021/08/funding-buyback-hiring/">$7.5 billion with a share buyback a few months ago</a>. That growth has been predicated on expanding beyond its traditional remit of publishing into the hugely lucrative terrain of e-commerce, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/automattics-bargain-bin-tumblr-deal-plugs-right-into-the-wordpress-business-model/">through its acquisition of Tumblr</a>.</p>
<p>The strategy here is simple: Continue opening up larger swaths of the internet to open-source innovation outside of the walled-garden platforms developed by Amazon and Facebook. If Automattic’s strategy works out, Woo, Tumblr and WordPress will link to new services that nobody yet associates with Automattic.</p>
<p>It’s an audacious vision, but the company is setting itself up for a battle against some of the most formidable — and deeply pocketed — companies in the tech world.</p>
<h2>From custom themes to billions in payments volume</h2>

<p>WooCommerce began life as WooThemes, a small design firm that didn’t look very different from the many others that created WordPress themes. In 2011, the company expanded to build themes for online stores.</p>
<p>“They&#8217;d spotted an opportunity where a lot of the themes they were selling were more commerce oriented, so they hired some guys they were incubating for a commerce platform, brought them into the team, and that quickly overtook the company for the lion&#8217;s share of attention,” says Paul Maiorana, the current CEO of WooCommerce, a subsidiary of Automattic.</p>
<p>Despite WooCommerce’s popularity (its plugin was among the top 10 most popular for WordPress), its success was mostly contained within the broader WordPress ecosystem. When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/19/automattic-buys-woocommerce-the-popular-plugin-for-turning-wordpress-into-a-store/">Automattic acquired WooCommerce in 2015</a>, the move went mostly unnoticed in the broader tech community.</p>

<p>WooCommerce still had less than 100 employees, and it didn’t appear to be a significant buy. E-commerce, while obviously growing, had yet to reach stratospheric highs.</p>
<p>Internally at Automattic, there were uncertainties over whether WooCommerce was worth the purchase, the value of which was never disclosed but was described to TechCrunch at the time as “the biggest acquisition by Automattic to date.”</p>
<p>“Even at the board level, we honestly asked if we should even be doing this. Everyone is saying this is a bad idea and you can&#8217;t compete with Amazon,” recalls Matt Mullenweg, Automattic’s founder and CEO. The counter view was that it was important for Automattic to cover all its bases. “Our ambitions are incredibly broad, and we take a very long-term view.”</p>
<p>Before long, WooCommerce was exploding in size, and the acquisition proved to be one of the most important decisions Automattic had ever made. “I&#8217;d call it a significant moment, like the birth of a child,” says Mullenweg.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s impossible to talk about <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> without talking about remote work. The company is a role model and innovator in this area: It has been entirely remote since 2005, and at 1,700 employees, it has helped prove that a remote workplace culture can succeed at scale.</p>
<p>But “remote” has taken on a different meaning than it denoted two years ago. Since COVID-19 began, companies that never planned on working remotely have moved millions of employees online. Zoom’s video meeting minutes <a href="https://backlinko.com/zoom-users">grew 30x</a> as employers made a mad dash to replicate physical offices within virtual meeting rooms. Initial studies have shown that <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/study-microsoft-employees-shows-remote-work-puts-productivity-innovation-risk/">productivity declined</a> as a result.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s why Automattic rejects the word “remote” entirely. Instead, its leaders use words like “distributed” and “asynchronous.” There is no online analogue to an office; indeed, Automattic doesn’t even require that employees know what each other’s faces look like.</p>
<p>At its most basic level, Automattic’s model isn’t about remote work at all. Instead, it’s about how the company is structured, from its management, to its communication style, right down to its hiring process.</p>
<h2>No more meetings</h2>
<p>I got a peek into just how different Automattic is from ordinary companies while scheduling one of the interviews for this article. Usually, finding a good time with interviewees involves hunting through a packed schedule for the few morsels of time available. A busy executive might have two or three openings during a week with every other slot filled.</p>
<p>Instead, when Monica Ohara, chief marketing officer of WordPress.com, sent me her Calendly link, I saw a wide open schedule. Ohara, by all appearances, wasn’t doing much work. When I asked about it, she laughed.</p>
<p>“It’s the thing I think is really broken with normal office work,” she said. “Your meeting calendar was a badge of honor and having so many meetings meant you were so important. That&#8217;s not a paradigm here.”</p>
<p>Instead, most communication is written and asynchronous — meaning that it can be addressed anytime during the work day.</p>
<h2>A CMS for a CMS company</h2>
<p>Automattic’s replacement for meetings and most office collaboration is <a href="https://wordpress.com/p2/">P2</a>, a modification of WordPress that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/wordpress-com-launches-new-p2-to-take-on-internal-communication-tools/">it announced in August 2020 at the height of the pandemic</a> and offers as a paid service.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4jgnalGM1f"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/wordpress-com-launches-new-p2-to-take-on-internal-communication-tools/">WordPress.com launches new P2 to take on internal communication tools</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;WordPress.com launches new P2 to take on internal communication tools&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/wordpress-com-launches-new-p2-to-take-on-internal-communication-tools/embed/#?secret=4jgnalGM1f" data-secret="4jgnalGM1f" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A P2 post looks more or less like a blog post, with threaded discussions, the ability to follow replies and a Like button. Whenever employees want to discuss anything with distant colleagues — for instance, a coder in the United States who wants to share something with a designer in South Africa who’s asleep at the time — they can write about it on the company’s P2 instance. Anyone else who is potentially interested can find the same post with a search or through various discovery features built into the platform.</p>

<p>Documentation is the order of the day, up to and including information that would be hidden at other companies.</p>
<p>“You need to be extremely transparent. Matt [Mullenweg, Automattic’s founder and CEO] posts what he&#8217;s working on. I post what I&#8217;m working on,” said Mark Davies, Automattic’s CFO, who previously worked at smart home platform Vivint, which operated as a much more traditional company. “When I came here for the first time, I had a board meeting, and I said, ‘Let&#8217;s get to work.’ They said, ‘No way, you need to post the board deck and what the decisions were.’ I said, ‘You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me!.&#8217;”</p>
<p>P2 isn’t the only communication method at Automattic — the company also uses software like Slack and Jira. Nonetheless, all the company’s tools share a common thread of asynchronicity: You have colleagues across the world, so don’t expect an immediate reply.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;d think that things could move slower here, but they really don&#8217;t. I think in offices, there&#8217;s also this perception that you have to be in-person. People are saving things up for their one-on-one or meeting when they could have sent an email,” said Ohara. “Here, I&#8217;ll often wake up and find out there&#8217;s lots happening in Europe that I need to catch up on versus us having to wait a week or two to get a conference room.”</p>
<p>Documenting everything and allowing employees to consume only what they need saves time. “I spend a lot more time communicating and a lot less time listening and sitting in reviews,” said Davies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Headlines from China concerning its technology market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">haven’t been kind in recent months</a>. Not that they have been unfair.</p>
<p>The Chinese technology market has been rocked by a wave of regulatory actions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/chinese-crackdown-on-tech-giants-threatens-its-cloud-market-growth/">in recent quarters</a> that changed the business landscape amid crackdowns by the country’s government on other areas of national activity. Tech titans were hit with fines and business model shakeups &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">business model <i>terminations,</i> in the case of many edtech companies</a> &#8212; while certain cultural items like <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/behind-china-s-crackdown-on-k-pop-and-fan-clubs/ar-AAOhdUf">celebrity fan culture</a> and <a href="https://qz.com/2072074/china-seeks-full-news-monopoly-by-banning-private-capital-in-media/">media were also taken to task</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>You might imagine that a broad push by a central government to more control both its national economy and mind wouldn&#8217;t be conducive to overall startup fundraising and activity. And yet.</p>
<p>When The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/vcs-unfazed-by-chinese-regulatory-shakeups-so-far/">recently looked into the Chinese venture capital market</a> in the wake of some of its national government’s regulatory actions, things appeared surprisingly stable. Since then, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">data from CB Insights covering the full Q3 period</a> has made an even stronger case: Putting aside a single outsized 2018 round, the third quarter of 2021 was the best three-month period for Chinese startups ever.</p>
<p>And not just in the value of the rounds they raised &#8212; they also raised more rounds.</p>

But that’s what makes data useful: No matter what you expect, what actually happened will set your thinking straight.</p>
<p>This morning, we’re digging into the data, looking at leading rounds to better understand where the money is going, and &#8212; with some help from TechBuzzChina’s Chinese technology analyst and angel investor, <a href="https://twitter.com/ruima">Rui Ma</a> &#8212; trying to get our heads around what’s going on.</p>
<p>Let’s talk China!</p>
<h2>China’s monster Q3</h2>
<p>Sure, the value of Alibaba stock fell from a 52-week high of $319.32 per share to just $166.82. Didi dropped from a recent local maxim of $18.01 to $8.24. And the value of Tencent Music collapsed from $32.25 &#8212; its last 52-week high &#8212; to just $7.72 per share (all data via Yahoo Finance).</p>
<p>But leading tech companies&#8217; plummeting stock prices have done seemingly nothing to blunt interest in Chinese technology startups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bluepallet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BluePallet</a>, an online marketplace connecting manufacturers with the chemical industry, announced today that it has raised $5 million in a funding round led by Vinmar Ventures, a subsidiary of petrochemical manufacturer Vinmar International. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also announced today that it has become the first industrial commerce platform to “officially” operate on Alibaba.com. This means that BluePallet’s network of chemical manufacturers and distributors will be exposed to millions of business buyers from around the world who source supply on the e-commerce site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing brings BluePallet’s total raised to $10 million and included participation from chemical industry veterans Terry Hill, Barentz CEO of North America; Mathew Brainerd, CEO of Brainerd Chemical Co.; and Bruce Schechinger, former chairman of the National Association of Chemical Distributors. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219907" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BluePallet was founded in 2020 through the merger of then three-year-old chemical marketplace EchoSystem and Velloci, a fintech company. BluePallet’s goal is to apply its “market network model” to modernize trade and transactions for a massive industry that has historically lagged when it comes to technology. (I should know, I covered the petrochemical industry in the late 1990s).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chemical industry is not considered a sexy one, but it supports many other sectors that we all depend on, such as the manufacturing of everyday consumer products, pharmaceuticals and agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BluePallet says its e-commerce model offers industrial buyers and sellers access to a broader marketplace while at the same time “strictly adhering” to the requirements of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulatory compliance and responsible distribution</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It claims that it&#8217;s able to give buyers and sellers more control over their supply chain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BluePallet site offers three products: TradeHub &#8212; a permission-based marketplace where users can find and list products with networking tools; TradePass &#8212; a “proprietary” business verification technology that aims to ensure “network integrity” by reviewing thousands of operational, commercial and financial risk data points on “a continual basis”; and TradeCart &#8212; a proprietary checkout system that integrates payment processing, authentication and logistics. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with the financing, BluePallet is also announcing that it is relocating its headquarters from Chicago to Austin, Texas. The reasoning behind this is closer proximity to Houston, which is home to a robust chemical industry, and to be able to take advantage of Austin’s “vibrant tech and entrepreneurial scene.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BluePallet CEO Scott Barrows, who had founded EchoSystems, said the raise represents validation for its offering. (Barrows previously co-founded ticketing platforms Epic Seats and ZeroHero, which is today used by LiveNationand TicketMaster). He co-founded BluePallet with Austin Britts, Kevin Fuller and Brian Perrott. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we continue to grow, we are setting our eyes to the East and aim to quickly establish a regional presence in Asia,” he added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asia Pacific is the largest region in the global chemicals market, accounting for 49% of the $3.34 trillion industry in 2020. North America is the second-largest region and accounts for 17% of the market. Because BluePallet is partnered with the NACD with access to its 750,000 member companies, Barrows believes the startup has significant room to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re really challenging and pushing the realms of what can be done in these B2B transactions,” he told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the company works to build its marketing network platform, it has attempted to partner with existing fintech companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We found that even the biggest ones had a max of $100,000 per transaction, or that they would not want to do business with the chemical industry, which is crazy,” Barrows told TechCrunch. “So we decided we’re going to go solve this problem for the $5 trillion chemical industry, and build this technology ourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what Barrows believes is a strong differentiator, he says that BluePallet is able to handle transactions of up to $1 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now that we can move money in this way, we’re building into more and more international markets,” he said. “We think this is the key, and that’s missing in a lot of these new offerings by a lot of startups.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also emphasizes that BluePallet is more than a “matchmaker.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most other sites are literally just matchmakers and that’s it,” he said. “They have no ability to actually complete a transaction and instead make the parties go complete the transaction offline. So this is really going to change and improve the way that people in the industry are doing commerce.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram today announced a number of new features that will roll out this week across both the Instagram Feed and its TikTok competitor, Reels. The creator-focused additions will allow users to collaborate with one another, raise funds and make better use of music on Reels, among other things. The company will also make its Instagram desktop website more usable, by allowing people to finally be able to post both photos and videos less than one minute in length using their desktop web browser.</p>
<p>The latter has been a long-requested new feature, the company notes, and will become available to global audiences as of Thursday, October 21.</p>
<p>The company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/instagram-post-from-desktop/">previously tested the feature</a> this summer, but it was not widely available.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220189" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2220230" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220230" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220230" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="417" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png 3504w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=768,471 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=680,417 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=1536,942 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=2048,1255 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220230" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>The other new features will drop throughout the week, starting today with &#8220;Collabs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instagram describes this feature as a &#8220;test,&#8221; explaining that it will allow people to co-author both Feed posts and Reels. To do so, users can invite another account to be a collaborator from the tagging screen on Instagram. If the other person accepts, both accounts will appear in the post or the Reels header and content will be shared to both sets of followers. Although Instagram is only announcing the test today, many Instagram users have already spotted the feature in the app, as the company <a href="https://twitter.com/vishalshahis/status/1417884832323964930">began a small-scale global test</a> of this feature back in July.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/3) Collaborating is a huge part of how people connect on Instagram. To make that easier, we’re testing a new way for people to co-author Feed Posts and Reels, called Collab. <a href="https://t.co/YD1SaSYHOl">pic.twitter.com/YD1SaSYHOl</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Vishal Shah (@vishalshahis) <a href="https://twitter.com/vishalshahis/status/1417884832323964930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At the time, Instagram said only a small number of people would have access to the feature, and it didn&#8217;t indicate when it would roll out more broadly.</p>
<p>When two creators choose to collab, the post or Reel will appear on both their Profile Grids and it will have a shared view count, like count and comment thread, Instagram says.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Instagram will also begin to test a new way to create fundraisers for nonprofits, with the introduction of a feature that lets you start the fundraiser directly from the creation button (the &#8220;+&#8221; plus button at the top right of the screen.). When you tap this option, instead of selecting Post, Story, Reels or Live, you&#8217;ll see an option to select a nonprofit and add the fundraiser to your Feed post.</p>
<p>Instagram has supported fundraisers for some time, even adding support for nonprofit fundraising during livestreams last year. But it hadn&#8217;t before offered a way to create a fundraiser from a standalone spot right from your Instagram profile.</p>
<p>This feature had been spotted ahead of this week&#8217;s launch by developer and reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1439196528367779845">Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, who found the new fundraiser button in development back in September.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Instagram</a> is working on adding the &quot;Fundraiser&quot; option to the Create menu <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/Od4dcdkHaO">pic.twitter.com/Od4dcdkHaO</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1439196528367779845?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Two other new additions are meant to enhance Instagram Reels, when used with music.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Instagram will introduce two new effects called Superbeat and Dynamic Lyrics, which will help creators who edit and perform using music on Reels. Superbeat will intelligently apply special effects to music to the beat of the user&#8217;s song while Dynamic Lyrics will display 3D lyrics that will flow with the song&#8217;s &#8220;groove,&#8221; says Instagram.</p>
<p>These new features follow TikTok&#8217;s rollout of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/as-competition-heats-up-tiktok-announces-six-new-interactive-music-effects-for-creators/">half dozen interactive music effects</a> back in April, including several that add visual effects synced to the beat of a song. Reels, meanwhile, has offered a much more limited selection of first-party creative effects until now, instead relying on its community to expand its library beyond the basics like a timer or speed adjustment tool, for instance.</p>
<p>The Reels features will arrive alongside posting from the desktop, which Instagram says will be limited to photos and videos less than one minute in length. The company this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/instagram-ditches-the-igtv-brand-combines-everything-but-reels-into-an-instagram-video-format/">dropped its IGTV brand</a> for long-form video, but still allows for videos up to 60 minutes. That&#8217;s now just considered &#8220;Instagram Video&#8221; &#8212; a term that includes anything that&#8217;s not video in a Story or in Reels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Human Landing System saga is far from over.</p>
<p>Senators on Monday released <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CJSRept_Final.PDF">a draft version of the appropriation bill</a> that governs NASA’s budget for fiscal year 2022, directing the agency to select two teams for the Human Landing System (HLS) program &#8212; but only giving the agency an additional $100 million to do so.</p>
<p>The total funding for the program would stand at $1.295 billion, with NASA receiving an overall budget of $24.83 billion for the next fiscal year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220252" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Using this funding, NASA is expected to ensure redundancy and competition, including robust support for research, development, testing, and evaluation for no fewer than two HLS Teams,” the draft bill says. “The [Senate appropriations] Committee expects real investments in development rather than additional studies.”</p>
<p>The directive is clear. What’s not clear is how NASA expects the agency to fund two HLS teams without a commensurate increase in funding.</p>
<p>First, a little refresher: The HLS is a critical part of NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time since the Apollo space program days. Back in April, NASA selected Elon Musk’s SpaceX &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">and only SpaceX</a> &#8212; to develop the landing vehicle for astronauts under Artemis. The company beat out defense contractor Dynetics and Blue Origin, which developed a “national team” that included aerospace primes Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper, for the award.</p>
<p>In the past, NASA had generally operated by choosing at least two vendors to encourage competition, and as a hedge in case one company’s project doesn’t pan out. That was how it operated with the Commercial Crew program for the International Space Station, when NASA awarded both SpaceX and Boeing contracts to build astronaut transport spacecraft. So, it’s fair to say that the agency did veer from historical precedent in selecting only SpaceX.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since April, Blue Origin has mounted a campaign protesting NASA’s decision, first by disputing the contract award to government watchdog the Government Accountability Office and then &#8212; when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/feds-dismantle-blue-origin-and-dynetics-protests-of-nasas-spacex-lunar-lander-award/">GAO rejected the company’s protest</a> &#8212; via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-goes-toe-to-toe-with-nasa-in-federal-court-over-award-to-spacex/">a complaint filed in a federal claims court</a>.</p>
<p>NASA maintains that it selected SpaceX because the company offered the most robust lander proposal at the lowest price, given budgetary constraints: only $2.9 billion, compared to the price tags of Blue Origin’s proposal ($5.9 billion) and Dynetics ($9 billion). Given the significant difference in cost between the three proposals, it’s unclear how the Senate’s increase to the HLS program &#8211;which is only $100 million &#8212; will enable NASA to select an additional team.</p>
<p>NASA administrator Bill Nelson seems confident that the agency will eventually get the funding it needs. “I think at the end of the day, after all the shouting is over, after all the pushing and tugging, a lot of which has nothing to do with NASA, you will see that NASA will have the funds that it needs,” <a href="https://spacenews.com/nelson-remains-confident-on-nasa-funding-for-artemis/">he said in an interview with SpaceNews</a>,</p>
<p>According to the bill, “having at least two teams providing services […] should be the end goal of the current development program.” If this version of the bill makes it into the final budget &#8212; which is unclear, as it would still need to be negotiated with the House &#8212; NASA would have 30 days to explain to Congress and the public how it plans to comply with the new directive.</p>
