										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Car enthusiasts have a history of electric-car hesitancy. While some are fully on board with electrification and hybridization, there are still some petrol holdouts, especially at the rarified and pointy end-of-the-price spectrum like Lamborghini.</p>
<p>The push for electrification and hybrid powertrains poses a significant challenge to the carmaker known for creating striking, bespoke containers for some of the most powerful gasoline engines in the world, and there&#8217;s a small sense of reluctance about it from Lamborghini&#8217;s top brass.</p>
<p>Lamborghini has said it will shift all models to hybrid powertrains by 2024 and already announced one hybrid model, the exceedingly limited run Lamborghini Sián FKP 37 and the Countach LPI 800-4. By next year, the first production (i.e., not limited run) vehicle with a hybridized powertrain will be released, though Lamborghini is still mum on what exactly that will look like. While other supercar makers like Ferrari, McLaren and Porsche continue to make both production and limited run vehicles with hybrid powertrains, Lamborghini is one of the last supercar companies to get into the game.</p>
<p>Lamborghini hopes to leverage its loyal customers to innovate around the future of their iconic super sports cars.</p>
<h2>The future of fuel for Lamborghini</h2>
<p>&#8220;On the one hand, we are super niche &#8212; and make up a very small part of the CO2 equation. But we want to do our part,&#8221; Andrea Baldi, the new North American CEO of Lamborghini said at a recent launch event for one of the last gas-powered Huracáns that Lamborghini will release, the Huracán STO. &#8220;The shift to hybrid, electric and alternative powertrains is forcing us to rethink performance and we&#8217;re not sure that electrification is the long-term direction to move in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether we release a fourth model with a hybrid or electric powertrain or find a solution for internal combustion that uses a different kind of fuel, we&#8217;re still learning. We need to deliver on a common target: Emotion and the authentic Lamborghini experience,&#8221; Baldi says.</p>
<p>He wouldn&#8217;t elaborate on specifics around the kind of fuel or technology the company might employ but Lamborghini CTO Maurizio Reggiani did allude to some interesting research that could point to a fully electrified Lamborghini in the future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Hybrid powertrains are the next frontier where we are sure we can innovate,&#8221; Reggiani said separately. &#8220;We exist because we have unique DNA. We are engineering emotion and there is some research we&#8217;re doing with the Polytechnic University in Milan on how physical events like vibration, for example, can impact the flow of emotion.&#8221; It&#8217;s possible to see a world where the physical effects of an ICE engine are simulated by gyroscopes and audio tracks.</p>
<p>Technically, Lamborghini&#8217;s factory in Sant&#8217;Agata Bolognese has been carbon neutral since 2015, Baldi says, but the 1,800-person company is part of the much larger, and much more carbon-emitting VW Group. Yet, despite its low volume of vehicles and a concerted push from the Italian government to exempt automakers like Lamborghini and Ferrari from the coming combustion engine ban, Lamborghini is being forced to move toward an alternative-fuel future.</p>
<p>Baldi says that one in 11,000 vehicles in the world is a Lamborghini, which is tiny compared to a massive automaker like Toyota or Honda. &#8220;Hybridization and electrification offer the opportunity to expand the future of emotion for the Lamborghini owner. You&#8217;re buying a dream. The majority of customers are looking for a car that expresses their success,&#8221; Baldi says. Yet, no matter how much Lamborghini customers want their combustion engines to continue well into the future, the time for those engines is coming to a close.</p>
<h2>Building a direct customer connection</h2>
<p>Meeting customer demands has always been at the heart of the Lamborghini brand and the company is leveraging its loyal owners to determine the future model direction as it works toward a 50% reduction in CO2 starting in 2025. The recent launch of the already sold out Countach LPI 800-4 at Pebble Beach is an example of how Lamborghini is using its customer base to create a new, high-demand product with a hybrid powertrain.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t just create vehicles in a vacuum. The whole customer experience has enriched the bonds we have with our customers,&#8221; Baldi said. &#8220;The special project we did with the Countach &#8212; that was an exercise of trust directly between the company and the customer. We had 1-to-1 meetings as if they were friends and that helped inform what we did with Countach. Building that vehicle was an emotional decision and it was a good business case.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the advent of COVID and resulting limits on travel, factory visits were largely halted during 2020, but Lamborghini was ahead of the game having launched a digital platform called Unica, back in 2018, that allowed them to deliver the specialized customer contact and service that owners expect. The app can be downloaded to a smartphone and owners gain access to exclusive events, launches and social media. In order to sign up, you have to provide the VIN of your Lamborghini and your certificate of ownership.</p>
<p>The app has opened up the possibility of direct sales between the company and consumers, as a result. &#8220;Direct sales is where we need to explore. We are in an age of acceleration, and we want to have a direct relationship with customers. The question is how much can we expand the direct touch with customers?&#8221; Baldi said. &#8220;To ensure a sense that the value of the car will be preserved means we have to have high-touch customer relationships. The average wait for a car is currently more than a year, right now. The wait time is selling these cars and the value is preserved because we have direct contact with customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latest Lamborghini model, the Huracán STO, a street homologated race car, is currently sold out until 2022 and comes with added connectivity via the Unica app and the vehicle. The system allows owners to record lap times, throttle and brake input, steering angle and video of laps on a track and upload the data to the app. There, owners can share their information with other Lamborghini owners, their friends, the company or their race coaches to continue to improve their performance. It becomes a sort of elite social network for Lamborghini owners and offers the company a way to connect in more direct ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;Customers demand the right context to experience a Lamborghini,&#8221; Baldi said. &#8220;Supersport cars are expanding. If we can offer these experiences in auto lifestyle and motorsport, and expand to more high touch, customers will stay within the brand.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When sister duo Claudia and Carolina Recchi were first building <a href="https://www.edsights.io/">EdSights</a>, they used a big guiding question.</p>
<p>“In a perfect world [where] we somehow had a magic wand that allowed us to collect the data on whatever we want on our fingers, what would we want to know to prevent [college] students from dropping out?,” Claudia said. The co-founder’s first few years were spent understanding data points, whether it was helping connect students to the right resources or simply hearing their concerns and communicating them to decision-makers. They landed on using a chatbot as a service that could both effectively check in with college students and collect data in a timely way.</p>
<p>The chatbot got a deep injection of vulnerability amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, the startup began selling its services to universities in search of better ways to retain and engage students, especially as the pandemic locked down campus’ and left students more alone than ever.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EdSights raises money to help schools reduce their drop-out rates&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/edsights-raises-money-to-help-schools-reduce-their-drop-out-rates/embed/#?secret=qf9dmTnXYS" data-secret="qf9dmTnXYS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Last year, EdSights&#8217; product was defined by its chatbot. Branded under the guise of a school’s mascot, the chatbot would send personalized questions and messages to students to understand their biggest stresses. It then would connect them to university resources ranging from financial aid to food and security services. EdSights sold the service to universities in search of better ways to retain and engage students, especially as the pandemic disrupted basic communication across the world.</p>
<p>The startup announced today that it has raised a $5 million Series A led by Album VC, the same firm that led early investments in Podium, Andela and Degreed. Other investors in the round include Lakehouse, Good Friends, Chegg CEO Dan Rosensweig and GSV Ventures’ Deborah Quazzo. With the new cash, EdSights’ total known capital raised to date is $8 million.</p>
<p>The new money isn’t without momentum. EdSights declined to share specific numbers, but shared that it sports 6x annual revenue growth. It also landed 70 customers, which can be colleges, institutions or universities, which is up from 16 last May. Co-founder Carolina Recchi, who built the company alongside her sister Claudia, said that their company is “very close to being profitable” and would be if they chose to stop hiring additional people. She estimates that EdSights will hit profitability in 14 months given these new growth goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>A constant challenge for EdSights is if it can spark action based off of the visibility that it provides. Universities notoriously deal with red tape, which could halt new initiatives or fast deployment, which could hurt how EdSights&#8217; return of investment plays out. The co-founders positioned a counterargument, saying that the student body data will help universities spend smarter on resources that students demand, and cut costs on newly irrelevant services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Universities are inefficient about how much money they spend, so I think we&#8217;re really uncovering when that happens,&#8221; Carolina said. &#8220;And I think that&#8217;s really why data is important&#8230;it&#8217;s the next phase of optimizing higher ed.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the startup doesn&#8217;t plan to just consult. Eventually, EdSights wants to start providing in-demand services such as mental health specialists, financial resources and career readiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you reach a certain level of scale and actually understand, what do we do about the areas in which the institution cannot help?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Is there someone else that can? And can that be us?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cryptocurrency company <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> is announcing a handful of new features. While the company is better known for its exchange that lets you convert USD into various cryptocurrencies, Coinbase wants to expand its consumer services so that you use the platform for different use cases with more financial services.</p>
<p>First, the company will soon <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/now-get-your-paycheck-deposited-into-coinbase-116fe1d073ce">launch</a> direct deposit in the U.S. This way, customers will be able to deposit a portion of their paycheck into Coinbase. Coinbase app users can find their current payroll company or employer and update paycheck allocation from there. The most extreme users will probably choose to deposit 100% of their paycheck into their Coinbase account.</p>
<p>Once the money hits your Coinbase account, you can choose what the company is supposed to do with your dollars. You can just keep everything in USD or you can choose to convert everything to a cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Users can choose any of the crypto assets available on the platform. This feature alone is particularly useful if you want to set up recurring buys without even having to think about it.</p>
<p>But direct deposit makes more sense when you realize that Coinbase also has its own <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/card">debit card</a> powered by <a href="https://www.marqeta.com">Marqeta</a>. It’s a Visa debit card that works with Apple Pay and Google Pay. It&#8217;s all about getting money in and out of your Coinbase account.</p>
<p>From the Coinbase app, you can choose the source wallet for your card transactions. Every time you make a purchase, Coinbase converts your crypto assets to USD with a 2.49% transaction fee.</p>
<p>Card transactions are also eligible to rewards. Current rewards include 1% back in DAI, ETH, DOGE or BTC, 4% back in GRT, XLM, AMP or RLY. So you spend a lot in transaction fees and you earn a bit in rewards.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Starting now, users can also choose to spend USD directly. In that case, there are no fees involved with card transactions. The company has been testing the Coinbase Card for a while, it’ll be available to everyone starting next month.</p>
<p>Coinbase is already an important financial app for millions of people in the U.S. Now that the company owns that relationship, it makes sense that it is adding new services to increase usage. That’s why Coinbase will also change the tabs in its mobile app with four new tabs —&nbsp;‘Assets’, ‘Trade’, ‘Pay’ and ‘For You’. And maybe some users will end up using the Coinbase app a bit more and their bank app a bit less.</p>

YouTube has acknowledged the situation on its <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-nbc-programming-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">official blog</a>, saying that it will drop its monthly price by $10 if the situation isn&#8217;t resolved and the content goes offline. If you&#8217;re a YouTube TV subscriber, you stand to lose NBC, USA Network, Golf Channel, Bravo, CNBC, Telemundo and <a href="https://youneedchannels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">eight other channels</a>.</p>
<p>According to YouTube, the dispute revolves around how much money its paying NBC Universal (NBCU) for its content. &#8220;For the duration of our agreement, YouTube TV seeks the same rates that services of a similar size get from NBCU so we can continue offering YouTube TV to members at a competitive and fair price,&#8221; the Google-owned service said. NBC said in a statement that it&#8217;s seeking &#8220;fair rates&#8221; from Google, adding that YouTube TV is &#8220;just days away from letting their contract expire.&#8221;</p>
<p>NBC Universal is trying to put some pressure on YouTube TV, <a href="https://youneedchannels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">asking users</a> to tweet at or chat with YouTube TV, or even switch providers. However, YouTube is saying that it will only renew &#8220;if NBCU offers us equitable terms&#8221; and said it would drop monthly prices by $10 from $64.99 to $54.99 while the channels are off the platform. It even encouraged users to sign up for NBC&#8217;s Peacock streaming service for $4.99 per month in order to retain NBCU content.</p>

Take advantage of full event access at a discount price. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=5dayslefttosavepost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=5dayslefttosavepost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your pass</a> before the sale expires on <strong>October 1 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong> and keep $100 is your wallet.</p>
<p>TC Sessions are known for their focused, deep dives into a specific tech sector, and this is our first time turning the spotlight on SaaS. The game is changing and expanding rapidly, and it’s the perfect time to examine where the next generation of SaaS startups is headed and what they’re creating.</p>
<p>You’ll hear from the industry’s leading voices — successful founders who scaled from startup to unicorn, CISOs offering advice about keeping the platforms safe and, of course, VCs sharing what characteristics they look for in SaaS products. Plus, real-world use cases and world-class networking.</p>
<p>Case in point: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/confluent-ceo-jay-kreps-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-saas-for-a-fireside-chat/">Jay Kreps</a>, the CEO and co-founder of Confluent, will join us for a conversation about processing massive amounts of streaming data in real time. He knows whereof he speaks — last year Confluent hit a $4.5 billion valuation and currently has a market cap of more than $17 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">Edna Conway</a>, the chief security and risk officer for Microsoft’s Azure, will join <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">Olivia Rose</a>, CISO and VP of IT and security at Amplitude, for a presentation called, <strong>SaaS Security, Today and Tomorrow</strong>. They’ll share their considerable expertise and explain what SaaS startups need to know about security now and in the future.</p>
<p>If fundraising’s on your mind don’t miss this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/sarah-guo-kobie-fuller-casey-aylward-headline-investor-panel-at-tc-sessions-saas/">panel discussion</a> with VCs Sarah Guo (Greylock), Kobie Fuller (Upfront Ventures) and Casey Aylward (Costanoa Ventures). All three possess a keen eye for SaaS startup success, and they’ll talk about what catches their attention.</p>

<p>And if you’ve never attended a TC Session, here’s what past attendees have told us about their experiences.</p>
<p>“TC Sessions: Mobility isn&#8217;t just an educational opportunity, it&#8217;s a real networking opportunity. Everyone was passionate and open to creating pilot programs or other partnerships. That was the most exciting part. And now — thanks to a conference connection — we’re talking with Goodyear&#8217;s Innovation Lab.” — Karin Maake, senior director of communications at FlashParking.</p>
<p>“Going to TechCrunch events, whether it’s Disrupt or the TC Sessions, helps me stay ahead of emerging trends, technologies and startups that affect the future of mobility.” — Rachael Wilcox, creative producer, Volvo Cars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok announced <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/1-billion-people-on-tiktok">in a blog post today</a> that 1 billion people use TikTok every month. That means that on this big rock in space that we call home, about one in seven-and-a-half people are regularly watching short-form videos of dancing, dangerous &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/tiktok-bans-viral-milk-crate-challenge-over-safety-concerns/">milk crate challenges</a>&#8221; and even actual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/tiktok-tests-a-learn-tab-to-showcase-education-and-how-to-videos/">educational content</a>.</p>
<p>For context, Facebook said that in June it had <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx">2.9 billion monthly active users</a>, up 7% year over year. But TikTok&#8217;s growth is rapid &#8212; this new user data marks a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tiktok-hits-1-billion-monthly-active-users-globally-company-2021-09-27/">45% increase</a> in monthly active users since July 2020, when it had 689 million users. Plus, this July, TikTok became the first non-Facebook app to reach <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion">3 billion global downloads</a>, per app analytics firm SensorTower.</p>
<p>The competition that TikTok poses to Western tech giants is palpable &#8212; Instagram, owned by Facebook, has radically shifted its focus, declaring that it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-now-supports-60-second-videos-on-reels-its-tiktok-clone/">no longer a photo-sharing app</a>. Instagram is heavily promoting Reels, its TikTok clone, and even discussion forums like Reddit are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/reddit-is-quietly-rolling-out-a-tiktok-like-video-feed-button-on-ios/">enticed by the promise</a> of short-form video feeds. Instagram even advised creators that if they recycle watermarked TikToks as posts on Reels, the content will be <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLFMSunBRX1/">less discoverable</a>.</p>
<p>TikTok<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tiktok-hits-1-billion-monthly-active-users-globally-company-2021-09-27/"> said</a> that its biggest markets are in the United States, Europe, Brazil, and Southeast Asia, even though its parent company ByteDance is headquartered in China. Of course, TikTok has faced severe regulatory threats in recent years &#8212; former President Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/biden-revokes-and-replace-trump-actions-targeting-tiktok-and-wechat-report/">attempted to block</a> U.S. business transactions with TikTok, and in India, home to 1.36 billion people, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/india-retains-ban-on-tiktok-uc-browser-and-57-other-chinese-apps/">TikTok has been banned</a> since last year.</p>
<p>Despite it all, TikTok continues to exhibit impressive growth. As recently as last month, TikTok parent ByteDance bought the VR hardware company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/tiktok-owner-bytedance-buys-a-top-virtual-reality-hardware-company/">Pico</a>, indicating a potential future expansion into VR. It&#8217;s not a coincidence that, all the while, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to turn his trillion-dollar platform into a &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">metaverse</a>&#8221; company. Anyone hungry for some popcorn?</p>

Warby Parker is also set to <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/eyewear-maker-warby-parker-to-go-public-via-direct-listing-on-nyse-2021-08-24-0">direct list later</a> this week &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">more on its numbers here</a>.</p>
<p>Expect a raft of coverage from TechCrunch on both debuts.</p>
<p>Even if you are tired of IPOs, these two warrant your attention. The Amplitude debut is notable for its status as a direct listing that follows a large private-market fundraising. The company is pursuing a liquidity model that both leverages ample private fundraising and dodges pricing issues present in traditional IPOs that have irked many in the Silicon Valley chattering classes.</p>

<hr />
<p>And the Warby offering will help set &#8212; or correct &#8212; market sentiment regarding D2C companies; the unicorn isn&#8217;t even a technology company in the eyes of many. However, its DNA in e-commerce and venture-backed history keep it firmly in the TechCrunch wheelhouse, regardless. And it&#8217;s <em>also</em> pursuing a direct listing after raising private capital in recent quarters.</p>

It&#8217;s either pesky bankers extracting unearned value from hardworking Silicon Valley types at graduation day, or it&#8217;s private-market investors irked that anyone else accretes upside from startups.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about how we&#8217;ll sort the matter.</p>
<h2>Raise, then direct list</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen a number of direct listings in recent years. Spotify is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/spotify-opens-at-165-90-valuing-company-at-30-billion/">perhaps the best remembered</a>. But Asana <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/asanas-strong-direct-listing-lights-alternative-path-to-public-market-for-saas-startups/">also went out via a direct listing</a>. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/wise-formerly-transferwise-confirms-direct-listing-on-the-lse-in-early-july-reportedly-at-a-6b-7b-valuation/">did Wise</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/can-squarespace-dodge-the-direct-listing-value-trap/">Squarespace</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/coinbases-direct-listing-alters-the-landscape-for-fintech-and-crypto-startups/">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">Roblox</a>.</p>
<p>Amplitude will also float without raising primary capital in its public debut. It raised a huge stack of funds earlier this year &#8212; $150 million at a valuation of just under $4.2 billion, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/amplitude-series-f--92399aff">per Crunchbase data</a>. This method of raising private capital and then direct listing decouples the traditional IPO, which combines a primary raise and a public flotation.</p>
<p>Another variation on the method is to direct list, later raising primary funds through a follow-on offering once the market has set what is perhaps a fairer price for the equity of the company in question. There is also work afoot to allow companies to direct list <em>and</em> raise primary capital, shifting pricing power from banks to public investors more directly. That final option is still more theory than applicable exercise.</p>
<p>So, unicorns that don&#8217;t want to pursue a traditional IPO can raise private funds before or after a direct listing in an attempt to get around the exorbitant first-day pops that some firms have recorded in recent quarters.</p>
<p>Roblox is an example of the raise-then-direct list method. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/roblox-files-to-go-public/">filed to go public</a> but shelved its IPO after seeing a few other companies storm out of the gate. The gaming company went on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/">raise private funds in early 2021</a>, and then direct list. Squarespace was similar: It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/squarespace-raises-300m-at-staggering-10b-valuation/">raised $300 million at a flat $10.0 billion valuation</a> (post-money) this March before direct listing in May.</p>
<p>This is the model that Amplitude and Warby Parker will test this week. The question it begs is simple: <em>Does raising private capital and then direct listing solve the pricing issue that traditional IPOs engender when bankers and institutional investors price the floating company at a lower value than what retail investors and others will pay for the same stock once it begins to trade?</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company will begin production of its first product offering, a variety of pork sausages, next year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berkeley-based cultured meat company <a href="https://newagemeats.com/">New Age Meats</a> announced Monday it raised $25 million in Series A funding that will enable the company to begin production of its first product offering, a variety of pork sausages, next year.</p>
<p>Hanwha Solutions of South Korea led the funding round and was joined by existing investors SOSV’s IndieBio, TechU Ventures, ff VC and Siddhi Capital.</p>
<p>CEO Brian Spears has a chemical engineering background and co-founded the company, which makes meat from animal cells, in 2018 after spending 12 years developing research laboratory and industry automation.</p>
<p>“We want to create a sustainable and humane process that delivers the same flavors, smell and experience in an affordable and accessible way,” he told TechCrunch. “Having the backing of Hanwha and our other investors, we can go after our mission to become the largest and most innovative meat company on Earth.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208247" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208247" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2208247" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg 5472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spears-at-Hello-Tomorrow-Singapore.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208247" class="wp-caption-text">Brian Spears speaking at Hello Tomorrow Singapore. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> New Age Meats</p></div></p>
<p>The Series A will enable the company to double its workforce, expand R&amp;D and build a 20,000-square-foot pilot manufacturing facility in Alameda. The investment follows $7 million of seed rounds previously raised from a group of backers including RXBAR founder Peter Rahal.</p>
<p>New Age Meats is starting with sausage because it is one of the foods that had the fastest way to market, but the company will eventually move into other meat categories like beef and chicken, Spears said.</p>
<p>He expects to be able to go to market in 2022, pending approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. He also sees demand for products coming from markets that eat a lot of pork, like Asia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The cultured meat landscape is gaining new entrants as the technology has evolved. Spears said New Age is differentiating itself by concentrating on delivering on the experience for customers that like eating meat and doing it in a way that is scalable and affordable.</p>
<p>While Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat were some of the first in the meat alternative space, other companies have come into it with a focus on cultured meat and are also attracting venture capital; for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/animal-alternative-makes-a-platform-play-in-the-growing-market-of-cultured-meat/">Animal Alternative</a> and Eat Just’s Good Meat, which <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210920005307/en/GOOD-Meat-a-Division-of-Eat-Just-Inc.-Raises-267-Million-Adds-Former-USDA-Secretary-to-Advisory-Board">last week announced another $97 million</a> in funding.</p>
<p>Hanwha Solutions, which corresponded via email, said that its business mission aligned with New Age Meats and sees potential for growth in the cell-based pork market.</p>
<p>And, given worldwide efforts to address climate change, Hanwha “expected rapid market growth” in the food tech industry, particularly around cultured meat.</p>
<p>“Growing awareness for healthy food and animal rights will also fuel the demand,” the company said. “With its expertise in using cell technology to produce cultured meats, New Age Meats will help us expand our business horizon.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more enterprises migrate to cloud-based architectures, they are also taking on more applications (because they can) and, as a result of that, more complex workloads and storage needs. Machine learning and other artificial intelligence applications add even more complexity. Now a startup that has built technology to make that process move faster and more efficiently is announcing a round of funding to address those enterprises&#8217; evolving needs. <a href="https://www.asteralabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astera Labs</a>, a fabless semiconductor company that builds connectivity solutions that help remove bottlenecks around high-bandwidth applications and help better allocate resources around enterprise data, has raised $50 million.</p>
<p>The Series C values the company at $950 million post-money, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>Fidelity Management and Research is leading the round with Atreides Management and Valor Equity Partners &#8212; two other new backers &#8212; also participating, and previous investors Avigdor Willenz Group, GlobalLink1 Capital, Intel Capital, Sutter Hill Ventures and VentureTech Alliance also participating.</p>
<p>Intel (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/intel-has-invested-132m-in-11-startups-this-year-on-track-for-300m-500m-in-total/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first invested in 2020</a>) is a strategic backer in this case, meaning a financial investor and significant customer. Sanjay Gajendra, Astera&#8217;s chief business officer, notes that the chip giant is collaborating with the startup to develop PCI Express and CXL (Compute Express Link) technology and products to &#8220;increase bandwidth, performance, and resource availability in next generation server and storage infrastructure.&#8221; With AI use cases being a central part of Intel&#8217;s next-generation growth strategy, these will be essential for building AI-based systems based on Intel&#8217;s processors, he said, adding that Aries Smart Retimers for PCIe are also featured in multiple reference designs and commercial platforms from Intel.</p>
<p>Other partners and customers include TSMC, Wistron, Samsung Electronics and Western Digital.</p>
<p>Prior to this, Santa Clara-based Astera had previously only raised $35 million in three years, which speaks to its own efficiency as a business, and the fact that it&#8217;s been generating healthy revenues already.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to join forces with Fidelity, Atreides, and Valor to cement our leadership position in intelligent cloud connectivity solutions and usher Astera Labs into the next growth phase of our company,” said Jitendra Mohan, CEO, Astera Labs, in a statement. “With this investment and increased collaboration with our manufacturing partners, we will rapidly scale our worldwide operations to satisfy incredible customer demand and launch multiple new product lines to solve the industry’s most pressing connectivity challenges.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest funding round, more specifically, is also coming on the back of what has been a relatively strong period for the company in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the shift it precipitated in migrations to the cloud among organizations.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;With a step-function increase in folks working/studying from home and relying on cloud-based SaaS/PaaS applications, the deployment of scalable hardware infrastructure has accelerated,&#8221; Gajendra said in an email to TechCrunch. He claims that solutions could provide up to double the bandwidth on the same infrastructure. &#8220;This has driven our sales demand from the world’s largest cloud operators by an estimated 25% to 30%.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Astera&#8217;s fabless approach is giving the company a faster route to scaling its technology and selling it on to more providers at a time when we are very much caught in a race for more bandwidth but also a finite amount of cost and resource for simply adding more capacity: this means that companies that are building solutions to improve the efficiency of systems that are already in place will continue to get a lot of attention from the market, and investors. This is an issue that extends to different aspects of enterprise IT: for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/firebolt-raises-127m-more-for-its-new-approach-to-cheaper-and-more-efficient-big-data-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebolt</a> is building architecture and algorithms to reduce the bandwidth needed specifically for handling big data analytics.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vne2VkPWXv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/firebolt-raises-127m-more-for-its-new-approach-to-cheaper-and-more-efficient-big-data-analytics/">Firebolt raises $127M more for its new approach to cheaper and more efficient Big Data analytics</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Firebolt raises $127M more for its new approach to cheaper and more efficient Big Data analytics&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/firebolt-raises-127m-more-for-its-new-approach-to-cheaper-and-more-efficient-big-data-analytics/embed/#?secret=vne2VkPWXv" data-secret="vne2VkPWXv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Avigdor Willenz is not only a founding investor in Astera Labs, but he was also one of the first to back other major processing startups, including Annapurna Labs (now owned by Amazon), Habana Labs (now owned by Intel) and many others. “Astera Labs has done a tremendous job in developing a portfolio of multiple innovative products that address critical needs of heterogeneous computing and composable disaggregation infrastructure,” said Willenz in a statement. For now, it looks like Astera is earmarked not as an exit but to stay the course to public company status, although the race for technology among the giants in the market may lead to a different outcome. “We are very pleased to see the strong execution track record and rapid value creation by Astera Labs, which has opened multiple options including an IPO in the future,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>“We are very excited with the growth and expansion of Astera Labs and remain highly optimistic about the long-term potential of the company,” added Stefan Dyckerhoff, MD at Sutter Hills Ventures and Board Member of Astera Labs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Space Force, the military branch spun out of the Air Force in December 2019, has announced its next batch of awards for projects related to next-gen rocket engine testing and upper-stage improvements.</p>
<p>The awards were granted by the Space Enterprise Consortium (SpEC), a program managed by the Space Force’s Space Systems Command. SpEC facilitates engagement between the U.S. Department and Defense and the space industry, by allowing its nearly 600 members to compete for contracts. The awards, which total $87.5 million, were granted to four launch companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blue Origin, which will receive $24.3 million to develop cryogenic fluid management for the upper stage of the New Glenn rocket.</li>
<li>United Launch Alliance, which will get $24.3 million for uplink command and control for its new Vulcan Centaur two-stage heavy-lift rocket.</li>
<li>Rocket Lab, whose contract award is also $24.3 million, one of the highest in the company’s history. Those funds will go toward upper-stage development of the company’s forthcoming Neutron medium-lift rocket.</li>
<li>SpaceX, which will get $14.4 million for combustion stability analysis and testing of its Raptor rocket engine.</li>

<p>SpaceX and ULA are already established launch providers for the U.S. government under the Space Force’s National Security Space Launch program. Both Rocket Lab and Blue Origin will be able to compete for the next series of launch procurement contracts in 2024. These latest contracts are a sign that the two companies are gearing up to submit their bids. (Blue Origin and Northrop Grumman lost to SpaceX and ULA in 2020.)</p>
<p>Regarding the new award, Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck said in a statement that it is a “vote of confidence” in the Neutron rocket. “We’ve built a trusted launch system with Electron, and we’ll do it again with Neutron to continue providing unfettered access to space with our new heavier-lift vehicle.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K.&#8217;s competition watchdog has cleared Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of Kustomer, a maker of CRM tools.</p>
<p>The purchase was announced<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/"> last November</a> &#8212; with a price tag we reported as $1 billion &#8212; but is pending closing after facing regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>The U.K.&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened an inquiry on the proposed merger this summer, at the end of July. The European Commission has also been digging into the implications of the deal, opening an investigation in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4021">August</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2kvsd8793q"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/">Facebook buys Kustomer for $1B to expand into customer service tools</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook buys Kustomer for $1B to expand into customer service tools&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/embed/#?secret=2kvsd8793q" data-secret="2kvsd8793q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6151a0da8fa8f5610b9c2208/Facebook.Kustomer_-_Summary_of_Phase_1_Decision_.pdf">summary</a> of its decision to greenlight Facebook&#8217;s latest bit of B2B shopping, the CMA said it looked at whether letting Facebook go ahead and scoop up the customer service software maker would dent competition by raising barriers to entry in the online display advertising market; whether Facebook might harm the competitiveness of customer service tools maker by limiting or degrading their access to its messaging channels; whether the tech giant might harm the competitiveness of other B2C messaging services by preventing them from integrating with Kustomer&#8217;s services; and whether Facebook could rely on cross-subsidizing from its online ads business to undercut competitors by offering Kustomer for free or on a freemium basis, thereby undermining the ability of others to compete.</p>
<p>For each concern (or &#8220;theory of harm&#8221;), the CMA goes on to explain that it was satisfied the acquisition did not meet the required bar of a &#8220;substantial lessening&#8221; of competition.</p>
<p>The small size of Kustomer appears to have helped allay concerns that letting Facebook assimilate the CRM maker might damage the wider market for such business tools.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The CMA considers that, even if some competitors would struggle to respond to Facebook offering Kustomer on a free or freemium basis, sufficient competitive constraints would remain,&#8221; the regulator writes in its conclusion on the last theory of harm, for example, adding that it &#8220;considers that the largest providers may be in a position to adopt a freemium model, or to develop a basic low-price CRM product targeted at small businesses, with the expectation that CRM revenues would increase as businesses’ needs grew&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most importantly, it is not necessary for other CRM providers to replicate the Merged Entity’s strategy in order to remain competitive,&#8221; it also writes. &#8220;While price is certainly an important dimension of competition, there are several other dimensions along which CRM providers could compete against the Merged Entity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the green light in a statement, a Facebook spokesperson sought to spin the clearance as a positive endorsement of the deal as a boon to competitors, writing: “We welcome the CMA’s decision, which shows that this deal is good for competition. The transaction will increase competition and bring more innovation to businesses and consumers in the dynamic and competitive CRM and business messaging spaces. More people will benefit from customer service that is faster, richer and available whenever and however they need it.”</p>
<p>While the CMA has decided there&#8217;s nothing to see here, the EU is still considering whether to clear Facebook-Kustomer. So the regulatory scrutiny continues.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s Kustomer buy could face EU probe after merger referral&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/facebooks-kustomer-buy-could-face-eu-probe-after-merger-referral/embed/#?secret=Ob9lmSmW05" data-secret="Ob9lmSmW05" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A Commission spokesperson had no comment on the CMA&#8217;s clearance &#8212; but confirmed its own &#8220;in-depth investigation&#8221; is ongoing, adding that there&#8217;s a provisional deadline of January 7, 2022, for EU regulators to take their own decision.</p>
<p>Despite the CMA&#8217;s relatively quick clearance of this particular Facebook purchase, the U.K. regulator does <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/">continue to dig into competition concerns</a> attached to Facebook&#8217;s earlier acquisition of animated gif platform, Giphy.</p>
<p>After a finding of provisional concerns on Facebook-Giphy earlier this summer, it proposed remedies that could include ordering Facebook to unwind the acquisition &#8212; leading the tech giant to respond with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-fights-british-watchdog-retain-gif-maker-giphy-2021-09-08/">a stinging rebuttal of any harms</a>, earlier this month, accusing the regulator of making &#8220;fundamental errors&#8221; in its assessment of the competitive implications of that deal.</p>
<p>Regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech&#8217;s acquisitions in the region tends to focus on a fairly narrow consideration of competitive harms &#8212; such as how the CMA has looked at the Kustomer buy through the lens of the overall competitiveness of the CRM market.</p>
<p>However, in the Kustomer case, <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/questions-about-facebooks-acquisition-of-kustomer/">concerns</a> have also been raised about the privacy implications of letting adtech giant Facebook get its hands on the support service&#8217;s customer data given that the smaller company operates in sectors including <a href="https://www.kustomer.com/industry/healthcare/">the health sector</a> where it is likely to be processing sensitive information on behalf of its customers.</p>
<p>Back in February, for instance, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) raised a series of privacy concerns in a letter to Facebook &#8212; which it also <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/questions-about-facebooks-acquisition-of-kustomer/">published online</a>, querying what uses the tech giant would be making for customer data held by Kustomer and asking whether such data would be combined with any other data held by Facebook and Facebook-owned companies.</p>
<p>Months later the ICCL <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/facebooks-kustomer-buy-could-face-eu-probe-after-merger-referral/">said</a> it had not had any response from Facebook to the letter raising privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Despite Europe&#8217;s comprehensive data protection framework &#8212; which is supposed to help safeguard people&#8217;s digital information &#8212; competition watchdogs in the region rarely consider privacy implications as part of their assessments of digital markets.</p>
<p>And there have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power/">calls for more joined up working</a> between competition and privacy regulators in order to properly tackle the market effects and consumer harms that can flow from digital giants&#8217; command of other people&#8217;s information.</p>
<p>One outlier on this front is German&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office (FCO), which has been doing just that &#8212; in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling/">pioneering case against Facebook&#8217;s superprofiling</a> (which is ongoing).</p>
<p>The FCO is <a href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2021/23_07_2021_Facebook_Kustomer.html;jsessionid=56124766822035B0C7DD34AEA6AF42A1.2_cid362?nn=3591568">also looking at</a> whether Facebook&#8217;s plans to acquire Kustomer fall under the scope of German merger control rules.</p>

You&#8217;ll find the $5 tenders at Walmart and other major grocery chains starting in October, though only in select markets. Beyond expects to expand availability later this year.</p>
<p>The company says its tenders have 50 percent less saturated fat than ones made with actual chicken, and have no GMOs, antibiotics, hormones or cholesterol. Beyond uses faba beans rather than a soy-based recipe in its attempt to replicate the taste and texture of a chicken tender. It says you&#8217;ll be able to heat up the pre-cooked tenders in under 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Along with Walmart, Beyond&#8217;s tenders will be available at some Jewel-Osco, Safeway NorCal, Harris Teeter, Giant Foods and ShopRite stores at the outset. Meanwhile, Beyond says it&#8217;s increasing availability of its products at Walmart. It&#8217;ll bring Breakfast Sausage Patties to more than 1,300 additional stores, while more locations will offer Beyond Meatballs and Beyond Beef Crumbles.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a busy month in the plant-based meat alternative ecosystem. Beyond competitor Impossible started selling its &#8220;chicken&#8221; nuggets in restaurants <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-chicken-nuggets-130035016.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><ins>a few weeks ago</ins></a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been an Extra Crunch summer. We&#8217;ve heard how to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/craft-your-pitch-deck-around-that-one-thing-that-can-really-hook-an-investor/">craft your pitch deck around the one thing that really hooks an investor</a>, and how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/how-retail-ziplines-series-a-pitch-deck-ticked-every-box-for-emergence-capital/">the industry experience of Retail Zipline&#8217;s Melissa Wong ticked every box for Emergence</a> when raising her Series A. And that&#8217;s just the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">tip of the iceberg</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also gotten a sneak peek at the Disrupt Startup Alley companies in our summer episodes of Extra Crunch Live: Startup Alley Edition.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more where that came from this fall. Without any further ado, check out the incredible speakers joining us on upcoming episodes of Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, we&#8217;re changing the name. Henceforth, ECL shall be known as TechCrunch Live. Here&#8217;s why: We realized that hanging out with TechCrunch in this context should be accessible to everyone. We interview startup founders and the investors that finance them to learn how the deal actually gets done, and we have folks in the audience pitch to get the expert feedback of our guests. Everyone should be able to benefit from that.</p>
<p>Because of that, we&#8217;re calling the series TechCrunch Live, as the live event hasn&#8217;t been an EC member perk for quite some time. Although the live portion is free upon registration, the video replays from TechCrunch Live will remain behind the paywall.</p>
<p>So, let me try that again.</p>
<p>Here are the upcoming speakers joining us on TechCrunch Live in October.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a>. I <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">also tweet</a>.</p>
<p>A few things this morning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram is pausing work on the kids-focused version of its social service. It claims that the product is the right thing to build, but that it wants to talk to folks about why, first. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/instagram-puts-kids-version-on-ice-after-critical-backlash/">TechCrunch has more here</a>.</li>
<li>Shares of Box are up this morning, after the company endured a period of time in the wilderness.</li>
<li>Google is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/26/google-lowers-its-cloud-marketplace-revenue-share-to-3percent-from-20percent.html">cutting its cloud app marketplace take rate</a> as marketplaces more broadly lose their ability to accrete economic value as middlepeople.</li>
<li>Spotify is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-kicks-off-campaign-to-win-more-advertisers-11632736800?mod=djemalertNEWS">spending to advertise its advertising solution</a> so that others can spend more money on Spotify.</li>
<li>Swiss startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/frontify-raises-50m-for-a-collaborative-cloud-platform-for-organizations-to-manage-and-use-their-design-and-brand-assets/">Frontify raises $50 million</a>, more than double its previous round&#8217;s size.</li>
<li>And from Sweden, EV company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/26/swedish-ev-maker-polestar-reportedly-preparing-to-go-spac-at-21b-valuation/">Polestar may go public via a SPAC</a>, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/e-motorcycle-maker-cake-closes-60m-round-to-scale-production-and-retail-sales/">EV company Cake raises $60 million</a>.

<li>And looking ahead, Amplitude will set a reference price this evening and direct list tomorrow. Warby Parker will set an IPO price tomorrow evening, and trade on Wednesday.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s that! Chat Wednesday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-maps-introduces-new-ways-to-explore-major-cities-in-3d/">bringing</a> its 3D maps to more cities within the Apple Maps app, including London, LA, New York and San Francisco. The experience, launching with iOS 15, follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/apple-maps-rebuild/">several years of investment</a> in Apple&#8217;s mapping platform to make the app more competitive with the market leader, Google Maps. This has included not only the addition of 3D maps, like those arriving now to major markets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-maps-upgrade-brings-more-detailed-maps-transit-features-ar-view-and-more/">but also overall more detailed maps</a>, improved transit features, AR viewing modes and more.</p>
<p>Many of these features have taken time to roll out, with major metros around the U.S. and world being the first to gain the enhancements. AR viewing, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-maps-upgrade-brings-more-detailed-maps-transit-features-ar-view-and-more/">only began launching</a> to select cities this year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208486" style="width: 495px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208486" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2208486" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg?w=485" alt="" width="485" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg?resize=768,1076 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg?resize=485,680 485w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg?resize=1096,1536 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208486" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>With 3D maps, however, Apple Maps users will be able to see more details for areas across the city, including their neighborhoods, commercial districts, marinas, buildings and more, the company says, along with elevation details, new road labels and even custom-designed landmarks.</p>
<p>For example, Apple Maps will show renderings for famous spots, like Coit Tower in San Francisco, Dodger Stadium in LA, the Statue of Liberty in NYC and the Royal Albert Hall in London, with more landmarks to come in time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208490" style="width: 495px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208490" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2208490" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg?w=485" alt="" width="485" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg?resize=768,1076 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg?resize=485,680 485w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg?resize=1096,1536 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208490" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Later this year, these sorts of 3D maps will become available in Philadelphia, San Diego and Washington, D.C., Apple says. Then, next year, they&#8217;ll arrive in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple is also enhancing its road-level navigation in Apple Maps, with more clearly displayed turn lanes, medians, bus and taxi lanes, and crosswalks. These appear in a 3D viewing mode which makes it easier to see the best lane to choose based on traffic conditions or for better route planning purposes. The app will also display the estimated time of arrival, based on the current conditions, as Google Maps does. This new navigation, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-maps-upgrade-brings-more-detailed-maps-transit-features-ar-view-and-more/">previously announced</a> for a 2021 release, will arrive in CarPlay later this year, Apple said, without giving a more specific deadline.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208487" style="width: 495px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208487" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2208487" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=485" alt="" width="485" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=768,1076 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=485,680 485w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=1096,1536 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208487" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Similarly, other major maps updates, which had been announced earlier this year, are also now rolling out. This includes transit features designed to make Apple Maps more competitive with third-party apps often favored by transit takers, like Citymapper. Now, nearby transit stations are prominently displayed at the top of the screen and users can pin favorite lines in Maps for easy access. And once a route is selected, Maps will automatically notify users when it&#8217;s time to disembark &#8212; something users can track on their Apple Watch, too.</p>

<p>Apple Maps offers more immersive walking directions with step-by-step guidance powered by augmented reality. This allows users to raise their phone to scan the buildings in their area, which lets Maps generate a more accurate position in order to provide more detailed guidance. This has been rolling out to select markets over the course of the year.</p>
<p>In addition, iOS 15 users can view a new 3D globe of the earth and they can tap an Explore Guides button in the Apple Maps app to access curated Guides from brands like Time Out, The Washington Post, the National Park Foundation, Complex and The Infatuation. These will offer suggestions about things to do or see in various cities worldwide. Users can also make guides of their own to share with friends and family.</p>

Between the impossible fever dream of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/nintendo-announced-that-chris-pratt-will-play-mario-on-the-big-screen/">last week’s Super Mario movie casting</a> and the eagerly anticipated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/nintendo-teases-2022-release-for-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-and-releases-zelda-game-watch-to-tide-us-over/">sequel to the Switch’s best game</a>, it’s easy to lose track of the other big developments from the gaming giant.</p>
<p>Nintendo recently held an intimate (and sufficiently socially distanced) event in New York, bringing together two of its biggest products launching ahead of the holidays. The first is the arrival of the first 2D Metroid title in 19 years. The title was a surprise announcement during this year’s virtual E3.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208237" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208237" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2208237" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208237" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nintendo</p></div></p>
<p>In many ways, Metroid Dread took centerstage at the briefing, complete with cardboard character cutouts from the game, mood lighting and related sound effects being piped over the PA. More than anything, Nintendo wants to make it clear that the title is more than just a stopgap between now and whatever undetermined time in the future when the company finally releases Metroid Prime 4.</p>
<p>Of course, a game doesn’t mean much without something to play it on. That’s where the new Nintendo Switch &#8212; OLED Model &#8212; comes in. Yes, that’s t1he full, glorious name &#8212; and for what’s worth, the company has been pronouncing it O-L-E-D. It’s a bit jarring (and clumsy) at first for someone who’s grown so accustom to pronouncing the screen technology phonetically.</p>

<p>If Metroid Dread was a slight disappointment for some of the fan-base due to it, well, not being Prime 4, the initial Switch OLED (as I will henceforth be referring to it) fell short of what many were expecting/hoping the company would be announcing on the hardware front. After all, at 3.5 years old, the Switch seems primed for a big makeover. Refresh cycles being what they are for consoles, hardware makers love to juice sales in their middle-age with some compelling new model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This serves the dual-purpose of (hopefully) bringing long-time holdouts on board and convincing the devoted it’s time to upgrade to something shiny and new. It’s worth noting that, in mid-2019, Nintendo did introduce two models. There was a refresh of the standard Switch that addressed far and away the system’s biggest downside: battery. The company also added the $200 Switch Lite &#8212; a more affordable and portable version of the console that helped get me through the first year of this pandemic in one piece.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208238" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208238" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2208238" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208238" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nintendo</p></div></p>
<p>Rumors of a Switch Pro were at full-force ahead of E3. What arrived was, for many, underwhelming, featuring the same RAM and processor (Nvidia Tegra X1) as its predecessor and a slightly larger display (0.8 inches) than its predecessor. The seven-inch OLED is still 720p (1080p when docked), and not the the 4K some were expecting. It does add some other features, like a wired LAN connection and double the storage to 64GB, without ditching the microSD slot.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208244" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208244" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2208244" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208244" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Waiting to play, I snapped a few quick shots of some OLED models on display, showcasing demos of Mario Kart. The system is striking in its black and white stormtrooper colors. When I finally got my hands on the system, the first thing that struck me was the weight. Granted, playing the Switch Lite for the past year has messed with my perspective on the matter, but the Switch OLED is also heavier than its predecessor, up to 0.93 pounds from 0.88.</p>
<p>While not improving the resolution, the new OLED technology does bring some upgrades &#8212; namely deeper blacks and higher contrast than the original. It’s fitting then &#8212; and likely not entirely coincidental &#8212; that the system launches with a dark, subterranean title like Metroid Dread. It’s a nice combo, and the improved sound offers a tactile feedback for loud sounds &#8212; something you get a lot of when firing rockets from your arm cannon.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208236" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208236" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2208236" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208236" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nintendo</p></div></p>
<p>Still, the Switch OLED may be a hard sell for those who have the original. Metroid Dread, on the other, is a bit more of a no-brainer. I was only afforded the time to play the early stages, but the game triggered the same sensory receptors that made the original (and subsequent side-scrollers). The pulsating alien life forms are still in full-effect, now battling alongside the relentless and (in the early stage, at least) seemingly invulnerable E.M.M.I. robots that populate the game from the beginning.</p>
<p>Metroid Dread and the new Nintendo Switch OLED Model arrive together on October 8. The new system runs $350.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin&#8217;s second human spaceflight will have a space industry veteran and sector-focused investor on board when it takes off: Dr. Chris Boshuizen, co-founder of Planet Labs and current partner at venture capital firm DCVC. Boshuizen will occupy one of four seats on Blue Origin&#8217;s next trip of its New Shepard fully reusable suborbital spacecraft with people on board, following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">debut journey earlier this year with Jeff Bezos</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Blue Origin also announced that <span class="m_-1800835828865331381normaltextrun">Glen de Vries, co-founder of the clinical trial software company Medidata Solutions will also be on the flight. He&#8217;s also the vice chair of life sciences and healthcare at Dassault <span class="m_-1800835828865331381spellingerror">Systèmes, a French software company that acquired Medidata in 2019. </span></span></p>

<p>Boshuizen has his PhD in physics from the University of Sydney, and was a NASA space mission architect at the Ames Research Center in California for four years before going on to found Planet Labs and serve as its CTO during its first five years of operation. He originally joined DCVC as an entrepreneur in residence, before becoming an operation partner and then a full-time partner earlier this year.</p>
<p>While he&#8217;s spent his entire career in the space industry, Boshuizen says that his ambitions to actually go to space started earlier still: He applied for pilot school in the Australian Defense Force Academy when he was just 17 but tested as partially color blind so he was disqualified from continuing.</p>
<p>The current smallsat and CubeSat boom actually owes a lot to Boshuizen, too: When he was working at NASA, he helped invent the &#8220;Phonesat,&#8221; which was an orbital satellite effectively built from a modified smartphone. The primary reason micro satellite constellations exist today in such high numbers is that the miniaturization of high-tech components spurred by the rise of the smartphone made small, powerful satellites that are relatively affordable to build and launch possible.</p>
<p>The flight is scheduled to take off on Tuesday, October 12, at 9:30 AM EST from Blue Origin&#8217;s sprawling Launch Site One just outside of Van Horn, Texas. The company has not released details regarding the identities of the remaining two crew members.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Boshuizen joined us <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/3-vcs-discuss-space-junk-and-what-else-theyre-betting-on-right-now/">last year at TC Sessions: Space</a>; the next event is coming up in December — still plenty of time to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">grab your tickets</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The head of Instagram has just <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids">announced</a> that it&#8217;s &#8220;pausing&#8221; a planned version of the social media software aimed at those younger than 13. The development comes hard on the heels of critical reporting in The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">Wall Street Journal</a> which unearthed internal documents that suggest the Facebook-owned company was aware the social media service <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">caused anxiety and mental health issues in teenaged girls</a>.</p>
<p>Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri references the WSJ report in a Twitter thread today &#8212; but he tries to play down the impact of the investigative journalism, seeking to re-spin the &#8220;pause&#8221; as intentional and thoughtful as opposed to a panicked reaction to extremely negative revelations about the impact of the service on the mental health of young girls.</p>
<p>The WSJ obtained an internal research slide from 2019 &#8212; in which Instagram&#8217;s parent Facebook acknowledged “we make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.”</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re pausing our project to build an Instagram experience for tweens, often referred to as &#8216;Instagram Kids&#8217;,&#8221; wrote Mosseri in a <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1442457312954920967">series of tweets</a> today.</p>
<p>&#8220;This experience was never meant for kids. We were designing an experience for tweens (10-12yo), and it was never going to be the same as Instagram today. Parents approve tween accounts and have oversight over who they follow, who follows them, who messages them, time spent etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the project leaked way before we knew what it would be. People feared the worst, and we had few answers at that stage. Recent WSJ reporting caused even greater concern. It’s clear we need to take more time on this.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re pausing our project to build an Instagram experience for tweens, often referred to as “Instagram Kids,” and announcing that we are building optional parental controls for teens. More here: <a href="https://t.co/fWwkK5yu6R">https://t.co/fWwkK5yu6R</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Adam Mosseri <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f637.png" alt="😷" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@mosseri) <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1442457312954920967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>If &#8220;taking more time&#8221; is a euphemism for &#8220;never&#8221;, Mosseri&#8217;s conclusion might be welcomed by the scores of child protection groups and stakeholders who have been urging Facebook to ditch the plan for months.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/facebook-instagram-for-kids-state-attorneys-general-letter/">May</a>, for instance, attorneys general from 44 U.S. states and territories penned a letter to Facebook calling on it to abandon its plan for an Instagram for under 13s.</p>
<p>Mosseri, however, has previously sought to play down concerns around the app’s negative impact on teens &#8212; dismissing them as “quite small”, as we reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">earlier this month</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IBHYuDIg5E"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">Facebook knows Instagram harms teens. Now, its plan to open the app to kids looks worse than ever</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook knows Instagram harms teens. Now, its plan to open the app to kids looks worse than ever&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/embed/#?secret=IBHYuDIg5E" data-secret="IBHYuDIg5E" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Critics will see this as a concession that the project is a bad idea. That’s not it,&#8221; the Instagram CEO went on to claim in today&#8217;s tweet thread announcing the shelving of the project &#8212; before going on to fear-monger that alternative apps under 13s might find and use could be way worse. So, uh, stay classy, Mosseri&#8230;</p>
<p>In an additional announcement that&#8217;s bundled with the headline-grabbing news it&#8217;s pulling Instagram &#8220;tweens&#8221; (as Mosseri couches it), the social media giant also reveals it&#8217;s building what it calls &#8220;optional parental controls for teens&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the time of writing the link to Instagram&#8217;s blog post about this change was not working (Update: the <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids">link</a> now works) so details are scant &#8212; but the move implies that the Facebook-owned company is feeling the heat in the wake of revelations that, per the WSJ&#8217;s reporting of its internal documents, 32% of teenage girls reported that Instagram made them have a worse body image.</p>
<p>The WSJ report also cited that, of research participants who experienced suicidal thoughts, 13% of British teens and 6% of American teens directly linked their interest in killing themselves to Instagram.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Optimove's customer relationship management marketing platform helps brands keep customers coming back.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When businesses can connect more personally with their customers, those customers in turn are more loyal. However, as consumer behavior changes, especially as it did over the past 18 months, it is more difficult to establish that connection amid all of the messages put in front of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.optimove.com/">Optimove</a>, specializing in customer relationship management marketing, wants to help brands “delight” their customers and keep them coming back. The company, with bases in Tel Aviv, New York and London, raised a $75 million growth investment led by Summit Partners.</p>

<p>The SaaS company was founded in 2012 by CEO Pini Yakuel to connect customers with brands and to apply artificial intelligence to customer data to orchestrate the right message to the right customer at the right time, and do it at scale, Yakuel told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“It’s easier when you are creating three or five customer journeys a month, but when you really scale and want to do thousands, there is not an easy way to do that,” he added. “We do that with AI orchestrators that govern all of the messages. Now you can define the message and the marketer will have all of the data and be able to get feedback and analysis of what the customer segment looks like.”</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/multichannel-marketing-market-3949">global multichannel marketing market</a> is expected to reach $28 billion by 2027, Yakuel said it will be an advantage to know who a brand’s customers are and how to target them. Optimove’s analysis of the data provides insights on how to achieve and attribute measurable improvement in such areas as churn, conversion, reactivation and lifetime value for each customer and campaign.</p>
<p>Prior to this investment, Optimove was bootstrapped for the first four years until raising $20 million. Yakuel said the company hasn’t used the money yet — it has been profitable so far. He considers the round to be Summit Partners, which is buying out the company’s earlier investors, as making a bigger commitment to the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It is a transition and phase into a new era,” he added. “It felt like the right time for us given the specific climate of fundraising. We also want to do some M&amp;A and build out our platform, but that all has to be done seamlessly. To use us today, a business may also have to use three or four other solutions and stitch them together. If we can own some of those capabilities, we can be better partners.”</p>
<p>In addition to M&amp;A, the company plans to double its staff of 300 over the next two years and invest in technology, R&amp;D and engineering to serve its 500 brand customers, including BetMGM, Papa John’s and Staples.</p>
<p>In the past year, the company saw an increase of 40% annual recurring revenue, and it sends more than 23 billion optimized messages via email, mobile, ad platforms and other channels, to over 3 billion customers annually. Next up for the company, Yakuel expects the next milestone to be an initial public offering in three years.</p>
<p>In addition to the funding, the company said Summit Partners’ head of Europe, Han Sikkens, and managing director, Steffan Peyer, are joining its board of directors.</p>
<p>Peyer said Summit invests in companies that are focused on marketing technology and are out to understand the customer journey, especially as that has become more important during the global pandemic. During this time, the cost of acquiring new customers has risen and this is where Optimove is most beneficial — enabling engagement with existing user bases, he added.</p>
<p>“What they have done is build a sophisticated customer data platform, with a sophisticated analytics orchestration engine, predicated on understanding and review the behavior of the customer and targeting micro segment campaigns to ensure the engagement level is good, and if there are other products that could be sold to a particular customer,” Peyer said. “Their modeling has a strong backend infrastructure to process data at scale and leverage that information in real time.”</p>
