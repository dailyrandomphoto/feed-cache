										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Leica&#8217;s a strange one. It only puts out a handful of cameras every year, and most of them are remixes or minor iterations on previous models. Since 2017 its flagship has been the solid but still somewhat archaic M10, but now the company has revealed its successor: <a href="https://leica-camera.com/en-US/photography/cameras/m/m11-black">the even more solid and also still somewhat archaic M11</a>.</p>
<p>Leica really defined the rangefinder style in cameras and its film models are legendary. In the digital era they are known more for their prices than anything else. While the build and image quality of the M10, Q2, and other cameras was unimpeachable, you could get a lot more camera for considerably less money elsewhere. That won&#8217;t change with the M11, but at least the new model brings some much-needed modern features.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important is the switch to a backside-illuminated sensor. This misleading term refers to putting the light-sensitive part of the sensor towards the aperture rather than letting it sit behind wiring and other components. BSI sensors usually outperform their traditionally predecessors by quite a lot, and Leica generally has a good sensor game to begin with. Interestingly they seem to have chosen a non-Bayer sub-pixel layout with an eye toward superior pixel binning.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257619" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new full-frame, 60-megapixel BSI sensor can be shot at full resolution, of course, but hardly anyone needs that these days. The 36MP and 18MP options sample the entire sensor rather than just lines or regions, reducing noise and artifacts. If I got one of these I&#8217;d switch it to 36MP and never look back. There are also 1.3x and 1.8x crop modes for those who enjoy them.</p>

<p>There are now three easily reassignable function buttons The rear touchscreen has twice the resolution of the old M10, though if you&#8217;re a real Leica fan you&#8217;ll probably have your eye to the optical finder.</p>
<p>Interestingly but controversially, the M11 uses its full sensor at all times for exposure purposes. Having the camera essentially always in &#8220;live view&#8221; mode means accurate exposures, <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/leica-m11-initial-review">but according to DPReview&#8217;s initial review</a>, it leads to longish startup times — and Leicas are generally quick as lightning to turn on and shoot with.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a USB-C port that charges the camera&#8217;s new and much larger battery, or pull shots off the card or 64-gig internal memory — or suck them directly onto your phone and a companion app (another reason not to shoot full rez).</p>
<p>Leica&#8217;s M series is unique and definitely not an option for more hobby photographers, who will rightfully balk at the $8,995 price for the M11 body — the M10 debuted at $6,600 in 2017, and even adjusting for inflation the new price is eye-popping. And of course that&#8217;s before you get any lenses!</p>
<p>But the point is not to recommend this camera specifically — more to note that Leica is still making technically interesting and quite competent cameras, the technology of which occasionally dips down to prices that mere mortals like you and I might be able to afford (after living on ramen for a month or two, anyway). Expect to see more variants of the M11 over the years but also some of the design lessons on display here applied to something more affordable. Not <em>affordable</em> affordable, but &#8220;less than a used car&#8221; affordable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The success of <a href="https://www.roblox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roblox</a> and other user-created gaming experiences like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/overwolf-raises-52-5m-for-its-platform-to-build-distribute-and-monetize-in-game-user-generated-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overwolf</a> have democratized the concept of making games and have taken it into the mainstream. Now, a startup founded by veterans from Unity, Microsoft and EA that is building a new platform for creators to build immersive games, and related communities around like-minded people, is gearing up to launch later this year. Ahead of that, it is disclosing a healthy $50 million in funding.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://yahaha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahaha Studios</a>, an Espoo, Finland-based startup with R&amp;D based in Shanghai, has yet to launch a commercial product. But it describes what it is building as a no-code &#8220;metaverse for games&#8221;, where people can come together in communities to build and play games combing virtual and real-world elements.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The $50 million that it has raised, to be clear, is not new funding: it was pulled together in a period of six months, across three rounds, nearly two years ago, all in 2020.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257472" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The company tells me that &#8220;round 1&#8221; was led by 5Y Capital; &#8220;round 2&#8221; was led by HillHouse, and &#8220;round 3&#8221; was led by Coatue. Early investors participated in subsequent rounds, and other backers include ZhenFund, Bertelsmann Asia Investments, BiliBili and Xiaomi. The funding, we&#8217;ve confirmed, values Yahaha in the range of $300 million to $500 million (&#8220;few hundred millions&#8221; is the phrase that was used when we asked).</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Yahaha Studios may still be months from launch, in the meantime it has been quietly running a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/766277288902918144/771777077875048478">Discord community</a> with a small group (around 220) of early users. The company tells me that an alpha version of the product will be launching in Q2 of this year. It is not planning to raise any more funding ahead of that, a spokesperson tells me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Metaverse&#8221; has very quickly become a very over-used word, and a number of companies claim to be blazing trails into this nebulous space, with its promises of combining augmented and virtual reality technologies to create entirely new kinds of digital experiences, gaming and otherwise. It looks like Yahaha has managed to stand apart from the crowd, and found investor attention early on, for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p dir="ltr">First of all, there are the company&#8217;s founders &#8212; Chris Zhu (CEO), Pengfei Zhang (COO) and Hao Min (CTO) &#8212; who all worked together as engineers at cross-platform gaming engine Unity, and have years of experience behind them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Zhang has been living in Finland for the last 15 years, and this is how the company got started there, but that is not the only reason for basing Yahaha in Espoo: with companies like Supercell also originating in the Helsinki suburb, there is a strong ecosystem in the region for building teams and tapping into new gaming innovations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company has confirmed that the Yahaha platform was built in partnership with Unity, a link that in turn will help onboard more creators and more cross-platform gameplay and communities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Second of all, there is the concept behind Yahaha itself, which focuses on two popular themes in tech at the moment: user-generated content and no-code development. UGC has been a popular part of online entertainment for decades at this point, but platforms like TikTok and Instagram have really given rise to a new focus on &#8220;creators&#8221;, people building huge audiences and businesses around the content that they are generating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While platforms like Twitch and Discord have made celebrities out of game players, we haven&#8217;t really yet had much in the way of platforms that make it easy for creators to build massive communities around actual games (Roblox partly addresses this but doesn&#8217;t feel like a social platform). This is what Yahaha seems to hope to become, and if it works, it could be on to something very interesting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Building the platform on a &#8220;no-code&#8221; framework, meanwhile, is what will help make Yahaha potentially used by more people. While a lot of the application of no-code has been in the area of enterprise IT (where people can, for example, easily build integrations between CRMs and accounting software), it&#8217;s interesting to see more of it making its way into consumer-focused services, specifically to serve creator communities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Achieving an investment of $50 million is incredibly exciting for us,&#8221; said CEO Chris Zhu in a statement. &#8220;<span class="il">Yahaha</span> Studios has a key part to play in ushering in the next generation of entertainment as the metaverse continues to grow. Connecting users around the world through virtual entertainment, <span class="il">YAHAHA</span> offers a unique creative and social experience to game developers and gamers alike. Through <span class="il">YAHAHA</span> we are empowering creators at all levels, from established developers to those making their first game. Everyone can be a creator in our virtual world. We’re really looking forward to fully launching this year, growing our team and bringing the first stage of our vision for the future of content creation to life.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Has Y Combinator truly changed the early-stage startup investing game, perhaps in its own favor? Or did it merely provide more time to its portfolio companies to reach their next stage of maturity?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Y Combinator’s <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/ycs-standard-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly announced plan</a> to invest more capital into startups that take part in its accelerator program is more controversial than many first assumed.</p>
<p>By raising its so-called “standard deal” to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/y-combinator-will-now-invest-500000-in-accelerator-companies/">include an additional $375,000</a>, the U.S. program and investing group with hundreds of companies in each of its accelerator classes may have materially changed the earliest stage of investing. Professional early-stage investors around the world may see their offers lose luster, possibly changing how the youngest startups that take part in Y Combinator interact with external capital.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Prior to the change, Y Combinator offered $125,000 to its accelerator participants in the form of a simple agreement for future equity, or SAFE, that reserves 7% of participating startups’ equity on a post-money basis. The new $375,000 SAFE, now part of YC&#8217;s regular transaction, is uncapped – meaning that the dollar amount will not convert into an automatic percentage stake of the company in question.</p>
<p>Stacked up against today’s myriad mega-rounds &#8212; those nine-figure checks that seem to touch down at every hour of the day &#8212; and the huge unicorn horde waiting by the private-market exits, an extra $375,000 may not seem like a big deal.</p>

According to <a href="https://twitter.com/dmikeasem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Asem</a>, a partner at the Midwest-focused <a href="https://m25vc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M25</a> venture capital shop, the new terms help Y Combinator, but come with &#8220;tradeoffs&#8221; for the group and founders themselves.</p>
<p>Naturally, Asem is talking his own book, but the fact that investors across the globe are less than enthused by the change is worth considering.</p>
<p>Has Y Combinator truly changed the early-stage startup investing game, perhaps in its own favor? Or did it merely provide more time to its portfolio companies to reach their next stage of maturity? Given the sheer number of checks that Y Combinator writes, and how much weight its imprimatur carries around the world, there may not be a more important early-stage question this year.</p>
<p>We asked investors and founders to weigh in on the matter. Notes follow from Asem; <a href="https://twitter.com/pejmannozad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pejman Nozad</a> of <a href="https://www.pear.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pear VC;</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/donutsdidthis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iris Choi</a> of <a href="https://www.floodgate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floodgate;</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanlustig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathan Lustig</a> of <a href="https://magmapartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magma Partners;</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/siggi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siggi Simonarson</a>, co-founder of <a href="https://www.buildbuddy.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BuildBuddy</a>, which took part in a 2020 Y Combinator class; and <a href="https://twitter.com/tf1aim">Torben Friehe</a>, co-founder of <a href="https://www.wingback.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wingback</a>, which is part of the Winter 2022 YC batch.</p>
<p>We’ll examine the impact that the new deal may have on startup founders, both experienced and not. We&#8217;ll also discuss what the new transaction terms mean for Y Combinator itself, whether the change was overdue, and what negative impacts could crop up around the world at different investing stages. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>How will the new YC standard deal impact founders?</h2>
<p>More capital is more capital, and some founders will benefit greatly from the new standard Y Combinator deal.</p>
<p>Floodgate’s Choi – perhaps the single most popular guest <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Equity podcast</a> – told The Exchange that the “precommitment” into a startup’s Series A “with the uncapped SAFE note is a vote of confidence for founders, especially maybe those who decide to go through YC in part because it derisks their future fundraises,” perhaps even more so when compared with “founders who would have no trouble raising.”</p>
<p>Magma’s Lustig found much to like about the new terms for one particular set of companies: “The new deal is going to be great for the Latin American companies that are extremely early, with no traction, and don&#8217;t have access to U.S. networks. The extra money will help them.”</p>
<p>The same investor <a href="https://latamlist.com/how-ycombinators-new-deal-may-affect-latin-american-startups-vcs-angels-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that the startups that are not “hot,” that feature an “underestimated founder,” or that simply want to chart their own path forward largely on the back of revenues could be winners from the new terms.</p>
<p>Thus far, then, things seem pretty good &#8212; the new terms could help startups raise, especially those companies with founders that don’t have a Stanford network or an office near South Park in San Francisco.</p>
<h2>The founder perspective</h2>
<p>We’ll get back to investors shortly, but let’s hear from a few founders that have taken part in Y Combinator.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/yc-backed-buildbuddy-raises-3-15m-to-help-developers-build-software-more-quickly/">BuildBuddy</a>&#8216;s Simonarson called the new terms “pretty exciting” because they may provide “founders more leverage.” How so? In Simonarson’s view, there was “a lot of pressure coming out of the batch to fundraise or risk running out of money” under the old investment terms.</p>
<p>“Now founders can wait until they have the traction [or] revenue [or] user metrics that allow them to raise on good terms,” he added. In the case of BuildBuddy, Simonarson said that had the company had access to a similar deal, the “money would have lasted [his company] well over two years,” which he said was quite a lot of time to build a product, learn, and make resulting tweaks.</p>
<p>Friehe of SaaS startup Wingback said that the new deal terms are “great news for the whole [Y Combinator Winter 2022] cohort, especially those companies which haven’t previously raised capital yet.”</p>
<p>Wingback didn’t need the capital, Friehe said, noting that his firm had “already raised a pre-seed round before coming into YC,” but added that the “extra cash will be helpful and allow us to grow faster than we previously anticipated.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Krafton, the developer behind PlayUnknown&#8217;s Battlegrounds,&#8221; and the maker of PUBG MOBILE, last year&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/">No. 6 top-grossing</a> mobile game on a global basis, is suing the app stores and a rival game maker, Garena, over copyright infringement involving Garena Online&#8217;s Free Fire games. The lawsuit alleges Garena&#8217;s games copy numerous aspects of its own, including its opening, its game structure and play, the combination and selection of weapons, armor and unique objects, locations, and the overall color schemes, materials and textures.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s YouTube is also named in the lawsuit for hosting videos of the infringing material.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Garena started selling a game in Singapore that copied aspects of Krafton&#8217;s game, shortly after Battlegrounds&#8217; launch in 2017. Apple and Google began selling a mobile version of this game, which was originally called Free Fire: Battlegrounds and is now called Free Fire. The Singapore claims were settled between the two companies, but Krafton never entered into a licensing agreement with Garena, the filing states.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257447" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Then, on 28 September 2021, Garena released a new title called Free Fire MAX, which is a separate mobile game distributed on Apple and Google&#8217;s app stores. This game is meant to offer the same user experience as Free Fire, Krafton says, and it also infringes on numerous aspects of Battlegrounds. The company noted the infringing game has gone on to earn &#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars&#8221; from its global sales. Apple and Google similarly profited, as they take commissions from games distributed through their app store platforms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Krafton named YouTube in the lawsuit because it hosts videos of Free Fire and Free Fire MAX gameplay. The videos have been viewed hundreds of millions of times, or in some cases, more than a million times. YouTube also hosts a feature-length live-action film that&#8217;s an infringing dramatization of Battlegrounds, the claim states.</p>
<p>Krafton says it&#8217;s turning to courts to resolve the matter because Apple and Google have not done so. It said it asked the app stores to stop distributing the game on Dec. 21, 2021, but they refused. YouTube also won&#8217;t take down the infringing videos.</p>
<p>The lawsuit comes shortly after the Nov. launch of Krafton&#8217;s follow-up title, PUBG: New State, which contains a number of new elements. The company is likely worried that its latest release will be copied, too, if this issue is not resolved.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clones of popular apps and games have been a common problem on app stores, and the growth of the subscription market has made the activity even more popular. Just this week, in fact, Apple <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/apple-pulls-wordle-clones-from-app-store/">had to clear out clones</a> of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/josh-wardle-interview-wordle/">popular online games Wordle</a>, for example. Apple is also facing a lawsuit from another developer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">who lost money to clone apps</a>. Like Wordle, other viral games in years past, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/clones-clones-everywhere-1024-2048-and-other-copies-of-popular-paid-game-threes-fill-the-app-stores/">like Threes</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/clones-clones-everywhere-1024-2048-and-other-copies-of-popular-paid-game-threes-fill-the-app-stores/">Flappy Bird</a>, have faced clones, too. But in many cases, the games are simpler, easier to copy, and faded from popularity faster. For games like PUBG Mobile, however, the financial impact of clones is at a much larger scale.</p>
<p>PUBG Mobile earned $2.7 billion in 2020, which grew to $2.9 billion by 2021, according to Sensor Tower data. Garena Free Fire saw about $1.2 billion last year, for comparison.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on Jan. 10, 2022. Krafton is asking for a jury trial to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>Krafton has often defended its gaming empire, having more recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-mobile-cheat-makers-ordered-to-pay-10-million-after-losing-lawsuit/1100-6499405/">won a lawsuit against cheaters.</a> PUBG also previously settled <a href="https://smcarthurlaw.com/pubg-netease-settle-battle-royale-copyright-lawsuit/">copyright claims with NetEase</a>, also over PUBG clones, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17509114/pubg-fortnite-lawsuit-copyright-dropped">dropped a similar suit</a> with Epic Games over Fortnite in 2018.</p>
<p>The game makers have not returned a request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s financial technology (fintech) companies out there targeting all sorts of different segments of the population, as well as companies at various stages of growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new company recently emerged that is targeting a popular startup niche, wanting to exclusively help early-stage SaaS (software-as-a-service) companies with their financial needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming out of stealth today with $150 million in debt financing and $11 million in seed funding, Arc is building what it describes as “a community of premium software companies” that gives SaaS startups a way to borrow, save and spend “all on a single tech platform.” And it’s doing it as part of a partnership with Stripe, one of the world&#8217;s largest, and most valuable private fintechs.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257147" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Arc wants to help SaaS companies grow through alternative financing methods so that they don’t have to turn to venture capitalists to fund growth at the price of diluting their ownership. Those same founders can also avoid the “restrictive covenants, guarantees, and insolvency risk associated with raising debt” if they use Arc, CEO and co-founder Don Muir said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Early-stage SaaS startups face the infamous cash-for-growth tradeoff &#8212; they are the most in need of funding yet are also in their most vulnerable state to raise capital in that they experience the highest dilution for each dollar raised,” Muir said. “This is exacerbated by the timing mismatch between monthly cash receipts from subscription software revenues and the upfront capital outlay to acquire new customers.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/don-muir/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muir</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-m-lombardo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick Lombardo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (president) and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravenjiang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raven Jiang</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CTO)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founded Arc in January of 2021 and incorporated the company in April. The trio founded Arc out of Muir’s living room in Menlo Park during their last year at the Stanford Graduate School of Business when the campus had gone into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to business school, Lombardo and Muir worked in private equity and investment banking in New York, collectively raising tens of billions of dollars of capital to finance mature, late-stage companies. It was during that time, Muir says, the pair experienced firsthand the shortcomings of traditional capital raising &#8212; namely, the “slow, offline, and transactional nature” of the deal process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An army of investment bankers, credit analysts and lawyers will spend months toiling in data rooms and building static models in Excel to close a financing transaction that ultimately costs a company millions of dollars, before taking into account the opportunity cost of management’s time,” Muir said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After meeting at Stanford, the trio came up with the concept behind Arc and then teamed up with Y Combinator to meet with hundreds of software founders in the San Francisco Bay Area. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arc was an early member of YC’s Winter 2022 batch, which commenced earlier this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We quickly realized that they shared a common pain point &#8212; startup funding is costly and distracting. Even in a zero interest rate environment, dilution is extraordinarily expensive for startup founders. At the same time, offline and bureaucratic banks with outdated underwriting policies and limited bandwidth are structurally unable to serve earlier-stage opportunities,” Muir explained. “Even premium recurring revenue software startups are neglected by traditional lenders. We founded Arc to give founders an alternative to the status quo. We’re on a mission to help startups grow &#8212; with technology and without dilution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the company launched its introductory product &#8212; Arc Advance &#8212; last summer, more than 100 startups have signed up for the Arc platform. To date, the majority of its customers have been VC-backed B2B SaaS companies seeking to accelerate their growth spend while also prolonging their runway before raising additional equity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, VCs have been a strong customer acquisition channel for Arc, noted Lombardo, who pointed to the fact that Arc’s largest partnership today is with Y Combinator, which is promoting Arc across its portfolio of thousands of software companies. Arc is also partnering with traditional capital providers, including VCs, banks and venture debt lenders. In fact, a large portion of its customers are VC-backed and seek capital from Arc “as an efficient way to smooth funding needs between episodic VC rounds,” Lombardo told TechCrunch. “</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, he said, “A Series A SaaS company is raising $1 million each quarter from Arc before its Series B late this year in order to accelerate spend &#8212; driving outsized headcount and revenue growth and resulting in a higher Series B valuation. In this example, the Series A investor also benefits financially from the reduced dilution and higher valuation that Arc’s capital unlocks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also among Arc’s customers are bootstrapped companies outside of Silicon Valley, Lombardo added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In coming months, the startup plans to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">release “a full suite” of financial tools designed “to empower SaaS founders to scale their businesses efficiently and retain control.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How it’s different and the same</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arc differs from traditional financial institutions that might deploy an army of analysts to manually underwrite transactions, its founders say, in that it uses technology to algorithmically price the risk inherent in startup financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“APIs offer real-time access to financials, machine learning enhances data value and cloud analytics unlock scalable, automated processes,” Muir said. “The result is more flexible, efficient and affordable capital that is offered programmatically to our customers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More specifically, the company is running </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">backend API integrations from companies like Plaid so that it can underwrite credit risk through real-time access to a startup’s financial data. It’s using machine learning “to drastically improve interpretation of the financial information it receives compared to manual analysis alone.” And finally, by leveraging Stripe’s banking-as-a-service technology, Arc’s customers can store and spend their funding from Arc “on a single platform designed for software companies,” the startup says. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257153" style="width: 1284px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257153" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2257153 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Arc-product.jpg" alt="" width="1274" height="954" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Arc-product.jpg 1274w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Arc-product.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Arc-product.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Arc-product.jpg?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Arc-product.jpg?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Arc-product.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1274px) 100vw, 1274px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257153" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Arc</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, Arc is not the first company to want to help SaaS companies grow without dilution. Buzzy fintech </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pipe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was founded in September 2019 with the mission of giving SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront by pairing them with investors on a marketplace that pays a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts. (Pipe describes its buy-side participants as “a vetted group of financial institutions and banks.”) The goal of that platform is to offer companies with recurring revenue streams access to capital so they don’t dilute their ownership by accepting external capital or get forced to take out loans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that Arc and Pipe have in common? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both allow founders to borrow against the future revenue of their company to grow without diluting their capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Arc emphasizes that its model is different from competitors even if missions might be similar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We aren&#8217;t a marketplace where we sell customer contracts on a Bloomberg Terminal-like platform. Instead, we build a more comprehensive relationship with our customers to help them grow over the long term,” the company says. “This approach lends to a recurring and full-service relationship with customers instead of an episodic financial transaction. It also enables Arc to be more flexible on terms and more hands on with customers. Arc backs SaaS founders for the long term and is building a vertically integrated product suite to serve their finance needs, end-to-end.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its vertical focus on SaaS also sets it apart, Muir believes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whereas competitors have prioritized horizontal expansion, Arc has doubled down on SaaS,” he told TechCrunch. “Our vertical focus allows Arc to serve the unique working capital needs and predictable, recurring revenue attributes of this premium customer profile.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This vertical industry focus also presents a SaaS startup with “a unique opportunity to generate network effects” with other SaaS companies through offerings that “benefit all members,” including financial benchmarking insights and community deals, Muir said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFX led Arc’s equity round with participation from Bain Capital, Clocktower Venture Partners, Will Smith’s Dreamers VC, Soma Capital, Alumni Ventures, Pioneer Fund and Atalaya Capital Management. Atalaya also provided the credit portion of the investment. A large number of high-profile angel investors also contributed to the round, including over 100 founders from Y Combinator-backed companies such as Vouch, Observe.AI, Eden Workplace, Teleport, RevenueCat, QuickNode, Dover, Middesk, Instabug and Rainforest QA, as well as “multiple founders of decacorn fintechs.” The ex-Stripe angel syndicate also put money in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFX founder James Currier, who led the fund’s investment in Arc, has joined the startup’s board of directors in conjunction with the financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arc is building the digitally native Silicon Valley Bank for SaaS startups,” Currier said. “The market for non-dilutive capital for SaaS startups is enormous and still very early.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y Combinator General Partner Jared Friedman likens Arc to more mature fintechs such as Stripe and Brex, saying that the company “has created a fintech product with mass appeal for startups.”</span></p>
<p>And that appeal was another draw for NFX.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arc’s vertical focus in SaaS prioritizes the SaaS founder rather than the buy-side investor and lets them build network effects into their software to benefit community members,” Currier said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last six months, Arc has grown the team from three co-founders to 15 employees, including senior software engineers coming from Google and LinkedIn, and finance and strategy folks hailing from Brex, Silicon Valley Bank and BCG. The company plans to double the team size in the first quarter of 2022, with a focus on engineering, data science, underwriting and sales.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I am disheartened to announce that Local Motors will cease to exist as of January 14,&#8221; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6887013733189599232/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="vg" data-orig-url="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6887013733189599232/" data-ml-id="2" data-ml="true" data-xid="fr1642035562594idi">wrote</a> Chris Stoner, former VP of sales and customer success. &#8220;I was only there a few months, but loved every minute of it. I made some great friends, both locally and globally, which makes it worthwhile. The autonomous vehicle space is an exciting emerging market with plenty of opportunity. Experiencing first-hand the skill and dedication of the people I worked with, I have no doubt AVs (like Olli) are the future of transportation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Olli, the company&#8217;s shuttle, a cute rectangular pod with large windows and a rounded frame, was designed for campuses and low-speed environments, like hospitals, military bases and universities.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257178" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The first generation of the shuttle debuted in 2016 in National Harbor, Maryland at a mixed-use development.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/31/come-along-take-a-ride/"> Olli 2.0</a>, a 3D printed, all-electric next gen version of the self-driving shuttle, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/toronto-will-trial-automated-shuttles-from-local-motors-in-new-pilot-program/">was meant to begin a pilot in Toronto last Spring, </a>ferrying passengers between West Rouge and Rouge Hill GO station in order to connect commuters to one of the area’s primary light rail networks for longer-distance transportation. Aside from an October 2020 announcement, news on that pilot seems to have gone quiet.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The shutdown comes only a few months after<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/local-motors-continues-growth-as-vikrant-aggarwal-becomes-chief-executive-officer-301381746.html"> Vikrant Aggrawal, formerly president and chief operating officer, took over as CEO</a>, as the company shared plans to scale production globally. Former CEO Jay Rogers transitioned to an advisory role on the company&#8217;s Board.</p>
<p>&#8220;As with most adventures, they must come to an end,&#8221; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6886785925599256576/">wrote</a> Jeff Hollowell, former VP of information technology at Local Motors. &#8220;Local Motors has closed its doors. It has been an exciting, challenging, and educational experience working with Olli and all the team at Local Motors. I was fortunate to work with amazing individuals and help build what others said could not be done! I&#8217;ve been able to grow as a leader and learn new skills that I now take to my next path forward. Thanks to all the team members and partners that I was able to work with. The time spent was well worth the effort.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Perhaps 2022 will be the year consumer health tracking moves beyond the wrist. We’ve seen Oura’s rise over the past few years and a CES that brought with it a couple of ring fitness trackers. Following Google’s addition to vital and sleep tracking on the Nest Home, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/this-lightbulb-can-monitor-your-vital-signs/">Sengled is adding the feature</a> to a smart lightbulb.</p>
<p>So, why not the face mask? Health-related face coverings have long been a fixture in a number of countries, like China, and are pretty much everywhere in this pandemic world. It’s hard to say whether mainstream adoption of masks will outlive COVID-19 in the U.S., but as the pandemic drags on, it seems increasingly likely that they’ll remain a part of daily lives for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257476" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257476" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2257476" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebit-circuitry-combined.png" alt="" width="1024" height="442" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebit-circuitry-combined.png 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebit-circuitry-combined.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebit-circuitry-combined.png?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebit-circuitry-combined.png?resize=768,332 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebit-circuitry-combined.png?resize=680,294 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebit-circuitry-combined.png?resize=1536,664 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebit-circuitry-combined.png?resize=2048,885 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebit-circuitry-combined.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257476" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Northwestern University</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257473" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The face is a solid position from which to monitor certain vitals, and the widespread adoption of masks offers a relatively fixed spot to collect that data. Accordingly, a team at Northwestern University is showing off <a href="https://facebit.health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FaceBit</a> &#8212; the “FitBit for the Face” &#8212; which attaches to an N95, surgical or cloth mask via magnet. From there, it’s able to monitor respiratory and heart rate, as well as time spent in the mask.</p>
<p>“We wanted to design an intelligent face mask for health care professionals that does not need to be inconveniently plugged in during the middle of a shift,” team leader Josiah Hester said in a statement. “We augmented the battery’s energy with energy harvesting from various sources, which means that you can wear the mask for a week or two without having to charge or replace the battery.”</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0zENpI85PDA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The system, which was recently detailed in a paper, can also determine mask fit &#8212; an issue for anyone not accustomed to using a mask. If the mask loosens or is bumped out of place, the connected app will send an alert to the wearer. Currently, the system’s battery lasts around 11 days on a charge, though the team is envisioning a battery-free version, powered by things like thermal and kinetic energy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product will need to undergo further clinical trials before proceeding, though the project has also been offered up as an open source product for those interested.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UBITS, a B2B online learning platform for upskilling employees in Latin America, has raised $25 million in funding led by Riverwood Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julián Melo and Marta Forero founded UBITS in Bogota, Colombia, in 2018 after the pair came up with the idea of “creating the Netflix for corporate training for LatAm.” They applied to Y Combinator, raised a seed round and went back to Colombia to create a program and courses that launched in January 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the beginning, we had 30 to 40 courses and the technology was not that good,” Melo admits. “Today, we have over 750 courses, which we believe is the largest catalog of corporate training available in Spanish today, as well as great features that help students apply what they learn.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257459" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also today has a “very powerful dashboard,” according to Melo, where companies can track all the learning analytics and see the number of courses, completion rates, ranking of courses and a number of other metrics. UBITS is also working on further personalizing its offering so that each employee has his/her own training path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We get to help them grow individually and in their career,” Melo said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two years, <a href="https://www.ubits.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UBITS</a> has grown its revenue by “more than 8x” and now works with hundreds of enterprises, such as Mercado Libre, Siemens and Kimberly Clark. In 2021, revenue grew by “2.5x” and more than tripled its number of customers &#8212; from 110 to nearly 350. At the end of 2021, almost 100,000 students had used its platform, up from 28,000 the year prior. The startup has also partnered with Coursera to provide access to UBITS courses in the B2C market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to have over 1,000 enterprise and midmarket customers and more than 1 million students using the platform by the end of 2022,” Melo told TechCrunch.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides Riverwood, edtech-focused Owl Ventures (which led its $5 million Series A round last June), Endeavor Catalyst and Roble Ventures also participated in the financing. The company also received a strategic investment from Stanford University. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257465" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257465" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2257465 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julian-and-Marta.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257465" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> UBITS co-founders Marta Forero and Julián Melo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UBITS offers companies an annual subscription per user so that they pay to give their employees unlimited access to a virtual content library and live sessions. The employees can choose from lessons that focus on a range of skills &#8212; from soft to technical, such as leadership, sales and commercial capabilities, technology training and education, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also partners with “top local experts” to offer micro courses and live classes. Companies can then monitor and analyze KPIs and customize their employees’ learning journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re personalizing the experience with algorithms based on AI so that we can recommend adequate courses and content to each person depending on their behavior on the platform,” Melo said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, UBITS has expanded to Mexico and Peru and, in fact, it now has dual headquarters in Mexico, where its two co-founders now live. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, students have completed over 600,000 courses on its platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital to enhance “its proprietary content” and add more than 2,000 new courses, continue to build out AI-based functionalities and launch in new locations such as Chile, Spain and other Spanish-speaking markets. It also plans to double its team of 280 this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our main goal is to create more content, improve technology and hire more engineers and people creating content, as well as people in product development, sales and customer success. We want to not only bring more customers but also retain and expand them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Francisco Alvarez-Demalde, co-founder and managing partner of Riverwood Capital, believes UBITS has developed a “disruptive employee-centric corporate learning platform with an engaging Spanish language offering that includes much-needed content for employees to advance in their professional journey and grow with their companies, while improving retention, productivity, and business outcomes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federico Storani, executive director of Riverwood Capital, is joining UBITS’ board as part of the financing. He believes that one of the startup’s biggest strengths is that its “upskilling material is approachable and addresses a clear gap in the market for employees of all levels across enterprises and mid-market companies in the region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“LatAm has the largest skills gap in the world. We want to solve this problem to help people grow, so companies will grow, and there will be a better society and economy in the region,” said Melo. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venmo is introducing a new gift-wrapping feature to give users a new way to gift money to friends and family. The new feature is starting to roll out today and gives users access to eight animated gift-wrap designs that can be added to a payment note.</p>
<p>To use the new feature, users need to tap the &#8220;Pay or Request&#8221; button and add the recipient. From there, you can tap the gift-wrap icon and select the gift-wrap you&#8217;d like to send along with the payment. Once you&#8217;ve chosen a gift-wrap, you&#8217;ll have the option to preview the animation before confirming and sending the payment.</p>
<p>The recipient will then get a notification that they&#8217;ve received a gift in the app, where they&#8217;ll be able to unwrap the gift and see the animated design. Venmo says both the sender and recipient can rewatch the animation at any time from the payment details screen. The rollout of Venmo’s new gift-wrapping feature starts today for select customers and will be available for all users in the coming weeks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257406" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2257453" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257453" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2257453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venmo-giftwrap.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venmo-giftwrap.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venmo-giftwrap.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venmo-giftwrap.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venmo-giftwrap.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venmo-giftwrap.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venmo-giftwrap.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257453" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Venmo</p></div></p>
<p>“The present emoji was one of the top ten emojis that customers used in their payment notes in 2021,&#8221; said Darrell Esch, the senior vice president and general manager at Venmo, in a statement. &#8220;We’re excited to introduce our new gift-wrapping feature to enhance this experience, enabling customers to celebrate with loved ones, no matter how big or small the moment.”</p>
<p>Venmo says 78% of users have indicated that they&#8217;ve sent money as a gift via Venmo or another person-to-person (P2P) payment service in the past year. The company says customers have been increasingly using Venmo to gift payments to others, not just for holidays or special occasions, but also as a way to show they’re thinking of them. It saw this behavior increase especially during the pandemic, as more than half of its customers who have gifted money through Venmo sent payments to say &#8221;thanks&#8221; or &#8221;just because.&#8221;</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The launch of the new feature comes as Venmo underwent a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/venmo-removes-its-global-public-feed-in-a-significant-app-redesign/">major redesign</a> last year. The company no longer offers a public, global feed of users’ transactions, as part of a significant redesign focused on expanding the app’s privacy controls and better highlighting some of Venmo’s newer features. The company only shows users their &#8220;friends feed,&#8221; which is the app’s social feed where you can see just your friends’ transactions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Retailers often build their own “orchestration” platforms for payment processing and routing, but these can be complex to maintain. Spreedly plays in this space, and, last year, new startup Gr4vy launched in the U.S. to do this in an even more fleet-of-foot manner, it claimed.</p>
<p>It raised an $11.1 million Series A last year to do that, but today it’s unveiled a further $15 million in Series A extension funding, led by March Capital, taking its total Series A stage funding to $27.2 million (including previous seed funding). The company claims this has now meant a doubling of its valuation to $115 million.</p>
<p>The San Mateo-based startup also attracted participation from Nyca Partners, Activant Capital and Plug and Play Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257452" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Unusually for orchestration platforms, Gr4vy’s cloud-native payment orchestration platform (POP) also offers Instances, which provides merchants infrastructure in the cloud. It now has partnerships with GoCardless, Banked and Akoova.</p>
<p>John Lunn, founder and CEO of Gr4vy told me: “The pandemic has made things difficult but has also been a massive opportunity because everything went online. A lot of companies and retailers’ systems weren&#8217;t prepared or fit for purpose. They went from processing 5% of their transactions online, and everything else in-store, to suddenly 100% online. So I think there&#8217;s been a huge advantage to the acceleration of digital partially caused by the pandemic.”</p>
<p>McKinsey projects that by 2025 global payments revenue will reach roughly $2.5 trillion, and by 2024 e-commerce retail sales are expected to account for 21.8% of all retail sales worldwide.</p>
<p>Solomon Hailu, partner of March Capital said: “Digital payments methods today come in more forms than ever before, resulting in merchants feeling overwhelmed… March is excited to partner with John and the Gr4vy team as they help merchants simplify and manage payment infrastructure via a cloud-native, easy-to-use, orchestration platform at a time when ecommerce strategy is mission-critical.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instacart is introducing a new &#8220;Ready Meals&#8221; hub to make it easier for users to discover and order ready-made meals from grocery stores on its app. The on-demand grocery delivery platform has <a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/updates/introducing-instacart-meals-a-new-product-for-grocers-consumers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offered</a> ready-made meals since January 2020 but says the option was not as visible or prominent in its app, which is why it&#8217;s launching the new hub. With the launch of the in-app destination, Instacart is now adding priority delivery to all ready-made meal orders, which means some orders will be delivered from grocery stores in as fast as 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Customers can use the Ready Meals hub to order prepared food from grocery stores like Publix, Giant, Food Lion, Hannaford, Stop &amp; Shop, Martin’s and Kroger. Ready-made meals from ShopRite will also be featured in the hub in the coming weeks. The prepared meals include salads, sandwiches, soups, sushi, rotisserie chicken and more.</p>
<p>“From fresh soups and salads for a quick lunch to take-and-bake casseroles, pasta dishes and meat and seafood entrees for the family dinner, we’re proud to serve as a powerful enablement partner for retailers, creating new ways for them to give busy people and families across the U.S. more ways to shop smart, eat healthy and feed their cravings faster than ever before,&#8221; said Daniel Danker, the head of product at Instacart, in a statement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257065" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement follows Instacart’s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/instacart-is-acquiring-catering-software-company-foodstorm/">acquisition</a> of FoodStorm, a SaaS order management system (OMS) that powers end-to-end order-ahead and catering experiences for grocery retailers. Instacart says that in addition to expanding FoodStorm&#8217;s technology to new partners on the Instacart Marketplace, it also plans to expand the Ready Meals hub to feature more grocers.</p>
<p>The rollout of the Ready Meals hub comes as Instacart <a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/updates/introducing-kroger-delivery-now-and-the-instacart-convenience-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> its Convenience hub in September 2021. The convenience hub allows users to place orders for common convenience items, like snacks and essentials, with a faster delivery time. The company also recently<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instacart-rolls-out-reduced-and-free-delivery-option-in-select-markets-deals-tab-and-more/"> launched</a> a new Dollar hub, which allows users to browse dollar store deals from more than 13,000 dollar stores, including Dollar Tree, 99 Cents Only Store, Five Below and Family Dollar.</p>
<p>Instacart says it has ambitious goals for the future and the new year after it had a record year in 2021. The company saw record daily and weekly order volume during the busiest holiday season in its history. Instacart says orders grew by 30% year-over-year and that its convenience business has more than doubled since June. The company says it plans to continue to unlock new ways for retailers to engage users on its platform in the future.</p>

<p>There are a handful of new pet veterinary services out there, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/bond-vet-stitches-up-170-million-from-warburg-pincus/">Bond Vet</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/small-door-the-onemedical-for-pets-launches-nyc-location/">Small Door</a>, and pet food companies have gotten into the mix in a real way, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/18/the-farmers-dog-a-customized-pet-food-subscription-service-scoops-up-8-1-million/">Farmer&#8217;s Dog</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/spot-tango-with-4-2-million-in-seed-funding-launch-unkibble/">Spot &amp; Tango</a> to name a few.</p>
<p><a href="https://fablepets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fable</a>, on the other hand, is thinking about the accessories a pup parent needs to stay sane in an urban environment, including collars, leashes, crates and toys. The company just raised $9 million in Series A, led by 14W, with participation from Female Founders Fund and Slow Ventures. And that fresh cash shows that its plan to build dog accessories that work together as an ecosystem is a smart one.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The New York-based startup is riding the waves of both pandemic-fueled puppy purchasing and the trend in how millennials take care of their pets. Like, you know, living, breathing companions.</p>
<p>But rather than focus solely on the pets themselves, Fable also makes a conscious effort to think of the pet parent, as well.</p>
<p>Fables products are all designed to make caring for a pet easier and more aesthetically pleasing, to boot.</p>
<p>The company launched with a collar and a leash, and then evolved to a new kind of hands-free leash called the Magic Link. Anyone who has tried to multitask getting coffee and walking the dog at the same time can quickly realize the value in a hands-free leash.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257431" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257431" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2257431" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?w=680" alt="Fable Magic Link" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg 8192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1M6A0877.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257431" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fable Pets</p></div></p>
<p>Fable then expanded to other use cases around caring for a dog, including a crate that can double as a side table by the bed, a dog bowl, a poop bag dispenser (that is durable enough to not need replacing after a few months) and, importantly, toys.</p>
<p>In fact, Fable&#8217;s best selling product is a game aptly called The Game. I have one for my puppy that has been an actual godsend.</p>
<p>The Game has a weighted bottom and a silicon frame wherein you can put up to a cup of kibble or treats. Inside, there is a sliding mechanism that lets you set the difficulty for your dog. From there, the pup activates both their play and their prey drive and can stay occupied for quite some time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had other treat-dispensing toys for my puppy, including puzzles and balls, that are either too easy for him (earns me five minutes) or are cheap and super loud. The Game seems to solve for those two problems.</p>
<p>Fable also released a toy called the Falcon, which dispenses treats through a small slot that the puppy has to squeeze to make open. Falcon is good on its own, but you can chain together multiple Falcons to create different, more difficult games for your little gal or guy.</p>
<p>All of these products are designed to look good in a small space, with matching earth and jewel-tone coloring.</p>
<p>This is where the real genius of Fable lies.</p>
<p>One product leads to another. Once you&#8217;ve purchased the essentials &#8212; a collar and leash &#8212; it makes sense to buy a matching toy or poop bag dispenser from a now-trusted brand. If your dog loves The Game, why not buy the Falcon? Why not buy two? And if you have a Falcon, did you know it can hang down on the inside of the Crate so your dog can stay busy and stimulated in there? And while you&#8217;re at it, why not get a matching bowl?</p>
<p>But Fable isn&#8217;t resting there. The company is thinking not only of new use cases to add into the portfolio, but ways to enhance existing products. For example, sibling founders Jeremy Canade and Sophie Bakalar described plans to sell an add-on to the Crate. (Right now, it has no drawer or compartment for storing human stuff.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257432" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257432" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2257432" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-1.png?w=680" alt="Fable The Crate" width="680" height="357" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-1.png 728w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-1.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-1.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-1.png?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257432" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fable Pets</p></div></p>
<p>Canade also hinted at a different insert for The Game that would change the difficulty of the toy for the dog.</p>
<p>Planned obsolescence isn&#8217;t part of the strategy here, but rather, what else can the company offer to enhance existing products while releasing new ones?</p>
<p>The startup has had quite a bit of success using this strategy.</p>
<p>In 2021, there have been more than 20,000 people on the waitlist for the Crate, and Fable sold a unit of The Game every five to 10 minutes over the holidays.</p>
<p>Overall, the business grew approximately 3x year over year, according to the team.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t hurt, either, that people naturally love sharing content around their dogs. The organic marketing around products like the Magic Link and The Game has helped spread the word tremendously, according to Canade and Bakalar.</p>
<p>Fable&#8217;s price point leans more toward the premium end of the Spectrum. The Crate stands out specifically at $395 — you can pick up a crate on Amazon or PetCo for $40. But Bakalar explained that the pricing depends on how you benchmark the products themselves. The Crate, for example, is also a bedside table, so when comparing it to prices at West Elm or Restoration Hardware, it&#8217;s much more in line.</p>
<p>The Game is $55, the Magic Link is $65 and the Waste Bag Holder is $35, to give you some idea of the range for pricing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those [competing] products are designed to be thrown away in the short term,&#8221; said Canade. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to actually rethink the products from scratch and make things that are both for the animal and the human. They&#8217;re meant to live in both those worlds simultaneously. Nobody is doing that. Everybody is either designing only for the human, with a quality grade that is not meant to stand up to the wear and tear of a dog, or only for a dog, without considering the human use case.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As competition amid digital banks heats up, U.S. fintech <a href="https://current.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Current</a> is rolling out a new product designed to make its banking service more appealing. The company announced this morning it&#8217;s launching a new high-yield offering called &#8220;Interest&#8221; that allows any Current account holder to earn a 4.00% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) &#8212; a rate that&#8217;s 60x higher than the national average, it notes.</p>
<p>The Interest offering will be made available to all Current users, including those on Current&#8217;s free Basic plan as well as Premium users who pay to access upgraded features. (The latter group also likely helps Current be able to afford to boost its APY, in fact, as Premium <a href="https://support.current.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408091015195-What-types-of-accounts-does-Current-offer-#basic-account-no-monthly-fee--0-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subscribers pay</a> $4.99 per month for Current&#8217;s expanded service.)</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s common for neobanks to offer a higher APY than traditional banks, many banking services require users to jump through hoops to reach the higher rate. For example, <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Finance</a> offers a 1.00% APY in its &#8220;Save&#8221; product on funds up to $5,000, but to get its higher 3.00% rate, you have to set up the auto-savings feature. Aspiration and Varo also offer a 3.00% APY, but <a href="https://my.aspiration.com/faq/Spend---Save%3EAspiration-Save%3EWhat-interest-rates-are-offered-for-Aspiration-Save-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have their own requirements</a> around spending, <a href="https://www.varomoney.com/savings-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">balances, total direct deposits</a> and more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257375" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Current&#8217;s new offering, however, pays out on funds up to a total of $6,000 annually, the company says. It also notes there is no minimum balance required and no direct deposit or spending requirement. However, what makes its product different is that all members will be able to earn interest on their funds on a daily basis. (Typically, banks pay the interest monthly.)</p>
<p>Plus, the catch on Current&#8217;s product is that the $6,000 total has to be spread across its Savings Pods. So the APY is earned on up to $2,000 per pod. That makes it more of a viable choice for customers just starting to save and who want to organize their money into different groupings, rather than someone looking to park a larger balance.</p>

<p>Current tells TechCrunch it&#8217;s not introducing this high-yield product at a higher rate which it aims to bring down later, over time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not approaching this as a promotional rate,&#8221; explains Current VP of Product, Josh Stephens. &#8220;We&#8217;re approaching it as something that&#8217;s available for all for the foreseeable future&#8230;I think, certainly, you see promotional rates from other folks out there with a lot of bells and whistles attached to it. But this is something that&#8217;s available for anyone, with no balance minimum, no fees,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The company also sees the rate as a way to better promote its banking service in a crowded landscape. Current, which got its start as a teen banking service, expanded over the years to offer a more competitive product for adults &#8212; including those without kids. Like many digital banking services, Current offers perks like fee-free overdrafts, cashback, fee-free ATMs, faster direct deposits, automated savings, money management tools and more. With Interest&#8217;s launch, it&#8217;s now responding to customer demands for better savings products, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inflation has been rising at one of the highest rates in 40 years over the last couple of months. [The Consumer Price Index] has been rising at the fastest pace since the early 80s,&#8221; says Stephens. &#8220;And for our members &#8212; and for a lot of Americans &#8212; this meant their money just isn&#8217;t going as far as they need. That means they&#8217;re paying more for the same goods and services. It&#8217;s making it harder to put money aside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Current believes the existing options on the market make it difficult for banking customers to meaningfully grow their money.</p>
<p>The change could encourage some banking customers who have their funds parked in savings elsewhere to move over to Current&#8217;s service instead. Over time, they may upgrade to premium Current products and services, making the higher APY worth it from a business perspective.</p>
<p>Today, Current has more than 3 million members, free and paid, with an average age of 27 among its member base &#8212; younger than many competitors.</p>
<p>Longer-term, the company plans to roll out more offerings to help these customers further grow their money. It&#8217;s planning to enter the crypto space, having last year <a href="https://current.com/blog/current-acala-announce-partnership-establish-new-category-of-hybrid-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a partnership</a> with Acala to create a new category of &#8220;hybrid finance&#8221; which will combine the benefits of traditional banking and decentralized finance. Consumer lending is also on its roadmap.</p>
<p>Current&#8217;s new Interest product will begin to roll out today across iOS and Android.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A New York bill that would ban state law enforcement from obtaining residents&#8217; private user data from tech giants through the use of controversial search warrants will get another chance, two years after it was first introduced.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/A84" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reverse Location Search Prohibition Act</a> was reintroduced to the New York Assembly and Senate last year by a group of Democratic lawmakers after the bill previously failed to pass. Last week, the bill was referred to committee, the first major hurdle before it can be considered for a floor vote.</p>
<p>The bill, if passed, would be the first state law in the U.S. to end the use of geofence warrants and keyword search warrants, which rely on asking technology companies to turn over data about users who were near the scene of a crime or searched for particular keywords at a specific point in time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257402" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For geofence warrants — also known as &#8220;reverse location&#8221; warrants — law enforcement asks a judge to order Google, which collects and stores billions of location data points from its users&#8217; phones and apps, to turn over records on whose phones were in a certain geographical radius at the time of a crime to help identify possible suspects. Geofence warrants are a uniquely Google problem; law enforcement knows to tap Google&#8217;s databases of location data, which the search giant uses to drive its ads business, last year netting the company close to $150 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a similar process for Google searches; law enforcement asks a judge for a warrant to demand that Google turns over <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/google-is-giving-data-to-police-based-on-search-keywords-court-docs-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who searched for certain keywords</a> during a particular window of time. Although less publicly known, keyword search warrants are in growing use and aren&#8217;t limited to just Google; Microsoft and Yahoo (which owns TechCrunch) have <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/10/04/google-keyword-warrants-give-us-government-data-on-search-users/?sh=376f6d797c97" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also been tapped</a> for user data using this kind of legal process.</p>
<p>The use of these warrants has been called &#8220;fishing expeditions&#8221; by internet rights groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which recently <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/01/standing-privacy-new-york-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lent its support</a> to the New York bill, along with <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/en/news/dragnet-warrants-are-trapping-innocent-people" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the ACLU</a>. Critics say these kinds of warrants are unconstitutionally broad and invasive because they invariably collect data on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/minneapolis-protests-geofence-warrant/">nearby innocent people</a> with no connection to the crime.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported last year that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/minneapolis-protests-geofence-warrant/">Minneapolis police used a geofence warrant</a> to identify protesters accused of sparking violence in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. Similar encounters reported by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/google-tracked-his-bike-ride-past-burglarized-home-made-him-n1151761" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBC News</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/16/geofence-warrants-reverse-search-warrants-police-google" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guardian</a> revealed how entirely innocent people have been tacitly accused of criminality simply for being close to the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/google-geofence-warrants/">data published by Google</a>, geofence warrants make up about one-quarter of all U.S. legal demands it receives. Since Google became widely known among law enforcement as a source for connecting location data and search terms to real-world suspects, Google processed more than 11,500 geofence warrants in 2020, up from less than a thousand in 2018 when the practice was still in its relative infancy.</p>
<p>New York state accounted for about 2-3% of all geofence warrants, amounting to hundreds of warrants in total.</p>
<p>Zellnor Myrie, a New York state senator who represents central Brooklyn and sponsored the Senate bill, told TechCrunch: &#8220;In dense, urban communities like the ones I represent in Brooklyn, hundreds or thousands of innocent people who merely live or walk near a crime scene could be ensnared by a geofence warrant that would turn over their private location data. And keyword search warrants would identify users who have searched for a specific term, name or location. Our bill would ban these types of warrants and protect New Yorkers&#8217; privacy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.stoik.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stoïk</a>, a new French startup that wants to protect small and medium companies against cybersecurity incidents. The company offers an insurance product as well as a service that monitors your attack surface.</p>
<p>The startup recently raised a $4.3 million (€3.8 million) seed round from Alven Capital, Anthemis Group, Kima Ventures as well as several business angels, such as Raphaël Vullierme, Emmanuel Schalit and Henry Kravis.</p>
<p>Stoïk targets SMEs specifically, as they are quite vulnerable when it comes to ransomware and other cyber attacks. And yet, small companies often aren’t doing enough to protect their software infrastructure.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257383" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We’re going to insure you and protect you,” co-founder and CEO Jules Veyrat told me. “But what we’re going to sell is the insurance product. If you get attacked, you have a phone number that you can call 24/7 and all the cost implications are insured.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Stoïk is going to offer monitoring tools so that small companies can fix vulnerabilities in their infrastructure. In that case, incentives between Stoïk and Stoïk’s clients remain aligned.</p>
<p>The team of 15 have already signed partnerships with insurance companies to design the insurance products. Stoïk sells insurance products and charges its clients directly — it takes a cut on each contract. It works with a third-party company called <a href="https://www.inquest-risk.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inquest</a> to handle crisis management.</p>
<p>Stoïk works a bit like <a href="https://www.coalitioninc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coalition</a> in the U.S., except that it doesn’t partner with brokers to distribute its insurance product. The French startup wants to build a direct relationship with its customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for the tech product, when you sign up to the service, you enter your domain name and start a scan. Stoïk looks at DNS records, finds IP addresses and scans online databases for password leaks associated with this domain name.</p>
<p>You get a score and several tips to improve that score. For instance, Stoïk can tell you that some services are externally exposed even though they shouldn&#8217;t be. If your score is above a certain threshold and if you generate less than €50 million in annual revenue, you can subscribe to the insurance product.</p>
<p>The company is currently in the pre-launch phase with contracts that range from €50 to €400 per month. Up next, it plans to add more features to its monitoring service. For instance, Stoïk wants to scan internal accounts. You could imagine scanning your Amazon Web Services configuration to spot some vulnerabilities. And that should also help when it comes to closing new contracts with potential customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies use invoices to pay for many of their major costs, ranging from materials to contract work. Most still rely on solutions built on top of bank transfers or credit cards to complete cross-border payments, which </span><a href="https://gocardless.com/en-us/guides/posts/international-bank-transfer-times/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically take two-five days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to complete and </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/accelerating-winds-of-change-in-global-payments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">represent a $130 trillion global market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise payments startup <a href="https://paysail.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paysail</a> just raised seed funding to build a tool that shortens the cross-border payment process to less than five seconds, the company says. Its solution leverages stablecoins, which it describes as “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price because they are pegged to a commodity or currency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using stablecoins to pay invoices also reduces transaction fees for businesses by removing third-party intermediaries, according to Paysail. Other startups in the space using traditional banking infrastructure to make payments more efficient have hit a ceiling on how fast and cheap they can offer payments because of fees charged by these intermediaries, particularly between countries that don’t transact as regularly, Paysail cofounder Nicole Alonso told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256907" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2256921" style="width: 376px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256921" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2256921" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="366" height="274" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg 5120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Liam_Nicole_Paysail-5318_r_high-res.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256921" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Paysail co-founders Nicole Alonso and Liam Brennan-Burke. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Paysail</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There have been enormous strides in making payments between, let&#8217;s say, the U.S. and Canada, significantly cheaper and quicker. But if you&#8217;re sending a payment from the U.S. to [a country in] Africa, it could still be really difficult and cost exorbitant fees,” Alonso said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of making a cross-border payment using legacy systems like Bill.com usually includes a transaction fee charged by the third-party intermediary as well as a currency exchange fee. A transfer done through Paysail, in contrast, costs only a “gas fee” it takes for the transaction to be validated on the blockchain, currently less than one-tenth of a cent, Alonso said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paysail is currently using Celo’s CUSD stablecoin, which tracks the price of the U.S. dollar, to enable payments and plans to expand to other stablecoins backed by different countries’ fiat currencies as it grows. It is also evaluating a transaction fee of around 0.9% to generate revenue for the business, which Alonso said could be structured as a tiered offering based on each company’s transaction volume and will ideally “significantly undercut any existing competitors in the non-crypto space” on price. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company announced its $4 million seed round today </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">led by Uncork Capital, with support from Tribe Capital, Pear VC and Mischief Capital. Angel investors Nik Milanović, head of business development and strategy at Google Pay, and Juan Manuel Fernández Lobato, founder and CEO of Ebury, also participated in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paysail’s current users comprise “a small cohort” of companies, most of which are already transacting in cryptocurrency or are familiar with the space, Alonso co-founder Liam Brennan-Burke told TechCrunch. The company wants to fine-tune its solution for crypto-native customers before expanding to those that have no prior crypto experience, Brennan-Burke added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alonso and Brennan-Burke, who launched Paysail after meeting as students at Claremont McKenna College last year, are Paysail’s only full-time employees today. They plan to use their funding to hire a full-time engineering team, as well as legal counsel and eventually a sales team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paysail is building its tech to allow users who don’t have an existing crypto wallet to start transacting on its platform by generating a noncustodial wallet on users’ behalf through a third-party wallet provider. It aims to eventually bring this functionality in-house and add new features within the Paysail wallet like allowing users to earn yield on their stablecoin holdings, Brennan-Burke said. In countries like Nigeria, where local fiat currency depreciation poses a significant risk, companies may prefer to hold their wealth in stablecoins pegged to less volatile currencies and transfer it into local fiat on their own timeline, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The goal ultimately with the platform is to continue making cryptocurrency payments really digestible and easy to use, and not so daunting for those businesses and individuals who don&#8217;t have any prior experience with it,” Brennan-Burke said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As cloud infrastructure projects grow increasingly complex, there&#8217;s been a trend in the industry to launch prepackaged solutions for specific verticals. Today, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/databricks-raises-1-6b-at-38b-valuation-as-it-blasts-past-600m-arr/">well-funded</a> data analytics firm Databricks is joining the fray with its first vertical-specific solution: Lakehouse for Retail. The promise here is to offer a fully integrated platform that can help retailers extract value from the vast volumes of data they generate, be that through traditional analytics or by leveraging Databricks&#8217; AI tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an important milestone on our journey to help organizations operate in real time, deliver more accurate analysis and leverage all of their customer <span class="il">data</span> to uncover valuable insights,&#8221; said Databricks CEO and co-founder Ali Ghodsi. &#8220;Lakehouse for Retail will empower <span class="il">data</span>-driven collaboration and sharing across businesses and partners in the retail industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the early adopters for the platform include the likes of Walgreens, Columbia and H&amp;M Group. These users get access to the full Databricks platform, but also &#8212; and most importantly &#8212; a set of Lakehouse for Retail Solution Accelerators that offer what Databricks calls a &#8220;blueprint of <span class="il">data</span> analytics and machine learning use cases and best practices,&#8221; which can ideally save new users months of development time. These include templates for real-time streaming data ingestion, demand forecasting, recommendation engines and tools for measuring customer lifetime value. It&#8217;s worth noting that Databricks previously offered <a href="https://databricks.com/solutions/accelerators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar blueprints</a>, but customers had to assemble these for themselves instead of Databricks offering them as part of an integrated solution.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257320" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;With hundreds of millions of prescriptions processed by Walgreens each year, <span class="il">Databricks</span>’ Lakehouse for Retail allows us to unify all of this <span class="il">data</span> and store it in one place for a full range of analytics and ML workloads,&#8221; said Luigi Guadagno, vice president, Pharmacy and HealthCare Platform Technology at Walgreens. &#8220;By eliminating complex and costly legacy <span class="il">data</span> silos, we’ve enabled cross-domain collaboration with an intelligent, unified <span class="il">data</span> platform that gives us the flexibility to adapt, scale and better serve our customers and patients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the course of the last few years, Databricks has been trying to popularize the concept of the &#8220;lakehouse,&#8221; which combines the best of data warehouses for analytics and data lakes for storing vast amounts of raw data that has yet to be operationalized.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Serve Robotics, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/uber-spins-out-delivery-robot-startup-as-serve-robotics/">Uber spinout that builds sidewalk delivery robots</a>, is deploying its next generation of robots that are capable of completing some commercial deliveries without a human in the loop, according to the startup. That means in certain operational design domains, or geofenced areas, Serve won&#8217;t be relying on remote operators to teleassist robots or followers to trail behind the robots for safety.</p>
<p>Most companies in the industry, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/driveu-auto-to-power-remote-piloting-of-easymiles-autonomous-shuttles-cocos-sidewalk-robots/">Coco</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/starship-technologies-is-bringing-food-delivery-robots-to-four-more-us-college-campuses-this-year/">Starship Technologies</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/kiwibot-partners-with-hospitality-giant-sodexo-to-bring-food-delivery-robots-to-college-campuses/">Kiwibot</a>, lean on remote operators to monitor autonomous deliveries and take over driving in case the robot stops or needs help, so Serve&#8217;s milestone is indeed a step toward progress in robotic deliveries.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The problem we have solved is that relying on teleoperation for safety means you must count on 100% reliable LTE networks and 100% mistake-free operators, both of which are impossible to achieve consistently,&#8221; Ali Kashani, co-founder and CEO of Serve, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Consider what happens when a safety situation requires human attention, but the video is delayed or the connection has dropped? With Level 4 robots, humans are not needed to be in the loop to ensure safety.&#8221;</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257117" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Serve began rolling out its next generation of robots in December and says it recently completed its first delivery at Level 4 autonomy, which <a href="https://www.sae.org/news/press-room/2018/12/sae-international-releases-updated-visual-chart-for-its-%E2%80%9Clevels-of-driving-automation%E2%80%9D-standard-for-self-driving-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAE defines</a> as a system that can drive autonomously as long as certain conditions are met and will not require a human to take over driving. The startup&#8217;s robots currently have L4 capabilities in some neighborhoods in Los Angeles, such as Hollywood, where Serve has been operating since 2018, Kashani said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the robot is in a given area where Level 4 is enabled, <span style="font-weight: 400;">the remote video feed turns off and the robot continues navigating autonomously without requiring a human in the loop,&#8221; Kashani told TechCrunch. &#8220;The robots can always request assistance if in need of one, say if they come across something unexpected. They also turn video on while crossing intersections. But for the majority of the time they operate autonomously.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Until autonomous vehicles reach Level 5 capability, under which the system can operate in all conditions without a human, there will always be a long tail of edge cases that robots are unfamiliar with. Relying on humans for those makes sense from both a safety and commercialization perspective, said Kashani.</p>
<p>Serve&#8217;s new robots are equipped with a range of active sensors, like ultrasonics and lidar sensors from Ouster, and passive sensors like cameras to help navigate busy sidewalks. The startup has developed specific capabilities for its bots, like automatic crash prevention, vehicle collision avoidance and fail-safe emergency braking, according to the company. The computations needed to produce those capabilities in real-time are powered by chip-maker Nvidia&#8217;s Jetson platform, which is designed specifically for robots and other autonomous machines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/uber-spinout-serve-robotics-gets-13m-seed-round-to-expand-sidewalk-robot-deliveries/">a $13 million expanded seed round last month</a>, which it said would be used to fund accelerated expansion plans into new customer segments and geographic areas. In line with those stated goals, Kashani said Serve&#8217;s next steps are to deploy its next-gen robots in more areas, starting with expanding in Los Angeles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we’ve learned in the last few years, &#8220;human error&#8221;-led cybersecurity breaches are the ones companies often find hardest to guard against. Surveys suggest some 85% of attacks can be traced back to the human factor. Thus startups built to alleviate this gap — such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/cybsafe-raises-7-9m-series-a-led-by-iq-capital-for-its-behavioral-cybersecurity-platform/">the U.K.’s Cybsafe</a>, which raised $7-9 million last year — are proliferating. Addressing human behavior is clearly one of the hottest new areas for cyber.</p>
<p>The latest to scale up in this space is <a href="https://sosafe-awareness.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoSafe</a>. The Cologne-based cybersecurity awareness and testing platform has now raised a $73 million Series B funding round led by growth-capital fund Highland Europe.</p>
<p>Existing investors Acton Capital and Global Founders Capital were joined by SAP Hybris founder and Celonis Advisory Board member Carsten Thoma, together with La Famiglia as well as Adjust founder Christian Henschel as participants.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257368" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>SoSafe competes with platforms like Knowbe4 (that went public in 2021) and Cofense, which has raised $58 million to date.</p>
<p>SoSafe says it takes a user-centered approach to cybersecurity, using insights from behavioral science to nudge users in the right, and safer, direction, using gamified methods to teach end-users what to look out for in a cyber attack.</p>
<p>It now has more than 1,500 customers, including Aldi, Ceconomy AG, Taylor Wessing, Vattenfall and Valtech.</p>
<p>Dr. Niklas Hellemann, co-founder and managing director of SoSafe, said: “Challenging the existing paradigms in security awareness and human risk management, we have seen tremendous adoption of our platform and extraordinary growth.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lead investor Highland Europe has previously backed security companies such as Malwarebytes, Cobalt and ActiveFence.</p>
<p>Gajan Rajanathan, partner at Highland Europe, said: “SoSafe’s founders have built a trusted cybersecurity awareness and testing platform, underpinned by behavioral analytics and human risk scoring that sustainably protects the most important threat surface in cybersecurity &#8212; human security breaches. They have rapidly emerged as one of the leading software scale-ups, experiencing incredible momentum in a short period of time.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starting an e-commerce business on one of the large marketplaces, for example, Shopify, can be an easy process, but what the team at <a href="https://www.swell.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swell</a> began to notice was that the model could only take a business so far.</p>
<p>Swell is working in “headless” commerce, which means it is disconnecting the front end of a website, aka the storefront, from the back end, where all of the data lives, to create a better shopping experience and so that anything on the back end can be updated and maintained without disturbing the front end.</p>
<p>The remote-first company offers APIs, storefronts and a dashboard, all tools that can grow with any sized company. The first version of Swell was a pure API for developers, but it wasn’t enabling businesses to get up-and-running quickly, so businesses were turning to marketplaces like Shopify, CEO Eric Ingram told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257099" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The key is getting started quickly, which Shopify is awesome at, but you realize you are stuck when you try to do more than the basic model,” Ingram said. “We needed to build something that was as easy as Shopify, but enabled you to grow. Most people can’t afford to build their own back end, so we also wanted to provide something people could do without spending millions of dollars.”</p>
<p>Swell was an idea Ingram had about a decade ago that stemmed from his experience at e-commerce company Digital River and then building a few of his own businesses, including a clothing company. He and his team got things off the ground in 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/headless-commerce-startup-swell-raises-3-4m/">raising $3.4 million in a seed round</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Headless commerce startup Swell raises $3.4M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/headless-commerce-startup-swell-raises-3-4m/embed/#?secret=ZJmcujxGcF" data-secret="ZJmcujxGcF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nearly a year later, the company is back again with $20 million in Series A funding, led by VMG Catalyst and Headline, with participation from Bonfire Ventures, Willow Growth, Commerce Ventures and Red Antler. Individual investors include Attentive CEO Brian Long, Gorgias CEO Romain Lapeyre, Remote First Capital and former CTO of Product Hunt Andreas Klinger, Fast.co CEO Domm Holland and Warby Parker’s Brian Magida.</p>
<p>The opportunity for additional funding was somewhat unexpected, according to Ingram, but he feels like Swell’s focus on small and mid-market companies, while building an ecosystem and community, separates it from competitors like Commercetools and Fabric that are targeting larger companies.</p>

<p>“To solve the problem, it has to be something accessible to everyone rather than just big companies with big budgets,” Ingram added. “Some of the platforms are only good at one thing, but there are hundreds of other models out there.”</p>
<p>In the past year, Swell grew five times in revenue and grew its customer base to over 1,000 at the end of 2021 after starting the year with 30 customers. It also created a free community plan, where customers begin paying when they start selling, to go with the standard and enterprise options.</p>
<p>Ingram expects to use the new funding to grow Swell’s team of 30 to 100 in the next 12 months and in product development, including building an app ecosystem. Plans include building out a framework for third parties to build the apps and also for customers to be able to own their own data on the back end and do more with it, something that is difficult for businesses building on marketplaces to do, he said.</p>
<p>“A core feature will be a configurable database that could adapt to new use cases,” he added. “The market is moving fast with integrations and building apps and the community will require 10 times more people to get to the next level.”</p>
