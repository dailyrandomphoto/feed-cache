<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;I wanted to discuss this now so that you can see the future that we&#8217;re working towards and how our major initiative across the company are going to map to that,&#8221; Zuckerberg said on the call. &#8220;What is the metaverse? It&#8217;s a virtual environment where you can be present with people in digital spaces. You can kind of think of this as an embodied internet that you&#8217;re inside of rather than just looking at.&#8221;</p>
<p>These comments echoed an interview he gave to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview">The Verge</a> last week, detailing some of the company&#8217;s future goals.</p>
<p>The metaverse offers Facebook an opportunity to draw a line between its moonshot efforts and its core business, building a wide-reaching hub that shines on augmented reality and virtual reality platforms but feels just as friendly on mobile and desktop. Zuckerberg&#8217;s definition of metaverse is more broad than some others, but comes down to building a version of the web that feels more like an MMO than a collection of web pages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_1886645" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1886645" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1886645 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Facebook-Horizon-World-Builder.png" alt="Facebook Horizon World Builder" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Facebook-Horizon-World-Builder.png 1140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Facebook-Horizon-World-Builder.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Facebook-Horizon-World-Builder.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Facebook-Horizon-World-Builder.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Facebook-Horizon-World-Builder.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Facebook-Horizon-World-Builder.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1886645" class="wp-caption-text">Early renders of Facebook&#8217;s Horizon platform. Image via Facebook.</p></div></p>
<div class="c-message_kit__gutter__left">
<p>It’s hard to imagine now, but Facebook was late to mobile. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A decade ago, Facebook’s apps were buggy, crash-prone HTML5 experiences, even as smooth native mobile apps were quickly becoming the standard for major software makers. By 2012, Zuckerberg realized that apps were the future — quickly becoming the present — and the Facebook founder scrambled to turn the company’s attention toward mobile at every level. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Facebook doesn’t intend to make the same mistake twice. That philosophy first became abundantly clear when the company bought the industry-leading VR hardware maker Oculus in 2014.</span></p>
</div>
<p>“Mobile is the platform of today, and now we’re also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow,” Zuckerberg said around the time of the two billion dollar acquisition. “Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate.”</p>
<p>Becoming &#8220;a metaverse company&#8221; is a further evolution of this thinking. For many, Roblox has seemed to be the clearest embodiment of the metaverse today &#8212;  a social world where users can jump between virtual experiences while creating their own experiences inside it. It&#8217;s notably not a virtual reality experience instead thriving largely on mobile and desktop. Roblox&#8217;s vision has resonated with investors, the now-public company is worth more than $45 billion &#8212; a fraction of Facebook&#8217;s value but more than almost any other games company in the West.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UcyfCTVvyS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebook-buys-studio-behind-roblox-like-crayta-gaming-platform/">Facebook buys studio behind Roblox-like Crayta gaming platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook buys studio behind Roblox-like Crayta gaming platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebook-buys-studio-behind-roblox-like-crayta-gaming-platform/embed/#?secret=UcyfCTVvyS" data-secret="UcyfCTVvyS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Facebook has been signaling its continued interest in this space. In June they bought a Roblox-like platform called Crayta for an undisclosed sum, and they&#8217;ve spent much of the last several years buying up a host of VR-focused game studios.</p>
<p>The company has tried to build its own VR-centric social hubs but most have fallen flat. Facebook&#8217;s metaverse-like Horizon platform garnered major headlines when it was announced nearly two years ago, but the company has had little to say during its exceedingly quiet beta period. This week, Facebook&#8217;s Andrew Bosworth <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boz/posts/much-of-the-work-weve-been-doing-at-facebook-reality-labs-connects-deeply-to-the/10113772424752191/">detailed</a> that Gaming VP Vivek Sharma would be taking over the effort under a new metaverse-centric product group led by Instagram&#8217;s Vishal Shah.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a very particular distinction in Facebook&#8217;s choice of rebranding itself as a &#8220;metaverse&#8221; company as opposed to an AR/VR one. While some might have seen specialized hardware as essential to a spatial internet, it&#8217;s become increasingly clear that users aren&#8217;t clamoring to embrace early headsets even as other new gaming platforms greatly accelerate their growth. While the company&#8217;s Quest 2 headset has sold much better than its previous devices &#8212; according to Facebook which has yet to release any hard sales numbers &#8212; it&#8217;s unclear whether they truly need a world full of users with Facebook glasses and headsets strapped to their faces in order to embrace this metaverse ideal &#8212; or whether that would just be the cherry on top.</p>

<p><a href="https://inkr.com/">INKR</a> is a digital comics platform that crosses cultural and language divides, enabling creators to reach global audiences with its proprietary localization technology. Previously bootstrapped, the company announced today that it has raised $3.1 million in pre-Series A funding led by Monk’s Hill Ventures, with participation from manga distributor TokyoPop founder and chief executive Stu Levy and VI Management managing director David Do.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Singapore with an office in Ho Chi Minh City, INKR was founded in 2019 by Ken Luong, Khoa Nguyen and Hieu Tran. The company says that since it launched in October 2020, its monthly average users have grown 200%. It currently partners with more than 70 content creators and publishers, including FanFan, Image Comics, Kodansha USA, Kuaikan, Mr. Blue, SB Creative, TokyoPop and Toons Family, and has more than 800 titles so far, including manga, webtoons and graphic novels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Luong, INKR’s CEO, told TechCrunch that the platform will focus first on translated comics from top global publishers, but plans to open to small and indie creators in 2022.</p>
<p>At the heart of INKR’s platform is its localization technology, which the company says reduces the time spent on preparing comics for different markets from days to just hours.</p>
<p>“Comics localization is more than just translation. It is a time-consuming process with many steps involving many people—file handling, transcription, translation, typesetting, sound effects, quality control, etc,” Luong said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182962" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182962" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2182962" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png" alt="A screenshot with some of the titles on digital comics platform INKR" width="450" height="974" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INKR_Screenshot_1.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2182962" class="wp-caption-text">Some of the titles on INKR</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to language, publishers also have to take into account the differences between comic styles around the world, including Japanese manga, Chinese manhua, Korean manhwa, American comics. For example, comics can be laid out page-by-page or use vertical scrolling. Some languages read from left to right, while others go from right to left.</p>
<p>Luong says INKR’s proprietary AI engine, called INKR Comics Vision, is able to recognize different formats and elements on a comic page, including text, dialogue, characters, facial expressions, backgrounds and panels. INKR Localize, its tool for human translators, helps them deliver accurate translations more quickly by automating tasks like text transcription, vocabulary suggestions and typesetting.</p>
<p>Since localization is performed by teams, including people in different locations, INKR provides them with browser-based collaboration software. The platform supports Japanese-English, Korean-English and Chinese-English translations, with plans to add more languages. Some publishers, like Kuaikan Manhua and Mr. Blue, have used INKR to translate thousands of comic chapters from Chinese and Korean into English.</p>
<p>INKR provides content creators with a choice of monetization models, including ad-supported, subscription fees or pay-per-chapter. Luong says the platform analyzes content to tell publishers which model will maximize their earnings, and shares a percentage of the revenue generated.</p>
<p>INKR is vying for attention with other digital comics platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/10/amazon-acquires-digital-comic-book-service-comixology/">Amazon-owned Comixology </a>and Webtoon, the publishing portal operated by Naver Corporation.</p>

<p>Luong said INKR’s competitive advantages include the the diversity of comics is offers and the affordability of its pricing. Before launching, it also invested in data and AI-based technology for both readers and publishers. For example, users get personalized recommendation based on their reading activity, while publishers can access analytics to track title performance based on consumption trends.</p>
<p>In a statement, Monk’s Hill Ventures general partner Justin Nguyen said INKR’s “proprietary AI-driven platform is addressing pain points for creators and publishers who need to go digital and global—localizing for many languages quickly and cost-effectively while also helping them improve reach and readership through analytics and intelligent personalized feeds. We look forward to partnering with them to quench the huge demand for translated comics globally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new trend is emerging in the world of startups and, to many, it couldn’t have come too soon. Why are there so few women in senior roles? Women going through menopause are commonly known to drop out of leadership roles, for instance. In the UK, menopause is responsible for about 14 million lost working days and 1 million premature career exits, according to research. Indeed, we only just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/2182193/">reported</a> on the new startup Peppy which is addressing this in employee health.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.vira.health/">Vira Health</a>, has raised a £1.5M seed funding from LocalGlobe and MMC Ventures. The round also included angel investors such as Megumi Ikeda (Hearst Ventures), Andrea Zitna of Elvie, Sofia Bendz, Matt Robinson, and Simon Lambert.</p>
<p>Founded in 2020 by Andrea Berchowitz and Rebecca Love, Vira Health is about personalized menopause care. Its first product, Stella, is an app for menopause relief highlighting 12-week menopause treatment plans, content, and virtual events such as yoga classes or a Q&amp;A with a gynecologist.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Andrea Berchowitz, co-founder, Vira Health, said: “Female health issues have historically been under-researched and under-invested, and this remains the case today. There is an opportunity to use technology to redress this balance by improving the collection and use of female data in healthcare. This first round of seed funding is a step towards realizing our vision.”</p>
<p>Remus Brett, Investment Partner, LocalGlobe said: “Menopause represents a major phase of a woman’s life and the current healthcare system struggles to provide the multi-faceted and long-term support that women need.”</p>
<p>Alexia Arts, Investor, MMC Ventures, said: “At MMC Ventures, healthcare is a key area of research and investment. We see a huge potential in capturing and harnessing data insights to reshape the way that healthcare is practiced and delivered. This is particularly relevant in female healthcare where there is a well-documented gender data gap that needs to be addressed.”  </p>
<p>Prior to launching Vira Health, Berchowitz was an Associate Partner at McKinsey &amp; Company, working in women’s health across the public and private sector, and led Middle East operations for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify&#8217;s recently launched live audio app and Clubhouse rival, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Spotify Greenroom</a>, has a long road ahead of it if it wants to take on top social audio platforms like Clubhouse, Airtime, Spoon and others, not to mention those from top social networks, like Twitter and Facebook. To date, the new Greenroom app has only been downloaded a total of 141,000 times on iOS, according to data from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower. This includes downloads from its earlier iteration, Locker Room &#8212; an app Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-30/spotify-acquires-locker-room-and-announces-plans-for-a-new-live-audio-experience/">acquired</a> to make its move into live audio.</p>
<p>On Android, Google Play data <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bettylabs.disco">indicates</a> the app has been installed over 100,000 times, but Sensor Tower cannot yet confirm this figure.</p>
<p>For comparison, Clubhouse today has 30.2 million total installs, 18.7 million of which are on iOS, Sensor Tower says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other top audio apps include Airtime, with 11.4 million iOS installs, out of a total of 14.3 million (including Android); and Spoon, with 7.6 million iOS installs, out of a total of  27.3 million.</p>
<p>International apps like UAE&#8217;s Yalla and China&#8217;s Lizhi are massive, as well, with the former sporting 48.1 total installs, 3.8 million of which are on iOS. The latter has 29.5+ million total installs, but only a handful on iOS.</p>
<p>There are other newcomers that have managed to stake smaller claims in the social audio space, too, including Fishbowl (759,000 total installs), Cappuccino (497,000 installs), Riff (339,000 installs) and Sonar (154,000 installs.)</p>

The firm analyzed 34 social audio apps. The chart shows those with the most installs.  </em></p></div></p>
<p>Spotify Greenroom&#8217;s launch last month, meanwhile, seems to have attracted only a small fraction of Spotify&#8217;s larger user base, which has now <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/spotify-stock-dips-after-reporting-weak-total-monthly-user-growth.html">grown to 365 million monthly active users.</a></p>
<p>The majority of Greenroom&#8217;s installs &#8212; around 106,000 &#8212; took place after Greenroom&#8217;s official launch on July 16, 2021 through July 25, 2021, Sensor Tower says. Counting only its Greenroom installs, the app is ranked at No. 12 among social audio apps. It follows Tin Can, which gained 127,000 installs since launching in early March.</p>
<p>Because Greenroom took over Locker Room&#8217;s install base, some portion of Greenroom&#8217;s total iOS installs (141K) included downloads that occurred when the app was still Locker Room. But that number is fairly small. Sensor Tower estimates Locker Room saw only around 35,000 total iOS installs to date. That includes the time frame of October 26, 2020 &#8212; the month when the sports chat app <a href="https://www.axios.com/locker-room-app-sports-discussion-betty-labs-6e8a50c5-112d-41e5-9970-4b70ecb62aca.html">launched to the public</a> &#8212; up until the day before Greenroom&#8217;s debut (July 15, 2021).</p>
<p>We should also point out that downloads are not the same thing as registered users, and are far short of active users. Many people download a new app to try it, but then abandon it shortly after downloading it, or never remember to open it at all.</p>
<p>That means the number of people actively using Greenroom at this time, is likely much smaller that these figures indicate.</p>
<p>Spotify declined to comment on third-party estimates.</p>

<p>While Sensor Tower looked at competition across social audio apps on the app stores, Spotify&#8217;s competition in the live audio market won&#8217;t be limited to standalone apps, of course.</p>
<p>Other large tech platforms have more recently integrated social audio into their apps, too, including Facebook (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">Live Audio Rooms</a>), Twitter (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-spaces-will-be-available-for-web-including-accessibility-features/">Spaces</a>), Discord (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Stage Channels</a>) and trading app <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22451481/public-app-trading-stocks-live-audio">Public</a>. A comparison with Greenroom here is not possible, as these companies would have to disclose how many of their active users are engaging with live audio, and they have not yet done so.</p>
<p>Despite what may be a slower uptake, Greenroom shouldn&#8217;t be counted out yet. The app is brand-new, and has time to catch up if all goes well. (And if the market for live audio, in general, continues to grow &#8212; even though the height of Covid lockdowns, which prompted all this live audio socializing in the first place, seems to have passed.)</p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s success or failure with live audio will be particularly interesting to watch given the potential for the company to cross-promote live audio shows, events, and artist-produced content through its flagship streaming music application. What sort of programming Greenroom may later include is still unknown, however.</p>

<p>Following Spotify&#8217;s <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-30/spotify-acquires-locker-room-and-announces-plans-for-a-new-live-audio-experience/">acquisition</a> of Locker Room maker Betty Labs<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, the company said it would roll out programmed content related to music, culture, and entertainment, in addition to sports. It also launched a <a href="http://greenroomcreatorfund.byspotify.com/">Creator Fund</a> to help fuel the app with new content. </span></p>
<p>But so far, Spotify hasn&#8217;t given its users a huge incentive to visit Greenroom.</p>
<p>The company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/podcasts-focus-spotify-user-growth/">during its Q2 2021 earnings</a>, explained why. It said it first needed to get Greenroom stabilized for a &#8220;Spotify-sized audience,&#8221; which it why it only soft-launched the app in June. Going forward, Spotify says there will be &#8220;more tie-ins&#8221; with the main Spotify app, but didn&#8217;t offer any specifics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously we&#8217;ll leverage our existing distribution on Spotify,&#8221; noted Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. &#8220;But this feels like a great way to learn, experiment and iterate, much faster than if we had to wait for a full on integration into the main app,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite semiconductor shortages peaking during the second quarter of 2021, Ford says it delivered better-than-expected operating results by leveraging strong demand for new vehicles, like its Bronco SUV, according to its <a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/799033206/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Ford-2Q2021-Earnings-Press-Release.pdf">most recent earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>In April, Ford had expected to lose about 50% of its planned Q2 production, resulting in a profit loss for the period. However, the automaker was able to generate companywide adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $1.1 billion, according to the report.</p>

<p>With demand for the Mustang Mach-E, which CEO Jim Farley said is already profitable on Wednesday&#8217;s earnings call, and other Ford vehicles up 7x from last year, Farley said &#8220;the business is &#8216;spring loaded&#8217; for a rebound when semiconductor supplies stabilize and more closely match demand,&#8221; according to a statement released by Ford.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company said it &#8220;has lifted its target for full-year adjusted free cash flow to between $4 billion and $5 billion, supported by expected favorable second-half working capital as vehicle production increases with anticipated improvement in availability of semiconductors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outwardly, Ford appears to be optimistic, but when pressed during the call, Farley was slightly more cautious and realistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do see the chip issue running through this year and we could see it bleeding into the first part of next year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had discussions with the FAB suppliers. They&#8217;re telling us that they&#8217;re reallocating capital, they&#8217;re increasing supply for automotive, etc. But I think this is one of those things where we need to see the relief coming through before we can really feel comfortable that we&#8217;re out of the woods here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farley said the industry is seeing signs of improvement in the flow of chips now in the third quarter, but &#8220;the situation remains fluid.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not wrong. Semiconductor sales in May were up 4.1% over April, which saw sales increase 1.9% over March 2021, according to the <a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/global-semiconductor-sales-in-may-up-26-2-year-to-year-4-1-month-to-month/">Semiconductor Industry Association</a>. Additionally, a <a href="https://www.wsts.org/76/Recent-News-Release">World Semiconductor Trade Statistics report</a> released in June forecasts global annual sales to increase 19.7% in 2021 and 8.8% in 2022. Earlier this month, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company said it expects the shortage of semiconductors in the manufacturing space to be greatly reduced starting this quarter due to its increased production efforts. The company said it already increased microcontroller unit production by 30% YOY in the first half of the year and intends to bring that up to over 30% pre-pandemic 2018 levels.</p>
<p>Sounds promising, but not everyone is on the same page here.<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04858089-fbe7-44f1-b096-8e705c664f8e"> Singapore-based Flex, a global chip manufacturer, recently warned</a> that the global chip shortage would last into mid-2022, worsened by the increased demand for cars, especially electric ones, as well as pandemic-induced purchases of video game consoles, tablets, laptops and other entertaining electronics.</p>
<p>Just as Ford is trying to reduce battery supply anxiety by becoming the manufacturer via battery cell partnerships with SK Innovation, Farley said Ford is also working closely with semiconductor fabricators and suppliers to help them with future projections of how many chips it expects to need.</p>
<p>A<a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/why-were-in-the-midst-of-a-global-semiconductor-shortage"> big reason there&#8217;s a semiconductor shortage</a> is because automakers cut their orders when the pandemic caused a drop in sales last spring. But when Q3 2020 rolled around and demand for passenger vehicles rebounded, chipmakers were already spoken for, filling orders from customers in consumer electronics and IT.</p>
<p>In Ford&#8217;s defense, it&#8217;s not easy to predict a pandemic and how many chips one would need for that. Let&#8217;s hope this doesn&#8217;t lead to a hoarding scenario like the Great Toilet Paper Crisis of 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford and its F-150 pickup, the automaker&#8217;s best-selling vehicle, have consistently inspired brand loyalty from pickup truck owners. According to the <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2020-us-automotive-brand-loyalty-study">J.D. Power 2020 U.S. Automotive Brand Loyalty Study,</a> Ford has a 54.3% loyalty rate. Now as the automaker moves to electrify its fleet, it seems to be bringing in fresh buyers.</p>
<p>Ford released Wednesday its second quarter earnings for 2021, which besides containing a surprise profit despite the ongoing chip shortage, revealed that its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">F-150 Lightning</a> electric pickup has generated 120,000 preorders since its unveiling in May. Ford reported revenue of $26.8 billion, slightly below expectations, and net income of $561 million in the second quarter.</p>
<p>To be clear, these are not orders and don&#8217;t reflect exactly how many of these vehicles Ford will sell. Customers can reserve one of these EVs by placing a refundable $100 deposit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, it does provide some insight into demand.</p>
<p>Importantly, three-quarters of those new orders come from customers that are new to Ford, according to the earnings release. During the call on Wednesday, CEO Jim Farley also said two out of five Lightning preorders are going to trade in an ICE pickup.</p>
<p>Not only does this potentially affect Ford&#8217;s sales, it also validates the company&#8217;s recent forays into battery production. Automakers across the world are engaging in battery joint ventures with cell and chemistry companies, and Ford is no different. The company has a partnership with SK Innovation to manufacture battery cells on American soil and is creating a battery R&amp;D center in Michigan, a part of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">$30 billion investment into electrification</a>.</p>
<p>Increased sales can also help with Ford&#8217;s expensive undertaking to invest in embedded electrical architecture upgrade that allows Ford to more easily update future EVs and enable new connected capabilities, according to Farley.</p>

<p>The F-150 Lightning comes with a lot of upgrades that make it attractive to Ford newcomers willing to pay more than the $40,000 base price. It&#8217;s got the same torque and power as its gas counterpart, plus a hands-free ADAS BlueCruise system, a comprehensive infotainment unit and enough battery capacity to power your whole house in the event of an outage.</p>

<p>Farley also said during the call that the new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-officially-adds-maverick-a-compact-pickup-truck-to-its-lineup/">Ford Maverick</a>, a compact hybrid pickup which starts at $20,000, already has around 80,000 orders. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/ford-unveils-maverick-a-compact-hybrid-pickup-truck-for-under-20000/">hybrid is marketed toward people</a> who aren&#8217;t exactly pickup truck people, but who maybe want to dip their toes into that utility pool.</p>
<p>“The demand for our first round of high-volume EVs clearly has exceeded our most optimistic projections,&#8221; said Farley. &#8220;We&#8217;re now working around the clock to break constraints and increase our manufacturing capacity for these red-hot new battery electric vehicles&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the earnings report, the combined U.S. customer-sold retail order bank for the electric <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/the-2021-ford-mustang-mach-e-is-disappointing-in-early-test-drive/">Mustang Mach-E</a> and other Ford vehicles was seven times larger than at the same point last year. With demand increasing, Farley said the business is &#8220;spring loaded&#8221; for a rebound when semiconductor supplies stabilize.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 28, 2021. What a day. Duolingo went public. Algolia raised an epic round. Crypto prices rose. And we’re being treated to a raft of earnings reports from tech’s biggest names. If you like tech news, boy do we have a post for you. Let’s go! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<p>P.S. Super cheap Disrupt tickets <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/48-hour-countdown-to-early-bird-savings-on-passes-to-tc-disrupt-2021/">end in two days</a>, so snag yours now. All the cool kids, etc.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/want-to-work-at-a-google-campus-youll-need-to-be-vaccinated/">Google will require vaccinations for office work:</a> </strong>It won’t solve the issue of tech workers not wanting to go back to offices after working from home for the last year, but Google is helping set the future of work once again, this time by requiring vaccines for workers returning to its offices. Which makes complete and utter sense. Vaccines are safe, and they keep the people around you safe. Expect to see more of this.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/search-api-startup-algolia-raises-150-million-at-2-25-billion-valuation/"><strong>Algolia raises $150M:</strong></a> The search-as-a-service company is now $150 million richer and worth a whopping $2.25 billion. The company did not share hard revenue numbers (boo), but did disclose that its annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew by 180% in the last year. The company last raised in 2019, when it added $110 million to its accounts at a valuation north of $500 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/duolingos-ipo-pricing-is-great-news-for-edtech-startups/"><strong>Duolingo goes public:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The popular consumer edtech service priced its IPO at $102 last night, a price that we felt was pretty darn good. Now the company is worth a little more than $132 per share, which is quite the first day. Sure, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/chinas-regulatory-crackdown-is-good-news-for-startups-aligned-with-ccp-goals/">edtech companies in China have taken whacking</a>, but the U.S. market seems rather lucrative at the moment. That’s good news for education startups in general.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/squire-a-barbershop-tech-platform-triples-its-valuation-again-with-tiger-global/"><strong>Squire proves that vertical SaaS can scale:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today’s Tiger round is Squire, a startup that provides industry-tuned software to barbershops. There are many such businesses, and thus there may be much business available for Squire to command. That appears to be the thesis behind its new $60 million round. The company’s service is “used by over 2,000 shops across three continents,” per TecCrunch reporting.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/algramo-aims-to-cut-plastic-waste-with-a-reusable-container-ecosystem-and-8-5m-a-round/"><strong>This startup wants to cut single-use plastic consumption:</strong></a> In all honesty, both you and I are pretty trash for the planet. We use plastics too much, and too often just once. Algramo is out to shake that up by working with brands and providing refill stations for different products. And now it has $8.5 million in capital to keep pursuing its vision.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/quotapath-raises-21-3m-in-insight-partners-led-round-to-help-sales-teams-better-track-commissions/"><strong>Gong.io is not the only sales tech startup doing numbers:</strong></a> QuotaPath is another, and it just put away a $21.3 million round. The startup “has developed a commission-tracking solution for sales and revenue teams,” per TechCrunch. Honestly this makes sense. Sales teams have tooling budgets, and salespeople like to get paid. Bread, meet butter.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/"><strong>Seven hundred million dollars for battery recycling:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the news from Redwood Materials, a company now worth $3.7 billion that wants to recycle scrap from battery production <em>and</em> used consumer batteries. It then takes out the useful bits and feeds those back into production. If the economics work, this rocks.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/launch-vehicle-startup-isar-aerospace-lands-an-additional-75m-in-funding/"><strong>Not just a billionaire’s club:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, the Bezos and Branson rocket trips have captured lots of media attention, but building rocket-launch tech is not a thinly populated problem space. Lots of companies are working on it, including Isar Aerospace, which just closed a $75 million round. The capital comes after the company raised $91 million last December. Its new capital is an extension of that round. Isar’s rockets will be able to take up to 1,000 kilograms to low-Earth orbit.</li>
<li>Remember that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/mmhmm-raises-100m-which-is-a-fun-thing-to-say-to-people-who-dont-follow-tech/">$100 million mmhmm round</a>? We got the founder of the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/the-mmhmm-story-and-how-it-plans-to-spend-its-100m/">on the Equity podcast for a chat</a>. Take a listen!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why I make everyone in my company be the CEO for a day</h2>
<p>In the reality TV series &#8220;Undercover Boss,&#8221; high-powered executives disguise themselves so they can work alongside everyday employees, ostensibly to learn from them.</p>
<p>Flipping that script, software company Vincit USA has a “CEO of the Day” program where staffers move into a metaphorical corner office for 24 hours and receive a very real unlimited budget. There&#8217;s just one requirement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CEO must make one lasting decision that will help improve the working experience of Vincit employees,&#8221; said Ville Houttu, Vincit&#8217;s founder and CEO.</p>
<p>Since instituting the program, Vincit USA has received multiple awards for its workplace culture and sees reduced staff turnover.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though it may seem crazy, the initiative has paid off tenfold,&#8221; said Houttu.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Our big technology news rundown today has two parts. The first is our usual collection of individual items. Then we have all that you need from recent earnings reports.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/walmart-to-sell-its-e-commerce-technologies-to-other-retailers/">Walmart is making its e-commerce tools more generally available:</a> </strong>One competitor to Amazon’s e-commerce might, Walmart, is working with Adobe to “integrate access to Walmart’s Marketplace, as well as its various online and in-store fulfillment and pickup technologies, into the Adobe Commerce Platform.” Walmart, along with Shopify and BigCommerce, are among the companies pushing back against an Amazon-only world.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/snapchat-adds-my-places-feature-to-snap-map-connecting-users-to-businesses/"><strong>Snapchat adds personal spaces to its map functionality:</strong></a> Snap’s Snapchat product has been on a roll lately, driving strong revenue for its parent company. Today it announced that it is bringing something called “My Spaces” to its mapping tool. What will that do for users? TechCrunch reports that the feature will let users save their favorite locations, share them with friends and get recommendations for other places to go.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/twitter-launches-u-s-e-commerce-pilot-that-lets-users-shop-from-profiles/"><strong>Twitter digs into e-commerce:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s our takeaway from today’s news that Twitter is launching a pilot of a “Shop Module” that will let folks sell stuff from their profile. Sure, Twitter is also moving into subscriptions and live audio and keeping up its streak of not building DM search, and now it will be a mix of Etsy and Amazon to boot!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, to earnings.</p>
<p>Shopify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/shopifys-q2-results-beat-estimates-as-e-commerce-shines/">crushed earnings expectations</a> this morning, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/microsoft-bests-earnings-estimates-as-azure-posts-51-growth-shares-fall/">as did Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/iphone-sales-fuel-apples-wall-street-beating-q3/">Apple yesterday</a> afternoon. All of the companies were rewarded by seeing their share prices fall today. Why? It appears that public-market investors had largely priced in earnings beats to their share prices. The good news is that they are mostly retaining previously accumulated value. The bad news is that the two companies could be flashing that we’re near the peak of tech multiples.</p>
<p>Or maybe not. Alphabet also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/alphabet-crushes-q2-earnings-estimates-as-google-cloud-cuts-losses-grows-54/">bested estimates and managed</a> to gain &#8212; as I write this to you &#8212; a fraction of a point in value. In other news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/podcasts-focus-spotify-user-growth/">Spotify’s ad business had a huge quarter,</a> notable if you are into the economics of the music and podcasting world.</p>

<p><b>Dear Sophie,</b></p>
<p><b>My startup is desperately recruiting, and we see a lot of engineering candidates on H-1Bs. They’re looking for H-1B transfers and green cards. What should we do?</b></p>
<p><b>— Baffled in the Bay Area</b></p>
<p>Dear Baffled,</p>
<p>Yes, you should absolutely sponsor international talent for green cards! Listen to my podcast in which I discuss <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/081-the-engineers-im-recruiting-want-h-1b-transfers-and-green-cards-what-do-i-do/">how to hire international professionals</a> who are already in the United States by transferring their H-1B visa and using green cards as a benefit to attract and retain them.</p>
<p>The severe shortage of tech talent currently in the U.S. is prompting professionals to negotiate better compensation packages, and companies are increasingly using green card sponsorship as a benefit to attract and retain international talent.</p>
<h2>Green card sponsorship as a benefit</h2>
<p>Companies need to offer green card sponsorship to remain competitive. In fact, <a href="https://resources.envoyglobal.com/reports/2021-immigration-trends-report">Envoy’s 2021 Immigration Trends Report</a> found that 74% of employers said they have sponsored an individual for permanent residence (a green card), which is the highest percentage in the six years Envoy has asked this question in its annual survey. Rather than waiting until the last possible moment to sponsor an H-1B visa holder for a green card, 58% of employers say they are starting the process with the employee’s first year at the company on an H-1B visa. Most employers — 96% — said that sourcing international talent is important to their company’s talent acquisition strategy.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2100312 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?w=680" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="680" height="448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Sponsoring international talent for a green card is a way for companies to show they invest in and prioritize their employees and are willing to make a long-term commitment to a prospective employee. Employers can further distinguish themselves by offering to cover expenses for green card applications for a spouse and children, as well as a work permit application for a spouse.</p>
<p>Employers should also consider paying for an employee&#8217;s marriage-based green card as a third-party payor, particularly since marriage-based green cards take about one-third of the time and one-third of the investment compared to employment-based green cards. What’s more, most marriage-based green cards are not subject to annual quotas.</p>
<h2>H-1B transfers are most common right now</h2>
<p>Because most U.S. embassies and consulates abroad remain closed for routine visa processing due to COVID-19, most employers are hiring international talent who are already in the United States on an H-1B sponsored by another employer. In these situations, an employer must file for an H-1B transfer for the prospective employee. Take a look at a previous <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/dear-sophie/dear-sophie-how-can-we-sponsor-h-1b-transfers-and-extensions/">Dear Sophie column</a> for more details on the H-1B transfer process.</p>
<p>The questions that employers ask me most often about the H-1B transfer process include:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, Google CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/want-to-work-at-a-google-campus-youll-need-to-be-vaccinated/">Sundar Pichai announced</a> that the company will require employees to be vaccinated before returning to work on-site. It was part of a larger letter sent to Google/Alphabet staff that also noted the company will be extending its work-from-home policy through October 18, as the COVID-19 delta variant continues to sweep through the global population.</p>
<p>In a message to TechCrunch, Facebook’s VP of People, Lori Goler, confirmed a similar policy for the social media giant.</p>
<p>“As our offices reopen, we will be requiring anyone coming to work at any of our U.S. campuses to be vaccinated,” Goler writes. “How we implement this policy will depend on local conditions and regulations. We will have a process for those who cannot be vaccinated for medical or other reasons and will be evaluating our approach in other regions as the situation evolves. We continue to work with experts to ensure our return to office plans prioritize everyone&#8217;s health and safety.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The statement is worded similarly to the long letter penned by Pichai, which carved out an exception for “medical or other protected reasons.” The comment doesn’t offer an adjusted timeline for the return, which had initially planned to go half-capacity in September and full by October.</p>
<p>Last week, a spokesperson<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-office-is-back-what-if-covid-has-other-plans-11627099214"> told The Wall Street Journal<em>,</em></a> “Expert guidelines state that vaccines are highly effective at preventing variants of COVID-19, including the delta variant. Our timelines to reopen our offices haven’t changed.”</p>
<p>Both statements offer some wiggle room for the company, based on things like local and state regulations, medical or personal concerns and, presumably, access to the vaccine, which can vary greatly based on region.</p>
<p>Amazon also responded to TechCrunch&#8217;s inquiry on the matter, noting, &#8220;We strongly encourage Amazon employees and contractors to be vaccinated as soon as COVID-19 vaccines are available to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/amazon-updates-return-to-office-guidance"> company&#8217;s current guidelines</a> don&#8217;t appear to require vaccination in order to return to its offices, though unvaccinated employees are required to wear masks. Face coverings are optional for those who have verification of being fully vaccinated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook posted its second quarter earnings Wednesday, beating expectations with $29 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s biggest social media company was expected to report $27.8 billion in revenue for the quarter, a 50% increase from the same period in 2020. Facebook reported earnings per share of $3.61, which also bested <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/07/28/facebook-earnings/?sh=5ecfc92b4dbc">expectations</a>. The company&#8217;s revenue was $18.6 billion in the same quarter of last year.</p>
<p>In the first financial period to really reflect a return to quasi-economic normalcy after a very online pandemic year, Facebook met user growth expectations. At the end of March, Facebook boasted 2.85 billion monthly active users across its network of apps. At the end of its second quarter, Facebook reported 2.9 billion monthly active users, roughly what was expected.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s shares opened at $375 on Wednesday morning and were down to $360 in a dip following the earnings report.</p>
<p>In spite of a strong quarter, Facebook is warning of change ahead — namely impacts to its massive ad business, which generated $28.5 billion out of the company&#8217;s $29 billion this quarter. The company specifically named <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">privacy-focused updates</a> to Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system as a threat to its business.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to expect increased ad targeting headwinds in 2021 from regulatory and platform changes, notably the recent iOS updates, which we expect to have a greater impact in the third quarter compared to the second quarter,&#8221; the company stated its investor report outlook.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="nMacGdiVKA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">Facebook isn&#8217;t happy about Apple&#8217;s upcoming ad tracking restrictions</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook isn&#8217;t happy about Apple&#8217;s upcoming ad tracking restrictions&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/embed/#?secret=nMacGdiVKA" data-secret="nMacGdiVKA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On the company&#8217;s investor call, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed to Facebook&#8217;s plans to reduce its reliance on ad revenue, noting the company&#8217;s expanded efforts to attract and support content creators and its e-commerce plans in particular. &#8220;We want our platforms to be the best place for creators to make a living,&#8221; Zuckerberg said, adding that the company plans to monetize creator tools starting in 2023.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg also emphasized Facebook&#8217;s grand aspirations for social experiences in VR. &#8220;Virtual reality will be a social platform, which is why we&#8217;re so focused on building it,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p>
<p>In the call, Zuckerberg also noted Facebook&#8217;s prospects for monetizing digital goods like clothing and avatars in virtual-reality-based social networks. Facebook refers to its conception of an interconnected web of virtual social networks as the &#8220;metaverse&#8221; — a corporate nod to Neal Stephenson&#8217;s 1992 futurist sci-fi novel &#8220;Snow Crash.&#8221;</p>
<p>No matter what Facebook planned to report Wednesday, the company is a financial beast. Bad press and user mistrust in the West haven’t done much to hurt its bottom line and the company’s ad business is looking as dominant as ever. Short of meaningful antitrust reform in the U.S. or a surging competitor, there&#8217;s little to stand in Facebook&#8217;s way. The former might still be a long shot given partisan gridlock in Congress, even with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/biden-executive-order-tech-antitrust/">White House</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/biden-jonathan-kanter-doj/">involved</a>, but Facebook is finally facing a threat from the latter.</p>
<p>For years, it&#8217;s been difficult to imagine a social media platform emerging as a proper rival to the company, given Facebook&#8217;s market dominance and nasty habit of acquiring competitors or brazenly copying their innovations, but it&#8217;s clear that TikTok is turning into just that. YouTube is huge, but the platforms matured in parallel and coexist, offering complementary experiences.</p>

<p>TikTok hit 700 million monthly active users in July 2020 and surpassed three billion global downloads earlier this month, becoming the only non-Facebook owned app to do so, according to <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion">data from Sensor Tower</a>. If the famously addictive short form video app can successfully siphon off some of the long hours that young users spend on Instagram and Facebook&#8217;s other platforms and make itself a cozy home for brands in the process, the big blue giant out of Menlo Park might finally have something to lose sleep over.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Globally, 225 million people are estimated to suffer from moderate or severe visual impairments, and 49.1 million are blind,<a href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2767477"> according to 2020 data from the Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science journal</a>. A Japanese startup that was incubated at Honda Motor Company’s business creation program hopes to make navigating the world easier and safer for the visually impaired.</p>
<p>Ashirase, which debuted as the first business venture to come out of Honda’s Ignition program in June, shared details of its in-shoe navigation system for low-vision walkers on Tuesday. The system aims to help users achieve more independence in their daily lives by allowing them to <em>feel</em> which way to walk through in-shoe vibrations connected to a navigation app on a smartphone. Ashirase hopes to begin sales of the system, also named Ashirase, by October 2022.</p>
<p>Honda created Ignition in 2017 to feature original technology, ideas, and designs of Honda associates with the goal of solving social issues and going beyond the existing Honda business. CEO Wataru Chino had previously worked at Honda since 2008 on R&amp;D for EV motor control and automated driving systems. Chino’s background is evident in the navigation system’s technology, which he said is inspired by advanced driver assist and autonomous driving systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The overlap perspective can be, for instance, the way we utilize sensor information,” Chino told TechCrunch. “We use a sensor fusion technology, meaning we can combine information from the different sensors. I have experience in that field myself so that is helpful. Plus there is overlap with automated driving because when we were thinking of safety walking, the automated driving technology had given us an idea for the concept.”</p>
<p>“Ashirase” comes from the Japanese words ashi, meaning “foot,” and shirase, meaning “notification.” As its name suggests, the device, which is attached to the shoe, vibrates to provide navigation based on the route set within an app. Motion sensors, which consist of an accelerometer, gyro sensors and orientation sensors, enable the system to understand how the user is walking.</p>
<p>While en route outside, the system localizes the user based on global navigation satellite positioning information and data based on the user’s foot movement. Ashirase’s app is connected to a range of different map vendors like Google Maps, and Chino said the device can switch to adapt to different information available on different maps. This capability might be helpful if, say, one map had updated information about a road blockage and could send over-the-air updates.</p>
<p>“Going forward, we want to develop the function to generate a map itself using sensors from the outdoor environment, but that’s maybe five years down the line,” Chino said.</p>
<p>The vibrators are aligned with the foot’s nerve layer, so it’s easy to feel the pulse. To indicate the user should walk straight ahead, the vibrator positioned at the front of the shoe vibrates. Vibrators on the left and the right side of the shoe also indicate turning signals for the walker.</p>
<p>Ashirase says this form of intuitive navigation helps the walker attain a more relaxed state of mind rather than one that is constantly alert, leading to a safer walk and less stress for the user.</p>
<p>This also allows the user to have more attention to spare for audible warnings in their environment, like, for example, if they were at a crosswalk, because the device cannot warn the user of obstacles ahead.</p>
<p>“Going forward, we’re thinking about technical updates for users who are totally blind because they don’t have such information like obstacle awareness like low-vision people,” Chino said. “So at this moment, the device is designed for low-vision walkers.”</p>
<p>While indoors, like in a shopping mall, the GPS won’t reach the user, and there isn’t a map for them to localize to. To solve for this, the company says its plan is to use WiFi or Bluetooth-based positioning, connecting to other devices and cell phones within the store, to localize the visually impaired person.</p>
<p>Ashirase is also considering ways to integrate with public transit systems so that the device can alert a user if they have arrived or are near their next stop, according to Chino.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of tech to pack into one little device that attaches to a shoe &#8212; any shoe. Chino said the device, which only needs to be charged once a week based on three hours of use per day, is made to be flexible and fit onto different types, shapes and sizes of shoes.</p>
<p>Ashirase intends to release its beta version for testing and data collection in October or November this year and hopes to achieve mass production by October 2022. It’ll have a direct-to-consumer model, the price of which the company is not yet ready to disclose, and a subscription model, which should cost about 2,000 to 3,000 Japanese Yen ($18 to $27) per month.</p>
<p>Chino estimates it’ll take the company 200 million Yen ($1.8 million), including the funds the company has already raised, to make it to market. So far, the company has raised 70 million Yen ($638,000), which came in the form of an equity investor round and some non-equity rounds, according to Chino.</p>
<p>Honda maintains an investor role in the company, supporting and following the business along the way, but Ashirase’s aim is to go public as a standalone company.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Queen's Gambit Growth Capital, the women-led SPAC in charge of the deal, called Swvl 'a disruptive platform that solves complex challenges and empowers underserved populations.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cairo and Dubai-based ride-sharing company Swvl plans to go public in a merger with special purpose acquisition company Queen&#8217;s Gambit Growth Capital, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/ae/news-releases/swvl-a-transformative-mass-transit-platform-announces-business-combination-with-queens-gambit-growth-capital-301343236.html">Swvl said Tuesday</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The deal will see Swvl valued at roughly $1.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swvl </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mostafa Kandil, Mahmoud Nouh and Ahmed Sabbah in 2017. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio started the company as a bus-hailing service in Egypt and other ride-sharing services in emerging markets with fragmented public transportation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its services, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bus-hailing, enables users to make intra-state journeys by booking seats on buses running a fixed route</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is pocket-friendly for residents in these markets compared to single-rider options and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">helps reduce emissions (Swvl claims it has prevented over 240 million pounds of carbon emission since inception).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After its Egypt launch, Swvl expanded to Kenya, Pakistan, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The company also moved its headquarters to Dubai as part of its strategy to become a global company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swvl offerings have expanded beyond bus-hailing services. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the company offers inter-city rides, car ride-sharing, and corporate services across the 10 cities it operates in across Africa and the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Queen&#8217;s Gambit, the women-led SPAC in charge of the deal,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-20/queen-s-gambit-is-said-to-boost-blank-check-ipo-to-300-million"> raised</a> $300 million in January and added $45 million via an underwriters&#8217; overallotment option focusing on startups in clean energy, healthcare and mobility sectors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/ae/news-releases/swvl-a-transformative-mass-transit-platform-announces-business-combination-with-queens-gambit-growth-capital-301343236.html">statement</a> also mentions a group of investors &#8212; Agility, Luxor Capital and Zain Group &#8212; which will contribute $100 million through a private investment in public equity, or PIPE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/swvl">Crunchbase</a>, Swvl has raised over $170 million. From an African perspective, Swvl features as one of the most venture-backed startups on the continent. The company has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been touted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach unicorn status in the past and will when this SPAC merger </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is completed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will aptly trade under the ticker SWVL</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The listing will make it the first Egyptian startup to go public outside Egypt and the second to go public after Fawry. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also make the mobility company the largest African unicorn debut on any U.S.-listed exchange, beating <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8b5024e0-5d1d-11e9-9dde-7aedca0a081a">Jumia&#8217;s debut</a> of $1.1 billion on the NYSE. In the Middle East, Swvl <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/anghami-spac-ipo/">joins music-streaming platform Anghami</a> as the second startup to go public via a SPAC merger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swvl had annual gross revenue of $26 million in 2020, according to the statement, and the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expects its annual gross revenue to increase to $79 million this year and $1 billion by 2025 after expanding to 20 countries across five continents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On why Queen&#8217;s Gambit picked Swvl for this deal, Victoria Grace, founder and CEO, said in a statement that the company fit the profile of what she was looking for: &#8220;a disruptive platform that solves complex challenges and empowers underserved populations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having established a leadership position in key emerging markets, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Swvl is ready to capitalize on a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> global market opportunity,” she added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/why-spacs-arent-targeting-african-startups/">wrote</a> that SPACs didn&#8217;t target African startups for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reasons, including a lack of global appeal and private capital and market satisfaction</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging by Grace&#8217;s comments, Swvl has that global appeal and is ready to venture into the public market despite</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being in operation for just four years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Excerpts from our Twitter Spaces chat with MKT1 founders Emily Kramer and Kathleen Estreich on the growth marketing industry, when to hire a marketer and when a startup should consider outsourcing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Emily Kramer and Kathleen Estreich are the founders of of <a href="https://www.mkt1.co/">MKT1</a>, a strategic marketing firm that does much more than just marketing. As we mentioned the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/mkt1-developer-marketing-is-what-startup-marketing-should-look-like/">last time</a> we spoke with the company, it offers a plethora of services ranging from marketing consulting and organizing recruiting and mentoring workshops to angel syndicate investing.</p>
<p>The two founders took to Twitter Spaces on July 20 with TechCrunch Managing Editor Danny Crichton to talk about about the growth marketing industry. They offered some new perspectives, like thinking of growth marketing as an engine and other subdivisions of marketing that make up growth marketing, as the fuel.</p>
<p>After talking about what they were seeing in marketing, we opened the floor for a Q&amp;A session that founders took advantage of to ask how to know when to hire a marketer and when is it good to outsource.</p>
<p>Below is an excerpt from the Twitter Spaces event, edited for length and clarity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What is growth marketing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emily Kramer:</strong> I think the easiest way to think about it is: Marketing consists of the fuel and an engine. Growth marketing is the engine and content marketing, product marketing, comms, events — all of that are your fuel. It&#8217;s building that engine: Everything from building marketing ops and making sure that you&#8217;re tracking and can get everything out the door, to what you&#8217;re doing with email, ads, SEO and on your website. All of these things that are used to drive your audience throughout your funnel.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			&#8220;Marketing consists of the fuel and an engine. Growth marketing is the engine and content marketing, product marketing, comms, events — all of that are your fuel.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It’s not just getting someone to sign up or getting someone to be a qualified lead to pass over to sales. It&#8217;s also supporting the customer success team and the product team. Anything that is communicating with your audience in a one-to-many way is how I think about the marketing function. Specifically growth marketing in general — it’s a full funnel, it&#8217;s the engine, and it&#8217;s ever changing.</p>
<p>We in marketing have 5,000 names for everything, including growth marketing. You&#8217;ll often hear in top-down sales organizations it is called demand gen, but I really think of demand gen as a subset of growth marketing focused specifically on driving leads to sales. That&#8217;s kind of what it is and how I define it. Every marketer you talk to would define it a little bit differently.</p>
<p><strong>What does the landscape of growth marketing look like in 2021? What are you seeing in summer 2021?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> We&#8217;re seeing two major shifts. One is thinking about how community is a part of this, or at least throwing around the word &#8220;community&#8221; for things that have always been done. &#8220;Community-led growth&#8221; is obviously a big buzzword; that&#8217;s basically getting people in conversation to drive growth. The phrase &#8220;product-led growth&#8221; is another, and that is really just another way to describe self-serve.</p>
<p>Having growth marketers who can collaborate with product growth roles and product growth teams and having one centralized team has been a trend over the past 10 years. But now the term product-led growth is what we use for all of that. Marketers love to rebrand even their own functions.</p>
<p><strong>Kathleen Estreich:</strong> A lot of companies are starting to think about growth marketing earlier. We&#8217;re seeing a lot of companies thinking about hiring their first marketer. It used to be you&#8217;d hire at Series A, but because all the funding rounds are sort of being moved up a level, a lot of seed-stage companies are thinking about growth earlier.</p>
<p>The skill sets of growth marketers are in high demand. They always have been, but it feels pretty acute right now. Given that a lot of the companies are raising money earlier and starting to try and build that traction faster to grow into the valuations, we&#8217;re starting to see a huge need. Pretty much every company we talked to is wanting to hire and thinking about growth levers they should be using earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Where is there an oversupply of folks? Where is there an undersupply? Where&#8217;s the demand today? What&#8217;s underutilized today?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> In general, marketers are in pretty high demand. Product marketing in particular has been pretty interesting. We&#8217;re seeing a lot of folks in product marketing roles, because typically, the first marketer at a startup is someone who has product marketing experience and there are many companies being started and they&#8217;re looking for product marketers. And finding someone who has the experience in product marketing, who&#8217;s not just coming from a big company.</p>
<p>I think product marketing at a larger organization, you&#8217;re very much tied to a product line; you&#8217;re doing just product marketing. But at an early-stage company, you&#8217;re not doing just product marketing; you also need someone who understands distribution. So we encourage a lot of companies to hire someone that is what we call a pi-shaped marketer: Someone who has depth and competence in two areas of marketing.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="nkwIt4w3lO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/5-companies-doing-growth-marketing-right/">5 companies doing growth marketing right</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 companies doing growth marketing right&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/5-companies-doing-growth-marketing-right/embed/#?secret=nkwIt4w3lO" data-secret="nkwIt4w3lO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Usually it&#8217;s product marketing and growth marketing, and finding that person is really challenging in a normal market. I would say in this market in particular, it&#8217;s a pretty tough role to fill. But if you can find the right person, you might have to make some trade-offs on either the level or the experience that you&#8217;re bringing someone in. But if you can find a person who has competence in product and growth marketing, I think that&#8217;s someone a lot of companies can benefit from in the early days of building their marketing teams.</p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> I&#8217;ve had a couple of startups that I&#8217;ve talked to, even in recent weeks, and I&#8217;ve heard, &#8220;Oh, our first marketer is going to be a community marketer.&#8221; That role is evolving and changing a lot. Back when I started doing startup marketing, about 10 years ago, community really meant social media, and it doesn&#8217;t mean that at all anymore. So finding people that have had that exact role before is really difficult.</p>
<p>In some cases, when people say community marketing, they mean they&#8217;ve done a lot of content, virtual events or customer success. I think when people post that role, it&#8217;s kind of like square peg, round hole or not knowing if it&#8217;s square peg, round hole. I sometimes see this mismatch on roles that are posted and the talent that is actually available.</p>
<p>I think my advice to marketers based on that is: Really read the job description, and maybe the title — does it match exactly what you&#8217;ve done, or does the title even match what you think you should be doing? Maybe there&#8217;s an opportunity there to kind of educate on what you can do and also educate on how to define roles in really early-stage companies.</p>
<p><strong>When is a good time to start working with a growth marketer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Estreich:</strong> A question we hear quite often is, &#8220;When do I know is the right time to hire my first marketer?&#8221; One of the things that Emily and I often tell founders is, the founding team is the first marketing team. You&#8217;re doing a lot of the early messaging and positioning. Usually kind of the early vision — that&#8217;s probably how you raised money. I think the way to think about it is to take a step back and ask, &#8220;Okay, what are the needs? What are the things that we&#8217;re trying to get done?&#8221; And thinking about product-market fit.</p>
<p>I think a product marketer, growth marketer or pi-shaped marketer is generally the first person that you would bring on. You want to make sure before you bring your first marketer that you actually have a product that&#8217;s ready to go to market. And if not, then it&#8217;s probably worth waiting until you have the product out there with some semblance of a handful of customers. Once you have that, then it might be time to start thinking about who that first marketer is.</p>
<p>I think the first marketer then is usually some combination of a product marketer with growth experience or a growth marketer with product marketing experience. Someone who, like Emily said at the beginning of the call, has experience with your business model and is ready to roll up their sleeves, because the first marketing job when you&#8217;re an early-stage company involves wearing a lot of hats, testing a lot of hypotheses and doing a lot of the work.</p>
<p>So you want to make sure that you don&#8217;t hire someone too senior who is not going to want to do the work. They&#8217;re just going to want to hire a team, which you&#8217;re probably not ready for. You also want to make sure they&#8217;re not too junior and they don&#8217;t even know what to do yet. Finding that balance, a midlevel person, is also going to be important.</p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> You mentioned that a product marketer can help you find the right niche to focus on. I think you should have some customers and a starting place. A better way to describe product marketers is actually audience marketers — they are figuring out how to communicate what you do to a specific audience. You probably have some idea, but they&#8217;re going to help you continue to explore within your team, like, &#8220;Should we expand to other audiences? Should we stay within this niche? What do those different audiences need? Are we talking to customers? What are they saying?&#8221;</p>
<p>They are responsible for knowing everything about your audience and also helping you grow into and test new audiences. That&#8217;s a huge part of the product marketing role. But again, it can be really risky to bring that person on too early at the sacrifice of building product and getting things out the door.</p>
<p><strong>Is MKT1 seeing any trends with B2B and growth-stage businesses around the balance between hiring FTEs and outsourcing certain marketing functions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kramer:</strong> Early on, I think founders think, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need to hire a marketer. I&#8217;m spending so much time on marketing, but I don&#8217;t need to hire a marketer, or I&#8217;ll just hire a contractor or agency for content. I&#8217;ll hire a contractor or agency for paid or for SEM or even for SEO.&#8221; Then you end up with all of these contractors. But contractors, even the best of contractors, are only good when they have a contact or someone to help them review things, and when they have clear instructions on what they need to do. Because you&#8217;re working with so many clients, you can&#8217;t get up to speed on all of that quickly.</p>
<p>The management overhead of a contractor agency is sometimes just as much as doing the work yourself, especially if you are not experienced in that area, because of all the back and forth. Many times, marketing is more iterative than some other areas of the business where you can hand over some things, especially when it comes to the creative aspects, because you&#8217;re figuring out what your brand is. There&#8217;s just going to be a lot of back and forth.</p>
<p>I think there are a couple of areas where agencies and contractors are better to hire. One of those areas is paid searches. You won&#8217;t need to hire an SEM specialist for a while. And it is definitely a specialty; it is a unique beast and kind of changes a lot, what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not. Having someone who understands how that works and is inside AdWords all day is really helpful, so that&#8217;s a good area to bring someone on. So no matter the size of my marketing team, I think I&#8217;ve always had a search agency to augment. Even when I&#8217;ve had a dedicated search person on my team, I&#8217;ve still had an agency to augment them. That&#8217;s something you&#8217;ll always need; you&#8217;ll need different agencies as you scale to do different things.</p>
<p>I think another area where it makes sense is on the content side, to augment the content people or your product marketer. Again, you need to have a clear understanding of what you&#8217;re trying to write about, what you&#8217;re trying to say, what your unique perspective is, what your brand is, before you start paying a contractor to write a bunch of content. Because what you&#8217;re going to end up with if you do that, is just a bunch of content that doesn&#8217;t really say anything; it doesn&#8217;t really drive a goal.</p>
<p>So content, paid search, always really good areas. And then as you scale — not at the beginning, most likely there are some exceptions depending on what type of business you are — but PR is the other area where media relationships, I mean, we&#8217;re talking to TechCrunch here, but like they can probably speak more to this. But media relationships are something where economies of scale really come into play. So having an agency that is a master in media or has a bunch of media relationships makes a lot of sense. That&#8217;s more later on. PR, content and paid search, but make sure you have people internally to manage them or it can become more detrimental than helpful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric air taxi startup Lilium has tapped German manufacturer Customcells to supply batteries for its flagship seven-seater Lilium Jet.</p>
<p>The battery IP is the result of &#8220;multiple players,&#8221; a Lilium spokesperson told TechCrunch, but the manufacturing will be the sole job of Customcells. While Lilium declined to specify the number of battery systems as part of the agreement, it confirmed that Customcells will be manufacturing guaranteed capacity until 2026.</p>
<p>Customcells specializes in high-performance lithium-ion batteries for the aerospace, automotive and maritime industries. The manufacturer recently announced a new joint venture with luxury sports car maker Porsche AG, dubbed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/porsche-to-make-high-performance-batteries-in-joint-venture-with-customcells/">Cellforce Group</a>, for the low-volume production of batteries for racing cars and performance vehicles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is just the latest partnership <a href="https://lilium.com/">Lilium</a> has announced in recent months as it prepares to shift into component and vehicle testing. The Munich-based eVTOL company has developed an international network of partnerships with suppliers like Japanese company Toray Industries for carbon fiber composite; Spanish aerospace supplier Aciturri for the jet’s airframe; and Palantir Technologies, one of its investors, for software services. In June, Lilium added aerospace manufacturing giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/german-evtol-maker-lilium-partners-with-honeywell-for-flight-control-and-avionics-systems/">Honeywell</a> to its roster for the jet’s flight control and avionics system.</p>
<p>Lilium’s decision to outsource major components to established manufacturers is a departure from many of the other leading eVTOL developers, like Joby Aviation, which have chosen to keep much of the engineering and production in-house. The strategy has a few advantages. For one, Lilium doesn’t have to spend millions – possibly hundreds of millions over time – in manufacturing facilities, or production and testing equipment. But the key advantage, Lilium executives suggest, may lie with the certification process.</p>
<p>Like other eVTOL manufacturers, the Lilium Jet must receive regulatory approval from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the Federal Aviation Administration in order to operate commercially in the EU and U.S., respectively. Lilium, in line with other major would-be players in the industry, has set an ambitious target of 2024 for commencing commercial operations. Established aerospace suppliers may use components that have already achieved a minimum performance standard recognized by regulators, which could save time in the certification process.</p>
<p>“Collaborating with experts, aerospace partners, is a deliberate choice for us,” Lilium’s chief program officer, Yves Yemsi, told TechCrunch earlier this year. “It will help us to reduce our time to market and still be safe.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drivers for Elon Musk&#8217;s underground Loop system in Las Vegas have been instructed to bypass passengers&#8217; questions about how long they have been driving for the company, declare ignorance about crashes, and shut down conversations about Musk himself.</p>
<p>Using public records laws, TechCrunch obtained documents that detail daily operations at the Loop, which opened in June to transport attendees around the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) using modified Tesla vehicles. Among the documents is a &#8220;Ride Script&#8221; that every new recruit must follow when curious passengers ask questions.</p>
<p>The script shows just how serious The Boring Company (TBC), which built and operates the system, is about controlling the public image of the new system, its technology and especially its founder, Elon Musk.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Your goal is to provide a safe ride for the passengers, not an entertaining ride. Keep conversation to a minimum so you can focus on the road,&#8221; advises the document. &#8220;Passengers will pepper you with questions. Here are some you may be asked and the recommended responses.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If riders ask a driver how long they have been with the company, they are instructed to respond with: &#8220;Long enough to know these tunnels pretty well!&#8221; The document goes on to note: &#8220;Passengers will not feel safe if they think you&#8217;ve only been driving for a week (even though that could mean hundreds of rides). Accordingly, do not share how long you&#8217;ve been employed here, but instead, find a way to evade the question or shift the focus,&#8221; the document advises drivers.</p>
<p>When asked how many crashes the system has experienced (the script uses the term &#8220;accidents&#8221;), drivers are told to respond: &#8220;It&#8217;s a very safe system, and I&#8217;m not sure. You&#8217;d have to reach out to the company.&#8221; Riders should expect similarly vague responses if they wonder how many employees or drivers TBC has, or how much the tunnels cost to dig. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/the-financial-pickle-facing-elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-system/">About $53 million in total</a>).</p>
<p>The use of Tesla&#8217;s advanced driver assistance system that is branded &#8220;Autopilot&#8221; is clearly a sore point at TBC. Clark County does not currently permit the use of the various driver assistance features anywhere within the Loop system, including automatic emergency braking or technologies that make the vehicle aware of obstacles and keep the vehicle in lane.</p>
<p>Officials even require mechanics to check the vehicles to ensure these are not activated.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to completing the actions under the initial inspection checklist, maintenance staff will verify that the automatic features of the vehicle, such as steering and braking/acceleration/deceleration assist (commonly known as Autopilot) are disabled for manual loop operation,&#8221; the document reads. The following checks will be conducted on a daily basis by CWPM technicians, according to the Vehicle Maintenance plan viewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>If a passenger should ask whether the Loop&#8217;s Tesla vehicles use Autopilot, drivers will give a response. However, this content was marked &#8220;Public Safety Related Confidential&#8221; in the documents TechCrunch received and was redacted, as were many other technical details.</p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s repeated requests to officials to explain this decision went unanswered.</p>
<h2>He who shall not be named</h2>
<p>The script also covers responses to questions about Musk himself: &#8220;This category of questions is extremely common and extremely sensitive. Public fascination with our founder is inevitable and may dominate the conversation. Be as brief as possible, and do your best to shut down such conversation. If passengers continue to force the topic, politely say, &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry, but I really can&#8217;t comment&#8217; and change the subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the script provides a number of replies to common Musk questions. Ask what Musk is like and you should expect the answer: &#8220;He&#8217;s awesome! Inspiring / motivating / etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>Follow up with: &#8220;Do you like working for him?&#8221; and you&#8217;ll get a response that could have come straight from North Korea: &#8220;Yup, he&#8217;s a great leader! He motivates us to do great work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Should a customer wonder how involved Musk is in the business, the driver will tell them: &#8220;He&#8217;s the company founder, and has been very involved and supportive.&#8221; Questions about Musk&#8217;s erratic tweets will be brushed off: &#8220;Elon is a public figure. We&#8217;re just here to provide an awesome transportation experience!&#8221;</p>
<p>One question, however, seems to hint that not everyone is happy working for Musk: &#8220;Is it true what I&#8217;ve read about him in the papers that he [is a mean boss / smokes pot / doesn&#8217;t let employees take vacations / etc.]?&#8221; Your driver&#8217;s rather equivocal response will be: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen that article, but that hasn&#8217;t been my experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>On a side note: While the hundreds of pages of training documents and operational manuals that TechCrunch obtained detail strong policies against drug use and harassment at the Loop, the word &#8220;vacation&#8221; does not otherwise appear.</p>
<h2>Tech that&#8217;s allowed</h2>
<p>Because Clark County currently forbids the use of automated driving features in the Loop, human drivers could be part of the system for some time. But the system is home to plenty of other advanced technologies, according to design and operational documents submitted to Clark County. Each of the 62 Teslas in the underground Loop has a unique RFID chip &#8212; as used in contactless payment systems &#8212; that pinpoints its location when it passes over one of 55 antennas installed in the roadway, stations and parking stalls.</p>
<p>Each vehicle also streams data to 24 hotspots through the system, sharing its speed, state of charge, the number of passengers in the car, and whether they are wearing seatbelts. Riders should be aware that every car is also constantly streaming real-time video from a camera inside the passenger cabin. All this data, along with video from 81 fixed cameras throughout the Loop, is fed to an Operations Control Center (OCC) located a few blocks away from the Convention Center. Video is recorded and stored for at least two weeks.</p>
<p>In the OCC, an operator is monitoring the camera feeds and other sensors for security threats or other problems &#8212; such as a driver using their own cellphone or speeding. The OCC can communicate with any driver via a Bluetooth headset or an in-car iPad that displays messages, alerts and a map of the car&#8217;s location in the tunnels. Vehicles have strict speed limits, ranging from 10 mph within stations to 40 mph on straight tunnel sections, and must maintain at least 6 seconds of separation from the car in front.</p>
<p>During testing this spring, the documents reveal that Clark County officials found some drivers were not following all the rules. &#8220;When asked about the speed limitations, several drivers replied with wrong straightaway and/or curved tunnel speeds. None provided at station, express lane, or ramp speeds,&#8221; reads one document. &#8220;Drivers were not announcing to the passengers to buckle their seatbelts. When asked, [some were saying] that they are optional or not required.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several drivers were also failing to maintain the 6-second safety margin with cars in front. TBC told Clark County that it would provide refresher training in those areas.</p>
<p>TBC, Clark County, and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which oversees the LVCC, did not reply to multiple requests for comment for this story.</p>
<p>The LVCVA recently signed a contract with Alphabet&#8217;s spin-out urban advertising agency, <a href="https://www.intersection.com/">Intersection Media</a>, to sell naming rights to the Loop system, which it hopes will net it $4.5 million.</p>
<p>TBC is currently building two extensions to the Loop to serve nearby hotels and ultimately wants to <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/vegas-loop">build a transit system</a> covering much of the Strip and downtown Las Vegas with more than 40 stations. That system would be financed by TBC and supported by ticket sales.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This further differentiates the social-forward Snap Map from more established resources like Google Maps and Apple Maps, which you can't really use to find out what restaurants your friends like.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more people are venturing out into the world this summer (safely, we hope!), Snapchat wants to make it easier for people to find restaurants, stores, parks and other interesting spots in their neighborhood. Today, Snapchat is starting to roll out the My Places feature on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/snap-map/">Snap Map</a>, which connects users with over 30 million businesses. Users can log their favorite spots, send them to friends, and find recommendations.</p>
<p>My Places has three main tabs: visited, favorites and popular. Visited lists places you&#8217;ve checked into on Snapchat, and favorites saves, well, your favorites. But the popular tab is particularly interesting because it marks the first time that Snapchat is using an algorithm to provide personalized recommendations to help people engage with the world around them. The algorithm considers where you are, what you&#8217;ve tagged or favorited already, and where your friends and other Snapchatters have visited.</p>
<p>This further differentiates the social-forward Snap Map from more established resources like Google Maps and Apple Maps, which you can&#8217;t really use to find out what restaurants your friends like. Sure, Snapchat can&#8217;t give you directions to that trendy sushi bar, but it&#8217;s not meant to, just like how Google Maps isn&#8217;t meant to show you what bar all your friends went to without you last night.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Snapchat shared survey results indicating that its users are more likely on average to engage in &#8220;post-pandemic&#8221; activities (is that a good thing?) and added that 44% of Snapchatters turn to the Snap Map to find places around them that they&#8217;re interested in.</p>
<p>With over 250 million monthly active users on Snap Map, the company announced an update in May called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-brings-partner-centric-layers-to-its-social-map-used-by-250-million-people/">Layers</a>, which lets partner companies add data directly to their own map. So far, Snapchat has collaborated with Ticketmaster and The Infatuation, a restaurant recommendation website &#8212; these partnerships help users see where they can find live entertainment, or what great restaurants are hidden in plain sight. Snapchat plans to further integrate Layers into Snap Map and My Places later this year.</p>
<p>Last week, Snap announced that during Q2 this year, it grew both revenue and daily active users at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/snap-had-its-best-quarter-in-four-years/">highest rates</a> it has achieved in the last four years. Year over year, the app grew 23%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart&#8217;s investments in software and retail technologies it used to transform its business from a brick-and-mortar to one that combines both in-person and online shopping will now be made available to other retailers for the first time, the company <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/07/28/walmart-to-offer-technologies-and-capabilities-to-help-other-businesses-navigate-their-own-digital-transformation">announced</a> today. Through a strategic partnership with Adobe, Walmart will integrate access to Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace, as well as its various online and in-store fulfillment and pickup technologies, into the Adobe Commerce Platform.</p>
<p>The technologies will be made available to both Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source customers, <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/07/27/adobe-walmart-partner-integrate-fulfillment-technologies-marketplace-adobe-commerce.html#gs.7l2itu">Adobe says</a>.</p>
<p>The deal will allow Walmart to potentially reach thousands of small to mid-sized retailers, who will effectively be able to tap into the same tools that one of the largest global retailers is using to run their business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Through the partnership, Adobe retail customers will be able to do things like show store pickup eligibility and available pickup times online; offer multiple pickup options like curbside and in-store pickup; provide their store associates with mobile tools to pick for orders, validate item selections and handle substitutions; and use tools to communicate with customers about their pickup orders, like those where customers can alert store associates of their ETA or arrival for curbside pickup.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the partnership will allow retailers to syndicate and sell their products across Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace.</p>
<p>The arrangement not only aims to benefit Walmart&#8217;s bottom line as it offers new revenue streams related to retail technologies, it could also serve as another tool in Walmart&#8217;s battle with Amazon for online retail dominance.</p>
<p>Retail businesses will use the Adobe Commerce platform to reach an expanded set of customers by listing products on Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace and then leverage Walmart&#8217;s Fulfillment Services to offer two-day shopping across the U.S.</p>
<p>And this, in turn, could boost the number of available products sold on Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace, which is still largely dwarfed by Amazon.</p>
<p>Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/how-pandemic-helped-walmart-battle-amazon-marketplace-sellers-2021-04-14/">had grown to an estimated 70,000 sellers</a> in 2020, fueled by a surge in online shopping triggered by the pandemic, according to third-party estimates. This was a more than doubling over 2019. Today, the marketplace is <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/walmart/number-of-sellers">topping 100,000 sellers,</a> per Marketplace Pulse data. Amazon&#8217;s Marketplace, on the other hand, counts an <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/amazon/number-of-sellers">estimated 6.3 million total sellers</a> worldwide, 1.5 million of which are currently active, per estimates.</p>
<p>Part of Walmart&#8217;s problem in scaling its marketplace business could be related to its ease-of-use on the seller side. Many smaller sellers <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/platforms/as-walmart-marketplace-grows-it-still-faces-hurdles-to-compete-with-amazon/">have reported that</a> Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace is far more difficult to use than Amazon&#8217;s, and they&#8217;ve complained about waiting months to hear back from Walmart about whether they were approved to sell on the platform.</p>
<p>Adobe&#8217;s partnership could help to address some of those challenges.</p>
<p>Adobe also notes it&#8217;s working to consolidate its other channel solutions into a single, unified extension that would allow its retail customers to sell across multiple sales channels &#8212; including <a href="https://magento.com/products/amazon-sales-channel">Amazon&#8217;s</a> &#8212; using one, integrated tool for easy account setup and catalog syndication.</p>
<p>This is the first time Walmart has made its retail technologies available to other businesses, the company said. And it has yet to forecast what sort of revenue the new partnership could bring in. But it&#8217;s a path that Amazon has also been pursuing in recent years to maximize the return on investment from its novel, retail innovations, like its A.I. and computer vision-powered <a href="https://justwalkout.com/">Just Walk Out system</a> that lets customers skip the checkout line.</p>
<p>&#8220;The core mission of helping people save money and live better is at the heart of every idea including Scan &amp; Go and checkout technologies, AI-powered smart substitutions and pickup and delivery,&#8221; said Suresh Kumar, chief technology officer and chief development officer of Walmart Inc., in a statement. &#8220;Combining Adobe’s strength in powering commerce experiences with our unmatched omni-customer expertise, we can accelerate other companies’ digital transformations,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Adobe’s retail customers in the U.S. will be able to integrate Walmart’s technologies in their own storefronts starting in early 2022, the companies said. Pricing and other details will be provided closer to launch.</p>
<p>While today&#8217;s announcement concerns channel partner Adobe, who will help to resell the technologies, Walmart also has a GoToMarket team that will target retailers directly.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Leaders become great not because of their power, but because of their ability to empower others.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that most tech companies tout their culture as &#8220;unique&#8221; or &#8220;open,&#8221; but when you take a closer look, it’s often merely surface level. Yes, you may be dog-friendly or offer unlimited beer on tap, but how are you helping your employees become the best versions of themselves? We’re at our best when our employees are at their best, so we do everything in our power to make that a reality.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			We’re at our best when our employees are at their best, so we do everything in our power to make that a reality.					</blockquote>

	</p>
<p>After successfully running Vincit in Finland and Switzerland, in 2016 we made the jump to the United States, setting up an office in California. Although we had moved over 5,000 miles to a new country, it was important that our two main KPIs remain the same: Employee happiness and customer satisfaction. We believe that happy employees make clients happy, and happy clients refer you to others. Therefore, it was essential that this positive and prosperous workplace environment followed us to the United States.</p>
<p>So beyond traditional benefits, like full medical coverage, 401k matching and standard office amenities, we tapped into our Finnish roots to build and provide our employees with an uninhibited, supportive workplace. We keep our company culture as transparent as possible and fully believe in the power of empowering our employees. We have no managers and no real role hierarchy. Employees do not have to go through an approval process on anything they are working on.</p>
<p>We encourage our employees to make a trip to Finland to visit our headquarters. Instead of &#8220;Lunch &amp; Learn&#8221; meetings, we host &#8220;Fail &amp; Learn&#8221; meetings where employees get to share something that didn’t work and what they learned from it. And once a month, we let an employee become the CEO for a day.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the &#8220;CEO of the Day&#8221; program is one of our most popular initiatives. The program gives our employee the reins for 24 hours with an unlimited budget. The only requirement? The CEO must make one lasting decision that will help improve the working experience of Vincit employees. Whatever the CEO of the Day decides, the company sticks with. They can purchase something for the company, change a policy, update a tool we use … Really, anything that they come up with can be done.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Squire is now a 175-person company with a tech platform used by over 2,000 shops across three continents.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When co-founders Songe LaRon and Dave Salvant first began barbershop tech platform <a href="https://getsquire.com/">Squire</a> in 2016, they leaned in: The duo bought a barbershop in New York City&#8217;s Chelsea neighborhood to see firsthand how the business worked. For one year, the co-founders religiously worked at the shop, now owned by a larger barbershop chain, handling every bit of the business (except cutting hair).</p>
<p>Five years later, the co-founders view that experience as a key moment in the history of Squire, now a 175-person company with a tech platform used by over 2,000 shops across three continents. After last raising a Series C in December and tripling its valuation, Squire announced today that it has raised a $60 million round led by Tiger Global.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Q81A5kTNOU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/squire-haircuts-coronavirus-crv-34-million-series-b/">Squire balances clean fades with the coronavirus</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Squire balances clean fades with the coronavirus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/squire-haircuts-coronavirus-crv-34-million-series-b/embed/#?secret=Q81A5kTNOU" data-secret="Q81A5kTNOU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And, it tripled its valuation, again. Off of 300% year-over-year revenue growth, the New York startup is now valued at $750 million. It&#8217;s a massive uptick: A little over a year ago, Squire was valued at $75 million.</p>
<p>Like many startups these days, Squire wasn’t searching for capital when Tiger Global, which participated in its Series B and C rounds, offered to lead its next financing. The startup has only spent 10% of its previous round, a $45 million equity round, and now has tens of millions more in the bank. Ultimately, its decision to bring on more capital is so it can expand in the U.K. and Canada more aggressively &#8212; even in the wake of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/los-angeles-based-boulevard-has-raised-11-million-for-its-software-to-manage-salons-and-spas/"> early-stage competitors like Boulevard.</a> Squire’s dry powder also puts the co-founders in a position to acquire companies, a strategy that Salvant is into and plans to be “aggressive about.”</p>
<p>Squire also announced today the official launch of a product that has been in the roadmap since inception: Squire Capital, a money management platform with tools tailored to the needs of barbershop operations, such as instant payments. Squire’s core business has been more around appointments, loyalty programs and the installment of contactless payment. Now, a fintech layer aims to offer a more niche service than current financial services heavyweights like Square or Paypal.</p>
<p>Fintech is a “natural next frontier” for Squire, Salvant said, because the startup already has deep insights into how its businesses operate and how they process sales; now, it wants to add another service so it can offer a more holistic experience to them.</p>
<p>Squire Capital was built with <a href="https://www.bond.tech/">Bond</a>, a venture-backed fintech infrastructure startup that aims to help enterprise operations launch their own banking products. After experimenting with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/squire-series-c/">$15 million debt financing arm</a> around the time of its Series C, Squire isn’t offering loans at this time, hoping to find a better way to scale offerings in the future.</p>
<p>Squire is en route to becoming a historical and unfortunately still rare Black-led unicorn. Salvant talked about the significance of that feat, noting that this was “the optimal outcome” when founding the company. He hopes that VCs and investors will start to invest more in Black founders with Squire as a data point of a success story.</p>
<p>“Let’s face it, we’re not typical founders, we don’t look the same and we don’t act the same,” Salvant said. “I just want to serve as a lighthouse and this is validation for myself, my co-founder, but more importantly, what’s coming after us.”</p>
