										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The New York City Council passed bills today that will set minimum pay and improve working conditions for gig workers making deliveries for apps like Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats. More specifically, the bills allow delivery workers to use restaurant bathrooms, limit how far they can be asked to deliver, set minimum payments per trip and ensure that tips get to workers. This legislation is the<a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/work/2021/9/22/22687983/nyc-landmark-food-delivery-worker-pay-bathrooms"> first of its kind</a> in any major U.S. city, setting a precedent for how government intervention can influence the relationship between food delivery companies and their many, many thousands of contractors.</p>
<p>This package of bills was written <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps">with input</a> from <a href="https://losdeliveristasunidos.org/">Los Deliveristas Unidos</a> (LDU), a collective of mostly immigrant app delivery workers that was born out of the Workers Justice Project. The group has been protesting for better working conditions throughout the pandemic, and, in April, they publicly <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2021/4/23/22397398/los-deliveristas-unidos-backed-by-union">joined forces</a> with SEIU Local 32BJ, NYC&#8217;s largest union of service workers.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;The bitter truth is that many food delivery workers can work 12 hours a day in the cold or rain for multiple food service apps and still not make enough to feed their own families,&#8221; the LDU website reads.</p>
<p>An LDU organizer <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5db8zx/gig-workers-were-incentivized-to-deliver-food-during-nycs-deadly-flood">told VICE</a> that gig workers can be financially incentivized to work during rain and snow storms, so dangerous weather can be an opportunity to make more money. Earlier this month, as Hurricane Ida pummeled New York City and led to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/nyregion/ida-new-york-city-deaths.html">13 deaths</a>, app delivery workers were still bringing people food, wading through feet of flooding to complete an order. DoorDash <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5db8zx/gig-workers-were-incentivized-to-deliver-food-during-nycs-deadly-flood">suspended service</a> in Manhattan, and Grubhub suspended service in certain parts of New York City. But many gig workers continued to seek bonuses and incentives where they could, even if it meant putting themselves in physical danger.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The conditions of Hurricane Ida illuminated a truth that has been obvious for years: contractors for delivery apps struggle to make a living wage, which incentivizes them to put themselves in danger for extra cash. At the same time, companies like DoorDash, Uber Eats and Grubhub <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/doordash-and-uber-eats-are-hot-theyre-still-not-making-money-11622194203">still aren&#8217;t making money</a>, even after doing more business than ever in the pandemic.</p>
<p>A report from the LDU surveyed more than 500 app-based couriers in NYC and found that, including tips, the average hourly net pay was <a href="https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/6c0bc951-f473-4720-be3e-797bd8c26b8e/09142021CHARTSLos%20Deliveristas%20Unidos-v02.pdf">around $12.21</a>, which falls below New York City&#8217;s $15 minimum wage. On top of that, delivery workers are expected to pay for their own transportation, which in New York City, is often via e-bike. Delivery workers are also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/nyregion/delivery-workers-robberies-nyc.html">especially vulnerable</a> to theft. The report also found that 49% of respondents had been in an accident or crash while making a delivery, and 75% of those people said that they paid for medical care with their own funds. However, DoorDash told TechCrunch that Dashers in Manhattan earn $33 per hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recognize the unique challenges facing delivery workers in New York City and share the goal of identifying policies that will help Dashers and workers like them. This is why last year, we announced an industry-leading set of initiatives to improve Dasher safety, strengthen earnings, and expand access to restrooms. We will continue to work with all stakeholders, including the City Council, to identify ways to support all delivery workers in New York City without unintended consequences,&#8221; a DoorDash spokesperson said in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>DoorDash also indicated some concerns with the bills, saying that the bathroom access bill doesn&#8217;t actually require restaurants to allow bathroom access; instead, companies like DoorDash have to include provisions in their <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4927206&amp;GUID=4F2D9BC6-74D4-4A24-A889-85104C11881B&amp;Options=ID%7cText%7c&amp;Search=2298">contracts with restaurants</a> that require them to allow delivery workers to use their bathrooms.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Grubhub also expressed support for the bills. The company told TechCrunch in a statement: “These bills are common sense steps to support the delivery workers who work hard every day for New York’s restaurants and residents. Ensuring they receive a living wage and have access to restrooms isn’t just a good idea &#8212; it’s the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>Gig workers for other apps experience similar issues to app delivery couriers. Earlier this week, the Gig Workers Collective &#8212; which represents about 13,000 Instacart contractors &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/instacart-shopper-activist-group-asks-customers-to-delete-the-app-until-demands-for-better-conditions-are-met/?tpcc=ECTW2020">urged customers to delete the app</a> until Instacart meets five demands to increase pay and make conditions better for workers. Because workers for these apps are contractors, rather than employees, they have fewer protections, like the guarantee of earning a minimum hourly wage. Instacart has even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/instacart-ceo-apologizes-for-tipping-debacle/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=inshorts">subsidized workers&#8217; wages</a> with their tips in the past.</p>
<p>For about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/23/nyregion/nyc-food-delivery-workers.html">80,000</a> delivery workers in New York City, today&#8217;s legislation marks a positive change. But it remains unclear how or if tech companies will be held responsible for paying these minimum wages and guaranteeing that workers&#8217; needs are met.</p>

After three days of fierce pitching in the virtual yet incredibly competitive Startup Battlefield arena, we have a winner.</p>
<p>The startups taking part in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/">Startup Battlefield</a> have all been hand-picked to participate in our highly competitive startup competition. Like last year, we reproduced the nail-biting excitement of our physical contest on a virtual stage. All the companies presented a live demo in front of multiple groups of VCs and tech leaders serving as judges for a chance to win $100,000 and the coveted Disrupt Cup.</p>
<p>After hours of deliberations, TechCrunch editors pored over the judges’ notes and narrowed the list down to five finalists: <a href="https://adventr.io">Adventr</a>, <a href="https://www.cellinobio.com">Cellino</a>, <a href="https://www.withkoa.com">Koa</a>, <a href="https://nthcycle.com">Nth Cycle</a> and <a href="https://tatum.io">Tatum</a>.</p>
<p>These startups made their way to the finale to demo in front of our final panel of judges, which included: Kirsten Green (Forerunner Ventures), Jim Lanzone (current CEO of Tinder, future CEO of Yahoo), Luciana Lixandru (Sequoia), Sarah Tavel (Benchmark), Alexa von Tobel (Inspired Capital) and Matthew Panzarino (TechCrunch).</p>
<p>We’re now ready to announce that the winner of TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 2021 is …</p>
<h2>Winner: Cellino</h2>
<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder="614cd3a175544444803475dd" post-id="2207654"></div> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cellinobio.com">Cellino</a>, a company developing a platform to automate stem cell production, combines AI technology, machine learning, hardware, software — and yes, lasers! — to democratize access to cell therapies. It aims to bring down costs associated with the manufacturing of human cells while also increasing yields.</p>
<p>Read our post about Cellino <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/cellino-is-using-ai-and-machine-learning-to-scale-production-of-stem-cell-therapies/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Runner-Up: Nth Cycle</h2>
<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder="614cd1ba7554444480346e7c" post-id="2207642"></div> </p>
<p><a href="https://nthcycle.com">Nth Cycle</a> has developed an electro-extraction system that stands at less than 1,000 square feet and can process 5 tons of material per day — a key differentiator from big, traditional recyclers that use hydro- and pyrometallurgical techniques that require more capital and generate a greater footprint. The system can accept “black mass,” a powdery waste substance that’s generated from the battery recycling process, and turn that waste into valuable minerals like nickel, cobalt and manganese.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In order to combat human trafficking effectively, those combating it must understand it — and these days, that means data. Unfortunately, for obvious reasons there is no convenient index of trafficking victims, though this confidential information is in some ways abundant. Microsoft and the International Organization for Migration may have found a way forward with a new synthetic database that has all the important characteristics of the real trafficking data, but is completely artificial.</p>
<p>While each victim is unquestionably individual, basic high-level questions like what countries are increasingly the source or means of trafficking, what routes and methods are used, and where the victims end up are a matter of statistics. The evidence to identify trends and patterns, crucial to prevention, is locked up in thousands of these individual stories that most would prefer not to publicize.</p>
<p>&#8220;Administrative data on identified cases of human trafficking represent one of the main sources of data available but such information is highly sensitive,&#8221; said IOM program coordinator Harry Cook <a href="https://www.iom.int/news/iom-microsoft-collaboration-enables-release-largest-public-dataset-bolster-fight-against-human-trafficking">in a news release describing the dataset</a>. &#8220;IOM has been delighted to work with Microsoft Research over the past two years to make progress on the critical challenge of sharing such data for analysis while protecting the safety and privacy of victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Historically, for things like crime databases and medical info, the strategy is to redact liberally, but this method of &#8220;de-anonymizing&#8221; has been shown to be ineffective against any serious attempt to reconstruct the data. With numerous databases public and leaked and computing power on tap, the redacted information can be supplied quite reliably.</p>
<p>The option taken by Microsoft Research is to use the original data as the basis for a synthetic dataset that retains all the important statistical relationships of the source but none of the identifiable information. And it&#8217;s not just turning &#8220;Jane Doe&#8221; into &#8220;Janet Doeman&#8221; and her hometown from Cleveland to Queens. Instead, groups of no less than ten people with similar or overlapping data are merged to create a set of attributes that accurately represent them statistically but can&#8217;t be used to identify them individually.</p>

<p>Naturally this doesn&#8217;t have the granularity of the original data, but unlike the sensitive source, <em>this</em> data can actually be used. It&#8217;s not necessarily for some task force to analyze and say &#8220;okay the next smuggling operation will be based out of&#8230;&#8221; but rather this data, based in firsthand evidence, can be pointed at as a factual record for addressing this at a policy and diplomacy level. Where before one may have had to say in a more general way that Country X or Government Z was neglectful or complicit in these matters, having hard data to back that up allows one to say &#8220;36 percent of sex trafficking victims pass through your jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not that the data has to be used in strongarm tactics — simply understanding the global trade in human misery as a system and not just a series of disconnected events is valuable in and of itself. You can peruse the data and request to use it <a href="https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/global-synthetic-dataset">here</a>., and learn more about the process for creating it <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/synthetic-data-showcase">at the program&#8217;s GitHub</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The company whose tech powered the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/myheritage-now-lets-you-animate-old-family-photos-using-deepfakery/"> sensational MyHeritage app</a> that turned classic family photos into lifelike moving portraits is back with a new implementation of its technology: Transforming still photographs into ultra-realistic video, capable of saying whatever you want.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.d-id.com">D-ID&#8217;s</a> Speaking Portraits may look like the notorious &#8220;deepfakes&#8221; that have made headlines over the past couple of years, but the underlying tech is actually quite different, and there&#8217;s no training required for basic functionality.</p>
<p>D-ID, which actually debuted at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/d-id-launches-its-initial-product-with-customers-in-printing-automotive-and-financial-services/">TechCrunch Battlefield in 2018 with a very different focus</a> (scrambling facial recognition tech), debuted its new Speaking Portraits product live at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. The company showed off a number of use cases, including using its new tech to create a multilingual TV anchor capable of expressing various emotions; creating virtual chatbot personas for customer support interactions; developing training courses for professional development use; and creating interactive conversational video ad kiosks.</p>
<p>Both this new product and D-ID&#8217;s partnership with MyHeritage, which saw the latter company&#8217;s app briefly take over the top of Apple&#8217;s App Store charts, are obviously major departures from the company&#8217;s initial focus. Up until even May of last year, D-ID was still raising funding based on its earlier approach, but its partnership with MyHeritage debuted in February, followed by a similar deal with GoodTrust after that and a splashy tie-up with Warner Bros. on the Hugh Jackman film &#8220;Reminiscence&#8221; that allowed fans to insert themselves into its trailer.</p>
<p>D-ID&#8217;s pivot might seem more dramatic than most, but from a technical perspective its new focus on bringing photos to life is not so far off from its de-identification software. D-ID CEO and co-founder Gil Perry told me that the company chose the new direction because it was apparent that there&#8217;s a very large addressable market when it comes to this kind of application.</p>
<p>Big-name clients like Warner Bros., as well as an App Store-dominating app from a relatively unknown brand, would seem to support that assessment. Speaking Portraits, however, is aimed at clients both big and small, and allows anyone to generate a full HD video from a source image, plus either recorded speech or typed text. D-ID is launching the product with support for English, Spanish and Japanese, but plans to add other languages in the future, too, as customers request support for those.</p>
<p>D-ID offers two basic categories of Speaking Portrait, including a &#8220;Single Portrait&#8221; that can be made using just a single still image, which features an animated head but other parts stay static. This one will also work with the existing background in the photo only.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For a bit more uncanny reality, there&#8217;s a &#8220;Trained Character&#8221; option that requires submitting a 10-minute training video of the character requested, following guidelines supplied by the company. This has the advantage of being able to work against a custom, swappable background, and features some preset animation options for the character&#8217;s body and hands.</p>
<p>Check out an example of a Speaking Portrait newscaster generated using the trained character method below to get a sense of how realistic it can be:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nV_sLx3PceU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The demo that Perry showed us live at Disrupt today was created from a still photo of himself as a child. The photo was mapped to facial expressions performed by a sort of human puppeteer who also voiced the script for what the Speaking Portrait version of Gil ended up saying during the interaction between his current and younger self. You can see a video of how the speaker&#8217;s expressions were mirrored by the animated photo below:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFW7iktsuYg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Obviously, the ability to create photo-realistic videos from just a single photo that can convincingly deliver any lines you want is a bit of a hair-raising prospect. We&#8217;ve already seen far-ranging debates about the ethics of deepfakes, as well as industry efforts to try to fingerprint and identify when AI generated realistic, but artificial, results.</p>
<p>Perry said at Disrupt that D-ID is &#8220;keen to make sure it&#8217;s used for good, not bad,&#8221; and that in order to achieve that, they&#8217;re going to be issuing a pledge at the end of October, alongside partners, that outline their commitments to &#8220;transparency and consent&#8221; when it comes to using tech like Speaking Portraits. The purpose of said commitment is to ensure that &#8220;users aren&#8217;t confused about what they&#8217;re seeing and that people involved give their consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>While D-ID wants to make assurances in its terms of use and public position on misuse of this kind of tech, Perry says it &#8220;can&#8217;t do it alone,&#8221; which is why he&#8217;s calling on others in the ecosystem to join forces in efforts to avoid abuse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://thentwrk.com/">NTWRK</a>, a video shopping app that has helped to popularize the idea of livestreamed commerce in the U.S., announced today it has closed on $50 million in new funding led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management and global luxury group Kering, owners of luxury <a href="https://www.kering.com/en/talent/who-we-are/our-houses/">brands</a> Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and others. The company has been working to capitalize on the growing interest in live commerce and creator content, and shifted into<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/the-ntwrk-the-live-nation-backed-shopping-app-for-gen-z-is-launching-a-virtual-festival/"> live virtual events</a> and festivals as COVID-19 ravaged the U.S. last year. Now it says it will invest in furthering its growth and working to establish a more global footprint.</p>
<p>Other participants in the new round include LionTree Partners and Tenere Capital. They join the company&#8217;s prior backers: Main Street Advisors (whose investors include Jimmy Iovine, Drake and LeBron James), Live Nation, Foot Locker and others. Allison Berardo, a vice president within the Growth Equity business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, will join NTWRK&#8217;s board of directors.</p>

<p>Aimed at a younger crowd of Gen Z and millennial consumers, NTWRK offers tools that allow creators to interact with viewers and sell products in real time, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/26/ntwrk-moves-into-live-events/">what&#8217;s been called</a> a mix of QVC, Twitter and Twitch. The experience blends commerce with entertainment, as viewers watch and chat with other viewers and hosts in real time, as they shop for streetwear, shoes, collectibles and other items. The company has also created its own exclusive content where it has featured hosts like Billie Eilish, Juice WRLD, DJ Khaled, Odell Beckham Jr., Eddie Huang, Blake Griffin, Alexander Wang, FaZe Clan, Nadeshot, Jonah Hill, Gary Vee, A$AP Ferg, Wu-Tang Clan, Doja Cat and others. (It even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/on-the-heels-of-its-ntwrk-investment-faze-clan-looks-at-global-expansion-despite-pandemic/">invested</a> into FaZe Clan last year, we should note.)</p>
<p>Its business model extends beyond just offering live video shopping that you can tune into at any time, as it also regularly features product drops that work to build up anticipation and excitement. This sort of feature is only now making its way to larger social media platforms, like Instagram, which introduced drops <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/instagram-launches-a-new-section-for-shopping-product-drops/">just this spring</a>.</p>
<p>NTWRK has also embraced live events and virtual festivals as another way to engage audiences. Last year, for instance, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/the-ntwrk-the-live-nation-backed-shopping-app-for-gen-z-is-launching-a-virtual-festival/">ran TRANSFER</a>, which featured 30 brands and artists, panels, interviews, DJ sets and musical performances. It also ran BEYOND THE STREETS, a virtual art fair that attracted over 250,000 attendees. Earlier this year it ran a two-day designer toy and collectibles festival, <a href="https://shorefire.com/releases/entry/ntwrk-unboxed-a-two-day-designer-toy-collectibles-festival-february-13-14-2021">Unboxed</a>, as the first of a slate of digital events which have subsequently run throughout the year, including <a href="https://shorefire.com/releases/entry/ntwrk-presents-surface-festival">Surface Festival</a>, a <a href="https://shorefire.com/releases/entry/ntwrk-the-hundreds-present-a-two-day-virtual-food-festival-family-style-to-go">virtual food festival</a> and a virtual <a href="https://shorefire.com/releases/entry/ntwrk-announces-open-house-a-virtual-home-goods-festivalfor-the-hype-obsessed-generation">home goods festival. </a>It&#8217;s now gearing up for th<a href="https://shorefire.com/releases/entry/ntwrk-announcesthe-second-editionof-transfer">e return of its flagship event</a>, TRANSFER.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1991851" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1991851" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1991851" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Transfer-black.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Transfer-black.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Transfer-black.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Transfer-black.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Transfer-black.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Transfer-black.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Transfer-black.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Transfer-black.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1991851" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://thentwrk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NTWRK <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This summer, NTWRK also <a href="https://shorefire.com/releases/entry/ntwrk-expands-into-the-world-of-nfts">embraced</a> the world of digital goods with the launch of NTWRK NFT, its own curated shop for unique crypto art from creators like BADBOI, Imaginary Foundation, MILKMAN, Young &amp; Sick, Fafi, KidEight, MGOGLKTKO and Eddie Gangland.</p>
<p>Livestream shopping is already a popular activity overseas, but is still gaining ground here in the U.S. The company, in announcing its news today, noted that livestream shopping in China reached $150 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow to $300 billion this year. But in the U.S. it&#8217;s expected to reach $11 billion by the end of 2021 and $25 billion by 2025, leaving much room for growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision is to become the biggest, most culturally relevant, livestream shopping marketplace for Gen-Z and Millennial audiences who are obsessed with pop culture,&#8221; said NTWRK CEO Aaron Levant, in a statement. &#8220;It’s exciting for NTWRK to have Goldman Sachs and Kering sign on for the future of livestream shopping.&#8221;</p>
<p>NTWRK had previously raised a $10 million Series A, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ntwrk/investor_financials">Crunchbase</a> data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian, the electric vehicle startup that’s gearing up for an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/electric-vehicle-company-rivian-has-confidentially-filed-for-an-ipo/">initial public offering</a>, continues its trend of growing fast. The company will be opening a service support operations facility for vehicle owners in Plymouth, Michigan &#8212; and just in time, as deliveries of the launch edition of the R1T pickup are expected to commence late this month.</p>
<p>The facility will create 100 new jobs and come at an investment of $4.6 million, $750,000 of which comes from a business development grant from the state. Funds such as the Michigan Business Development Program are used to attract business and encourage in-state job creation and investment. This isn’t Rivian’s first time investing in Michigan &#8212; while the company’s factory is in Normal, Illinois (with a second one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/rivian-is-planning-a-second-u-s-factory/">likely coming</a>), its headquarters is in Plymouth. Rivian also opened an R&amp;D center in Dearborn in 2015 at a capital investment of $29.5 million.</p>
<p>The new center will be an extension of Rivian’s current headquarters, a company spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. Through the new center, the electric automaker “plans to support all Rivian owners” by providing “around-the-clock assistance by the Rivian Roadside and Service Support team to North American Rivian owners with vehicle questions, roadside requests and service scheduling needs,” according to a news release.</p>
<p>The Michigan Governor’s Office describes the new jobs as high-wage and says that they come with benefits like tuition reimbursement and childcare assistance.</p>

<p>Like its rival Tesla, Rivian operates under a direct sales model that allows customers to order vehicles from it directly online. Today, only 22 states allow OEMs to sell directly to customers &#8212; in those states, Rivian can set up display rooms and offer test rides &#8212; but there are no prohibitions from a customer ordering directly online.</p>
<p>Rivian also plans on keeping its servicing and support in-house. According to the company website, Rivian plans on providing 24/7 support via its Service Team, which will offer troubleshooting, diagnostics, help with setting up appointments and roadside assistance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just last week, Rivian confirmed to TechCrunch that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/rivian-vehicles-are-now-ready-for-sale-in-all-50-states-following-key-certifications/">received the necessary certifications</a> from three separate agencies giving it the greenlight to sell and deliver the R1T and R1S SUV in all 50 states.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bay Area-based autonomous farming startup Iron Ox this week announced a $53 million round. The Series C, led by Breakthrough Energy Venture, brings the firm’s total funding up to $98 million.</p>
<p>Iron Ox is one of a large number of companies looking to revolutionize farming for the 21st century, amid growing concerns over population growth, climate change, labor shortages and a slew of other mounting concerns. Solutions range from large-scale indoor farms to field robotics designed for a more plug and play approach that operates with a more traditional setup.</p>
<p>The startup refers to its approach as a “closed loop system.” It’s effectively a robotic greenhouse full of proprietary harvesting technology. The company doesn’t have any outlandish claims in terms of yield, saying it more or less amounts to what you’ll get from a traditional farm, but it’s working to do so with a significantly smaller environmental footprint &#8212; and a model that is less beholden to seasonal changes than standard farming.</p>
<p>Iron Ox says its system uses around 90% less water than traditional farming. These sorts of systems also integrate data into every part of the process, collecting a significant amount of information about the produce they grow to improve on future yield.</p>
<p>“World-class investors know that humanity’s most important pursuit is to reverse climate change. To get there, we can’t settle for incrementally more sustainable crops — and we can’t ask consumers to compromise on taste, convenience, or value,” co-founder and CEO Brandon Alexander said in a release tied to the news. “We are applying technology to minimize the amount of land, water and energy needed to nourish a growing population. The team at Iron Ox will not stop until we achieve our long-term mission of making the produce sector carbon negative.”</p>
<p>The company says this round will go toward scaling manufacturing, expanding operations in the U.S., ramping up R&amp;D and hiring more headcount.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tiny houses might have lost some of their luster in the COVID era, but a reimagined future for remote work might call for tiny offices.</p>
<p>According to Nick Foley, <a href="https://www.denizen.work/#1">Denizen</a> founder and CEO, people are clamoring for a serene space to think these days — and they’re happy to pay for it.</p>
<p>Foley is the former chief product officer and director of industrial design for Jump Bikes, a bike-sharing company acquired by Uber in 2018 for $200 million. With Denizen, he’s setting out to answer one question: “Can you build an office space as a product that’s just a phenomenal experience for a single person to have the perfect workday?&#8221;</p>
<p>Foley thinks that WeWork got some things wrong about how to optimize the work environment. While plenty of people reap the social benefits of co-working, a buzzing environment full of workers focusing on different projects can be detrimental to the kind of flow state that some work necessitates.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207299" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207299" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207299" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-outside.jpg?w=680" alt="Denizen outside" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-outside.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-outside.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-outside.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-outside.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-outside.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-outside.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-outside.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207299" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nick Foley and David Krawczyk</p></div></p>
<p>Denizen’s solution is to build a small army of itty-bitty standalone offices that come pre-constructed, packed with outlets, USB plugs, cameras (for videoconferencing), speakers, an integrated router and even a whiteboard wall, all in less than 100 square feet. Denizen’s office pods are beautifully designed, with windows that can turn opaque in seconds for privacy, recyclable materials and an aesthetic that’s right at home in Dwell (they were actually <a href="https://www.dwell.com/article/denizen-archetype-prefab-office-pod-4b8c5d90">just featured in Dwell</a>, because of course they were).</p>
<p>“The ceiling is really high, the glass is all around you — it just feels expansive and huge,” Foley said, adding that Denizen is all about giving people the tools they need to have “inspired, productive workdays.” And they&#8217;re not just a beautiful concept image — a friend of Foley&#8217;s who works for NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory gave us a virtual tour of his own Denizen-built micro workspace.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Denizen initially only planned to provide its pre-fab office pods to employers, who could rent them on a monthly subscription basis. But the demand from people stuck working from home and searching for an alternative was so great that the company now plans to sell the standalone offices on wheels to individuals, who can keep them at their home residences. One of Denizen’s beautiful, high-tech tiny offices will set you back about $55,000 as an individual.</p>
<p>Foley sees the Denizen model as something that would fit into a company’s COVID-era real estate plan. With fewer workers coming into the office, companies are downsizing the expensive and often sprawling campuses that have long defined them and looking to explore more flexible, bespoke options that better fit the future of work. For an employer with a bulk deal, Foley expects that each smartpod will run around $1,000 per month to rent.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207301" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207301" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207301" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-board.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-board.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-board.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-board.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-board.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-board.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-board.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denizen-board.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207301" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nick Foley and David Krawczyk</p></div></p>
<p>The pods could supplement traditional offices with inspiring solo office settings, but Foley hopes that some day companies or even city governments might place clusters of Denizen office pods in green spaces where they could be booked out by the day.</p>
<p>“The real dream is honestly very similar to Jump Bikes&#8230; Figuring out how to collaborate on the neighborhood level to make these really amazing shared use amenities,” Foley said.</p>
<p>The company is currently raising a seed round of funding and signing up companies in the Bay Area and further afield in California for multi-unit tests that will start in early 2022. It’s looking to scale slowly, selling about 100 units next year while it streamlines the manufacturing experience to get the product just right.</p>

<p>Because the smartpods are on wheels, Denizen smartly eschews many of the permitting headaches that Foley’s team would otherwise get bogged down in. “I understand how that can be a complication to a business model,” Foley says, citing his experience installing kiosks and parking structures for Jump Bikes.</p>
<p>Instead of navigating labyrinthine local regulations, anyone with a 12&#215;7.5-foot area and the cash to spare can roll right into one of the little pod offices and get to work. From a regulatory perspective, it’s basically a beautiful little RV, sans plumbing.</p>
<p>Foley is excited about how his vision fits into the future of work, but he’s also excited about the literal nuts and bolts of putting Denizen’s tiny offices together. Production for the pod offices blends large-scale CNC automation, 3D printing and sophisticated product design into a product that’s pre-fabricated and ready to ship to Denizen’s early customers on the West Coast, wheels and all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most people know Ryan Reynolds from his movies, but the actor has his hands in a number of entrepreneurial ventures. He owns a majority stake in <a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/">Mint Mobile</a>, a mobile virtual network operator, which has grown more than 50,000% in the past three years. He was also invested in <a href="https://www.aviationgin.com/">Aviation Gin</a> before selling it for a staggering $600 million last year.</p>
<p>But perhaps most applicable to the startup world, Reynolds is also a founder of <a href="https://www.maximumeffort.com/">Maximum Effort</a>, a marketing firm responsible for the ads you&#8217;ve seen for the Deadpool franchise, Aviation Gin, Mint Mobile (of course) and that hilarious Match.com ad featuring Satan and the year 2020 as a match made in hell.</p>

		<blockquote>
			I&#8217;ve found that everything that I&#8217;ve built or made, that I value and hold dear in this world, including my family and businesses, have all been built on the foundations of failures and mistakes.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 this week, we sat down with Reynolds to discuss how startups can use &#8220;fast-vertising&#8221; (a term Reynolds coined), which involves treating real-time cultural moments as a springboard, to build their own brand buzz.</p>
<p>We also talked about why he invests in big, well-established businesses instead of small tech startups, why Mint isn&#8217;t available in Canada yet, and perhaps most importantly, how authenticity and failure are actually the keys to his success.</p>
<h2>The secrets of great marketing</h2>
<p>Reynolds knows exactly what he brings to the table when he makes a deal with a company. First and foremost, it&#8217;s awareness. He&#8217;s Ryan Reynolds, after all, and can introduce a lesser-known brand relatively easily, considering he has more than 18 million Twitter followers and nearly 40 million followers on Instagram.</p>
<p>But unlike other celebrities who tweet inauthentic promotions of brands they&#8217;re associated with, Reynolds truly wants a seat at the table and has a level of credibility with his fans and followers that is a direct result of his personality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In some ways, the timing couldn’t have been more fortuitous. No one roots for a pandemic, but WarnerMedia launched HBO Max just as cities and states across the U.S. went under curfews and lockdowns as the COVID-19 pandemic spread.</p>
<p>In many ways, the service seemed well positioned, even in a sector crowded with platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+. HBO Max brought decades of critically acclaimed series under its belt, including &#8220;The Sopranos,&#8221; &#8220;The Wire,&#8221; and &#8220;Game of Thrones,&#8221; coupled with pricey acquisitions like the &#8220;Friends&#8221; and &#8220;South Park&#8221; back catalogues.</p>
<p>Filling out the offering was a healthy catalogue of 1,300 films and television series from CNN, TNT, TBS, truTV, Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, among others. WarnerMedia, meanwhile, provided access to perennial favorite Looney Tunes shorts and the complete catalogue of DC Comics films and televisions shows. All told, HBO Max promised 10,000 hours of movies and TV at launch.</p>
<p>But if Quibi’s eight-month lifespan is any indication, all the money, star power and executive bonafides can’t buy you a successful streaming service. Over the last few years, many big names had tried and failed at that game — the streaming graveyard is littered with good intentions and big-budget flameouts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Lamborghini Huracán is the best-selling sports car that Lamborghini makes, and its days as a combustion-powered super sports car are numbered.</p>
<p>Since the Huracán&#8217;s inception in 2014, the company says it has sold 17,500 worldwide, but that won&#8217;t be enough to save the V10 engine &#8212; no matter how much customers want it. The new Huracán STO, or Super Trofeo Omologata, is the latest super sports car to enter the Lamborghini line up and it simultaneously offers a tiny glimpse of what the future might hold for Lamborghini while exalting the sunsetting of the raucous, visceral, powerful, internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Huracán STO is a celebration of the combustion engine,&#8221; Andrea Baldi, the new North American CEO of Lamborghini, told TechCrunch while sitting trackside at Willow Springs Raceway during a press event to test the all-new Huracán STO, a street-to-racetrack super sports car that starts at $327,838 before taxes and delivery.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207615" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Huracán-STO-4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207615" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2207615 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Huracán-STO-4.jpg" alt="Lamborghini Huracan STO" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Huracán-STO-4.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Huracán-STO-4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Huracán-STO-4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Huracán-STO-4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Huracán-STO-4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Huracán-STO-4.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Huracán-STO-4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2207615" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lamborghini</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The engine isn&#8217;t just an engine,&#8221; Maurizio Reggiani, the chief technology officer for Lamborghini, tells me later, &#8220;it&#8217;s music and it&#8217;s part of the DNA of the brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>That DNA is deeply tethered to striking design, power and what both executives refer to as &#8220;emotion&#8221; &#8212; an abstract idea that embodies the sense of exclusivity and fun that draws the well heeled to Lamborghini.</p>
<p>While I don&#8217;t pretend to be an accomplished professional race car driver and only got a handful of lead-follow laps around the tricky, undulating Big Willow track, it&#8217;s clear that Lamborghini has harnessed something special in one of the last combustion-engined vehicles it will introduce. (Next time, I want to see how the Huracán STO handles on the road.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>An approachable race car you can street drive</h2>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A91hJqX0QyE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The new Huracán STO takes lessons from Lamborghini&#8217;s successful campaigns in single-model racing &#8212; the Super Trofeo EVO and GT3 EVO series that take place all around the world &#8212; and blends these with &#8220;comfort, practicality&#8221; and street legality. At its core, the Huracán STO is a reverse-homologated street-legal race car with advanced aerodynamics and materials, sophisticated brakes and telemetry that aims to make its owners faster on the track &#8212; while still offering them the option to take a date to dinner in one of the most striking vehicles on the road today.</p>
<p>The Huracán&#8217;s massive 5.2-liter, 631 horsepower V10 engine is married to a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox that makes reaching 140 mph on the straight at Big Willow happen in an eyeblink &#8212; and the STO doesn&#8217;t even break a sweat since the max speed is 193 mph. Put your foot to the floor and the rear-wheel drive STO takes off even when the ANIMA (Adaptive Network Intelligence Management) setting is in the most mellow street (STO) mode. In this mode, the suspension and dynamics are managed by the Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Integrata (LDVI) system to be responsive but more forgiving than in the other modes.</p>
<p>Want a little bit more slide around the corners and faster lap times? Press the ANIMA button again, and you land in Trofeo mode, which changes the torque vectoring (managed by the LDVI) to allow a tad more tail wag. Piaggio mode is reserved for rain, something the desert landscape around Rosemead, California, where Willow Springs is located, hasn&#8217;t seen in some time.</p>
<p>The Huracán STO feels approachable on the track &#8212; even on the gnarly off-camber, reducing radius, double apex turns around Big Willow. That&#8217;s in large part thanks to the advanced aerodynamics of the vehicle, most prominently visible in the added shark fin and giant, manually adjustable wing. That wing at the back can be set into three distinct positions: High, medium and low, which can change the center of gravity by up to 13% and increase the downforce by more than 200 pounds.</p>
<h2>Advanced materials and brakes</h2>
<p>Lamborghini has also employed the use of lightweight carbon fiber to both maintain body stiffness and minimize weight.  More than 75% of the body of the Huracán STO is made up of carbon fiber, including the Miura-inspired clamshell-style &#8220;cofango,&#8221; a mash-up of the Italian words for hood and fender, at the front of the car. Under that bonnet sits a tiny storage space, just big enough for your racing helmet or a date&#8217;s bag, depending on your driving plans for the day. The STO is nearly 100 pounds lighter than the Performante on which it is partially based thanks to the additional carbon fiber and lighter interior bits.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more important than going very quickly on a race track is the ability to stop very quickly, repeatedly, without any softness in the brakes. The STO gets the first consumer vehicle application of a set of F1-derived, Brembo, carbon-ceramic resin matrix (CCM-R) brakes. This technology helps prevent brake fade during long track stints by keeping them cooler. Added vents at the fenders also push air past the calipers and discs to keep things from getting too heated, as well. Drivers can see brake temperatures in the instrument panel and LDVI helps keep track of brake fade.</p>
<h2>Track tech that makes you faster</h2>
<p>For those who want to see measurable improvement in their track times, Lamborghini offers a connected telemetry system &#8212; much like a VBOX a professional driver would use &#8212; that owners can use to record and compare their track times and performance.</p>
<p>The system analyzes everything from brake and throttle input to steering angle to help make owners and drivers faster around their preferred track. The data and video are all uploaded to Lamborghini&#8217;s proprietary semi-social network that owners can access on their smartphones through the UNICA app. They can choose to share their track times with other owners, their friends or their coaches.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t pretend that I came close to the limits of those brakes or the bespoke Bridgestone Potenza track tires my car had &#8212; but I will say that the Huracán STO is one of the most confidence-boosting, communicative and approachable track cars I&#8217;ve experienced. Steering is direct and linear, and unlike other Lamborghinis I&#8217;ve driven both on and off track, the STO doesn&#8217;t get messy or squirrelly as you begin to tiptoe closer to the edge of the vehicle&#8217;s capability. At quick speeds its controlled and even refined, a term you might not traditionally associate with a track-oriented Lamborghini.</p>
<p>The good news for those with cash to spend is that Huracán STO production is only limited by what the factory in Sant&#8217;Agata Bolognese can produce. Baldi says that&#8217;s around 2,500 cars per year, and the Huracán STO is already sold out through next year. &#8220;The limit is only in what we can produce. It is limited by the production capacity. By 2024 we&#8217;ll be hybridizing the Huracán and the existing ICE versions will be discontinued,&#8221; Baldi said.</p>
<p>Lamborghini says that the STO will do 0-60 in under 3 seconds &#8212; and while my time following Richard Antinucci, the pro race driver leading me around the track, only consisted of a handful of laps, it&#8217;s clear that the STO offers something incredibly special for those with enough cash and aplomb to push the reverse-homologated car to its limits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, Clubhouse is rolling out Wave, a feature that makes it easier to start private rooms with friends when you see that they&#8217;re online. Available globally on iOS and Android, Wave will replace starting a private room with friends. You can wave at multiple people at once, so long as they follow you, and anyone who accepts will join your private room as a speaker.</p>
<p>To send a wave, navigate to the Hallway by swiping right or tapping the dots icon on the bottom left of the screen. Then, tap the wave button next to the names of the people you want to chat with. Those people will get a notification that you invited them to a room &#8212; if they deny the request, you won&#8217;t know. If they accept, they can be added to a private room with you and anyone else who accepted your invitation.</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re waiting for friends to connect with you, you can still browse around the app and join other rooms &#8212; you&#8217;ll be notified when someone joins your private room from your Wave. While you browse, a small Wave bar will appear on the screen, making it easier to cancel your Wave if you become engrossed in another conversation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207508" style="width: 1450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207508" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207508 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03_tap-for-hello.gif" alt="" width="1440" height="810" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207508" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clubhouse</p></div></p>
<p>These private rooms can still be reported to Clubhouse if someone is breaking the rules. Clubhouse told TechCrunch that if someone waves to people that have blocked each other, then the first person to join will have access, but the next person won&#8217;t be allowed in, since a user in the room has them blocked.</p>
<p>The feature will start rolling out today, but users need to have the latest version of Clubhouse downloaded to gain access. Wave was <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1438931407322042369">first spotted</a> by app researcher Jane Manchun Wong last week &#8212; Clubhouse <a href="https://twitter.com/Clubhouse/status/1439638356334452741">played along</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207509" style="width: 1450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207509" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207509 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05_room.gif" alt="" width="1440" height="810" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207509" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clubhouse</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though Clubhouse said in a blog post that more than 700,000 rooms are created on the app each day, the pressure is on the startup to compete with more established companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a>, which have invested in their own live audio products.</p>
<p>Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/clubhouse-android-app-launch/">launched for Android</a> in May and came <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/clubhouse-invite-open-to-everyone-exits-beta/">out of beta</a> in July &#8212; but according to estimates from app analytics firm SensorTower, Clubhouse only saw about 1.7 million global installs last month, down 35% month over month from about 2.6 million in July. Its best month on record was in February, when it gained 9.6 million downloads. To date, SensorTower estimates that Clubhouse has been downloaded 32.2 million times.</p>
<p>Clubhouse has recently unveiled upgrades like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/clubhouse-dms-backchannel/">Backchannel</a>, a messaging feature and support for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/29/clubhouse-spatial-audio/">spatial audio</a>, which offers a more life-like experience of being in a room full of people. But the app still doesn&#8217;t have live captioning, making it inaccessible to users who are deaf or hard of hearing. Facebook Live Audio Rooms and Twitter Spaces already support this feature.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["The pandemic made it visible that there was a missing piece in the customer journey: video chat," says Fernando Moya, CEO of early-stage Chilean startup Ocular Solution. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;The pandemic made it visible that there was a missing piece in the customer journey: video chat,&#8221; says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-moya-b9b52b66/">Fernando Moya</a>, CEO of early-stage Chilean startup <a href="https://ocularsolution.com/">Ocular Solution</a>.</p>
<p>According to Moya, COVID-19 made it obvious that live chat and chatbots were not enough, as people were still hoping to interact face-to-face with customer agents — just like they do offline.</p>
<p>This is what Ocular Solution, which participated in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/">Startup Alley</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt, is hoping to solve in the digital world, with a platform that helps clients add a video chat element to their site and integrate it with their existing tools, from HubSpot to Pipedrive.</p>
<p>Video chat can come in handy for customer support, but also for onboarding and sales. The latter is especially true if the service is a good fit for consultative selling, in which the end user is hoping to get questions answered before proceeding.</p>
<p>This desire to talk to a real person explains why Moya sees video chat as an efficient way to reduce cart abandonment rate — a major issue for e-commerce. Aggregating data from 44 studies, UX research institute Baymard <a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate">estimated</a> the average documented online shopping cart abandonment rate at near 70%.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for site visitors not to turn into customers, but Ocular found out that offering video chat can help boost conversions. The startup&#8217;s customers boast an average service-related net promoter score of 8, Moya told TechCrunch, with conversion rates starting at 15% and peaking at 250% during Chile&#8217;s e-commerce promotion event <a href="https://www.cyber.cl/index.html#information/preguntas-frecuentes">CyberDay</a>.</p>
<p>Ocular launched in Chile, where Moya had previously co-founded another company, <a href="https://www.wingsoft.com/">Wingsoft</a>, which Ocular spun out of. But the startup is already looking beyond borders: It plans to keep its team remote, albeit with small hybrid hubs; and it already has clients in other Latin American countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Latin America&#8217;s e-commerce <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/chart/247777/digital-buyer-penetration-worldwide-by-region-2021-of-internet-users">hasn&#8217;t reached the same penetration levels</a> than in North America and Western Europe, but <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/argentina-was-the-country-where-e-commerce-grew-the-most-in-2020/">sales are increasing at a faster pace than in other regions</a>. These new online consumers are arguably more likely to look for an experience that is more similar to in-person shopping. &#8220;The quantity of people requiring video assistance is growing very fast,&#8221; Moya said.</p>
<p>Customer satisfaction and sales aside, Ocular is also hoping to help its clients improve their internal processes. As a result, it provides companies with data to help them track key metrics related to customer service, while helping attendants do their job. &#8220;We train your agents so that they deliver the best service experience and can get the most out of the tools,&#8221; its site explains.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that agents play a key role in the use of our technology; they humanize this new customer service channel,&#8221; Moya said. &#8220;Therefore, our efforts are focused on generating tools that allow them to improve day by day, that motivate them and generate profits as the result of them performing well, within an entertaining and challenging environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moya expects more people to want to become video chat attendants and predicts an upcoming &#8220;uberization&#8221; of this segment. This could help answer growing demand for these services: &#8220;Use cases for video support are varied, and new ways of applying it are appearing every day.&#8221;</p>

It includes a bunch of intriguing features, such as audible directions, remote kill and an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) sensor.</p>
<p>You can play your own music or podcasts using the built-in Bluetooth speaker and hear turn-by-turn directions to help you get where you&#8217;re going. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-28-unagi-electric-scooter.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><ins>Unagi</ins></a>teamed up with Google to bring the navigation feature to its iOS and Android app. After you&#8217;ve selected your destination and put your phone away, you&#8217;ll hear direction prompts through the audio system and see directional signals on the display.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-09%2Fecce1450-1c76-11ec-a97f-d8b5fd430fd6&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=805b73035861f7418e3bef023175fa8dc04f6665" alt="Unagi Model Eleven smart scooter" data-uuid="d29c9afb-2869-33db-893f-5120d7922fef" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Unagi Scooters</div>
</figure>
<p>On the security end, there&#8217;s a motion sensor alarm to deter potential thieves, as well as GPS tracking. You&#8217;ll be able to kill a stolen scooter remotely from within the app.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Model Eleven&#8217;s most eye-catching feature is that ADAS sensor in the higher-end version. Unagi says the scooter can tell the difference between people, stop signs, stoplights, cars and other objects. It can warn you of a potential collision through both the audio system and the touchscreen display.</p>

<p>Unagi enlisted industrial designer Yves Béhar to help create the Model Eleven, which it says is the lightest, full suspension scooter on the market in part thanks to its use of long carbon fiber. The foldable scooter features Unagi&#8217;s existing dual motor system, a swappable battery system and what the company claims are puncture-proof tires you can easily change when needed.</p>
<p>The standard Model Eleven costs $2,440. For the ASAS model, you&#8217;ll need to fork over $2,860. Unagi is initially offering pre-orders through an <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/unagi-model-eleven-the-smartest-scooter-on-earth" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><ins>Indiegogo campaign</ins></a>, but with the likes of Best Buy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-buy-starts-selling-e-bikes-electric-scooters-171330423.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><ins>now selling the company&#8217;s scooters</ins></a>, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to see the Model Eleven at retailers in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When founder Somdip Dey was a computer science masters student at the University of Manchester, his parents got in a terrible car accident. He sent all of his money back to his parents in India to help with their medical bills, but then he faced a problem familiar to too many: If he wasn&#8217;t going to get paid for another week, how was he supposed to feed himself?</p>
<p>&#8220;Luckily, this happened around when the summer holiday started, so a lot of students were moving out and literally throwing away unopened food,&#8221; Dey remembered. &#8220;I realized that there&#8217;s too much waste that could be used by other people who might need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>This helped him stay fed in a time of crisis, but as an AI researcher, he started to think about how technology could help reduce food waste and get hungry people fed. As Dey finished his masters and moved on to pursue a PhD at the University of Essex, he developed a company called <a href="https://nosh.tech/">Nosh Technologies</a> alongside co-founder Suman Saha.</p>
<p>With almost 13,000 users across Android and iOS, the Nosh app helps users log their groceries&#8217; expiration dates to remind them to use what they bought before it goes bad.</p>
<p>Using AI, the app learns about user&#8217;s consumption and waste habits, producing weekly analytics that help the user reduce their waste and save money at the grocery store. The app can scan barcodes and even grocery receipts directly into the app, but users can also input data manually. Then, once the contents of a user&#8217;s pantry and fridge are loaded into the app, they can search for existing recipes online that will help them use up their stock before it goes to waste.</p>
<p>In the future, Dey wants to offer a premium subscription, which would include access to an AI that would generate new, personalized recipes based on what food you have at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our current users reported that using the app, they ended up saving almost 40 to 50 pounds every month, which they might have wasted,&#8221; Dey told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2203347" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203347" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2203347" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Somdip_Dey_2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="544" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Somdip_Dey_2.jpg 1126w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Somdip_Dey_2.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Somdip_Dey_2.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Somdip_Dey_2.jpg?resize=768,614 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Somdip_Dey_2.jpg?resize=680,544 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Somdip_Dey_2.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203347" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Somdip Dey / Nosh</p></div></p>
<p>As part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/">Startup Alley</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt, Nosh is unveiling its newest features, which fall more in line with Dey&#8217;s original inspiration for the company. These include <a href="https://noshdaily.com/">Nosh Daily</a>, a companion blog to the app, and Nosh Shop, which allows restaurants to sell at a discounted rate food that might go bad soon.</p>
<p>By charging a 10% service charge, the startup can begin earning some money &#8212; right now, it has only raised £33,000 in pre-seed money and has nine employees. From that service charge, Dey says about 3% will be donated to charities combating food waste.</p>
<p>To Good To Go, also based in Europe, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/too-good-to-go-raises-31-million-to-fight-food-waste/">raised $31.1 million</a> to achieve the same goal as Nosh Shop. But Dey says that Nosh differentiates itself by allowing restaurants to sell their food at a higher price than To Good To Go. This would motivate more restaurants to use their app (and in return, reduce food waste) since they can turn a better profit. To Good To Go sells food at one-third its original price, but Nosh Shop would allow restaurants to price their soon-to-be-spoiled meals at up to 70% off the original price.</p>
<p>While this might help restaurants, it&#8217;s up to consumers to decide if they&#8217;ll pay for that food at less of a discount. To start, Nosh Shop will roll out locally in selected places in the U.K.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter&#8217;s slate of new product announcements is not slowing down. The company today introduced a number of new initiatives aimed at better serving the conversations and community using its platform, including support for tipping with crypto, NFT authentication and plans for other experiments designed to provide more context about a conversation to those just joining in. The company also said it&#8217;s preparing to launch its own creator fund in a few weeks to provide audio creators with access to financial, technical and marketing support.</p>
<p>While Twitter was not yet ready to detail specifics, like the fund size or expected reach, in terms of creator participants, it&#8217;s a clear shot across the bow of a top competitor in social audio, Clubhouse, whose own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/clubhouse-promises-its-accelerator-participants-either-brand-deals-or-5k-per-month-during-the-program/">creator &#8220;accelerator&#8221;</a> offered to connect its participants with brand deals or $5,000 per month during their participation in its program.</p>
<p>Similarly, Twitter views its creator fund as one not aimed at rewarding creators for the content they produce &#8212; like some rival funds running across Facebook, Instagram, Snap and elsewhere &#8212; but rather at helping creators get started with audio productions on Twitter Spaces.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207551" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207551" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207551 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Spaces-Recording-and-Replay.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207551" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The goal of it really is to provide that technical and marketing expertise,&#8221; noted Twitter Product Lead for Creator Monetization, Esther Crawford. &#8220;We think of it as kind of a stopgap solution. We want to onboard these folks into other long-term monetization features. But we want to give them an initial boost,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Spaces hosts will also be able to record and replay their programs &#8212; a move likely meant to counteract the threat of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/callin-david-sacks-social-podcasting-app-launches-and-announces-a-12m-series-a-round/">competitive platforms</a> which tout recording as a key differentiator. This will launch in a &#8220;few months,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Twitter also today announced a few new products and expansions to recently launched features.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One of these is a new feature that would allow its app to better serve creators working with NFTs, or non-fungible tokens &#8212; a way to certify digital assets, stored on the blockchain. Artists are now creating NFTs of their work which are sold across NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation, SuperRare and others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207555" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207555" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207555 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Twitter-NFTs.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207555" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Twitter says it&#8217;s planning to &#8220;soon&#8221; explore support for NFT authentication. This would allow NFT creators to connect their crypto wallets to Twitter, in order to track and showcase their NFTs on the platform. This particular plan is still in the early stages as Twitter couldn&#8217;t yet articulate how this would work. The company said it was testing different ideas for making creators with authenticated collections stand out more visually somehow &#8212; perhaps with something like a profile badge or differently shaped avatar.</p>
<p>When pressed for further details on its broader NFT roadmap, Twitter declined to comment.</p>
<p>Another new feature in the crypto space is support for Bitcoin tipping. Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">first introduced its &#8220;Tip Jar&#8221; feature</a> in May as a beta product, allowing users to send and receive one-time payments via third-party services like PayPal, Venmo, Patreon, Cash App, Bandcamp and others. Now the feature will expand to global audiences on iOS with Android coming soon, and will add support for tipping with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>There will be a couple of ways Bitcoin tips can work. Users will be able to add a Bitcoin Lightning wallet or their Bitcoin address in order to start receiving Bitcoin tips. Lightning wallets are popular among users in the crypto community due to their lower transaction fees, the company said. Twitter&#8217;s implementation of this uses <a href="https://strike.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://strike.me/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1632501355086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcAeEdW3knDeLYNiCctYM9QiUfng">Strike,</a> a payments application built on the Bitcoin Lightning Network that allows people to send and receive Bitcoin free and instantly, it said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207561" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207561" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207561 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-1.01.34-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="311" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-1.01.34-PM.jpg 1248w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-1.01.34-PM.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-1.01.34-PM.jpg?resize=300,137 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-1.01.34-PM.jpg?resize=768,351 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-1.01.34-PM.jpg?resize=680,311 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-1.01.34-PM.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207561" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>In fact, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey this summer <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1403172297586925572">tweeted</a> that it was &#8220;only a matter of time&#8221; before Twitter built support for the Lightning Network, a layer atop the Bitcoin blockchain, into its platform. At the time, there was some <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/11/jack-dorsey-suggests-twitter-likely-to-integrate-lightning-network/">speculation</a> that users would first see this sort of support in a micropayments product, which has now been proven correct.</p>
<p>The Tip Jar will also add a couple other services as well, including GoFundMe and Brazilian mobile payments service PicPay.</p>
<p>Another new experiment called &#8220;Heads Up&#8221; (for the time being), is the first that will help to give users a sense of a conversation&#8217;s vibe before they wade in.</p>
<p>One of Twitter&#8217;s thorniest issues is its inability to help people feel safe sharing their thoughts and opinions on its network, which has served as a breeding ground for cancel culture, and where armies of trolls can descend on marginalized voices or others they disagree with at any time &#8212; like activists, women in tech (as was made famous with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_(harassment_campaign)">Gamergate</a> scandal) or female journalists.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207553" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207553" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207553 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heads-Up-1.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207553" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>In this area, Twitter has worked to create new features like those that enable users to limit who can reply to their tweets, which it says has contributed to a decline in abuse reports over the past four weeks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-safety-mode-harassment/">launched Safety Mode into beta</a>, which offers a sort of automated level of protection against harassment during a time of heightened abuse. It created a way for people to quietly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-tests-a-safety-feature-on-web-to-remove-followers-without-blocking-them/">remove followers</a> as an alternative blocking. And today, Twitter says it will soon launch a new feature that will allow users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/twitter-is-eyeing-new-anti-abuse-tools-to-give-users-more-control-over-mentions/">remove themselves from a conversation</a> they&#8217;re mentioned in and is experimenting with a new feature called &#8220;word filters&#8221; that would let users stop abusive tweets that don&#8217;t cross the line into being against Twitter policy.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207554" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207554" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207554 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Word-Filters.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207554" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Twitter didn&#8217;t fully explain how it will measure a conversation&#8217;s vibe in the coming &#8220;Heads Up&#8221; feature, in order to warn newcomers about the nature of the discussion. But said it was considering leveraging data from its emoji reactions (which are only now in testing) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/twitter-rolls-out-improved-reply-prompts-to-cut-down-on-harmful-tweets/">reply prompts</a>, which warn users when they&#8217;re about to post something potentially offensive.</p>
<p>The company has been launching new products at an incredibly fast clip in recent months, with additions that have included a rapidly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">improved</a> Twitter Spaces audio chat platform, the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-communities/">interest-based &#8220;Communities</a>,&#8221; creator platform <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-super-follows">Super Follows</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/twitter-is-already-working-on-integrating-newsletters-on-its-site-following-revue-acquisition/">newsletters</a> via its acquisition of Revue, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">tipping</a>, a premium subscription service called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/twitter-blue-a-3-monthly-subscription-service-could-be-coming-soon/">Twitter Blue</a>, crowdsourced fact-checking with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/twitter-starts-rolling-out-birdwatch-fact-checks-inside-tweets/">Birdwatch</a>, new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/twitter-tests-new-e-commerce-features-for-tweets/">e-commerce</a> features, new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-to-revamp-user-profiles-with-about-tab-support-for-pronouns-confirmed-status-and-more/">profiles</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/twitter-introduces-a-new-label-that-allows-the-good-bots-to-identify-themselves/">labels</a>, a reopened account <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/twitter-re-opens-its-account-verification-process-after-another-pause/">verification</a> system, conversation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/twitter-change-who-can-reply/">controls</a>, Direct Message <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/twitter-rolls-out-a-series-of-improvements-to-its-direct-message-system/">improvements</a> and more.</p>
<p>Today, it offered a few updates on a handful of these products.</p>
<p>It said it&#8217;s working on more Spaces discovery tools that would make it easier to find Spaces at the top of the timeline, and elsewhere in the app &#8212; a likely reference to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/">dedicated Spaces tab on mobile</a>. It&#8217;s also expanding access to Ticketed Spaces, improving the discovery of newsletters, launching a new creator earnings dashboard, and working on more account labels &#8212; like those brands and those that would help memorialize the accounts of the deceased &#8212; among other things.</p>

<p>Twitter noted, too, how it plans to handle moderation within its Communities feature, saying that these interest-based destinations would have their own moderators and norms specific to that community, above and beyond the <span class="il">Twitter</span> Rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our first step into decentralizing moderation, so that your Twitter is your space,&#8221; explained Twitter&#8217;s Product Lead for Conversational Safety, Christine Su, adding that Communities would open up to more people &#8220;soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>More broadly, Twitter attempted to explain its strategy, which is increasingly looking like &#8220;throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks.&#8221; In fact, it admitted &#8212; to some extent &#8212; it may be doing just that.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll keep seeing us push towards this vision through experimentation and iteration,&#8221; explained Twitter Head of Consumer Product Kayvon Beykpour. &#8220;You&#8217;ll see us share our progress publicly along the way, as we have over the last few years. And you won&#8217;t see us stay tied to the things that aren&#8217;t working. We&#8217;ve done that with Fleets and you&#8217;ll continue to see that with other explorations we test out. We believe that if we&#8217;re not winding things down every once in a while, then we&#8217;re not taking big enough bets,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s announcements were detailed this morning at a press briefing and Q&amp;A session, ahead of the publication of some of its <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/bringing-tips-to-everyone">news</a> to its corporate blog.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A host of features are being added to Google&#8217;s Android Auto experience, and the company&#8217;s Automotive OS will come to more cars including, for the first time, Honda vehicles from 2022 onwards.</p>
<p>Google introduced its Android Auto app in 2015, enabling drivers to run a tethered connection between their smartphone and their vehicle’s stereo system to play music from the device, have Maps’ turn-by-turn directions be read aloud, and take calls through the sound system. In the six years since, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-auto-google-maps-ui-right-hand-drive-cars-181544539.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">both Android Auto</a> and the infotainment systems they operate on have gotten a whole lot smarter. On Thursday, Google announced that it will be rolling out even more features and capabilities to drivers, whether they run Android Auto on their phones or directly through their cars.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While Android Auto has been designed to minimize distractions to the driver when on the road, initially connecting the phone to the infotainment or stereo system has to date been a whole thing. You’d have to make sure the Bluetooth radio was live on your phone, then cajole the vehicle into recognizing and pairing with the device, then remember the myriad various oral commands to incite Android Auto into doing what you actually wanted it to. But no longer! Drivers will soon be able to effectively automate the tethering process just by saying “Hey Google, let’s drive.” </span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>What’s more, Google has redesigned the Auto UI to enable access to a bevy of content sources including Amazon Music, Audible, iHeartRadio, JioSaavn, Pandora, Podcast Addict, SoundCloud, and YouTube Music with one-tap accessibility as well as have the system read incoming text messages aloud and allow the driver to respond by voice. Expect to see these new features arrive over the next few weeks in English-speaking markets as well as Germany, Spain, Mexico, France and Italy.</p>
<p>And for international travelers using dual-SIM phones, Android Auto will allow you to establish separate Work and Personal profiles and have their relevant contact lists and calendar appointments display, depending on when and why they’re behind the wheel.</p>
<p>For vehicles with in-car displays, Android Auto (the mirroring version, not what you’d find on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">Polestar 2</a> or the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvos-c-40-recharge-knocks-the-ass-off-its-xc-40-predecessor-and-we-love-them-for-it-163057786.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">XC40 Recharge</a>) will soon boast a few new features, such as games. Google is partnering with GameSnacks to offer drivers quick and fun diversions to play while the vehicle is parked. Finally, an end to doom-scrolling while sitting in public charging lots. Conversely, Google is making paying for gas less interactive. Just say “Hey Google, pay for gas” to have the vehicle’s infotainment system complete a contactless payment with Google Pay. You do have to select the fuel grade and, you know, actually pump the gas but, still. The feature will be available at Exxon and Mobil gas stations to start with support for Shell, Conoco, Phillips 66 and 76 stations coming soon.</p>
<p>As for the integrated Android Automotive OS (like what you’d find in select Ford, GM, and Volvo vehicles), get ready to see it in a whole bunch of new makes and models. Google announced on Thursday that its latest partner is Honda, which will begin producing vehicles with built-in AAOS come the 2022 model year, and will soon be available in both the Chevy Silverado and the Renault Mégane E-Tech.</p>

They&#8217;re designed to be carried around by the wind and could be used in numerous applications including disease and air pollution tracking, according to a paper published by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03847-y.epdf?sharing_token=H_ir9bfrqhQ2lsW0udPg7tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NHZkfDUEKmhjTX15axDSP-EqNRoRAgjNvE6EgxUSns1ObKU5SUSYUOHSWqZ9JANy9Q6W9_XUSRUaunfaoZagd0JEEDFEcyG2SX3x8NHC-DnDrqqnfXavjw1lkDTh94pHLKNh-JhwCeItdJXrbLXUTKVw1qqCBB4z7eIWvQjUOatQ%3D%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.vice.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em>Nature</em></a>. At the same time, they could be made from biodegradable materials to prevent environmental contamination.</p>
<p>The design of the flyers was inspired by spinning seeds from cottonwood and other trees. Those fall slowly by spinning like helicopters so they can be picked up by the wind and spread a long distance from the tree, increasing the range of the species.</p>
<p>The team from Northwest University ran with that idea but made it better, and smaller. &#8220;We think we&#8217;ve beaten biology&#8230; we&#8217;ve been able to build structures that fall in a more stable trajectory at slower terminal velocities than equivalent seeds,&#8221; said lead Professor John A. Rogers. &#8220;The other thing&#8230; was that we were able to make these helicopter flyer structures that are much smaller than seeds you would see in the natural world.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3me68t6Kh0I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>They&#8217;re not so small that the aerodynamics starts to break down, though. &#8220;All of the advantages of the helicopter design begin to disappear below a certain length scale, so we pushed it all the way, as far as you can go or as physics would allow,&#8221; Rogers told <em>Vice</em>. &#8220;Below that size scale, everything looks and falls like a sphere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The devices are also large enough to carry electronics, sensors and power sources. The team tested multiple versions that could carry payloads like antenna so that they could wireless communicate with a smartphone or each other. Other sensors could monitor things like air acidity, water quality and solar radiation.</p>
<p>The flyers are still concepts right now and not ready to deploy into the atmosphere, but the team plans to expand their findings with different designs. Key to that is the use of biodegradable materials so they wouldn&#8217;t persist in the environment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t think about these devices&#8230; as a permanent monitoring componentry but rather temporary ones that are addressing a particular need that’s of finite time duration,&#8221; Rogers said. “That&#8217;s the way that we&#8217;re envisioning things currently: you monitor for a month and then the devices die out, dissolve, and disappear, and maybe you have to redeploy them.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn returned to Disrupt this year to explain how the sophistication of public markets impacts the company's strategy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lot has changed for <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo.</a> The language learning company launched nearly a decade ago on the Disrupt stage with no monetization plans. Today, that scrappy app has matured into a well-known consumer brand and a business that makes a ton of money. This growth fueled the startup’s recent decision to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/31/5-lessons-from-duolingos-bellwether-edtech-ipo-of-the-year/"> go public</a>, which is rare for a consumer edtech company.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder<a href="https://twitter.com/luisvonahn?lang=en"> Luis von Ahn</a> returned to TechCrunch Disrupt this year to explain how the sophistication of public markets impacts the company&#8217;s strategy. Armed with fresh capital from the IPO and attention from the public markets, Duolingo is drawing its line on what’s next and what’s never going to be on its roadmap.</p>
<p>Part of becoming a listed company is opening yourself up to critique from the public markets, which are full of investors rooting for viable businesses that know how to make money and appreciate in value. But what happens if optimizing for money isn’t what a company wants to do?</p>
<p>Duolingo’s early days were defined by an allergy to monetization because its mission was to scale free education. When the company eventually introduced monetization through subscriptions, it didn’t paywall any learning content. Instead, its subscription product is built around enhancing the user experience — from avoiding advertisements altogether to allowing for unlimited mistakes. Today, about 95% of Duolingo’s users consume the product for free.</p>
<p>Von Ahn defended the idea that Duolingo may be tempted to begin paywalling learning features for its subscription service now that it&#8217;s in the eye of retail investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Audio startup <a href="https://syngspace.com/">Syng</a> has been building on quite a bit more hype than the average fresh hardware startup, largely because of the team behind it. Founder and CEO Chris Stringer was Jony Ive&#8217;s first hire at Apple and worked at the company for 21 years. In an interview, Stringer referred to the first time he heard stereo audio was &#8220;the most impressive product demo ever,&#8221; and that his company is looking to build on that wonder by building &#8220;triphonic&#8221; audio hardware that can transform the home-listening experience with spatial audio.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about transforming the stage from that stage/audience static experience that&#8217;s essentially just an image on the wall, to actually making the stage the square footage of your home,&#8221; Stringer tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Syng has closed a $48.75 million &#8220;combined&#8221; Series A from investors led by Palo Alto-based Eclipse Ventures, the startup tells TechCrunch. Other investors include Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger, Lionel Richie and Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia. The company has now raised $50 million to date to build out an audio hardware startup with a hefty focus on design and advanced tech.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s hardware relies on computational audio technology similar to tech that consumers have seen in products like the HomePod, which allows speakers to adjust to the spaces that they&#8217;re in. But Syng&#8217;s products are designed for spatial audio first-and-foremost. The company&#8217;s first product &#8212; the Syng Cell Alpha &#8212; is a high-end $1,799 speaker that looks like it belongs in a mid-century modern spaceship. The Apple design ethos is strong in the product which channels a bit of the Jony Ive-designed Harman Kardon SoundSticks, inside a package that Stringer says is meant to be treated more like a piece of furniture than the brutalist tower speakers that currently carve out the ultra high-end of audio.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t gotten a chance to listen to the hardware myself, so I&#8217;ll reserve any judgments there, but while $1,799 is certainly quite pricey for a single speaker, it&#8217;s also clear that most users will not be getting the most out of the tech by buying just one. The Cell Alpha speakers are meant to interact with each other, taking in feedback while creating a dynamic soundstage for users. A big selling point of this auto-adjustment is less rigid speaker placement and the ability to let your design interests dictate where speakers are placed more than a room&#8217;s natural acoustics. This is likely only true up to a certain point, obviously, but Stringer hopes that this leads to fewer audio systems fixated around a giant TV on the wall and more people really enjoying music in their homes.</p>

<p>The company currently supports up to four speakers in a single room. The Cell Alpha only comes in a single variation at the moment, but Stringer hints at future products down the road in different price points and sizes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Getting an ultra-high-end audio setup in your home has typically meant hiring a contractor and creating a weave of complex speakers, cables, receivers, amps and universal remotes that can be an awful lot for anyone to handle. Syng&#8217;s model brings a more Sonos-like approach, treating devices more like home objects than utilitarian objects to be disguised and hidden, into the mix.</p>
<p>Hardware is hard &#8212; as they say &#8212; and consumer audio can be an especially difficult place to play as a newcomer. Legacy is more important in internet-connected audio than most other realms of hardware, as people can often keep premium home audio products running for decades &#8212; or at least much longer than other tech devices. Betting on the reliability of a lifetime of firmware updates for a new startup can be a tricky bet for consumers, especially with a price tag like the Cell Alpha&#8217;s. Another challenge for the startup is that most users have scant options for playing spatial audio,  most music streaming services barely support it. As Stringer notes, this likely won&#8217;t be the case for long as major players like Apple start pushing the technology more aggressively, but hardware startups and market timing have always had a complicated relationship.</p>
<p>Other investors in the startup include Bridford Group, SIP Global Partners, Renegade Partners, Animal Capital, Schusterman Family Investments, Vince Zampella and Alex Rigopoulos. Stringer says the funding will be used for R&amp;D around the company&#8217;s future hardware and software products.</p>
