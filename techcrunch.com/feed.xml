										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Being &#8220;underbanked&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean that someone lacks access to financial services. Instead, it often means they don&#8217;t have traditional bank accounts or credit cards. But in markets like Indonesia, many still use digital wallets or e-commerce platforms, creating alternative sources of user data that can help them secure working capital and other financial tools. <a href="https://finantier.co/">Finantier</a>, a Singapore-based open finance startup, wants to streamline that data with a single API that gives financial services access to user data, with their consent. It also includes machine learning-based analytics to enable credit scoring and KYC verifications.</p>
<p>Currently in beta mode with more than 20 clients, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/finantier" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="finantier">Finantier <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is busy getting ready to officially launch. It announced today that it has been accepted into Y Combinator’s Winter 2021 startup batch. The startup also also recently raised an undisclosed amount of pre-seed funding led by East Ventures, with participation from AC Ventures, Genesia Ventures, Two Culture Capital and other investors.</p>
<p>Finantier was founded earlier this year by Diego Rojas, Keng Low and Edwin Kusuma, all of whom have experience building products for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aax-b20d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aax-b20d">fintech <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> companies, with the mission of enabling open finance in emerging markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Open finance grew out of open banking, the same framework that Plaid and Tink are built on. Meant to give people more control over their financial data instead of keeping it siloed within banks and other institutions, users can decide to grant apps or websites secure access to information from their online accounts, including bank accounts, credit cards and digital wallets. Open banking refers mainly to payment accounts, while open finance, Finantier&#8217;s specialty, covers a larger gamut of services, including business lending, mortgages and insurance underwriting.</p>
<p>While Finantier is focusing first on Singapore and Indonesia, it plans to expand into other countries and become a global fintech company like Plaid. It&#8217;s already eyeing Vietnam and the Philippines and has established partnerships in Brussels.</p>
<p>Before launching Finantier, Rojas worked on products for peer-to-peer lending platforms Lending Club and Dianrong, and served as chief technology officer for several fintech startups in Southeast Asia. He realized that many companies struggled to integrate with other platforms and fetch data from banks, or purchase data from different providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are discussing open banking, embedded finance and so on,&#8221; Rojas, Finantier’s chief executive officer, told TechCrunch. &#8220;But those are the building blocks of something bigger, which is open finance. Particularly in a region like Southeast Asia, where about 60% to 70% of adults are unbanked or underbanked, we believe in helping consumers and businesses leverage the data that they have in multiple platforms. It definitely doesn’t need to be a bank account, it could be in a digital wallet, e-commerce platform or other service providers.&#8221;</p>
<p>What this means for consumers is that even if someone doesn’t have a credit card, they can still establish creditworthiness: for example, by sharing data from completed transactions on e-commerce platforms. Gig economy workers can access more financial services and deals by giving data about their daily rides or other types of work they do through different apps.</p>
<h2>Building Southeast Asia&#8217;s financial infrastructure</h2>
<p>Other open banking startups focused on Southeast Asia include Brankas and Brick. Rojas said Finantier differentiates by specializing on open finance, and creating infrastructure for financial institutions to build more services for end users.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7h7DFWSFfk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/brankas/">Brankas wants to bring Southeast Asia&#8217;s banks and e-commerce into the digital era</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Brankas wants to bring Southeast Asia&#8217;s banks and e-commerce into the digital era&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/brankas/embed/#?secret=7h7DFWSFfk" data-secret="7h7DFWSFfk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The benefit of open finance for financial institutions is that they can create products for more consumers and find more opportunities for revenue sharing models. In Southeast Asia, this also means reaching more people who are underbanked, or otherwise lack access to financial services.</p>
<p>While taking part in Y Combinator’s accelerator program, Finantier will also be participating in the Indonesia Financial Service Authority&#8217;s regulatory sandbox. Once it completes the program, it will be able to partner with more fintech companies in Indonesia, including bigger institutions.</p>
<p>There are 139 million adults in Indonesia who are underbanked or unbanked, said East Ventures co-founder and managing partner Wilson Cuaca.</p>
<p>The investment firm, which focuses on Indonesia, conducts an annual survey called the East Ventures Digital Competitiveness Index, and found that financial exclusion was where one of the largest divides existed. There significant gaps in between the number of financial services available in heavily-populated islands like Java, where Jakarta is located, and other islands in the archipelago.</p>
<p>To promote financial inclusion and alleviate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/07/01/govt-aims-for-10-million-msmes-to-go-digital-by-year-end.html">government has set a goal</a> for 10 million micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to go digital by the end of the year. There are currently about 8 Indonesian million MSMEs that sell online, representing just 13% of MSMEs in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Providing equal access to financial services will create multiplier effects to the Indonesian economy,&#8221; Cuaca told TechCrunch about East Ventures&#8217; decision to back Finantier. &#8220;Currently, hundreds of companies work with their own unique solutions to bring financial services to more people. We believe Finantier will help them offer more products and services to this underserved section of the population.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/iac" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="iac">IAC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced today that it plans to turn <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/vimeo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="vimeo">Vimeo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> into an independent, publicly traded company.</p>
<p>Last month, IAC CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/vimeo-funding-spin-off/">Joey Levin wrote a letter to shareholders</a> in which he said the holding company had &#8220;begun contemplating spinning Vimeo off to our shareholders.&#8221; It sounds like the company has moved beyond the contemplation phase, with plans that will be submitted for stockholder approval in the first quarter of 2021, and the actual spin off happening in Q2.</p>
<p>&#8220;The combination of Vimeo’s remarkable growth, solid leadership position and enormous market opportunity have made clear its future,” Levin said in a statement today. “It’s time for Vimeo to spread its wings and become a great independent public company.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Vimeo once competed with YouTube as a consumer video destination, its strategy has shifted in recent years to providing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/vimeo-record/">video tools for businesses</a>. In November, the company said it had 1.5 million paying subscribers and 3,500 enterprise clients — and that its most recent quarter was with positive EBITDA, plus year-over-year revenue growth of 44%.</p>
<p>The announcement notes that this is the eleventh company that IAC has spun off, a process in which it distributes its ownership stake to IAC shareholders. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/match-group-iac-separaton/">Match Group completed its separation</a> from IAC over the summer.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we have a rare opportunity to help every team and organization in the world integrate video throughout their operations, across all the ways they communicate and collaborate,&#8221; said Vimeo CEO Anjali Sud in a statement. &#8220;Our all-in-one solution radically lowers the barriers of time, cost and complexity that previously made professional-quality video unattainable. We’re ready for this next chapter and focused on making video far easier and more effective than ever before.”</p>

<p>With companies looking to reopen operations and have their employees return to work safely, management toolkits that track employee health are piling into the market offering all sorts of strategies to maintain a safe work environment.</p>
<p>These include offerings from companies like <a href="https://joinworksafe.com/?utm_keyword=%2Bcovid%20%2Bbusiness%20%2Bcheck&amp;matchtype=b&amp;adgroup=108804102901&amp;network=g&amp;placement=&amp;devicemodel=&amp;phylocation=9010929&amp;feeditemid=&amp;creative=475012381575&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=WS_-_Work_-_Symptoms_App_-_Broad_-_Desktop_-_Call_Extension&amp;utm_term=%2Bcovid%20%2Bbusiness%20%2Bcheck&amp;hsa_acc=5201870928&amp;hsa_cam=11451716307&amp;hsa_grp=108804102901&amp;hsa_ad=475012381575&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-990408313657&amp;hsa_kw=%2Bcovid%20%2Bbusiness%20%2Bcheck&amp;hsa_mt=b&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAz4b_BRBbEiwA5XlVVg9F_N5yXaaZ5p4K3dI_k8MNwgOaJBosG0ENf0Fz82mYQ3Qb8JzJQRoCGgAQAvD_BwE">WorkSafe</a>; or the <a href="https://www.weprotectwell.com/">ProtectWell</a> tool from Microsoft and UnitedHealth; or <a href="https://explore.getnspace.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=health_check&amp;utm_term=%2Boffice%20%2Bhealth%20%2Bcheck&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAz4b_BRBbEiwA5XlVVp1L5Wa5vrVWpgJ-zLlRTcME4puCXv2bwxED__tlPiDY0Kd4p6gwlRoC0hoQAvD_BwE">NSpace</a>, which has similar features and a scheduling tool for booking office space safely.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For its part, ReturnSafe is boasting six figure monthly recurring revenue and is working with 50 organizations since its launch six months ago.</p>
<p>The pitch to investors and customers is that the need to manage employees and ensure that workspaces are free from health risks is only going to grow in a post-COVID-19 world.</p>
<p>Of course, the best way for employers to ensure the safety and security of their employees is to provide adequate leave and time off if employees are sick and to ensure that everyone has access to adequate testing at regular intervals should they not be able to work remotely.</p>
<p>Like other companies in the market, ReturnSafe offers a symptoms screener, a testing dashboard, a case management dashboard and a new vaccine management service. In addition to those software tools, ReturnSafe pitches a set of wearable devices with built-in social distancing alarms to ensure that employees maintain safe distances. <b><i></i></b></p>

		Samuel is a product leader and two-time founder, currently serving as VP of Product at Fivestars. He previously founded Divvyshot (acquired by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and co-founded Freshplum (acquired by TellApart).	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Leading up to Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram, I was the product manager in charge of Facebook Photos. Mark Zuckerberg had bought my previous company, Divvyshot, one of the first iOS photo-sharing apps. I worked closely with Mark, and so conversations about the future of social sharing and emerging mobile apps were common. Instagram was a competitor that came up more than once.</p>
<p>Now that attorneys general in 48 states and the Federal Trade Commission are suing Facebook for their acquisition of Instagram, you might imagine I have a strong opinion about it. I do, both as the former Facebook Photos PM and as a former Facebook acquisition. In some ways, I was the appetizer for the eventual entrée. As an American consumer, I know success for the FTC would unequivocally be a disaster for innovation.</p>
<p>A key question in this antitrust case is whether Facebook bought Instagram to eliminate a competitive threat. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21345723/facebook-instagram-documents-emails-mark-zuckerberg-kevin-systrom-hearing">Documents have already leaked</a> suggesting Mark perceived Instagram as a threat. That same sentiment felt clear to me in our conversations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I wasn’t at Facebook for long. In my mid-twenties and with a rush of confidence, I decided to leave to start another company. In hindsight, I left abruptly and without much notice. I departed soon after kicking off an initiative to revamp our mobile Photos products, leaving the team in a lurch (the mobile rehaul never launched). Months later, Mark started to court Instagram. The deal was formalized exactly one year after my sudden departure.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			We have to be sophisticated about what we call a monopoly and how we constrain (or punish) our country’s most successful businesses.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Despite those events suggesting anti-competitive intent, I’m simply not convinced that the recent antitrust suit will benefit the competitive startup ecosystem or even consumers as a whole.</p>
<p>A cliché phrase in the startup space is “thinking from first principles,” but in this case, it’s helpful. The primary reason the United States government wants to regulate monopolies is to “<a href="https://www.uschamber.com/antitrust-laws">protect competition and benefit consumers</a>.” In the <a href="https://www.wraltechwire.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-suit-the-penalties-states-want-and-under-what-laws/">recent antitrust suit against Facebook</a>, they are ostensibly protecting Facebook’s competitors in the startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>There are two key pieces of legislation that Facebook has been accused of violating. First, the Sherman Act, which makes it unlawful to maintain or acquire a monopoly, and then the Clayton Act, which goes a step further in prohibiting anti-competitive, monopolistic mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>The sine qua non of an antitrust accusation — violating <a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/competition-and-monopoly-single-firm-conduct-under-section-2-sherman-act-chapter-2">Section 2 of the Sherman Act</a>, which Facebook is accused of — is being able to prove that a company has used their monopoly to &#8220;harm society by making output lower, prices higher, and innovation less than would be the case in a competitive market.&#8221; The Department of Justice also establishes that <a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/competition-and-monopoly-single-firm-conduct-under-section-2-sherman-act-chapter-2">a major factor in qualifying a monopoly</a> is if a company has had “a market share in excess of two-thirds for a significant period.”</p>
<p>Before looking at Facebook, let’s look at an example of successful antitrust action. Critics of Facebook often bring up United States v. Microsoft Corp<em>. </em>as precedent. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/04/business/us-vs-microsoft-overview-us-judge-says-microsoft-violated-antitrust-laws-with.html">this case</a>, Microsoft was accused of a monopoly stemming from its bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows. To be clear, I agree with this antitrust action because Microsoft <em>had a monopoly.</em> If you examine Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/windows-95-remains-most-popular-operating-system/">market share for operating systems in 1998</a>, they owned 86% of the market when the case was filed<strong>. </strong>It is easy to see how they used unreasonable bundling to artificially grow market share for Internet Explorer, clearly making “output lower” and “innovation less” (does anyone look back fondly at Internet Explorer?) for society.</p>
<p>It’s much harder to see where exactly Facebook has a monopoly. For instance, the FTC is suing Facebook <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general">to divest Instagram</a>. Instagram’s revenue is primarily generated from advertisers on the platform. The FTC’s accusation of monopoly — with their fingers pointed at Instagram — would imply that Facebook has built a dominant share of the digital advertising market. However, market research company EMarketer found that Facebook had <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikevorhaus/2020/07/06/the-new-advertising-zeitgeistgoogles-us-ad-revenue-to-decline/?sh=5da2ab03236e">23% of this market</a> in 2020, a far cry from two-thirds control. Calling Facebook a monopoly is far from a cut-and-dry case.</p>
<p>Now let’s ask the question: Who actually benefits from this antitrust action?</p>
<p>Not the founder of the next Facebook-killer. With the FTC pressing the heel of their boot down on acquisitions, it becomes less rewarding — and riskier — to found a startup.</p>
<p>In Silicon Valley, every new founder is an aspiring disruptor. But they and their investors understand the value of the cliché, “if you can’t beat them, join them.” I understood that reality when I sold Divvyshot to Facebook in 2010, shortly after my bank account hit $0.</p>
<p>Without the prospect of rich acquisitions by major companies, fewer founders would risk their livelihood and venture capital dollars would shrink. Large technology companies would be incentivized to simply copy newcomer products, rather than acquire their teams. Don’t forget: Being acquired is a <em>success </em>for most startups and entrepreneurs (who often lack other appealing outcomes).</p>
<p>Not the consumer. For the consumer to benefit, one has to believe that either (a) Instagram would have been more successful without Facebook, or (b) Facebook’s behavior discourages other competitive startups.</p>
<p>The former has been well-debated and is a somewhat subjective question. For the latter, with a shrinking pool of dollars and founders comes a shrinking pool of competition in any category. It’s that competition that fuels a busy home screen with a dozen app icons for every use case. Instagram’s $1 billion exit encouraged copycats, competitors and innovators like Vine, Flipagram, VSCO, and, eventually, TikTok.</p>
<p>As Mark Zuckerberg said about their acquisitions, “One way of looking at this is that what we’re really buying is time.” It’s hard to stay on the top in tech. If dot-com history is any indication, today’s leaders will be tomorrow’s Yahoo. It’s that natural pressure of age, not the threat of antitrust, that encourages companies like Facebook to make innovative product bets in new categories like VR to avoid irrelevance.</p>
<p>It’s time for a new plan. To be clear, we must foster competition within our technology space here in the United States. We should explore entirely new versions of antitrust legislation that focus on affirmative outcomes rather than punitive assessments.</p>
<p>The U.S. government might consider accommodating acquisitions by these companies through ecosystem development. Rather than shutting down acquisitions, consider a requirement that the acquirer invests some percentage of any significant acquisition amount into blind minority positions at other emerging startups.</p>
<p>It’s a dramatic thought, but new dynamics might emerge with innovation as the clear winner. For instance, these technology giants may fund startups that undermine their entrenched competitors. One example: Facebook might use this venture arm to fund ideas outside their scope in the Future of Work, creating insurgent competition for Microsoft.</p>
<p>The outflow of capital from incumbents to startups would foster competition while still enabling incumbents to scale. Remember, it’s these scale effects that allow us to enjoy our low consumer prices, high quality of life and R&amp;D-fueled innovation that no economy wants to lose.</p>
<p>There’s a more important monopoly at stake. Silicon Valley is the most competitive and innovative sector in the world. Regions and governments across the globe aspired to copy our “secret sauce,” but often have been hampered by regulation, corruption or anti-capitalistic legislation. Are we sure it’s time for us to start copying them?</p>
<p>Up until recently, that question was just hypothetical. Silicon Valley’s title as the leader in innovation was never under threat. We had the protective moats of geographic density, well-functioning capital markets, light-touch regulation and permissive immigration policy (50% of Silicon Valley startups are founded by immigrants, after all). Are we sure we don’t want to double-down on that winning formula?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China has liberalized its economy. Shenzhen, China’s hub for technology innovation, has had its gross domestic output (GDP) <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-09/24/c_139394442.htm#:~:text=China's%20Shenzhen%20sees%2020.7%20pct%20annual%20GDP%20growth%20over%204%20decades%3A%20mayor,-Source%3A%20Xinhua%7C%202020&amp;text=The%20city%20is%20undergoing%20high,about%20396.9%20billion%20U.S.%20dollars).">grow by an annual average of 20.7% over the last 40 years</a>, even recently <a href="https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/china/article/3100043/shenzhen-special-economic-zone/">surpassing Hong Kong</a>. I find the recent dethroning of Facebook by TikTok as <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90584368/tiktok-beats-out-facebook-to-become-the-top-app-worldwide-by-downloads-in-2020">the most downloaded application worldwide in 2020</a> a foreboding sign.</p>
<p>While nobody would choose to give personal data to foreign companies ruled by autocratic regimes, most users aren’t weighing those consequences as they scroll through the next social experience. After all, who among us isn’t tempted to make that trade-off for an engaging TikTok video in the middle of a quarantine?</p>
<p>We have to be sophisticated about what we call a monopoly and how we constrain (or punish) our country’s most successful businesses. We may pick a battle with Facebook and win, but lose the larger war. Losing that war may mean pushing the next Instagram out of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>And that may mean, somewhat ironically, that the only technology monopoly the United States government is dismantling with this flavor of antitrust legislation is its own.</p>

<p>These blank-check corporations, as they&#8217;re also known, have become a popular way to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/">raise money from the public markets</a>. The filing says that Group Nine is creating a SPAC &#8220;for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company goes on to claim that it doesn&#8217;t have any specific acquisition targets in mind, and that there have not been &#8220;any substantive discussions.&#8221; But it says it&#8217;s interested in digital media companies, as well as those in &#8220;adjacent industries&#8221; such as social media, e-commerce, events, digital publishing and marketing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea of consolidating digital media properties has been a recurring theme from executives over the past few years. BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti, for example, has said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/business/media/buzzfeed-jonah-peretti-mergers.html">a consolidated digital media entity</a> could have more clout in negotiations with Facebook and Google, and he recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/buzzfeed-acquires-huffpost/">struck a deal to acquire HuffPost</a> from Verizon Media (which also owns TechCrunch).</p>
<p>Group Nine is itself a roll-up of previously independent digital media companies, led by CEO Ben Lerer (pictured above) and growing last year with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/group-nine-acquires-popsugar/">the acquisition of PopSugar</a>. The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/group-nine-media-explores-blank-check-company-for-digital-media-acquisitions-11607995318?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmediatrends&amp;stream=top">reported recently</a> that the company was exploring a SPAC.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe the digital media sector is primed for consolidation, as digital media companies need a scaled platform with efficient portfolio infrastructure to compete in the ecosystem and return value to shareholders in the long-term,&#8221; Group Nine says in the filing.</p>

So, when I got back into our WordPress install, the group of companies that had each recently reached nine-figure revenues <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/the-100m-arr-club/">was top of mind</a>.</p>
<p>But looking at $100 million ARR companies proved less useful than we might have hoped. Mostly what we managed was to collect a bucket of companies that were about to go public.</p>
<p>That was always a risk. As we wrote at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps the startup market would do well to celebrate the $50 million ARR mark even more loudly. At $50 million ARR, a startup is scaling to IPO size. That’s the goal, after all.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is our aim for 2021.</p>
<p>If your startup is approaching the $50 million ARR mark, or the $50 million annual run rate threshold, <a href="mailto:alex.wilhelm@techcrunch.com">I want to hear from you</a>. Drop a line if your startup has an annualized run rate between $35 million and $60 million, is privately held, and you are willing to chat about how quickly it is growing. (The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/">first raised this idea in November</a>.)</p>

<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But that&#8217;s next year. Today, let&#8217;s chat about <a href="https://www.nexthink.com/">Nexthink</a>, what the hell &#8220;digital employee experience&#8221; is and what&#8217;s good with cyber insurance and why it&#8217;s helping <a href="https://www.coalitioninc.com/">Coalition</a> grow rapidly.</p>
<h2>Nexthink gets IPO ready</h2>
<p>Nexthink is a venture-backed software company with headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland and Boston<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. According to </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, Nexthink raised external capital in modest amounts from 2006 until 2014, when the startup picked up a $14.5 million Series D. That round was its first worth more than $10 million.</span></p>
<p>From there, Nexthink was a venture capital success story, presumably scaling quickly as it raised two larger rounds in 2016 and 2018 worth an estimated $40 million and $85 million, respectively. Nexthink was valued at a little over $558 million (post-money) following its 2018 round.</p>
<p>How did it attract so much external funding? By building digital experience monitoring software. Which, after doing a bit of research this morning, appears to be software aimed at tracking what corporate end users are doing with devices and how well software running on those devices perform.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve already written several stories about <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20433206/omni_text-1.pdf">the new pandemic stimulus package</a> that Congress approved yesterday, including funding to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/covid-19-relief-bill-includes-1-9b-to-rip-and-replace-huawei-and-zte-equipment/">increase broadband access</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/new-stimulus-bill-includes-35-2-billion-for-new-energy-initiatives/">for new energy initiatives</a>.</p>
<p>There are, however, other provisions that could also have serious implications for the technology and media worlds. For one thing, the bill includes a proposal from Senator Thom Tillis (a Republican from North Carolina) that would make illegal streaming a felony, with penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment.</p>
<p>When Tillis released a draft of his proposal earlier this month, the open internet/intellectual property nonprofit Public Knowledge released <a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/press-release/public-knowledge-responds-to-senator-tillis-felony-streaming-copyright-proposal/">a statement</a> arguing that there&#8217;s no need &#8220;for further criminal penalties for copyright infringement,&#8221; but also saying that the bill is &#8220;narrowly tailored and avoids criminalizing users&#8221; and &#8220;does not criminalize streamers who may include unlicensed works as part of their streams&#8221; — instead, it focuses on those who pirate for commercial gain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The bill also includes the CASE Act, which creates a new Copyright Claims Board within the U.S. Copyright Office. This system has been compared to small claims court, with the ability to adjudicate copyright claims and order payments of up to $30,000.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20927545/copyright-bill-house-congress-hakeem-jeffries-case-act-dmca">the House of Representatives was debating the CASE Act last year</a>, proponents defended it as giving independent artists an easier way to pursue copyright infringement claims, while groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation said it could have a negative impact on individual internet users. Techdirt&#8217;s Mike Masnick <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201221/09573745928/congress-once-again-sells-out-to-hollywood-sneaks-case-act-felony-streaming-bill-into-government-funding-omnibus.shtml">argued yesterday</a> that it will &#8220;supercharge copyright trolling exactly at a time when we need to fix the law to have <em>less</em> trolling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the House and Senate have approved the bill, it&#8217;s going to President Donald Trump for his signature. Since the full text was only released yesterday, we can probably expect plenty more debate over its implications in the weeks and months to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The New York Times is bringing its signature crosswords game into augmented reality. The media company announced this morning it&#8217;s launching a new AR-enabled game, &#8220;Shattered Crosswords,&#8221; on Instagram, where players will be able to solve clues by finding spinning broken crossword pieces in AR. When the right vantage point is achieved, players will find the words hidden among the shards above the puzzle.</p>
<p>The concept is similar to those found in other 3D puzzlers, like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/polysphere-art-of-puzzle/id1440756080">Polysphere</a>, for example, where you swipe to rotate broken pieces to see a complete picture. But in this case, The NYT has made the whole gaming experience appear in augmented reality, as well.</p>
<p>The new game was built using technology from Facebook&#8217;s Spark AR platform, the company says, and it&#8217;s the first time The NYT has created an AR gaming experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, it&#8217;s not the first time The NYT has worked with AR technology.</p>
<p>This fall, The New York Times announced a multi-year collaboration with Facebook <a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/new-york-times-ar-instagram/">focused</a> on publishing a series of AR-driven reporting on Instagram. The reports would use AR technology to tell stories in a more visual and interactive way. To support its new efforts, The NYT also launched its own AR Lab with a staff of over a dozen employees who would work alongside a dedicated newsroom team to develop the AR journalism content.</p>
<p>To date, the Lab has helped produce visual stories tied to the centennial of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/17/us/suffrage-movement-photos-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/17/us/suffrage-movement-photos-history.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608733935800000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHriROPXwreUcHie67c2UGa2jUgWg">women’s suffrage</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/30/science/wear-mask-covid-particles-ul.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/30/science/wear-mask-covid-particles-ul.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608733935800000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGaOmbQb2AQih18whxdN2TfnIplww">the science behind the effectiveness of face masks</a> and coverage of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/california-wildfires" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/california-wildfires&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608733935800000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGK5mHFPUXrp_LPnasYIJYsr9Ut2w">California wildfires.</a></p>
<p>The NYT had begun to experiment with AR in previous years, too, though not in partnership with Facebook. In 2018, for example, it announced it would begin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/01/sports/olympics/nyt-ar-augmented-reality-guide.html">using augmented reality to tell stories</a> within its own native app for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Before today, The NYT did feature &#8220;live solves&#8221; of its Crossword on social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, as a way to engage players on social media. But these were not standalone games or built with AR &#8212; they were <a href="https://twitter.com/NYTimesWordplay/status/1245758478544601088">viewing experiences</a>.</p>
<p>That said, the new game itself may have limited appeal, beyond being an interesting demo of AR from The NYT. The puzzle is too small and simple to appeal to any serious crossword fans, and the process of finding clues in the shards requires gestures and movement, which can get frustrating after some time. It doesn&#8217;t move as smoothly as something like Polysphere, either, we found.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear who would return to this sort of puzzle on a regular basis, compared with traditional mobile games or even the standard crossword puzzle.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Shattered Crosswords&#8221; game is available on the @NYTimes Instagram profile page under the &#8220;Effects&#8221; tab, alongside the company&#8217;s other AR reports. It works on both iOS and Android platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.stepzen.com/">StepZen</a>, a new startup from the crew who gave you <a href="https://cloud.google.com/apigee/api-management">Apigee</a> (which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/08/google-will-acquire-apigee-for-625-million/">sold to Google</a> in 2016 for $625 million) had a different vision for their latest company. They are building a single API that pulls data from disparate sources to help developers deliver more complex customer experiences online.</p>
<p>Today, the startup emerged from stealth and announced an $8 million seed investment from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/neotribe-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="neotribe-ventures">Neotribe Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wing-venture-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wing-venture-capital">Wing Venture Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>With years of experience working with APIs, the founders wanted to take that a step further, says CEO and co-founder Anant Jhingran. &#8220;StepZen is a product that lets front end developers easily create and consume one API for all the data they need from the back end,&#8221; he explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is all in the service of providing a smoother, more consistent customer experience. That means whether you are on an e-commerce site accessing your order history or a banking app grabbing your current balance, these scenarios require pulling data from various back-end data resources. Connecting to those resources is a time-consuming task, and StepZen wants to simplify that for developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Developers spend an enormous amount of time deploying and managing code that accesses the back end, and what StepZen wants to do is to give them that time back,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xoC2WaPJzg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/jitsu-nabs-2m-seed-to-build-open-source-data-integration-platform/">Jitsu nabs $2M seed to build open-source data integration platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jitsu nabs $2M seed to build open-source data integration platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/jitsu-nabs-2m-seed-to-build-open-source-data-integration-platform/embed/#?secret=xoC2WaPJzg" data-secret="xoC2WaPJzg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Instead of manually writing code to pull this data, StepZen enables developers to simply provide configuration information and credentials to connect to these back-end data sources, and then it builds a single API that handles all of the heavy lifting of pulling that data and presenting it when needed.</p>
<p>Jhingran uses the example of presenting a list of open orders for a customer. It sounds simple enough, but once you consider that the data could live in several places, including the CRM system, the order system or with your courier, that means accessing at least three separate and highly disparate systems. StepZen will help pull this all together via its API and present it smoothly to the user.</p>
<p>Today the company has 11 employees, including the three founders, with plans to add another eight or so in 2021. As they do that, CBO and co-founder Helen Whelan says they are working to build a diverse and inclusive company. While the founding team is itself diverse, they want to hire employees with diverse backgrounds and ways of thinking to build the most complete product and company.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first 10 or so employees, we tapped into the networks of the people who we&#8217;ve worked with, people who you know can do a great job. Then I think it&#8217;s about deliberately expanding from there and deliberately taking the time that you need to explore and expand your pipeline of candidates,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company is just nine months old and has been spending most of this year building the solution and working with pre-alpha users. Today the product is in alpha, with plans to release it as a software service early next year.</p>
<p>As the company emerges from stealth, it&#8217;s looking to continue building the product and looking for ways to remove as much complexity as possible. &#8220;We know how to do the hard things on the back end. We&#8217;ve got the database technologies and the API technologies down, and it&#8217;s now about finding how to make all of that simple on the outside and easy for developers to use, &#8221; Whelan said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2016, when the world felt like an entirely different place, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/13/speakable-lets-you-take-action-on-news-articles-that-move-you/">Jordan Hewson launched a platform called Speakable</a>. It was meant to let news readers take action on a cause or issue in the very moment they cared most: while reading a news article about it. The company partnered with publishers and NGOs to deliver an action button, right on the publisher&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>Skip forward to today, and people have become far more proactive about the causes they care about. That&#8217;s why Hewson is launching a new product called <a href="https://actionable.org/">actionable</a>, a library of actions mapped across dozens of causes, giving the user a clear view into how they can do something about the things they care about most.</p>
<p>Though donations are an option across the platform, there are other methods by which users can take action, including volunteering, contacting your representatives and signing petitions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We were founded before the 2016 election,&#8221; said Hewson. &#8220;And Speakable was based on the hypothesis that if we didn&#8217;t make action easy, people wouldn&#8217;t do it. But so much has changed, politically and socially, that people are really breaking down the doors to find out ways that they can help in this moment that we&#8217;re in. So we really wanted to be able to provide our users with a platform where they can proactively seek out things that they want to do and deepen their community experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Issues on the platform include Education, Equal Rights, Environment, Health, Migration, Politics, Poverty, Racial Justice and more. When a user clicks on an issue, actionable breaks the results down into the type of action the user might take, from donating to volunteering to signing petitions. The platform also drills down into the specific mission of the organization to give users a clear look at how they&#8217;re spending their resources.</p>
<p>When Speakable launched, it offered its services for free in the hopes of scaling up rapidly. Today, the platform charges a 3% service fee for donations made through the platform, but Hewson doesn&#8217;t see that as the company&#8217;s primary revenue generator.</p>
<p>Rather, Speakable is partnering with brands to sponsor action buttons for their own purpose-based initiatives. Hewson explains that might take the form of a matching campaign or sponsoring the ability for you to reach out to your legislator on a certain issue, giving the publishers another way to generate revenue, as well as Speakable, while scaling campaigns and initiatives on behalf of the brand partners.</p>
<p>The company is currently partnered with about 90 publishers and, via an API, aims to list all the nonprofits that exist in the States.</p>
<p>Interestingly, actionable doesn&#8217;t necessarily rank or curate the NGOs on its platform in an effort to maintain neutrality among nonprofits, according to Hewson.</p>
<p>Speakable has raised $2.5 million since inception. It has also powered 10 million actions, with the majority of those actions coming in 2020, with 5.2 million actions taken this year. Just this past week, in fact, Speakable facilitated more than $1.3 million in donations in a single day to Feeding America in partnership with the TODAY show.</p>
<p>The team is about 15 people. Sixty percent identify as women at the female-founded company, with 20% identifying as BIPOC and 10% identifying as LGBTQI+.</p>

<p>Given the COVID-19 pandemic, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that VergeSense would be seeing quite a bit of demand for its service and sensors. While the company was seeing strong growth since its launch in 2017, the pandemic is accelerating the move to smarter office spaces. As VergeSense CEO and co-founder Dan Ryan told me, over the course of the last few months, the company added new features to help businesses manage social distancing, for example, and to better understand where in a given office they should intensify their cleaning protocols.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>It&#8217;s also becoming increasingly clear that even after we get the pandemic under control, office spaces &#8212; and office work &#8212; will look radically different. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a sort of a hybrid model of working, which, pre-pandemic, was already something that was happening &#8212; companies were experimenting with this &#8212; but now it&#8217;s been turbocharged,&#8221; Ryan said. &#8220;We never anticipated any of this, but I think it&#8217;s a great example of the possibilities that you can help support when you have this intelligent infrastructure all around you that allows you to almost program the physical world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another new feature the company launched this year allows its tools to register when a seat is likely occupied, even though nobody is in it right now, by looking for backpacks and other signs that would signal that a desk is in use.</p>
<p>VergeSense currently has customers in 29 countries. These include the likes of Shell, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/quicken-loans" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="quicken-loans">Quicken Loans, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Roche, Cisco and Telus. In total, the company&#8217;s tools watch more than 40 million square feet of space now.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2090015" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Analytics-Platform-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090015" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2090015" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Analytics-Platform-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="577" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Analytics-Platform-1.png 1918w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Analytics-Platform-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Analytics-Platform-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Analytics-Platform-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Analytics-Platform-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Analytics-Platform-1.png?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Analytics-Platform-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2090015" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> VergeSense</p></div></p>
<p>As Ryan told me, the company saw quite a bit of inbound interest from investors this year and the team wanted to capitalize on the current trends. &#8220;As we look forward to &#8217;21, especially now that this transition to an agile hybrid seating model is going to be turbocharged, we were preparing for and planning for additional growth there as well. So this was sort of opportunistic opportunity to team up with Tola to help go to the next level,&#8221; Ryan explained.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to continue to work on its core computer vision capabilities and hardware, but as Ryan noted, one of the focus areas for VergeSense in 2021 will also include new partnerships and integrations with tools for booking desks and rooms, as well as building automation systems. To do so, it plans to double its headcount and hire across all departments.</p>
<p>VergeSense is obviously not the only company playing in this space. Swiss startup <a href="https://locatee.com/en/">Locatee</a>, for example, raised a Series A round for its service earlier this year, though it uses network data to measure occupancy and not the kind of dedicated sensors that VergeSense is developing. Other players include the likes of <a href="https://www.density.io/">Density</a>, <a href="https://basking.io/">Basking</a> and <a href="https://www.steerpath.com/occupancy-analytics">SteerPath</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japanese startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/astroscale" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="astroscale">Astroscale <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has shipped its ELSA-d spacecraft to the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazahkstan, where it will be integrated with a Soyuz rocket for a launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/astroscale-sets-march-2021-for-first-commercial-orbital-debris-removal-demonstration/">scheduled for March of next year</a>. This is a crucial mission for Astroscale, since it&#8217;ll be the first in-space demonstration of the company&#8217;s technology for de-orbiting space debris, a cornerstone of its proposed space sustainability service business.</p>
<p>The ELSA-d mission by Astroscale is a small satellite mission that will demonstrate two key technologies that enable the company&#8217;s vision for orbital debris removal. First will be a targeting component, demonstrating an ability to locate and dock with a piece of space debris, using positioning sensors including GPS and laser locating technologies. That will be used by a so-called &#8220;servicer&#8221; satellite to find and attach to a &#8220;target&#8221; satellite launched at the same time, which will stand in for a potential piece of debris.</p>
<p>Astroscale intends to dock and release with the &#8220;target&#8221; using its &#8220;servicer&#8221; multiple times over the course of the mission, showing that it can identify and capture uncontrolled objects in space, and that it can maneuver them for controlled de-orbit. This will basically prove out the feasibility of the technology underlying its business model, and set it up for future commercial operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In October, Astroscale announced that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/astroscale-raises-51-million-in-series-e-funding-to-fuel-its-orbital-sustainability-ambitions/">had raised $51 million</a>, making its total raised to date $191 million. The company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/astroscale-expands-into-geostationary-satellite-life-extension-with-new-acquisition/">acquired the staff and IP of a company called Effective Space Solutions in June</a>, which it will use to build out the geostationary servicing arm of its business, in addition to the LEO operations that ELSA-d will demonstrate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.liberis.com/">Liberis</a>, the U.K.-based fintech that provides finance for small businesses as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/liberis/">an alternative to a traditional bank loan or extended overdraft</a>, has replenished its own coffers with £70 million in funding. The round is a mixture of debt and venture debt, although the company is declining to disclose the percentage split, so we can likely chalk this up as mostly debt to fund the loans Liberis issues.</p>
<p>Providing the financing are previous backers British Business Investments, Paragon Bank and BCI Europe, along with new partner <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/silicon-valley-bank" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="silicon-valley-bank">Silicon Valley Bank <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (SVB). It brings the total funding raised by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/liberis" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="liberis">Liberis <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to £200 million, including more than £50 million in equity funding. “The new funds will be used to fuel company growth, launch new products and markets, and provide additional customer financing solutions,” says the fintech.</p>
<p>To date, 2007-founded Liberis has provided over £500 million in financing to 16,000 SMEs across Europe, the U.S. and the U.K. (the product is available in five new countries: U.S., Finland, Sweden, Czech Republic and Slovakia). However, lending has really picked up lately, with £250 million lent in the past two years alone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Liberis provides SMEs with funding from £1,000 to £300,000 based on projected credit and debit card sales. However, the clever part is that the loan is paid back via a pre-agreed percentage of the business’ digital transactions. In other words, bar any minimum monthly payment agreed, the repayment schedule is directly tied to the size and pace of a business’ card transactions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2YytgNNFrn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/liberis/">Liberis raises £57.5M to offer finance for small businesses paid back via customer card transactions</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Liberis raises £57.5M to offer finance for small businesses paid back via customer card transactions&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/liberis/embed/#?secret=2YytgNNFrn" data-secret="2YytgNNFrn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Noteworthy, the go-to-market strategy has shifted toward B2B2B &#8212; or “embedded finance” &#8212; with Liberis now predominantly partnering with marketplaces, software providers and acquirers, such as Worldpay from FIS and Global Payments. These partners integrate with Liberis to offer personalised pre-approved revenue-based financing to their end customers.</p>
<p>“Liberis’ core business is to enable partners to offer embedded business finance to their customers,” Rob Straathof, CEO of Liberis, tells TechCrunch. “Back in 2015, we launched one of the world’s first embedded business finance partnerships with Worldpay from FIS, and have significantly expanded our partnerships across the globe over the past years, including Global Payments, Opayo (Sagepay), EPOS Now and Worldpay U.S.”</p>
<p>Straathof says that by integrating Liberis’ business finance platform into a partner’s existing ecosystem and customer experience, the fintech is able to provide “instant value” for its partners and the SMEs they support.</p>
<p>“Through our single API integration, we receive privileged data from our partners which enables Liberis to offer hyper-personalised and pre-approved finance to SMEs,” he explains. “By making finance more personalised, intuitive and accessible for SMEs, we in turn empower our partners to unlock greater customer value by improving engagement, satisfaction and loyalty which lowers churn. Ultimately, everyone wins”.</p>
<p>Comments Folake Shasanya, SVB’s head of EMEA warehouse financing: “We are pleased to become a new funding partner to Liberis and have been impressed with their ability to embed financing solutions across technology platforms, payments providers and more. At SVB, supporting innovation is in our DNA and we are delighted to provide this global growth opportunity to Liberis through our warehouse and venture debt products”.</p>
<p><em>Article updated to clarify the round is a mixture of debt and venture debt, without any pure equity funding.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Macau, the former Portuguese colony that is now the world&#8217;s biggest gambling center, is planning to host a tech fair next year to match the famed <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The brains behind the &#8220;Beyond&#8221; conference are Lu Gang, founder of Chinese tech news media company TechNode, which was TechCrunch&#8217;s former China partner, and Jason Ho, a Macanese venture investor and a member of the CPPCC Beijing, China&#8217;s top political advisory body, who also enjoys deep connections in the Macau government.</p>
<p>The event, which is partially funded by the Macau government, signals the region&#8217;s long game to diversify its casino-focused economy for its population of 600,000. The fair has also won &#8220;support&#8221; from the Guangdong provincial government, which is pitching its own &#8220;Greater Bay Area&#8221; comprising Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Macau and other cities in the region, to rival the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Macau has very good infrastructure. With the entertainment industry and the hotels, I think it&#8217;s very suitable for doing an event that could potentially attract people to join,&#8221; Ho told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Unlike CES, the tech fair will have a focus beyond consumer and enterprise electronics to include government-facing technology, Ho said. It&#8217;s inviting companies across the globe that specialize in social and environmental technology, life sciences, advanced technology and &#8220;new infrastructure,&#8221; a Chinese buzzword referring to innovation in the likes of 5G, smart cities and transportation.</p>
<p>Ho envisions the event will be a bridge between China and the rest of the world, given Macau&#8217;s &#8220;neutral&#8221; position in the geopolitical landscape.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Macau can be a platform that could help other countries to get into Mainland China or even for Mainland China companies to go to APAC or Middle Eastern countries,&#8221; Ho said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Hong Kong and Macau are the only ones that could host a very international and neutral event that people would like to join and won&#8217;t feel like that&#8217;s a very government event.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many argue that Hong Kong&#8217;s special status as a semiautonomous region <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/business/hong-kong-special-status-explained.html">is at stake</a> as Beijing tightens its grip over the former British colony. Rise, a popular tech conference that Web Summit hosted in Hong Kong <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/15/rise-conference-2020-2021/">up until 2019</a>, has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/web-summit-will-hold-rise-2022-in-kuala-lumpur-launch-a-new-event-in-tokyo/">relocated to Kuala Lumpur</a> due to ongoing political tensions in the city.</p>
<p>Ho admitted Macau will potentially face the same challenge, but he believed the exit of major international tech fairs, from Rise in Hong Kong to CES Asia in Shanghai (<a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/tech/article/3093108/ces-asia-chinese-version-major-us-tech-show-gets-scrapped-amid-trade">in part due to the U.S.-China trade war</a>), should open up opportunities for Macau to attract attendees from Asia&#8217;s tech community and others with an interest in China.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Web Summit will hold RISE 2022 in Kuala Lumpur, launch a new event in Tokyo&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/web-summit-will-hold-rise-2022-in-kuala-lumpur-launch-a-new-event-in-tokyo/embed/#?secret=eU9hAwHpDN" data-secret="eU9hAwHpDN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I always have a big dream that we want to compare ourselves eventually with Singapore,&#8221; Ho said, adding that the Macau government is working to introduce policies that are friendly to overseas businesses.</p>
<p>Beyond is scheduled to take place in mid-June next year, but the viability of the event will no doubt be contingent on the development of COVID-19 control in the next few months.</p>
<p>Aside from tech corporations and startups, Beyond also looks to attract influential members from academia, society and provincial governments across China. The event organizer is in talks with ByteDance, DJI, SenseTime, Alibaba, Tencent, Foxconn, BMW and more to invite executives from the giants to attend.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Google said on Tuesday it is investing in two Indian startups, Glance and DailyHunt, as the Android-maker makes a further push into the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market. Two-year-old Indian startup Glance, which serves news, media content and games on the lock screen of more than 100 million smartphones, has raised $145 million in a new [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said on Tuesday it is investing in two Indian startups, Glance and DailyHunt, as the Android-maker makes a further push into the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market.</p>
<p>Two-year-old Indian startup Glance, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/inmobis-glance-tops-100-million-daily-active-users-in-21-months/">serves news, media content and games on the lock screen of more than 100 million smartphones</a>, has raised $145 million in a new financing round from Google and existing investor Mithril Partners.</p>
<p>Glance, which is part of advertising giant <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/inmobi" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="inmobi">InMobi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Group, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">uses AI to offer personalized experience to its users. The service replaces the otherwise empty lock screen with locally relevant news, stories and casual games. Late last year, InMobi acquired Roposo, a Gurgaon-headquartered startup, that has enabled it to introduce short-form videos on the platform. Google is also investing in Roposo. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roposo is a short-video platform with more than 33 million monthly active users. These users spend about 20 minutes consuming content across multiple genres in more than 10 languages on the app everyday. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;India&#8217;s Glance tops 100M daily active users in 21 months&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/inmobis-glance-tops-100-million-daily-active-users-in-21-months/embed/#?secret=pjZtmuLA0U" data-secret="pjZtmuLA0U" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Glance ships pre-installed on several smartphone models. The subsidiary maintains tie-ups with nearly every top <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/android" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="android">Android <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> smartphone vendor, including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/xiaomi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="xiaomi">Xiaomi </a>and Samsung, the two largest smartphone vendors in India. The service has amassed over 115 million daily active users.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Glance is a great example of innovation solving for mobile-first and mobile-only consumption, serving content across many of India’s local languages,” said Caesar Sengupta, VP, Google, in a statement. “Still too many Indians have trouble finding content to read or services they can use confidently, in their own language. And this significantly limits the value of the internet for them, particularly at a time like this when the internet is the lifeline of so many people. This investment underlines our strong belief in working with India’s innovative startups and work towards the shared goal of building a truly inclusive digital economy that will benefit everyone.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naveen Tewari, founder and chief executive of Glance and InMobi Group, said the investment will pave the way for &#8220;deeper partnership between Google and Glance across product development, infrastructure, and global market expansion.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand in the U.S.</span></p>
<h2>Investment in DailyHunt</h2>
<p>Google said on Tuesday that it is also investing in VerSe Innovation, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/06/newshunt/">parent firm of Indian startup DailyHunt</a>. Across its apps including eponymous service and short-video platform Josh, DailyHunt claims to serve over 300 million users news and entertainment content in 14 Indian languages. The startup said it has completed a round of over $100 million from Google, Microsoft and AlphaWave among other investors, and this new round values it at over $1 billion, making it a unicorn.</p>
<p>DailyHunt &#8212; which is co-run by Umang Bedi, former Facebook India head &#8212; plans to deploy the fresh capital to scale the Josh app, the augmentation of local language content offerings, the development of content creator ecosystem, innovation in AI and ML and the growth of its truly &#8220;made-in-Bharat-for-Bharat short-video platform,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Josh and Roposo are among over a dozen apps in India that are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/tiktoks-rivals-in-india-struggle-to-cash-in-on-its-ban/">attempting to fill the void</a> New Delhi created after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banning TikTok in late June</a> in the country. TikTok identified India as its biggest overseas market prior to the ban.</p>
<p>Google is writing both these checks from India Digitization Fund that it unveiled this year. Google has committed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">invest $10 billion in India</a> over the course of the next few years. Prior to today, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/india-approves-googles-4-5-billion-deal-with-reliances-jio-platforms/">invested $4.5 billion from this fund in Indian telecom giant Jio Platforms</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In their rush to offer alternatives to advanced western chipsets, Chinese semiconductor companies are racking up large fundings from investors. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/horizon-robotics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="horizon-robotics">Horizon Robotics, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a five-year-old unicorn specializing in AI chips for robots and autonomous vehicles, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hxLwKCI6WkA5ntKlvTSH7Q">announced</a> Tuesday that it has secured $150 million in funding.</p>
<p>The proceeds are the first close of a more than $700 million Series C round that Horizon is seeking to raise. The partial funding is jointly led by prominent investors 5Y Capital (formerly Morningside Venture Capital), Hillhouse Capital and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/capital-today" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="capital-today">Capital Today <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. <a href="https://www.gtja.com.hk/en/aboutus/#group_profile">Chinese brokerage Guotai Junan&#8217;s international arm</a> and KTB Network, an investment entity under the Korean conglomerate KTB, also participated.</p>
<p>The round arrived less than two years after Horizon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/horizon-robotics-raises-600m/">completed its $600 million Series B round</a>, which valued the firm at $3 billion post-money and also saw the participation of prominent Korean financiers including SK China, the China subsidiary of conglomerate SK Group, and SK Hynix, SK’s semiconductor unit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, founded by a Baidu veteran, raised its Series A round of more than $100 million, led by Intel Capital, in late 2017.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>With the fresh capital, Horizon plans to hasten the development and commercialization of its automotive chips and autonomous driving solutions. It also aims to build an &#8220;open ecosystem&#8221; for industry partners.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years, China has been striving to wean dependence on western chip giants in sectors ranging from smartphones to vehicles. Local startups like Horizon Robotics and Black Sesame Technologies, as well as telecoms titan Huawei, are pouring resources into autonomous driving processors, hoping to match or overtake the technologies from Nvidia and Intel&#8217;s Mobileye.</p>
<p>Horizon&#8217;s OEM and Tier 1 auto partners, according to the firm, include <a href="https://medium.com/horizon-robotics/horizon-robotics-assisted-audi-to-receive-its-first-test-license-for-autonomous-driving-on-public-18dc38f78e5e">Audi</a>, Bosch, <a href="https://medium.com/horizon-robotics/horizon-robotics-and-continental-sign-mou-in-the-field-of-intelligent-driving-839ce85ee486?source=collection_category---4------0-----------------------">Continental</a>, SAIC Motor and BYD.</p>
<p>Indeed, 75% of China&#8217;s ADAS-equipped (advanced driver-assistance system) cars and Level 3 (autonomous driving under certain circumstances) vehicles will be supported by Chinese suppliers by 2030, up from 20% in 2019, investment bank CITIC Securities <a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/hyyj/2020-09-25/doc-iivhvpwy8790568.shtml">projects</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.casaverdecapital.com/">Casa Verde Capital</a>, the investment fund co-founded by cannabis connoisseur Snoop Dogg (also known as Calvin Broadus), has closed on $100 million for its second investment fund,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1793392/000179339220000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml"> according to documents</a> filed<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1794686/000179468620000001/0001794686-20-000001-index.htm"> with the SEC</a>.</p>
<p>The fund, whose managing director, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/karan-wadhera" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="karan-wadhera">Karan Wadhera <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> declined to comment for this article, has managed to raise more cash just as the market for cannabis-related products seems poised for another period of expansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to the public perception of the cannabis industry is not too dissimilar to the dotcom bubble of the late ’90s, where there was a lot of hype — a lot of it driven by public companies — and a lot of speculative trading and valuations that weren’t really founded in reality. [We’re talking about] projections multiple years out into the future, and then crazy revenue multiples on top of that,&#8221; Wadhera <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/cannabis-vc-karan-wadhera-on-why-the-industry-which-took-a-hit-last-year-is-now-quietly-blazing/">said of the last bust when he spoke to TechCrunch in July</a>. &#8220;Things just got really frothy, and that eventually burst, and last April or May was sort of the apex of that moment. It’s when things started to trade off. And it’s been those names, the public names in particular, that have been hit particularly hard.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since then, the industry has come roaring back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sitting here today, four-plus months into COVID, cannabis has really proved itself to be a non-cyclical industry. Cannabis has been deemed an essential business everywhere across the U.S. We had record sales in March, April and May, and the trend has continued,&#8221; Wadhera said in July. &#8220;And now that we are getting into an environment where governments are going to be looking for additional sources of tax revenue, the potential urgency around cannabis legalization is going to be there, which is going to be massively positive for the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no indication of the target for the new venture capital fund, but with the new fundraising, Casa Verde <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/13/snoop-doggs-venture-firm-just-closed-its-debut-fund-with-45-million/">more than doubles the size of its initial investment vehicle</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cannabis VC Karan Wadhera on why the industry, which took a hit last year, is now quietly blazing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/cannabis-vc-karan-wadhera-on-why-the-industry-which-took-a-hit-last-year-is-now-quietly-blazing/embed/#?secret=lpZzYw7etf" data-secret="lpZzYw7etf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since Broadus, Wadhera and a third partner and the founder of Cashmere Agency and Stampede Management <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ted-chung" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ted-chung">Ted Chung launched <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> their debut fund in 2018, weed businesses have endured a roller-coaster business cycle of boom and bust.</p>
<p>In spite of those market vagaries, Casa Verde has managed to build a portfolio that is now worth at least $200 million, according to people with knowledge of the firm. That money has come through several special purpose vehicles and other fundraising mechanisms raised alongside the flagship fund.</p>
<p>The overall market for cannabis and cannabinoid derivatives is expected to hit $34 billion by 2025 according to an analyst report seen by TechCrunch from the investment bank <a href="https://www.cowen.com/">Cowen.</a></p>
<p>With <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/arizona" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="arizona">Arizona, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota all passing adult-use cannabis legalization measures in their states, the investment bank predicted roughly 30% growth to their total addressable market estimates.</p>
<p>For its part, Casa Verde has always taken a broad view on the potential addressable market that cannabis and its chemical compounds could capture.</p>
<p>Nowhere is that more on view than in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/snoop-doggs-casa-verde-gets-into-the-sleep-space-backing-ny-based-proper/">firm&#8217;s latest investment in the sleep company, Proper</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="trGpcMREtB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/snoop-doggs-casa-verde-gets-into-the-sleep-space-backing-ny-based-proper/">Snoop Dogg&#8217;s Casa Verde gets into the sleep space, backing NY-based Proper</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Snoop Dogg&#8217;s Casa Verde gets into the sleep space, backing NY-based Proper&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/snoop-doggs-casa-verde-gets-into-the-sleep-space-backing-ny-based-proper/embed/#?secret=trGpcMREtB" data-secret="trGpcMREtB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“[Cannabis] is an input as well and its use case will go beyond how people think of cannabis stigmatically,” Wadhera said. “At its core, [<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/proper-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="proper-2">Proper] <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is a company that’s helping us target this sleep epidemic. We think CBD and cannabis at large can play a big role in addressing that in a way that traditional products haven’t been able to.”</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s true for sleep is true for a number of other different applications as well, Wadhera has said in the past.</p>
<p>Casa Verde has already invested heavily across the pure-play opportunities in cannabis, with investments spanning delivery, supply chain logistics, brands and retail.</p>
<p>But the health benefits that cannabinoids could have for all kinds of ailments open up a much larger market &#8212; as do the broad consumer opportunities should Congress <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/323582/support-legal-marijuana-inches-new-high.aspx">accede to the wishes of more than 60% of the American electorate</a> and legalize recreational cannabis use nationally.</p>
<p>And, as Wadhera told us in July, a Biden administration presents a potentially much more positive regulatory environment for the industry than the previous Trump administration did.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Biden will be very helpful. He has laid out many of the things that he wants, and [while] he isn’t taking it as far as full-scale legalization, he’s certainly in favor of full-scale decriminalization, [meaning] letting states have full authority over what happens with their businesses, and also the rescheduling of cannabis down from the current Schedule 1 level,&#8221; Wadhera had said. &#8220;So all of that will be incredibly helpful and will bring a lot more players who will feel comfortable investing in the space and, potentially, acquiring some of these businesses, too.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A coalition of companies have filed <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20433333-nso-v-whatsapp-amicus-brief-microsoft-et-al-as-filed">an amicus brief</a> in support of a legal case brought by WhatsApp against Israeli intelligence firm NSO Group, accusing the company of using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/13/whatsapp-exploit-let-attackers-install-government-grade-spyware-on-phones/">an undisclosed vulnerability</a> in the messaging app to hack into at least 1,400 devices, some of which were owned by journalists and human rights activists.</p>
<p>NSO develops and sells governments access to its Pegasus spyware, allowing its nation-state customers to target and stealthily hack into the devices of its targets. Spyware like Pegasus can track a victim&#8217;s location, read their messages and listen to their calls, steal their photos and files and siphon off private information from their device. The spyware is often installed by tricking a target into opening a malicious link, or sometimes by exploiting never-before-seen vulnerabilities in apps or phones to silently infect the victims with the spyware. The company has drawn ire for selling to authoritarian regimes, like Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Last year, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whatsapp">WhatsApp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> found and patched a vulnerability that it said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/13/whatsapp-exploit-let-attackers-install-government-grade-spyware-on-phones/">was being abused</a> to deliver the government-grade spyware, in some cases without the victim knowing. Months later, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/whatsapp-spyware-nso-group/">WhatsApp sued NSO</a> to understand more about the incident, including which of its government customers was behind the attack.</p>
<p>NSO has repeatedly disputed the allegations, but was unable to convince a U.S. court to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/17/us-judge-whatsapp-lawsuit-against-israeli-spyware-firm-nso-can-proceed">drop the case</a> earlier this year. NSO&#8217;s main legal defense is that it is afforded legal immunities because it acts on behalf of governments.</p>
<p>But a coalition of tech companies has sided with WhatsApp, and is now asking the court to not allow NSO to claim or be subject to immunity.</p>
<p>Microsoft (including its subsidiaries LinkedIn and GitHub), Google, Cisco, VMware and the Internet Association, which represents dozens of tech giants, including Amazon, Facebook and Twitter, warned that the development of spyware and espionage tools — including hoarding the vulnerabilities used to deliver them — make ordinary people less safe and secure, and also runs the risk of these tools falling into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>In a blog post, Microsoft&#8217;s customer security and trust chief Tom Burt said NSO should be accountable for the tools it builds and the vulnerabilities it exploits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Private companies should remain subject to liability when they use their cyber-surveillance tools to break the law, or knowingly permit their use for such purposes, regardless of who their customers are or what they’re trying to achieve,&#8221; said Burt. &#8220;We hope that standing together with our competitors today through this amicus brief will help protect our collective customers and global digital ecosystem from more indiscriminate attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesperson for NSO did not immediately comment.</p>
