										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the insurance industry adjusts to life in the 21st century (heh), an AI startup that has built computer vision tools to enable remote damage appraisals is announcing a significant round of growth funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://tractable.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tractable</a>, which works with automotive insurance companies to let users take and submit photos of damaged cars that are then &#8220;read&#8221; to make appraisals, has raised $60 million, a series D that values Tractable at $1 billion, the company said.</p>
<p>Tractable says it works with more than 20 of the top 100 auto insurers in the world, and it has seen sales grow 600% in the last 24 months, which CEO Alex Dalyac told me translates as &#8220;well into 8 figures of annual revenue.&#8221; He also told me that &#8220;we would have grown even faster if it weren&#8217;t for Covid.&#8221; People staying at home meant far less people on the roads, and less accidents.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its business today is based mostly around car accident recovery &#8212; where users can take pictures using ordinary smartphone cameras, uploading pictures via a mobile web site (not typically an app).</p>
<p>But Tractable&#8217;s plan is to use some of the funding to expand deeper into areas adjacent to that: natural disaster recovery (specifically for appraising property damage), and used car appraisals. It will also use the investment to continue building out its technology, specifically to help build out better, AI-based techniques of processing and parsing pictures that are taken on smartphones &#8212; by their nature small in size.</p>
<p>Insight Partners and Georgian co-led the round and it brings the total raised by the company to $115 million.</p>
<p>Dalyac, a deep learning researcher by training who co-founded the company with Razvan Ranca and Adrien Cohen, said that the &#8220;opportunity&#8221; (if you could call an accident that) Tractable has identified and built to fix is that it&#8217;s generally time-consuming and stressful to deal with an insurance company when you are also coping with a problem with your car.</p>
<p>And while a new generation of &#8220;insuretech&#8221; startups have emerged in recent years that are bringing more modern processes into the equation, typically the incumbent major insurance companies &#8212; the ones that Tractable targets &#8212; have lacked the technology to improve that process.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unlike the tension between fintech-fuelled neobanks and the incumbent banks, which are now scrambling to invest in more technology to catch up with the times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting into an accident can be anything from a hassle to trauma,&#8221; Dalyac said. &#8220;It can be devastating, and then the process for recovery is pretty damn slow. You&#8217;re dealing with so many touch points with your insurance, so many people that need to come and check things out again. It&#8217;s hard to keep track and know when things will truly be back to normal. Our belief is that that whole process can be 10 times faster, thanks to the breakthroughs in image classification.&#8221;</p>
<p>That process currently also extends not just to taking pictures for claims, but also to help figure out when a car is beyond repair, in which case which parts can be recycled and reused elsewhere, also using Tractable&#8217;s computer vision technology. Dalyac noted that this was a popular enough service in the last year that the company helped recycle as many cars &#8220;as Tesla sold in 2019.&#8221;</p>
<p>Customers that have integrated with Tractable to date include Geico in the U.S., as well as a large swathe of insurers in Japan, specifically Tokio Marine Nichido, Mitsui Sumitomo, Aioi Nissay Dowa and Sompo. Covéa, the largest auto insurer in France, is also a customer, as is Admiral Seguros, the Spanish entity of UK&#8217;s Admiral Group, as well as Ageas, a top UK insurer.</p>
<p>Japan is the company&#8217;s biggest market today Dalyac said &#8212; the reason being that it has an ageing population, but one that is also very strong on mobile usage: combining those two, &#8220;automation is more than a value add; it’s a must have,&#8221; Dalyac said. He also added that he thinks the U.S. will overtake Japan as Tractable&#8217;s biggest market soon.</p>
<p>The new directions into property and other car applications will also open the door to a wider set of use cases beyond working with insurance providers over time. It will also bring Tractable potentially into new competitive environments. There are other companies that have also identified this opportunity.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/hover-secures-60m-for-a-3d-imaging-platform-used-to-assess-and-fix-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hover</a>, which has built a way to create 3d imagery of homes using ordinary smartphone cameras, is also eyeing ways of selling its tech (originally developed to help make estimates on home repairs) to insurance companies.</p>
<p>For now, however, it sounds like the opportunity is a big enough one that the race is more to meet demand than it is to beat competitors to do so.</p>
<p>“Tractable’s accelerating growth at scale is a testament to the power and differentiation of their applied machine learning system, which continues to improve as more businesses adopt it,&#8221; said Lonne Jaffe, MD at Insight Partners and Tractable Board member, in a statement. &#8220;We’re excited to double down on our partnership with Tractable as they work to help the world recover faster from accidents and disasters that affect hundreds of millions of lives.”</p>
<p>Emily Walsh, Partner at Georgian Partners added: “Tractable’s industry-leading computer vision capabilities are continuing to fuel incredible customer ROI and growth for the firm. We&#8217;re excited to continue to partner with Tractable as they apply their artificial intelligence capabilities to new, multi-billion dollar market opportunities in the used vehicle and natural disaster recovery industries.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon admits it has a fake review problem, but does its best to spread the blame around in <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/how-amazon-works/creating-a-trustworthy-reviews-experience">a new post</a> detailing the issue. After numerous reports for years that the online retail giant is overrun with knock-off products and faked or farmed reviews, the company aims to look as if it is finally putting its foot down, but no new efforts or rules are discussed — rather, it is others that need to step up <em>their</em> work to keep Amazon safe.</p>
<p>Amazon reviews have become notoriously unreliable as indicators of quality as the store has given itself over willingly to counterfeits, AliExpress resellers, and promotion of the company&#8217;s internal brands (developed with the benefit of seller data). <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/06/amazon-reviews-thousands-are-fake-heres-how-to-spot-them.html">Multiple</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-fake-review-problem">reports</a> have found organized efforts to spam the store with meaningless 5-star reviews in exchange for free products or cash. I have myself received such offers, or sellers promising payment for raising a star rating.</p>
<p>After the requisite preliminary palaver about being &#8220;obsessed with delighting customers&#8221; and all that, Amazon explains that it, like all big tech giants, uses automated systems to vet reviews before they go up. The company has always been cagey about the actual numbers, but in this post it drops a whopper: &#8220;In 2020, we stopped more than 200 million suspected fake reviews before they were ever seen by a customer.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bezos &#8216;can&#8217;t guarantee&#8217; no anti-competitive activity as Congress catches him flat-footed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/bezos-cant-guarantee-no-anti-competitive-activity-as-congress-catches-him-flat-footed/embed/#?secret=gWDUWYTNjF" data-secret="gWDUWYTNjF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>200 million is a lot no matter how you look at it, but it&#8217;s really a lot when you consider that Amazon <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/06/amazon-reviews-thousands-are-fake-heres-how-to-spot-them.html">told CNBC that same year</a> that it &#8220;analyze[s] over 10 million review submissions weekly,&#8221; which adds up to somewhere north of 520 million submissions yearly. These two Amazon-provided numbers suggest that a third of all reviews submitted, at a minimum, are rejected as fake.</p>
<p>Hard numbers on Amazon&#8217;s total reviews are hard to come by. <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-fake-review-problem">Speaking to Buzzfeed</a>, Amazon listing analysis site ReviewMeta&#8217;s Tommy Noonan estimated that in 2020 Amazon hosted around 250 million reviews (of which, incidentally, he calculated about 9 percent were &#8220;unnatural&#8221;). But if over 500 million were submitted in 2020 and about 200 million of those were fake, that indicates a far larger total. I&#8217;ve asked Amazon for more precise information on this, and will update the post if I hear back, but the company is not communicative about these numbers in general.</p>
<p>Groups organizing on social media numbering in the tens of thousands have been repeatedly pointed out as major contributors to the fake review ecosystem. Amazon writes that in the first quarter of 2020, it reported 300 such groups to the platforms hosting them, and the same period in 2021 it reported over 1,000. Takedown times have increased, but it&#8217;s hard to take this increase as anything other than a thriving business model — certainly not something in the process of being stamped out.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xscALVQfXS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/facebook-takes-down-16000-groups-trading-fake-reviews-after-another-poke-by-uks-cma/">Facebook takes down 16,000 groups trading fake reviews after another poke by UK&#8217;s CMA</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook takes down 16,000 groups trading fake reviews after another poke by UK&#8217;s CMA&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/facebook-takes-down-16000-groups-trading-fake-reviews-after-another-poke-by-uks-cma/embed/#?secret=xscALVQfXS" data-secret="xscALVQfXS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;It is imperative for social media companies to invest adequately in proactive controls to detect and enforce fake reviews ahead of our reporting the issue to them,&#8221; Amazon declares. Indeed social media companies are being pressed from multiple directions to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/big-tech-companies-cannot-be-trusted-to-self-regulate-we-need-congress-to-act/">take more responsibility</a> for what users do on their platforms, but they make the same noises Amazon does: &#8220;we&#8217;re doing what we can,&#8221; (and, it is left unsaid, clearly it&#8217;s not enough).</p>
<p>&#8220;We need coordinated assistance from consumer protection regulators around the world,&#8221; Amazon writes. But the company <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/amazon-wages-lobbying-war-kill-100025138.html">lobbied forcefully and successfully against the INFORM act</a>, which would have helped identify sellers with bad intent and add transparency to online marketplaces (strangely, Amazon has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/amazon-u-s-sellers-will-have-to-display-their-name-and-address-starting-sept-1-2020/">taken some of the actions it objects to independently</a>). And that line is suspiciously absent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/ring-police-warrants-neighbors/">when it is Amazon that consumers need to be protected against</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is also critical that we hold bad actors—and the service providers that provide them with fake reviews—accountable for their activity,&#8221; the post continues. But while lawsuits and partnerships with law enforcement are part of that, once again the call to &#8220;work together&#8221; rings hollow when Amazon itself is where the activity occurs and the company is in complete control of that ecosystem. Though it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/">banned some major players from the store</a>, innumerable others flout the rules with impunity.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the post does Amazon detail any new steps it will take to deter these bad actors or crack down on the pervasive gaming of the system for which it sets the rules. It will &#8220;continue to enhance&#8221; its detection tools, &#8220;streamline processes&#8221; for partnerships, and &#8220;work hard&#8221; at keeping scammers accountable. In other words, it will keep doing exactly what it has been doing this whole time — which is what put it in this position in the first place.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Thanks to a twist of fate, two large cups of coffee and help from editor Annie Saunders, the Extra Crunch team is taking over today&#8217;s edition of Daily Crunch.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll hand it back as soon as Henry Pickavet returns or Alex Wilhelm is back from vacation, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve been handed the mic: We&#8217;re trying to identify the most effective growth marketers who are helping startups build their businesses. With that in mind, Managing Editor Eric Eldon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/to-win-post-pandemic-startups-need-remote-first-growth-teams">interviewed growth leader Susan Su</a>, currently head of portfolio strategy at Sound Ventures, about the need for founders to develop a growth-centered mentality as the economy reopens.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don’t need to memorize all the right buttons to push in an ads dashboard, but they need to be familiar and comfortable with the core work of gap-finding,&#8221; says Su.</p>
<p>&#8220;Founders will fail if they adopt a mentality that someone else can or should do it for them. The founder’s job is to supply ambition and opinions, and then magnetize high-quality talent to come and pull the levers and bring their creative vision to life.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve worked with a growth expert you recommend, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">please get in touch and let us know</a>.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t rank with top personal health brands like Procter &amp; Gamble, Peloton or Fitbit, but perhaps it doesn&#8217;t need to. Cupertino&#8217;s health-related products and services are broad enough to touch each of these companies — and many others — in some way.</p>
<p>In <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/apple-health/">an interview with Apple VP of Technology Kevin Lynch</a></strong>, Darrell Etherington tracked the evolution of the company&#8217;s user-guided approach to developing hardware, software and data management policies around personal health.</p>
<p>“It actually started from Apple Watch, where we were capturing heart rate data for calorimetry activity, and [Activity] ring closure, and we needed a place to put the heart rate data,&#8221; says Lynch. &#8220;So we created the Health app as a place to store the data.”</p>
<p>Sarah Perez reported on <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">today&#8217;s launch of Spotify Greenroom, a live audio app</a></strong> based on the code of Locker Room. In March, Spotify purchased Betty Labs, which developed Locker Room.</p>
<p>Best known for music streaming, Spotify has been branching out into a more robust media company in recent years. Greenroom will allow users to host and join audio chat rooms, &#8220;and optionally turn those conversations into podcasts,&#8221; says Sarah.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason why advertising units are called &#8220;impressions.&#8221; CPG companies are eager to literally place their messages in our faces.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/facebook-will-begin-beaming-advertisements-into-virtual-reality/">Facebook today announced its plans to start testing ads on its Oculus platform</a></strong> in a limited rollout. A company blog post indicates that “for now, this is a test with a few apps.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/bonds-200-million-led-investment-values-software-testing-platform-browserstack-at-4-billion/">Software testing platform BrowserStack</a></strong> announced today that it has raised $200 million in a Series B round. The round, which values the company at $4 billion, was led by BOND, with Insight Partners and Accel participating.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/denmarks-templafy-raises-60m-for-its-b2b-saas-platform-that-does-business-document-creation/"><strong>PandaDoc competitor Templafy</strong></a> has raised a Series D worth $60 million. Since launch, the business document creation platform based in Denmark has raised $125 million, including a $25 million Series C 14 months ago.</p>
<p>After securing a $100 million Series E round led by Accel partners, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/bringg-nabs-100m-at-a-1b-valuation-for-a-last-mile-delivery-platform-for-retailers/">last-mile delivery platform Bringg is now valued at $1 billion</a></strong>, the company confirms. CEO Guy Bloch told TechCrunch the funds will be used to continue fueling growth, expanding operations and acquiring new customers. “Companies need our urgent help to do a job,&#8221; says Bloch.</p>
<h2>Edtech investors are flocking to SaaS guidance counselors</h2>
<p>The prevailing post-pandemic edtech narrative, which predicted higher ed would be DOA as soon as everyone got their vaccine and took off for a gap year, might not be quite true.</p>
<p>Natasha Mascarenhas explores a new crop of edtech SaaS startups that function like guidance counselors, helping students with everything from study-abroad opportunities to swiping right on a captivating college (really!).</p>
<p>&#8220;Startups that help students navigate institutional bureaucracy so they can get more value out of their educational experience may become a growing focus for investors as consumer demand for virtual personalized learning increases,&#8221; she writes.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/facebook-rolls-out-new-tools-for-group-admins-including-automated-moderation-aids/"><strong>Facebook rolls out new tools for Group admins</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Facebook launched a new set of tools aimed at helping Facebook Group administrators get a better handle on their online communities and, potentially, help keep conversations from going off the rails. (May the odds be ever in your favor!) Among the more interesting new tools is a machine-learning-powered feature that alerts admins to potentially unhealthy conversations taking place in their group. Another lets the admin slow the pace of a heated conversation by limiting how often group members can post. As the adage goes, if you can’t say anything nice, say it slower.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/google-updates-its-kids-online-safety-curriculum-with-lessons-on-gaming-video-and-more/"><strong>Google updates online safety curriculum for kids</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Perhaps we can teach the next generation to just be nice on the internet instead of using machine learning to prevent them from rapidly disseminating vaccine disinformation? Google updated and expanded its digital safety and citizenship curriculum, Be Internet Awesome, which has lessons for parents and educators about online gaming, cyberbullying and online empathy. Fingers crossed!</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/waymo-alphabets-self-driving-arm-raises-2-5b-in-second-external-investment-round/"><strong>Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving arm, raises $2.5B</strong></a><strong>:</strong> In its second outside funding round, Waymo raised $2.5 billion to grow Waymo Driver, its autonomous driving platform, and its team. At the moment, Waymo One, a commercial ride-hailing service, operates in the Phoenix, Arizona area, and Waymo announced plans earlier this month to enter a “test run” of its trucking and cargo transportation service with J.B.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E3 2021 kicked off with news about E3 2022. Kind of a funny way to start a show, as Mayor Eric Garcetti told the crowd, &#8220;we look forward to seeing you in-person, here in the City of Angels, in 2022.&#8221; Also a bit funny when the mayor’s video game show announcement has less confetti and Minions than his state-reopening speech, but that’s something for another post.</p>
<p>It’s understandable, of course, that E3’s organizers led with that news. The 2021 show was, like so many other things over the past year-and-a-half, a historic anomaly. After opting to skip the 2020 show altogether (understandably), it went ahead with the first &#8212; and for the time being, last &#8212; all virtual event.</p>
<p>The virtual event always seems like a good idea, in theory. In practice, results vary wildly depending on a number of factors, not the least of which is content. Many shows have an uphill battle when it comes to moving all online. CES, I think, was a struggle, due in part to the size of the show, but also the content. As ubiquitous as consumer electronics are, I don’t see wide swaths of the internet champing at the bit to watch a presentation from anyone but, say, Apple and maybe Samsung.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;E3 2021 catch up&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/e3-2021-catch-up/embed/#?secret=7ESqLTKvwK" data-secret="7ESqLTKvwK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>E3 doesn’t have that problem. The show already had a leg up, having moved away from industry-only to something more hybrid years ago. Unlike other shows I attend regularly, people in downtown LA actually get a bit of a buzz when E3 comes to town. Everyone’s a gamer and most are excited about some piece of upcoming news. Uber and Lyft drivers love to tell you about it that week.</p>
<p>It follows that the show’s online presence is immense. The days leading up to the event, E3-related content was trending all over the place &#8212; people watch trailers, argue about the trailers, stream about the trailers and argue about other people’s streams about the trailers on their own streams. It’s a recipe for success around a virtual event &#8212; especially coming after a year when, even before the latest Xbox and PlayStation were released, the industry was already setting records amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Of the big three, Microsoft won, hands down. Sorry, Sony, you can’t win if you don’t play. Nintendo was solid, but not spectacular. But more on that in a moment.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1YnVzOA2wNs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=444&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>I talked a fair bit about the Xbox press conference <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/e3-2021-catch-up/">in the last one of these</a>. But the long and short of it is Microsoft won on two flanks: sheer volume and Game Pass titles. That last bit feels about as close to a silver bullet as we’re going to see in this generation of consoles. Likely Sony is going to have its own virtual event in the near future &#8212; but it’s going to be a tough act to follow.</p>
<p>In all, Microsoft showed off 30 games (and a fridge), a whopping 27 of which will be available on Game Pass, if there were any doubt as to how all-in the company is on its subscription service. And, of course, there’s the fact that this was billed as a Microsoft/Bethesda event, which shows you how important that massive acquisition is to the future of Xbox.</p>
<p>As for Nintendo, let’s be honest. Anything that didn’t include the long-rumored Switch Pro was going to be a disappointment. The original Switch is four years old and due for a big upgrade, beyond the Switch Lite and a refresh with added battery. It’s time for that HD screen &#8212; the thing would sell like hotcakes next holiday.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQz_ECTGGyA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Thing is, the Switch had a spectacular 2020. Even with an initial supply chain shortage (something all three current consoles are guilty of), it did gangbusters during the pandemic, due in no small part to the arrival of a long-awaited new Animal Crossing game. A low-pressure, social title between fuzzy animals was precisely what the world needed last year, and Nintendo was happy to deliver.</p>
<p>There’s also a good chance that Nintendo is dealing with continued supply chain issues around the new components. So while it seems likely the Pro is on the way (see: the new Guardians of the Galaxy game), we’ll likely have to wait until next year.</p>

<p>We’ll also have to wait until next year for Breath of the Wild 2, but at least the sequel to the much-loved Zelda game had the decency to show up this year. And, of course, we’ve got a bunch of great-looking titles coming for the system. Some highlights.</p>

<p data-c="paragraph">Lincoln Motor will launch its first all-electric vehicle in 2022 followed by three other EVs as part of the luxury brand&#8217;s goal to electrify its entire portfolio by the end of the decade.</p>
<p data-c="paragraph">The first EV will come to market just in time for Lincoln&#8217;s 100th birthday celebration — and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/lincoln-reportedly-plans-to-electrify-entire-lineup-by-2022/">nearly four years</a> since initial reports emerged that the brand was aiming to electrify its lineup. Like GM&#8217;s luxury brand Cadillac, Lincoln doesn&#8217;t have an all-electric vehicle in its lineup. But Lincoln is keen to catch up and has set a lofty target for half of its global sales to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2025. These new vehicles fall under Ford&#8217;s commitment to invest $30 billion into electric vehicles through 2025.</p>
<p data-c="paragraph">The announcement by Lincoln follows a string of EV-related news from Ford and its competitors. On Wednesday, rival GM said it planned to invest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/">$35 billion in EVs and autonomous vehicles</a> — an $8 billion increase from its financial commitment made back in November 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p data-c="paragraph">The Lincoln EV was originally going to be built on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/rivian-is-building-lincoln-an-all-electric-vehicle/">Rivian&#8217;s skateboard platform</a>. However, those plans were scrapped in April 2020. The companies said at the time that they still plan to co-develop a vehicle in the future. A<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Lincoln spokesperson confirmed those co-development plans were still intact, but did not reveal any more information. </span></p>
<p data-c="paragraph"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For now, Lincoln&#8217;s electric vehicles will be based on a </span>new, dedicated EV architecture developed by Ford. The automaker announced in May during its <a href="https://shareholder.ford.com/investors/delivering-ford/default.aspx">Capital Markets Day</a> for investors that it was developing two flexible platforms, one for smaller SUVs and sedans and another for larger pickups. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This is a different architecture used in the current Ford Mustang Mach-E and upcoming Ford F-150 Lightning.</span></p>
<p data-c="paragraph">The new flexible platform, which allows for rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive vehicles, is expected to underpin EV versions of the Lincoln Aviator and Ford Explorer.</p>

<div class="_1z604">
<p data-c="paragraph">According to Lincoln, the automaker&#8217;s first fully electric car will join the likes of plug-in hybrid SUVs Aviator and Corsair. Lincoln has not yet revealed what model the new EV will take, but it hinted the design might be similar to the Lincoln Zephyr Reflection concept sedan revealed at Auto Shanghai this year, made specifically for the Chinese market. Lincoln&#8217;s electric car will be available for sale in both the United States and China.</p>
</div>
<p>Lincoln also shared information on the interior of its new EV, attempting to make it a minimalistic and expansive space with a panoramic roof vista to create a more airy feel, one that befits a &#8220;sanctuary,&#8221; as the automaker is referring to its vehicle. Perhaps most notable is the upcoming EVs will have a digital platform built off the Android operating system, which will allow the company to offer third-party apps and services and update the software remotely.</p>
<p>The vehicle will also be equipped with advanced driver-assist features, including hands-free driving on certain highways.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automakers’ interest in robotics is not a new phenomenon, of course: Robots and automation have long played a role in manufacturing and are both clearly central to their push into AVs. But recently, many companies are going even deeper into the field, with plans to be involved in the wide spectrum of categories that robotics touch.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021?promo=leftrail&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>, we spoke to a trio of experts at three major automakers. Max Bajracharya of Toyota Research Institute, Mario Santillo of Ford and Ernestine Fu of Hyundai Motor Group joined us to discuss their companies’ unique approaches to robotics.</p>
<h2>Why are automakers so interested in robotics?</h2>
<p>Let’s get the simple question out of the way first, shall we? Moving beyond existing investments in manufacturing and autonomous vehicles, why do so many carmakers seem so bullish about companies like Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bajracharya:</strong> I think all automakers are recognizing that there won’t be the automotive business in the future as it is today. A lot of automakers, Toyota included, are looking for what’s next. Automakers are very well positioned to leverage what they already know about robotics and manufacturing to take on the robotics market. <strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><em>(Timestamp: 1:01)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<h2>The role of concept vehicles</h2>
<p>Concept cars are nothing new in the industry, but even still, Hyundai’s recently announced Ultimate Mobility Vehicle (UMV) was pretty wild, with large, extending legs that help it walk off-road.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;From Twenty Minute VC to 20VC, Harry Stebbings launches a micro VC off the back of his popular podcast&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/from-twenty-minute-vc-to-20vc-harry-stebbings-launched-a-micro-vc-off-the-back-of-his-popular-podcast/embed/#?secret=IE1C02W1Bf" data-secret="IE1C02W1Bf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Stebbings said that his early-stage fund, 20VC Early, will invest checks between $250,000 to $750,000, while his growth-stage fund, 20VC Explorer, will invest in Series B onwards, with checks between $1 million to $5 million.</p>
<p>The 20VC portfolio already includes a few reported unicorns, including audio app Clubhouse and virtual event organizer Hopin. But maybe more notable is what his assumed success &#8212; as a 24-year-old who has won a spot in competitive deals and raised a massive venture capital fund &#8212; means for the way that tech is evolving.</p>
<p>First, media experience, and the ability to spout useful content in a noisy world, is being increasingly valued as an asset in the modernizing world of VC. This week, Andreessen Horowitz launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/andreessen-horowitz-goes-into-publishing-with-future/">Future</a>, a full-fledged media operation that will cover trends in startups and tech. Stebbings’ podcast, which has more than 200,000 subscribers and 80 million downloads to date, has cultivated an audience by interviewing tech’s elite, from Twitter co-founder Biz Stone to Slack founder Stewart Butterfield and a16z’s Angela Strange. Those connections getting leveraged into dollars is a proof point of this growing idea, and sometimes meme, that Twitter followers can help anyone start a rolling fund.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my second point, which is that Stebbings raising such a massive tranche of capital could quiet some of the worry around emerging fund managers being unable to, well, 15X their initial micro-funds. In other words: You might be able to get a few of your buddies in venture to throw some checks in, but how do you get a full endowment to sign on board? Based on recent conversations I’ve had with emerging fund managers, it’s hard to get institutions, the ones with real check-writing power, on board for new funds because they only have so much capital allocated toward venture. It&#8217;s even harder for diverse, underrepresented founders. Whether or not Stebbings is a one-off is unclear, but we do at least know that venture backers are viewing his Rolodex as a key competitive advantage and asset in the wild world of investing.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, media is venture and venture is media. Stebbings sits at the intersection of that trend, and with $140 million more, it will be interesting to see what he does next, and if returns come along for the ride.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vianai Systems, an AI startup founded by Vishal Sikka, former chief executive of Indian IT services giant Infosys, said on Wednesday it has raised $140 million in a round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>The two-year-old startup said a number of industry luminaries also participated in the new round, which brings its total to-date raise to at least $190 million. The startup raised $50 million in its seed financing round, but there’s no word on the size of its Series A round.</p>
<p>Details about what exactly the Palo Alto-headquartered startup does is unclear. In a press statement, Dr. Vishal Sikka said the startup is building a “better AI platform, one that puts human judgment at the center of systems that bring vast AI capabilities to amplify human potential.” Sikka, 54, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/five-reasons-why-ceo-vishal-sikka-had-to-leave-infosys/articleshow/60114080.cms">resigned</a> from the top role at Infosys in 2017 after months of acrimony between the board and a cohort of founders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“<a href="http://vian.ai">Vianai</a> helps its customers amplify the transformation potential within their organizations using a variety of advanced AI and ML tools with a distinct approach in how it thoughtfully brings together humans with technology. This human-centered approach differentiates Vianai from other platform and product companies and enables its customers to fulfill AI’s true promise,” the startup said.</p>

<p>The startup claims it has already amassed as its customers many of the world’s largest and most respected businesses, including insurance giant Munich Re.</p>
<p>Its investors include Jim Davidson (co-founder of Silver Lake), Henry Kravis and George Roberts (co-founders of KKR), and Jerry Yang (founding partner of AME and co-founder of Yahoo). Dr. Fei-Fei Li (co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI) has joined Vianai Systems’ advisory board.</p>
<p>“With the AI revolution underway, we believe Vianai’s human-centered AI platform and products provide global enterprises with operational and customer intelligence to make better business decisions,” said Deep Nishar, senior managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “We are pleased to partner with Dr. Sikka and the Vianai team to support their ambition to fulfill AI’s promise to drive fundamental digital transformations.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well, it was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Advertising giant Facebook announced Wednesday that they&#8217;re going to begin testing advertising inside virtual reality titles on its Oculus platform soon. The first roll-out is limited enough, with Facebook testing ads inside a single gaming shooter title: <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2307085352735834/?intern_source=blog&amp;intern_content=testing-in-headset-vr-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blaston</a> from Resolution Games. They are interestingly not rolling this out with a first-party title, though I&#8217;m sure integration with Oculus Studio titles is inevitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;For now, this is a test with a few apps — once we see how this test goes and incorporate feedback from developers and the community, we’ll provide more details on when ads may become more broadly available across the Oculus Platform and in the Oculus mobile app,&#8221; a company <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/testing-in-headset-vr-ads/">blog post</a> reads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Users will be able to mute, hide or see information on why they are being served an ad in its current form.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an unsurprising development for a platform that Facebook has long been bankrolling with little regard for current revenues. Nevertheless, Facebook likely realizes that there are going to be plenty of privacy questions and addressed some of them head-on. The biggest admission is that Facebook says it will not be using any data stored locally on the Oculus headset, including images from the device&#8217;s cameras to target ads. It also says, somewhat less emphatically, that there are &#8220;no plans to use movement data to target ads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook is likely realizing that it probably should&#8217;ve published a blog post years ago declaring that it was indeed not using smartphone microphones to monitor conversations and target ads (mainly because it has access to better personal information via adtech data partners anyway, but I digress) before those narratives took off. Facebook specifically notes it doesn&#8217;t use audio conversations on the headset for ad targeting.</p>
<p>Virtual reality has been a labor of future-minded thinking for Facebook. Since the beginning, it has spent billions bankrolling the ecosystem and this move seems to signal that it believes its wandered over some sort of adoption hump and are nearing the time to start more aggressively monetizing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Growth marketer and investor Susan Su says that after the pandemic, startup founders will need to develop a mentality that places growth at the center of company strategy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Growth leaders used to build key relationships across a company while working together in a real-life office. Those relationships could carry over through the pandemic, but let’s say you’re a new company and you’re remote-first.</p>
<p>How do you build this complex collaboration from scratch?</p>
<p>Growth marketer and investor Susan Su tells us that the solution is not just more software tools. In the interview below, she says that after the pandemic, startup founders will need to develop a mentality that places growth at the center of company strategy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Consultants and agencies can be great additions to this effort, especially if they have previously solved the types of problems you face. (In fact, TechCrunch is asking founders who have worked with growth marketers to share a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this survey</a>. We’ll use your answers to find more experts to interview.)</p>
<p>Su is currently the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susansu/">head of portfolio strategy for Sound Ventures,</a> previously a growth leader at Stripe and the first hire at Reforge. She also shared a few thoughts on market opportunities after the pandemic in the full interview below. E-commerce is mainstream for good, she says, even as we all try to step away from screens more often. However, many social and mobile sectors are mature, and it’s going to be even harder for startups to compete as real-world activities absorb more time.</p>
<p>Don’t forget: Susan Su will also appear <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">at our Early Stage virtual event on July 8</a> (and answer questions directly).</p>
<p><strong>How are you seeing startups manage changes in user engagement as more people exit pandemic lockdowns and adjust their daily lives?</strong></p>
<p>As we exit the pandemic, I expect that we&#8217;ll see a natural and obvious spike in some consumer activity that will roll up to midsized businesses and enterprises. Just like with the onset of the pandemic, we&#8217;ll see uneven results across sectors:</p>
<p>E-commerce boomed during the pandemic but was really an augmentation of an already-accelerating trend toward digital commerce and streamlined logistics. I don&#8217;t think we backtrack from e-commerce because habit formation around online shopping has been building for years; we would be backtracking to an age long before 2020, and that&#8217;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>New social-mobile experiences also boomed during the pandemic, but there&#8217;s still a valid question around whether 15 months or so is enough time to become part of the ingrained infrastructure of daily life. We are living in an age of mature platforms, so every new service is stealing time away from an existing service. As with pre-pandemic growth, their success rests upon fast-accumulating network effects and great, sticky core product experience. Now that we have parks, friends and dinners out calling to us again, it&#8217;s a real test of how compelling some of these new value propositions really are, and whether they can continue to demonstrate their relevance in a more hybridized online-offline world.</p>
<p>That said, the pandemic was an enormous constraint on human society and [the] economy, and these kinds of constraints often breed innovation that doesn&#8217;t go away. We will evolve, but we can never go back. It sounds cheesy but it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><strong>Some aspects of the pandemic, like remote work, appear to have radically changed certain industries. How will these societal changes impact how the typical startup thinks about growth?</strong></p>
<p>Growth will always be growth — that is, a process of iterative experimentation to identify and solve customer problems, and then scale those solutions in order to reach and convert bigger and bigger audiences. Platform changes like iOS 14 or Facebook&#8217;s periodic algorithm adjustments will have a bigger impact in the near term on the technical functioning of growth, and these aren&#8217;t specifically pandemic-related.</p>
<p>One area to watch is how growth teams are built and operated. Growth is a horizontal function that touches many different parts of the org, including product, engineering, marketing, comms and design. Many startup teams have already been working with collaboration tools even while they sat in the same office, but growth is about more than just using tools. The most effective growth leaders succeed by building relationships across the organization; it&#8217;s like the fable of Stone Soup — you&#8217;re creating this meal that will feed everyone, but you also need each person to bring a pinch of salt, or a dash of pepper, or one carrot, and that requires socialization and relationship-building. I&#8217;ll be very interested to see how new growth leaders onboard remote-only teams and what approaches they take to this &#8220;networking&#8221; need within the function.</p>
<p><strong>From the days of growth hacking on social platforms, growth marketing is now an established part of the world. But it’s not necessarily the main expertise of a startup founder, even if it needs to be. So, how should they think about addressing growth marketing in 2021? What are the essentials they should do in their roles?</strong></p>
<p>Every founder needs to have a growth mentality. They don&#8217;t need to memorize all the right buttons to push in an ads dashboard, but they need to be familiar and comfortable with the core work of gap-finding. That said, founders are by definition entrepreneurial — their company exists because they saw an opportunity that no one else did, and this is the fundamental work of growth as well.</p>
<p>Founders will fail if they adopt a mentality that someone else can or should do it for them. The founder&#8217;s job is to supply ambition and opinions, and then magnetize high-quality talent to come and pull the levers and bring their creative vision to life. There are many people who can <em>do</em> growth marketing — that is, they know how the platforms work, they understand the rules and the playbooks. But there are very few who can come up with truly visionary strategies that change the game altogether — those people become founders, and those companies become household names. So for a founder, I&#8217;d say the most important growth work is to continue to know your market and customer better than anyone else in the whole world, have an opinion about what&#8217;s missing, and work to bring the best talent to come in alongside you and be a thought partner, not just a button pusher.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?<br />
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">Respond to our survey</a> and help us find the best startup growth marketers!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>With limited resources, how should early-stage companies think about what to focus on?</strong></p>
<p>This is going to depend on the goals of your company. Are you planning to raise money and need to demonstrate certain KPIs? Are you bootstrapping and need to keep the lights on? Resources should always be allocated to the most strategic purposes, with the longest-term view you can afford. For some companies, this could mean forgoing revenue to focus on viral or word-of-mouth-driven user acquisition to demonstrate to future investors that there&#8217;s something special here. For other companies, perhaps in lower volume categories like enterprise, it&#8217;s about bringing a few strategic logos into the family as a signal to later customers and other stakeholders, including future employees and investors.</p>
<p>One thing that early-stage companies should always be focused on is building a top-shelf employer brand. You will only ever be as good as the talent you attract to your company, and interestingly growth can actually play a role in this. The best designers, engineers and product people are often flowing toward the companies that have the best growth. In that way, it&#8217;s a highly strategic role and function.</p>
<p><strong>What do startups continue to get wrong?</strong></p>
<p>You can&#8217;t truly outsource growth or any other core function; you can&#8217;t tack on customer acquisition after product development. At the end of the day, if you really think about it, all a company is, is a customer-acquisition engine. This needs to be core; wake up every day and think about growth, not just to hit revenue or user KPIs, but to build the company that the best people are clamoring to work at. It&#8217;s not about finding someone sufficient to solve your near-term problems; it&#8217;s about framing problems in a way that&#8217;s so compelling to the most creative, hardest-working people so that they can&#8217;t get it out of their heads. Go for talent moonshots, and figure out how to close them. The rest will fall in line from there.</p>
<p><strong>When should a founder feel comfortable getting help from an outside expert or agency?</strong></p>
<p>Anytime. Agencies are great. They are an extension of your talent, and the best agencies aren&#8217;t selling you — they have to be sold on your problem because they have their pick of companies just like yours. That&#8217;s the agency or outside expert you want to work with, because they&#8217;ll have a priceless perspective from the other best-in-class founders and teams they&#8217;ve worked with that they can bring to your challenge. Any agency can run Facebook ads (it&#8217;s not rocket science), but you want to find the team that&#8217;s solved the gnarliest problems for your hero companies. Then you&#8217;ll get not just an ads manager, but a teacher.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook today <a href="https://www.facebook.com/community/whats-new/new-tools-features-nurture-community/">introduced</a> a new set of tools aimed at helping Facebook Group administrators get a better handle on their online communities and, potentially, help keep conversations from going off the rails. Among the more interesting new tools is a machine-learning-powered feature that alerts admins to potentially unhealthy conversations taking place in their group. Another lets the admin slow down the pace of a heated conversation, by limiting how often group members can post.</p>
<p>Facebook Groups are today a significant reason why people continue to use the social network. Today, there are &#8220;tens of millions&#8221; of groups, that are managed by over 70 million active admins and moderators worldwide, Facebook says.</p>
<p>The company for years has been working to roll out better tools for these group owners, who often get overwhelmed by the administrative responsibilities that come with running an online community at scale. As a result, many admins give up the job and leave groups to run somewhat unmanaged &#8212; thus allowing them to turn into breeding grounds for misinformation, spam and abuse.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook last fall tried to address this problem by rolling out new group policies to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/facebook-tries-to-clean-up-groups-with-new-policies/">crack down on groups without an active admin</a>, among other things. Of course, the company&#8217;s preference would be to keep groups running and growing by making them easier to operate.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where today&#8217;s new set of features come in.</p>
<p>A new dashboard called Admin Home will centralize admin tools, settings and features in one place, as well as present &#8220;pro tips&#8221; that suggest other helpful tools tailored to the group&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167072" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167072" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167072" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="349" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png?resize=768,394 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png?resize=680,349 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png?resize=1536,789 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167072" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Another new Admin Assist feature will allow admins to automatically moderate comments in their groups by setting up criteria that can restrict comments and posts more proactively, instead of forcing admins to go back after the fact and delete them, which can be problematic &#8212; especially after a discussion has been underway and members are invested in the conversation.</p>
<p>For example, admins can now restrict people from posting if they haven&#8217;t had a Facebook account for very long or if they had recently violated the group&#8217;s rules. Admins can also automatically decline posts that contain specific promotional content (perhaps MLM links! Hooray!) and then share feedback with the author of the post automatically about why those posts aren&#8217;t allowed.</p>
<p>Admins can also take advantage of suggested preset criteria from Facebook to help with limiting spam and managing conflict.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167074" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167074" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167074" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167074" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>One notable update is a new moderation alert type dubbed &#8220;conflict alerts.&#8221; This feature, currently in testing, will notify admins when a potentially contentious or unhealthy conversation is taking place in the group, Facebook says. This would allow an admin to quickly take an action &#8212; like turning off comments, limiting who could comment, removing a post, or however else they would want to approach the situation.</p>
<p>Conflict alerts are powered by machine learning, Facebook explains. Its machine-learning model looks at multiple signals, including reply time and comment volume to determine if engagement between users has or might lead to negative interactions, the company says.</p>
<p>This is sort of like an automated expansion on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/community/using-key-groups-tools/how-to-use-keyword-alerts/">Keyword Alerts</a> feature many admins already use to look for certain topics that lead to contentious conversations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167068" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167068" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167068" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg?resize=1536,1408 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167068" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>A related feature, also new, would allow admins to also limit how often specific members could comment, or how often comments could be added to posts admins select.</p>
<p>When enabled, members can leave one comment every five minutes. The idea here is that forcing users to pause and consider their words amid a heated debate could lead to more civilized conversations. We&#8217;ve seen this concept enacted on other social networks, as well &#8212; such as with Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/twitter-retweet-prompt-android/">nudges</a> to read articles before retweeting, or those that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/twitter-rolls-out-improved-reply-prompts-to-cut-down-on-harmful-tweets/">flag potentially harmful replies</a>, giving you a chance to reedit your post.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167067" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167067" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167067" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167067" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Facebook, however, has largely embraced engagement on its platform, even when it&#8217;s not leading to positive interactions or experiences. Though small, this particular feature is an admission that building a healthy online community means sometimes people shouldn&#8217;t be able to immediately react and comment with whatever thought first popped into their head.</p>
<p>Additionally, Facebook is testing tools that allow admins to temporarily limit activity from certain group members.</p>
<p>If used, admins will be able to determine how many posts (between one and nine posts) per day a given member may share, and for how long that limit should be in effect for (every 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days or 28 days). Admins will also be able to determine how many comments (between one and 30 comments, in five-comment increments) per hour a given member may share, and for how long that limit should be in effect (also every 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days or 28 days).</p>
<p>Along these same lines of building healthier communities, a new member summary feature will give admins an overview of each member&#8217;s activity on their group, allowing them to see how many times they&#8217;ve posted and commented, have had posts removed or have been muted.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167070" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167070" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167070" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg?resize=1536,1408 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167070" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Facebook doesn&#8217;t say how admins are to use this new tool, but one could imagine admins taking advantage of the detailed summary to do the occasional cleanup of their member base by removing bad actors who continually disrupt discussions. They could also use it to locate and elevate regular contributors without violations to moderator roles, perhaps.</p>
<p>Admins will also be able to tag their group rules in comment sections, disallow certain post types (e.g., Polls or Events), and submit an appeal to Facebook to re-review decisions related to group violations, if in error.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167075" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167075" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167075" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167075" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Of particular interest, though a bit buried amid the slew of other news, is the return of Chats, which was previously announced.</p>
<p>Facebook had abruptly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/crd5ar/chats_in_facebook_groups_are_going_away_on_22/">removed</a> Chat functionality back in 2019, possibly due to <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/facebook-is-removing-its-group-chats-feature-to-limit-spammers/561141/">spam</a>, some had speculated. (Facebook said it was product infrastructure.) As before, Chats can have up to 250 people, including active members and those who opted into notifications from the chats. Once this limit is reached, other members will not be able to engage with that specific chat room until existing active participants either leave the chat or opt out of notifications.</p>
<p>Now, Facebook group members can start, find and engage in Chats with others within Facebook Groups instead of using Messenger. Admins and moderators can also have their own chats.</p>
<p>Notably, this change follows on the heels of growth from messaging-based social networks, like IRL, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/messaging-social-network-irl-hits-unicorn-status-with-softbank-led-170m-series-c/">new unicorn (due to its $1.17 billion valuation)</a>, as well as the growth seen by other messaging apps, like Telegram, Signal and other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/following-riots-alternative-social-apps-and-private-messengers-top-the-app-stores/">alternative social networks.</a></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167069" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167069" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167069" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png?resize=1536,1408 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167069" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Along with this large set of new features, Facebook also made changes to some existing features, based on feedback from admins.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now testing pinned comments and introduced a new &#8220;admin announcement&#8221; post type that notifies group members of the important news (if notifications are being received for that group).</p>
<p>Plus, admins will be able to share feedback when they decline group members.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167064" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167064" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167064" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png?resize=1536,1408 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167064" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>The changes are rolling out across Facebook Groups globally in the coming weeks.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Few people are more closely tapped into the innovations in the transportation space than investors. We talked to three of them.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few people are more closely tapped into the innovations in the transportation space than investors. They’re paying close attention to what startups and tech companies are doing to develop and commercialize autonomous vehicle technology, electrification, micromobility, robotics and so much more.</p>
<p>Clara Brenner, co-founder and managing partner of Urban Innovation Fund; Quin Garcia, the managing director of AutoTech Ventures; and Rachel Holt, co-founder and general partner of Construct Capital talked (and debated) about how the pandemic affected the venture world and deal flow; why AutoTech Ventures was hesitant to invest in micromobility; on how to incentivize micromobility; and, of course, their take on the rise of mergers with special purpose acquisition companies as a route to going public. They also shared their thoughts on the most overlooked opportunities they are interested in within the transportation space.</p>
<h2>How the COVID-19 pandemic shaped VC</h2>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic turned the world upside down, and VC was no exception. Holt and Garcia explained some of the effects they saw on startups &#8212; both new and existing &#8212; over the past year.</p>
<blockquote><p>Holt: There was enough dislocation in transportation, and in some other areas, that happened through COVID, that it&#8217;s just the time when, whether it&#8217;s buyers or cities or others are just evaluating what the new world order should look like. And I think that just creates a lot of opportunity. … When you have a shock to the system like COVID, it creates just an opportunity for everyone, whether it&#8217;s inside companies, whether it&#8217;s founders, or whether it&#8217;s cities and governments and other entities to take a step back and say, OK, what do we want the next five years to look like? <em><strong>(Timestamp: 4:18, 4:55)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google announced today it&#8217;s updating and expanding its digital safety and citizenship curriculum called <a href="https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us">Be Internet Awesome</a>, which is aimed at helping school-aged children learn to navigate the internet responsibly. First introduced four years ago, the curriculum now reaches 30 countries and millions of kids, says Google. In the update rolling out today, Google has added nearly a dozen more lessons for parents and educators that tackle areas like online gaming, search engines, video consumption, online empathy, cyberbullying and more.</p>
<p>The company says it had commissioned the <a href="http://unh.edu/ccrc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://unh.edu/ccrc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623936185119000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGdzMnl4n6ZRfl2R4-WZwTzJa3OAQ">University of New Hampshire’s Crimes Against Children Research Center</a> to evaluate its existing program, which had last received a significant update back in 2019, when it added lessons that focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/googles-new-media-literacy-program-teaches-kids-how-to-spot-disinformation-and-fake-news/">teaching kids to spot disinformation and fake news.</a></p>
<p>The review found that program did help children in areas like dealing with cyberbullying, online civility and website safety, but recommended improvements in other areas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google then partnered with online safety experts like <a href="https://www.cfchildren.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cfchildren.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623936185119000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEq3vKgqEgHiaBxZ1P7ULu0EcbPbg">Committee for Children</a> and <a href="https://www.guidestar.org/profile/81-1691541" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/81-1691541&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623936185119000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEyPcqvPKReywSd2ACD3cbPLkyoRw">The Net Safety Collaborative</a> to revise its teaching materials. As a result, it now has lessons tailored to specific age groups and grade levels, and has expanded its array of subjects and set of family resources.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="t6w68BUa5v"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/investors-and-companies-are-looking-for-ways-to-entertain-and-protect-your-kids-online/">Investors and startups are seeking ways to entertain and protect kids online</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Investors and startups are seeking ways to entertain and protect kids online&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/investors-and-companies-are-looking-for-ways-to-entertain-and-protect-your-kids-online/embed/#?secret=t6w68BUa5v" data-secret="t6w68BUa5v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new lessons include guidance around online gaming, search engines and video consumption, as well as social-emotional learning lessons aimed at helping students address cyberbullying and online harassment.</p>
<p>For example, some of the new lessons discuss search media literacy &#8212; meaning, learning how to use search engines like Google&#8217;s and evaluating the links and results it returns, as a part of an update to the program&#8217;s existing media literacy materials.</p>
<p>Other lessons address issues like practicing empathy online, showing kindness, as well as what to do when you see something upsetting or inappropriate, including cyberbullying.</p>
<p>Concepts related to online gaming are weaved into the new lessons, too, as, today, kids have a lot of their social interactions in online games which often feature ways to interact with other players in real time and chat.</p>
<p>Here, kids are presented with ideas related to being able to verify an online gamer&#8217;s identity &#8212; are they really another kid, for example? The materials also explain what sort of private information should not be shared with people online.</p>

<p>Among the new family resources, the updated curriculum now points parents to the recently launched online hub, <a href="https://families.google/">families.google</a>, which offers a number of tips and information about tools to help families manage their tech usage.</p>
<p>For example, Google updated its <a href="https://families.google/articles/tips-family-link/">Family Link</a> app that lets parents set controls around which apps can be used and when, and view activity reports on screen-time usage. It also rolled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/youtube-to-launch-parental-control-features-for-families-with-tweens-and-teens/">parental control features on YouTube</a> earlier this year, aimed at families with tweens and teens who are too old for a YouTube Kids account, but still too young for an entirely unsupervised experience.</p>
<p>Google says the updated <a href="http://g.co/beinternetawesome" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://g.co/beinternetawesome&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623936185119000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHflwfbyzkrRbuDIlWbb1Q3DsDdPA">curriculum</a> is available today to parents, families, teachers and educators, via the <a href="https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623945522828000&amp;usg=AFQjCNES0Bn8FdcL_Hz-NPg0TDytKGceiQ">Be Internet Awesome</a> website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Multiple suspects believed to be linked to the Clop <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/are-we-overestimating-the-ransomware-threat/">ransomware</a> gang have been detained in Ukraine after a joint operation from law enforcement agencies in Ukraine, South Korea, and the United States.</p>
<p>The Cyber Police Department of the National Police of Ukraine <a href="https://www.npu.gov.ua/news/kiberzlochini/kiberpolicziya-vikrila-xakerske-ugrupovannya-u-rozpovsyudzhenni-virusu-shifruvalnika-ta-nanesenni-inozemnim-kompaniyam-piv-milyarda-dolariv-zbitkiv/">confirmed</a> that six arrests were made after searches at 21 residences in the capital Kyiv and nearby regions. While it&#8217;s unclear whether the defendants are affiliates or core developers of the ransomware operation, they are accused of running a &#8220;double extortion&#8221; scheme, in which victims who refuse to pay the ransom are threatened with the leak of data stolen from their networks prior to their files being encrypted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was established that six defendants carried out attacks of malicious software such as &#8216;ransomware&#8217; on the servers of American and [South] Korean companies,&#8221; alleged Ukraine&#8217;s national police force in a statement.</p>
<p>The police also seized equipment from the alleged Clop ransomware gang, said to behind total financial damages of about $500 million. This includes computer equipment, several cars — including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/tesla/">Tesla</a> and Mercedes, and 5 million Ukrainian Hryvnia (around $185,000) in cash. The authorities also claim to have successfully shut down the server infrastructure used by the gang members to launch previous attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together, law enforcement has managed to shut down the infrastructure from which the virus spreads and block channels for legalizing criminally acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrencies</a>,&#8221; the statement added.</p>
<p>These attacks first began in February 2019, when the group attacked four Korean companies and encrypted 810 internal services and personal computers. Since, Clop — often styled as &#8220;Cl0p&#8221; — has been linked to a number of high-profile ransomware attacks. These include the breach of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/execupharm-clop-ransomware/">U.S. pharmaceutical giant ExecuPharm</a> in April 2020 and the attack on South Korean e-commerce giant E-Land in November that forced the retailer to close almost half of its stores.</p>
<p>Clop is also linked to the ransomware attack and data breach at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/accellion/">Accellion</a>, which saw hackers exploit flaws in the IT provider’s File Transfer Appliance (FTA) software to steal data from dozens of its customers. Victims of this breach include Singaporean telecom Singtel, law firm Jones Day, grocery store chain Kroger, and cybersecurity firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/qualys/">Qualys</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the dark web portal that Clop uses to share stolen data is still up and running, although it hasn&#8217;t been updated for several weeks. However, law enforcement typically replaces the targets&#8217; website with their own logo in the event of a successful takedown, which suggests that members of the gang could still be active.</p>
<p>“The Cl0p operation has been used to disrupt and extort organizations globally in a variety of sectors including telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, aerospace, and technology,&#8221; said John Hultquist, vice president of analysis at Mandiant&#8217;s threat intelligence unit. &#8220;The actor FIN11 has been strongly associated with this operation, which has included both ransomware and extortion, but it is unclear if the arrests included FIN11 actors or others who may also be associated with the operation.”</p>
<p>Hultquist said the efforts of the Ukrainian police “are a reminder that the country is a strong partner for the U.S. in the fight against cybercrime and authorities there are making the effort to deny criminals a safe harbor.”</p>
<p>The alleged perpetrators face up to eight years in prison on charges of unauthorized interference in the work of computers, automated systems, computer networks, or telecommunications networks and laundering property obtained by criminal means.</p>
<p>News of the arrests comes as international law enforcement turns up the heat on ransomware gangs. Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside">it had seized most of the ransom paid</a> to members of DarkSide by Colonial Pipeline.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives are often thought to be an issue that can be solved by intuition by some segment of the HR team. However, in reality, it needs to come from a data-driven approach that encompasses the entire workforce.</p>
<p>The primary aspect that companies usually look to, in terms of treating employees fairly, is remuneration. However, having the conversation and agreeing on the need for equality doesn’t mean it will be achieved on an organizational scale.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Particular attention should be paid to addressing inequities in the areas of attracting and hiring candidates, integration, performance assessment, compensation and promotion.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.mercer.us/our-thinking/next-generation-global-research-when-women-thrive-2020.html">survey from Mercer</a> that included data from more than 1,000 companies in 54 countries, 81% agreed that it was important to have a plan for advancing gender equality, but just 42% actually had one in place. This points toward a tokenism attitude indicating companies are happy to talk around the issue without addressing it directly.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that women make up roughly half of all college-educated workers in the United States, they are underrepresented in positions of power &#8212; just <a href="https://www.holoniq.com/notes/women-ceos-leaders.-the-global-state-of-play.-2021/">8% of Fortune 500 companies</a> are led by women, and, incredibly, just 1% by women of color. Furthermore, the last U.S. census revealed that women who are employed full time are paid on average <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-wage-pay-gap-charts-2017-3?r=US&amp;IR=T#men-have-earned-more-than-women-since-1979-the-first-year-with-available-data-1">17% less than men</a>.</p>
<p>While there have been steps to ensure equal pay, such as Canada’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/news/2018/10/government-of-canada-introduces-historic-proactive-pay-equity-legislation.html">Pay Equity Act</a>, which states that men and women in the public sector should be paid equally, it does not cover the private sector. Given that the Institute for Women’s Policy Research <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-wage-pay-gap-charts-2017-3?r=US&amp;IR=T#men-have-earned-more-than-women-since-1979-the-first-year-with-available-data-1">estimates</a> that equal pay will not be reached until 2059, there is still plenty of work to be done.</p>
<p>Particular attention should be paid to addressing inequities in the areas of attracting and hiring candidates, integration, performance assessment, compensation and promotion. Companies need to think about initiatives that are supported by objective tools to drive progress, identify problems and strategize solutions. This is where data can be a great tool to provide insight into DEI: by highlighting shortcomings and areas where there is bias.</p>
<h2>Start with data collection</h2>
<p>The first step is to create a data set so that tangible metrics can be utilized and turned into actionable decisions. To do this, diversity and inclusion officers need to be given the opportunity to weed out bias.</p>
<p>Obviously, the data would drive decisions on areas such as compensation. But far too often, director-level discussions don’t involve the talent acquisition team. To eradicate the pay gap and ensure compensation is equalized on individual merit, this needs to change. Line managers and talent acquisition teams have the best knowledge of their staff and are well placed to procure the right information to help senior managers make equitable decisions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors Co. has yet again upped the amount it says it will spend on electric and autonomous vehicle investments, saying Wednesday that it would spend $35 billion through 2025 &#8212; an $8 billion increase from its previous plan announced in November 2020.</p>
<p>The company has set a target to bring 30 new EVs to the global market by 2025 and to transition to all-zero-emission by 2035. With the new investment, GM said it will add new electric commercial trucks to its North American plan, as well as build additional U.S. assembly capacity for electric SUVs.</p>
<p>Beyond building out a large portfolio of new electric models, the automaker has taken a multipronged approach in its quest to lead the EV revolution: it is also investing in two new battery cell plants under its joint venture with LG Chem, dubbed Ultium Cells LLC; and it’s poured funding into Cruise, its autonomous driving arm that it purchased for majority ownership in 2016.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The news was announced one day after Cruise said it had tapped a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cruise-secures-5b-credit-line-to-buy-electric-autonomous-cruise-origin-vehicles-from-gm/">$5 billion line of credit</a> from the OEM’s financial arm as it prepares for commercialization of its Origin electric and autonomous vehicle. Commercial production of the Origin is anticipated to begin in 2023.</p>

<p>GM also manufactures hydrogen fuel cells under its HYDROTEC joint initiative with Honda. It confirmed Wednesday that it will launch the third-generation HYDROTEC cells by mid-decade. The automaker has partnership agreements with heavy truck developer Navistar and Liebherr-Aerospace, which is developing hydrogen fuel cell power systems for aircraft.</p>
<p>The company also said yesterday it would supply fuel cells and EV batteries to Wabtec Corporation, a Pittsburgh-based company developing the world’s first battery locomotive.</p>
<p>“GM is targeting annual global EV sales of more than 1 million by 2025, and we are increasing our investment to scale faster because we see momentum building in the United States for electrification, along with customer demand for our product portfolio,” CEO Mary Barra said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ford announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">similar increase in EV investment</a> last month, when it said it would invest $30 billion by 2025, up from $22 billion by 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hbcu.vc/">HBCUvc</a>, a nonprofit organization that wants<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/18/hbcu-vc-trains-students-become-venture-capitalists/"> to diversify the world of venture</a> by rooting itself in historically Black colleges and universities, nearly shut down last year. Founder <a href="https://twitter.com/hadiyahdotme?lang=en">Hadiyah Mujhid</a> met with her team, an entirely Black and Latinx staff, and warned them that they only had two months left before she would have to shut down the three-year operation.</p>
<p>One week after that conversation, George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, was murdered by police in Minneapolis. His death prompted global Black Lives Matter protests and a nationwide reckoning with racism. In tech, it led to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/"> a rush of venture firms publicly pledging</a> to back more Black founders, trying to make up for a history of inequality in allocation of dollars.</p>
<p>The wave of support resulted in HBCUvc landing its biggest one-day unsolicited donation that it ever saw, $40,000. In the year since, the nonprofit was able to double its budget and team, and tripled its impact by launching programs in Baltimore, Alabama and Chicago.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="P5txmXTARc"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/">Venture firms rush to find ways to support Black founders and investors</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Venture firms rush to find ways to support Black founders and investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/embed/#?secret=P5txmXTARc" data-secret="P5txmXTARc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And now, HBCUvc has raised a debut capital arm that will invest non-dilutive capital in Black, Indigenous and Latinx early-stage entrepreneurs. The $1 million fund was raised from a group of philanthropic investors, including the Mark Cuban Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and Google for Startups.</p>
<p>“It’s a very weird feeling to know that all of this, and the impetus for all this was because off unjustly murder,” Mujhid says, about one year later. “It sounds cold, but [my advisors] say that sometimes it takes a tragedy to spark a shift in how we think and do things. And so [I’m] recognizing this as an extra opportunity to shift the industry.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166902" style="width: 842px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166902" loading="lazy" class="breakout  wp-image-2166902" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg" alt="" width="832" height="555" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg 5184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166902" class="wp-caption-text">HBCUvc staff.

<h2><strong>Teaching capital </strong></h2>
<p>The investment vehicle, dubbed the Venture Capital Lab Fund, is different from a traditional venture capital fund. Because it offers non-dilutive financing, HBCUvc does not take equity from a startup in which it invests. The checks aren’t donations either, Mujhid said. The teaching capital goes to for-profit entrepreneurs and the nonprofit does not get a tax write-off for it.</p>
<p>Instead, Mujhid thinks the best way to describe the Venture Capital Lab Fund is “teaching capital.” Similar to how teaching hospitals give aspiring doctors a way to practice and learn their craft before formally entering the field, the fund wants to do that for aspiring investors.</p>
<p>The fund will give HBCUvc&#8217;s some 230 venture fellows, all from underrepresented backgrounds, check-writing experience. Fellows are invited to identify an entrepreneur, write an investment memo and submit to the HBCUvc investment committee, a board of partners as well as alumni community members.</p>
<p>“This is an opportunity to give as many of our fellows who go through our program an opportunity to work to develop a track record right now,” she said.</p>
<p>While the fund has no specific number of checks that it plans to write, around half the capital will be allocated to founders who are tied to historically Black colleges and universities.</p>
<p>“Entrepreneurs that we see within our community are kind of eager to accept funding and sometimes they&#8217;re going into deals too early, and sometimes they&#8217;re taking funding and giving up equity way too soon,” Mujhid said. “This could be an opportunity to take funding, without giving away equity.”</p>
<p>The checks are meant to replace the “angel round” with an average size of $5,000 for student founders, and $10,000 for nonstudent founders.</p>
<p>A wave of new investment vehicles for Black and underrepresented founders has been growing in recent weeks. Google for Startups <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleStartups/status/1405151042606673922?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">announced</a> today that it is launching a $5 million Black Founders fund that will offer $100,000 in non-dilutive funding to 50 Black founders from within its program and community. Last week, Screendoor <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/06/09/screendoor-raises-50-million-to-back-underrepresented-vcs/?sh=43bfbbc92ba1">launched</a> as a $50 million fund-of-funds to back underrepresented, emerging investors. And last month, Collab Capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/collab-capital-closes-50-million-debut-fund-for-black-founders/">closed its $50 million debut fund that</a> will be invested solely in Black founders.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Collab Capital closes $50 million debut fund to back Black founders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/collab-capital-closes-50-million-debut-fund-for-black-founders/embed/#?secret=McAWnqTj0l" data-secret="McAWnqTj0l" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“There are a lot of organizations right now that are starting funds [with] the primary goal of supporting founders,” Mujhid said. “And that’s a goal of ours, but we’re hoping to have a ripple effect of training and really providing onramps for the next best in-class investors&#8230;and in order to do that, they have to have a training vehicle.”</p>
<p>One unexpected challenge to that progress, she says, is the return to in-person work as the pandemic fades away.</p>
<h2><strong>In-person is out </strong></h2>
<p>“When we were working with partners pre-COVID, investors would say that [they] need someone who&#8217;s based in San Francisco,” she said. “And we’d say, good luck because most of our demographic isn’t really here.” In contrast, going online opened up programming for the nonprofit because it removed geographic barriers. It recently onboarded its largest intern class to date: 45 interns working at 40 venture capital firms across America.</p>
<p>Now, as firms open back up, she’s worried about the recreation of geographic barriers, and if they will negatively affect opportunities for underrepresented folks who want to get experience in the industry. The nonprofit has begun advocacy work on educating tech professionals on how racial barriers intertwine with geographic barriers. Part of HBCUvc’s push will be around asking companies to rethink their policies as they open up, specifically by holding true to their commitment of diversity.</p>
<p>Despite this, remote work came with its own equity issues. Funding for female founders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/funding-for-female-founders-falls-to-2017-levels-as-pandemic-shakes-up-the-vc-market/">dropped to 2017 levels</a> as many check-writers turned to existent, largely male and white, networks while investing remotely. <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/highlighting-notable-funding-to-black-founders-in-2020/">According to Crunchbase data</a>, U.S. companies raised nearly $150 billion in venture capital, and of that, less than 1% ($1 billion) went to African-American or Black startup founders.</p>

<p>And the pledges that investors made? While HBCUvc was able to “shift the trajectory of its programming” thanks to an outpour of support, Mujhid thinks that a lot of the initial buzz around backing Black founders was “unfortunately, a knee-jerk reaction.”</p>
<p>“I was seeing our name everywhere,” she said, describing the series of memos and tweets that firms began putting out to show their commitment to diversity. Half the mentions came from people that HBCUvc had never talked to before. “You are riding this tragedy out and you are trading on our name unethically,” she said. Some of the interest turned into partnerships, some of it didn’t.</p>
<p>As they built out new programs based on an increased budget, a concern of Mujhid’s, then and now, was what it looks like if people shift priorities, or fall off their commitments. But for now, she feels like they are riding a fortunate wave, one that has the potential to make Black founders and investors a sturdy part of tech’s dollars and deals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Joining us onstage as a judge for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>&#8216;s Startup Battlefield will be Yasmin Razavi, general partner at Spark Capital. Her engineering background and fintech chops should make for incisive questions for the founders presenting.</p>
<p>Razavi invests in growth-stage enterprise, fintech and developer companies, but her background is until fairly recently an engineering-focused one. She grew up in Tehran, studied engineering at the University of Toronto and got her MBA at Harvard Business School.</p>
<p>A stint at McKinsey eventually led to being a product manager at Snap, where she built the tech behind the app&#8217;s monetization stack. In 2017 she joined Spark, and since then has led investments in Marqueta, Deel, Rapyd, Niantic, Capitolis and Earnin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We recently had Razavi at Disrupt as a panelist, and of course if you&#8217;re an Extra Crunch subscriber you can watch the whole thing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/getting-to-the-growth-stage/">here</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YhAp465ZP6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/getting-to-the-growth-stage/">Getting to the Growth Stage</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Getting to the Growth Stage&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/video/getting-to-the-growth-stage/embed/#?secret=YhAp465ZP6" data-secret="YhAp465ZP6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ultimately anyone who wants to be a shareholder or investor in your business wants to understand the unit economics of your business,&#8221; she said during the  panel. &#8220;For me, there’s all sorts of fancy metrics being thrown around; ultimately they all come down to what is the unit economics, and what is the payback I can expect when I invest in growth?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Razavi&#8217;s philosophy is go to market and out-execute the competition, then capitalize on that success. Why anyone would want to do the opposite is hard to say, but the point is to move quickly and decisively as early as possible so that making money later is a natural consequence rather than a scramble.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">For contemporary artists, attaching work to the blockchain in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT) may seem like a secure and verifiable way to sell art online.</p>
<p>In some ways, it is. Blockchain inherently records time-stamped data on all transactions, with a permanent indication of ownership across a distributed ledger. A look inside a blockchain’s transactions will provide all the information needed about when an NFT was traded, who was involved in the transaction and how much was spent.</p>
<p>But the reality of NFT ownership is much more complicated than one might imagine. As a new crypto asset class, NFTs appear to exist almost unbound by current regulatory systems. But when combined with art, there are overlaps to consider. Understanding the legal pitfalls of the contemporary NFT ecosystem is the first step in unlocking its potential.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Does copyright exist on the blockchain?</h2>
<p>High hopes abound for the potential of NFTs to serve as copyright alternatives, with many believing them to be copyrights themselves. When viewed at face value, it’s easy to understand the confusion.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The NFT purchaser owns nothing more than a unique hash on the blockchain with a transactional record and a hyperlink to the file of the artwork.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The truth is, NFTs are just tokens that represent an asset, completely separate from the assets themselves. Because every NFT represents a unique asset, a single NFT can’t be duplicated while maintaining the same value as the original. Many equate this exclusive form of ownership with ownership of the work itself, but the distinction must be emphasized.</p>
<p>This misconception goes further. The range of possibilities for what can be an NFT coincides surprisingly well with works eligible for copyright. While every jurisdiction defines “works” in different ways, none stray too far from the essentials. In Canada, for example, <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/h_wr02281.html">copyright</a> protection extends to literary, artistic, dramatic or musical works in addition to performances, recordings and other related works. Creators need not apply for these protections — the state provides them <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/h_wr02281.html">inherently</a> upon the creation of the work.</p>
<p>Naturally, this protection is guaranteed for the original work that an NFT represents. When artwork is created and auctioned on an NFT marketplace, the copyright functions almost exactly as it would in an in-person scenario, with the copyright retained by the artist. But a lack of copyright trading infrastructure that complies with international law makes the exchange of NFT copyrights impossible on current platforms.</p>
<p>So unless an external agreement is made between the artist and the buyer, the bundle of copyrights to an NFT still belong to the original artist. The NFT purchaser owns nothing more than a unique hash on the blockchain with a transactional record and a hyperlink to the file of the artwork.</p>
<h2>Without legal parameters, fraud is inevitable</h2>
<p>The issue of NFT copyright tracking gets even trickier when considering the potential for theft and fraud. In order to be added to the blockchain, NFTs must be “signed” by the uploader in a process known as “minting.” Similar to a painter&#8217;s signature on their painting, this feature is intended to link the NFT to its creator. Things can go wrong when minters lie about their identity, which is <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-03-16/nfts-artists-report-their-work-is-being-stolen-and-sold/13249408">not uncommon</a> across many NFT platforms.</p>
<p>The issue stems from the lack of a strong legal framework in the NFT market. One can mint a tweet, art piece or even a <a href="https://news.artnet.com/market/nyan-cat-nft-sells-for-560000-1945679">gif of Nyan Cat</a> without being the actual creator on some platforms. As a result, many artists have reported seeing their art being <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-03-16/nfts-artists-report-their-work-is-being-stolen-and-sold/13249408#:~:text=Many%20artists%20around%20the%20world,work%20posted%20on%20social%20media.">stolen and sold</a> in NFT form without their consent in what would clearly be a copyright violation in the traditional art marketplace.</p>
<p>This issue is particularly pervasive among NFT tweet exchanges. A Twitter bot known as @tokenizedtweets went on a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-03-16/nfts-artists-report-their-work-is-being-stolen-and-sold/13249408">minting spree</a> earlier this year, sending shockwaves throughout Twitter and the NFT community. Its policy of creating NFTs from viral tweets without the author’s consent or even notification caused an outcry from several actors, artists and other creators, provoking responses from names as big as <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamShatner/status/1368645203045720064">William Shatner</a>, who expressed concern about “these @tokenizedtweets stealing content, images I upload and my tweets which are all under my copyright being tokenized and sold without permission.”</p>
<p>Theft and fraud are natural results of platforms that lack a strong legal infrastructure. The actions of @tokenizedtweets, now banned from Twitter, demonstrates this issue well.</p>

<h2>What’s missing? International compliance</h2>
<p>So far, no NFT platforms have ventured into internationally compliant territory for the copyright of art that an NFT sale represents. Doing so would be a tremendous leap for the NFT ecosystem. In addition to minimizing fraud through stronger copyright enforcement, international compliance would allow for tokenized copyright exchange within the blockchain itself.</p>
<p>The groundwork has already been laid thanks to the 1886 <a href="https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/">Berne Convention</a>, an international agreement that guarantees standardized copyright protection at the moment a work is created in any of its 179 signatory countries. The treaty was tested in 2014, for example, when Tom Petty sued Sam Smith for copyright infringement over Smith’s hit song, “Stay With Me,” which is almost melodically identical to Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down.” The suit and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/01/26/sam-smith-stay-with-me-tom-petty-i-wont-back-down/22346051/">settlement</a>, which includes royalties to Petty’s estate, demonstrated the continuing functionality of the Berne Convention.</p>
<p>The 1996 <a href="https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/wct/">WIPO Copyright Treaty</a> formally brought Berne principles into the digital art realm, but many Berne Convention signatories didn’t sign it. With no new treaties on the horizon, the private sector may have to pick up the slack left behind by world governments.</p>
<p>The NFT world still fails to comply with the diversity of copyright law around the world despite the uniformity imposed by international treaties. To move the industry away from speculation and into global functionality, international copyright compliance must be incorporated into this emerging ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My co-founders and I launched a software startup in Iran a few years ago, and I’m happy to say it’s now thriving. We’d like to expand our company in California. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Now that President Joe Biden has eliminated the Muslim ban, is it possible to do that? Is the pandemic still standing in the way? Do you have any suggestions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Talented in Tehran</strong></p>
<p>Dear Talented,</p>
<p>Yes, it’s possible! Unfortunately, yes, the COVID-19 pandemic is still making the immigration process a bit challenging, but remember, where there’s a will, there’s most often, in immigration law, a way.</p>
<p>On his first day in office in January, Biden rescinded the ban on visas for many majority-Muslim countries, including Iran. The ban had been in place since 2017 and nearly 42,000 visa applications were denied, according to the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/presidentialproclamation/PP-9645_Montly-Public-Reporting-January%202021.pdf">U.S. Department of State</a>.</p>
<p>Biden also allowed the bans on the issuance of H-1B, L-1, and J-1 visas and green cards at U.S. embassies and consulates that the previous administration put in place last year to lapse.</p>
<p>That means international startup founders like you and other international talent living outside the United States can start thinking about obtaining these visas and green cards without necessarily requiring exceptions to do so. In a recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/075-latest-biden-immigration-updates/">podcast episode</a>, I talked about these and other immigration-related changes, as well as those promised by the Biden administration. Take a listen to find out more!</p>
<p>As you probably know, most travelers from Iran are currently not allowed entry into the U.S. because of the COVID-19 travel ban, and most U.S. embassies and consulates are not open for routine visa and green card application processing. Because the United States has not had an embassy or consulate in Iran since the Iran hostage crisis of 1979, you and your co-founders should find out which U.S. embassies or consulates are currently processing routine visa and green card applications — and are in countries that are not on the suspended entry list — and apply there. We’re still waiting for detailed information from the State Department on the equivalent of reparations for individuals who were affected by the Muslim ban.</p>
<p>In addition, I recommend that you consult with an experienced immigration attorney who can help you devise an immigration strategy for yourself, your co-founders and your families based on your personal and professional goals. Now, here are a few options for you to consider.</p>
