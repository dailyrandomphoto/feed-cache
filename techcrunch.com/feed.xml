										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Product-led growth is all the rage in the Valley these days, and we had two leading thinkers discuss how to incorporate it into a startup at TechCrunch Early Stage 2021. Tope Awotona is the CEO and founder of Calendly, which bootstrapped for much of its existence <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">before raising $350 million at a $3 billion valuation from OpenView and Iconiq</a>. And on the other side of that table and this interview sat Blake Bartlett, a partner at OpenView who has been leading enterprise deals based around the principles of efficient growth.</p>
<p>In this interview, the two talk about bootstrapping and product-led growth, expanding internationally, when to bootstrap and when to fundraise, and how VCs approach a profitable company (carefully, and with a big stick). Oh, and how to spend $350 million.</p>
<p><i>Quotes have been edited and condensed for quality.</i></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="Bootstrapping is directly tied to product-led growth">Bootstrapping is directly tied to product-led growth</h2>
<p>Product-led growth is all about efficiency — spending all of a startup’s capital and time on perfecting its product to capture new users and help the most fervent customers advocate for the product with others or perhaps the managers approving their expenses. That’s directly related to bootstrapping, since by evading VC investment, a startup has to be much more tied to customers in the first place</p>
<p><b>Tope Awotona:</b></p>
<blockquote><p>With no marketing at all, Calendly begin to take off. So the initial users were in higher education, and very quickly we moved to the commercial sector. And all of that was because of the virality of the product. Seeing that, we just began to invest more into virality. So the combination of self serve, which is incredibly capital efficient, because you don&#8217;t need all of these sales people, and also the virality, instead of spending a bunch of dollars on advertising, you can really rely on the virality of the product and rely on the network of the users to really propagate and to enable distribution, just those are the two things that really allowed us to be successful. <b>(Timestamp: 7:49)</b></p></blockquote>
<p>We later discussed how the extreme focus on users can drive efficiency through product-led growth.</p>
<p><b>Blake Bartlett:</b></p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s the product and the distribution model, and they need to be tightly aligned. Tope spoke to some of this but I think first and foremost, even outside of metrics, it&#8217;s just how is the business built? And on the product front, the product is built, the jobs to be done so to speak, are oriented towards the actual user of the product, not their boss. SaaS historically was built for the boss because the boss owns the the budget for that department. So if you&#8217;re building a sales tool, build for the VP of Sales, and then hopefully the AEs will, you know, go along with it. But now with product-led growth, you&#8217;re actually building for that user. … Eventually, you can build the things on top that the boss cares about like the admin panel, and the KPIs and all that kind of stuff. <b>(Timestamp: 29:35)</b></p></blockquote>

[&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coronavirus pandemic has increased our collective screen time, and that&#8217;s particularly true on mobile devices. According to a new <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/q1-2021-market-index">report</a> from mobile data and analytics firm App Annie, global consumers are now spending an average of 4.2 hours per day using apps on our smartphones, an increase of 30% from just two years prior. In some markets, the average is even higher &#8212; more than five hours.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2021, the daily time spent in apps surpassed four hours in the U.S., Turkey, Mexico and India for the first time, the report notes. Of those, India saw the biggest jump as consumers there spent 80% more time in smartphone apps in the Q1 2021 versus the first quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective in the American market, Nielsen had last year reported <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/report/2020/the-nielsen-total-audience-report-august-2020/">consumers were spending</a> around 4 and half hours watching live or time-shifted TV, but only 3 hours, 46 minutes using smartphone apps.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2136078" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2136078" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2136078" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image001-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image001-1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image001-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image001-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image001-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image001-1.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image001-1.png?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image001-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2136078" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>However, we should point out that Nielsen and App Annie&#8217;s analysis can&#8217;t necessarily be compared directly, because App Annie only measured time spent on Android devices &#8212; and many Americans use iPhones. Nielsen, meanwhile, relies on panels to achieve a representative sampling. Nevertheless, the broad strokes here are that mobile apps seem to be a more popular means of entertainment than the good ol&#8217; American pastime of watching TV.</p>
<p>The new report also notes that three markets &#8212; Brazil, South Korea, and Indonesia &#8212; saw the average daily time spent in apps jump to over five hours this past quarter.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to determine which apps are driving these changes as the most downloaded apps tend to remain the same quarter after quarter. The top charts are dominated by the usual names like TikTok, YouTube and Facebook, for example. That&#8217;s why App Annie now tracks what it calls &#8220;breakout apps,&#8221; which are those that saw spikes in quarter-over-quarter downloads across both iOS and Android.</p>

<p>In Q1 2021, Western markets saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/following-riots-alternative-social-apps-and-private-messengers-top-the-app-stores/">a sharp rise in secure messaging apps</a>, Signal and Telegram. Signal, for instance, placed first in the U.K., Germany, and France, and fourth in the U.S. as a &#8220;breakout app&#8221; for the quarter. Telegram was No. 9 in the U.K. No. 5 in France, and No. 7 in the U.S.</p>
<p>Investment and trading apps were also popular in the quarter, with Coinbase&#8217;s crypto app at No. 6 in the U.S. and U.K. on this list, while Binance was No. 7 in France. Crypto trading app Upbit, meanwhile, was No. 1 in South Korea. The payment app, PayPay was the No. 1 breakout app in Japan. And Robinhood was No. 2 in the U.S.</p>
<p>Clubhouse also made a showing on the &#8220;breakout&#8221; charts, as it gained ground in non-U.S. markets like Germany and Japan, where it ranked No. 4 and No. 3, respectively.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s breakout chart was different, with a focus on video apps like TikTok, Kwai, CapCut and iQIYI.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2136079" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2136079" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2136079" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="393" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png?resize=768,444 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png?resize=680,393 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png?resize=1536,888 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2136079" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s influence on games was also apparent in the quarter. The game High Heels from Istanbul-based Rollic (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/zynga-completes-rollic-acquistion/">now owned by Zynga</a>), was heavily advertised on TikTok, sending the title to No. 1 in the U.S. and U.K.&#8217;s &#8220;breakout&#8221; games charts, as well as No. 3 in China, No. 7 in Germany, and No. 6 in Russia.</p>
<p>Other hyper-casual games did well, too, including Project Makeover, DOP 2: Delete One Part, and Phone Case DIY.</p>
<p>Crash Bandicoot: On the Run also broke out in the quarter. Despite launching on March 25, the game saw 21 million downloads in four days, becoming the top breakout app in Germany, No. 2 in the U.S., No. 3 in the U.K, and No. 9 in France.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/spinning-out-from-the-cryptocurrency-hardware-developer-bitfury-liquidstack-pitches-a-data-center-cooling-tech/">LiquidStack does it</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/submer-is-dunking-servers-in-goo-to-save-the-planet/">So does Submer</a>. They&#8217;re both dropping servers carrying sensitive data into goop in an effort to save the planet. Now they&#8217;re joined by one of the biggest tech companies in the world in their efforts to improve the energy efficiency of data centers, because Microsoft is getting into the liquid-immersion cooling market.</p>
<p>Microsoft is using a liquid it developed in-house that&#8217;s engineered to boil at 122 degrees Fahrenheit (lower than the boiling point of water) to act as a heat sink, reducing the temperature inside the servers so they can operate at full power without any risks from overheating.</p>
<p>The vapor from the boiling fluid is converted back into a liquid through contact with a cooled condenser in the lid of the tank that stores the servers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are the first cloud provider that is running two-phase immersion cooling in a production environment,” said Husam Alissa, a principal hardware engineer on Microsoft’s team for datacenter advanced development in Redmond, Washington, in a statement on the company&#8217;s internal blog. </span></p>
<p>While that claim may be true, liquid cooling is a well-known approach to dealing with moving heat around to keep systems working. Cars use liquid cooling to keep their motors humming as they head out on the highway.</p>
<p>As technology companies confront the physical limits of Moore&#8217;s Law, the demand for faster, higher performance processors mean designing new architectures that can handle more power, the company wrote in a blog post. Power flowing through central processing units has increased from 150 watts to more than 300 watts per chip and the GPUs responsible for much of Bitcoin mining, artificial intelligence applications and high end graphics each consume more than 700 watts per chip.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Microsoft isn&#8217;t the first tech company to apply liquid cooling to data centers and the distinction that the company uses of being the first &#8220;cloud provider&#8221; is doing a lot of work. That&#8217;s because bitcoin mining operations have been using the tech for years. Indeed, LiquidStack was spun out from a bitcoin miner to commercialize its liquid immersion cooling tech and bring it to the masses.</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Air cooling is not enough&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>More power flowing through the processors means hotter chips, which means the need for better cooling or the chips will malfunction.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Air cooling is not enough,” said Christian Belady, vice president of Microsoft’s datacenter advanced development group in Redmond, in an interview for the company&#8217;s internal blog. “That’s what’s driving us to immersion cooling, where we can directly boil off the surfaces of the chip.”</span></p>
<p>For Belady, the use of liquid cooling technology brings the density and compression of Moore&#8217;s Law up to the datacenter level</p>
<p>The results, from an energy consumption perspective, are impressive. The company found that using two-phase immersion cooling reduced power consumption for a server by anywhere from 5 percent to 15 percent (every little bit helps).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft investigated liquid immersion as a cooling solution for high performance computing applications such as AI. Among other things, the investigation revealed that two-phase immersion cooling reduced power consumption for any given server by 5% to 15%. </span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, companies like Submer claim they reduce energy consumption by 50%, water use by 99%, and take up 85% less space.</p>

<p>For cloud computing companies, the ability to keep these servers up and running even during spikes in demand, when they&#8217;d consume even more power, adds flexibility and ensures uptime even when servers are overtaxed, according to Microsoft.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[We] know that with Teams when you get to 1 o’clock or 2 o’clock, there is a huge spike because people are joining meetings at the same time,” Marcus Fontoura, a vice president on Microsoft&#8217;s Azure team, said on the company&#8217;s internal blog. “Immersion cooling gives us more flexibility to deal with these burst-y workloads.”</span></p>
<p>At this point, data centers are a critical component of the internet infrastructure that much of the world relies on for&#8230; well&#8230; pretty much every tech-enabled service. That reliance however has come at a significant environmental cost.</p>
<p>“Data centers power human advancement. Their role as a core infrastructure has become more apparent than ever and emerging technologies such as AI and IoT will continue to drive computing needs. However, the environmental footprint of the industry is growing at an alarming rate,” Alexander Danielsson, an investment manager at Norrsken VC noted last year when discussing that firm&#8217;s investment in Submer.</p>
<h2><strong>Solutions under the sea</strong></h2>
<p>If submerging servers in experimental liquids offers one potential solution to the problem &#8212; then sinking them in the ocean is another way that companies are trying to cool data centers without expending too much power.</p>
<p>Microsoft has already been operating an undersea data center for the past two years. The company actually trotted out the tech as part of a push from the tech company to aid in the search for a COVID-19 vaccine last year.</p>

<p>These pre-packed, shipping container-sized data centers can be spun up on demand and run deep under the ocean’s surface for sustainable, high-efficiency and powerful compute operations, the company said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The liquid cooling project shares most similarity with </span><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/project-natick-underwater-datacenter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft’s Project Natick</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is exploring the potential of underwater datacenters that are quick to deploy and can operate for years on the seabed sealed inside submarine-like tubes without any onsite maintenance by people. </span></p>
<p>In those data centers nitrogen air replaces an engineered fluid and the servers are cooled with fans and a heat exchanger that pumps seawater through a sealed tube.</p>
<p>Startups are also staking claims to cool data centers out on the ocean (the seaweed is always greener in somebody else&#8217;s lake).</p>
<p>Nautilus Data Technologies, for instance, has raised over $100 million (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nautilus-data-technologies">according to Crunchbase</a>) to develop data centers dotting the surface of Davey Jones&#8217; Locker. The company <a href="https://www.nautilusdt.com/copy-of-pr-october-10th-2017-1">is currently developing a data center project</a> co-located with a sustainable energy project in a tributary near Stockton, Calif.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">With the double-immersion cooling tech Microsoft is hoping to bring the benefits of ocean-cooling tech onto the shore. “We brought the sea to the servers rather than put the datacenter under the sea,” Microsoft&#8217;s Alissa said in a company statement.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Here at TechCrunch, we spend most of our time talking to founders. Investors probably come a close second, but it&#8217;s definitely founders at the top of the list. That comes through in our articles and our events, but even with all we do there, it only begins to scratch the surface on the many, many interesting stories that are out there to tell.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re excited to bring you <a href="https://apple.com/found">Found</a>, a new weekly podcast from TechCrunch that&#8217;s all about founders, and the stories behind the startups. Each episode features an interview with a different early stage founder, with myself and TechCrunch Managing Editor Jordan Crook as hosts.</p>
<p>These aren&#8217;t your typical startup founder conversations or pitches — they&#8217;re open, honest talks about what it&#8217;s really like to found a company, and why you&#8217;d want to do that to begin with. We hear from founders about what motivated them to try to tackle big problems and put their financial success at risk, and about what they&#8217;ve had to overcome along the way to make their startup dreams a reality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In our first batch of episodes, you&#8217;ll hear about an epiphany at the top of a literal mountain; going from teenage homelessness to running an artificial intelligence company; capping a medical degree with a world-class business education to assemble a unique toolkit for entrepreneurship; and finding inspiration for a world-changing business essentially gathering dust in NASA&#8217;s laboratories.</p>
<p>Found is about all of the above, but it&#8217;s also about hearing real stories from real founders all around the world about how they managed to pull off things like raising venture capital, pivoting their businesses, and building a team from nothing.</p>
<p>Our first episode debuts tomorrow — Friday, April 9 — but you can subscribe in <a href="http://apple.co/found">Apple Podcasts</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=WaeqHnqAQG-JZm3I1SmhCw">Spotify</a> (or wherever you find your podcasts) right now to listen to the trailer, and get the premiere when it&#8217;s available. New episodes will be released weekly after that on Friday afternoons.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re love the conversations we&#8217;ve had so far on Found, and we think you will, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.realworldplaybook.com">Realworld</a> has a big vision — founder and CEO Genevieve Ryan Bellaire told me her goal is &#8220;simplifying adulthood.&#8221; And the New York startup has raised $3.4 million in seed funding to make it happen.</p>
<p>Apparently that&#8217;s something Ballaire struggled with herself in her early twenties. Despite being a lawyer with an MBA, she said she found herself &#8220;just totally unprepared for all these real world things,&#8221; whether that was figuring out housing or heath insurance — something I (a non-lawyer, non-MBA) can definitely relate to.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s tons of content out there out there that can tell you to fill out this form to sign up for a credit card, but you don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s not one place that defines adulthood.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the same time, there are online services that can make aspects of adulthood easier — whether that&#8217;s Lemonade for insurance, Betterment for investing or Zocdoc for doctor&#8217;s appointments. But again, finding these services and just knowing that you should use them can be a challenge, so Bellaire said Realworld is meant to serve as the &#8220;single point of entry.&#8221;</p>
<p>To do that, the startup has created more than 90 step-by-step playbooks, covering everything from budgeting to moving to salary negotiation. Bellaire said these are designed for members of Gen Z who are just leaving college and entering the workforce.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2136040" style="width: 493px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2136040" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2136040" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Genevieve-Ryan-Bellaire.jpg?w=483" alt="Realworld CEO Genevieve Ryan Bellaire" width="483" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Genevieve-Ryan-Bellaire.jpg 2245w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Genevieve-Ryan-Bellaire.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Genevieve-Ryan-Bellaire.jpg?resize=213,300 213w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Genevieve-Ryan-Bellaire.jpg?resize=768,1080 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Genevieve-Ryan-Bellaire.jpg?resize=483,680 483w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Genevieve-Ryan-Bellaire.jpg?resize=1092,1536 1092w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Genevieve-Ryan-Bellaire.jpg?resize=1456,2048 1456w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Genevieve-Ryan-Bellaire.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2136040" class="wp-caption-text">Realworld CEO Genevieve Ryan Bellaire</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, even if you focus on a specific age group, different twentysomethings will have different backgrounds, income levels and challenges. Bellaire said the playbooks will customize their instructions based on a user&#8217;s specific goals and circumstances, but she also argued that Realworld&#8217;s &#8220;starter pack&#8221; of 15 playbooks covers things that every adult will need to deal with in some form, such as creating budgets, finding an apartment and understanding income taxes.</p>
<p>The startup plans to release its first mobile app next month, and its goal is to become what Bellaire described as a &#8220;platform, marketplace and community.&#8221; The playbooks are a big piece of the platform, and eventually, Realworld could also include a marketplace for services that will help you accomplish those adulthood goals, as well as a community where users share their knowledge and advice.</p>
<p>Realworld initially charged for access to its playbooks, but they&#8217;re now available for free. Instead, Bellaire said the company could charge a subscription fee for additional features and for &#8220;concierge-oriented support.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one of those problems where if get it right, you can make a huge impact, but you can also have huge financial success,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>It sounds like investors agree. Realworld had previously raised $1.1 million, and this new seed round was led by Fitz Gate Ventures, with participation from Bezos Expeditions (Jeff Bezos&#8217; personal investment firm), Knightsgate Ventures, The Helm, Great Oaks VC, Copper Wire Ventures, AmplifyHer Ventures, Underdog Labs, Human Ventures and Techstars.</p>
<p>Amplifyher Partner Meghan Cross Breeden noted that Realworld could &#8220;corner the market on life milestones,&#8221; not just for Gen Z right now, but for &#8220;every future milestone &#8230; in the long-haul of adulthood, from buying a home to caring for a parent.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a small industrial park located nearly halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego, one company is claiming to have hit a milestone in the development of a new technology for generating power from nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>The twenty year old fusion energy technology developer <a href="https://tae.com/">TAE Technologies</a> said its reactors could be operating at commercial scale by the end of the decade, thanks to its newfound ability to produce stable plasma at temperatures over 50 million degrees (nearly twice as hot as the sun), .</p>
<p>The promise of fusion energy, a near limitless energy source with few emissions and no carbon footprint, has been ten years out for the nearly seventy years since humanity first harnessed the power of nuclear energy.  But a slew of companies including TAE, <a href="https://generalfusion.com/">General Fusion</a>, <a href="https://cfs.energy/">Commonwealth Fusion Systems</a> and a host of others <a href="https://www.fusionindustryassociation.org/members">across North America and around the world</a> are making rapid advancements that look to bring the technology from the realm of science fiction into the real world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For TAE Technologies, the achievement serves as a validation of the life&#8217;s work of Norman Rostoker, one of the company&#8217;s co-founders who had devoted his life to fusion energy research and died before he could see the company he helped create reach its latest milestone.</p>
<p>“This is an incredibly rewarding milestone and an apt tribute to the vision of my late mentor, Norman Rostoker,” said TAE&#8217;s current chief executive officer, Michl Binderbauer, in a statement announcing the company&#8217;s achievement. “Norman and I wrote a paper in the 1990s theorizing that a certain plasma dominated by highly energetic particles should become increasingly better confined and stable as temperatures increase. We have now been able to demonstrate this plasma behavior with overwhelming evidence. It is a powerful validation of our work over the last three decades, and a very critical milestone for TAE that proves the laws of physics are on our side.”</p>
<p>Rostoker&#8217;s legacy lives on inside TAE through the company&#8217;s technology platform, called, appropriately, &#8220;Norman&#8221;. In the last 18 months that technology has demonstrated consistent performance, reaching over 50 million degrees in several hundred test cycles.</p>
<p>Six years ago, the company had proved that its reactor design could sustain plasma indefinitely &#8212; meaning that once the switch is flipped on a reaction, that fusion reaction can continue indefinitely. Now, the company said, it has achieved the necessary temperatures to make its reactors commercially viable.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s with these milestones behind it that TAE was able to raise an additional $280 million in financing, bringing its total up to $880 million and making it one of the best financed private nuclear fusion endeavors in the world.</p>
<p>“The Norman milestone gives us a high degree of confidence that our unique approach brings fusion within grasp technologically and, more important, economically,” Binderbauer said. “As we shift out of the scientific validation phase into engineering commercial-scale solutions for both our fusion and power management technologies, TAE will become a significant contributor in modernizing the entire energy grid.”</p>
<p>The company isn&#8217;t generating energy yet, and won&#8217;t for the foreseeable future. The next goal for the company, according to Binderbauer, is to develop the technology to the point where it can create the conditions necessary for making energy from a fusion reaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;The energy is super tiny. It&#8217;s immaterial. It&#8217;s a needle in the haystack,&#8221; Binderbauer said. &#8220;In terms of its energy discernability, we can use it for diagnostics.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2136022" style="width: 926px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2136022" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2136022" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TAE_Michl-Binderbauer_4.jpg" alt="" width="916" height="611" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TAE_Michl-Binderbauer_4.jpg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TAE_Michl-Binderbauer_4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TAE_Michl-Binderbauer_4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TAE_Michl-Binderbauer_4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2136022" class="wp-caption-text">TAE Technologies Michl Binderbauer standing next to the company&#8217;s novel fusion reactor.

<p><strong>Follow the sun</strong></p>
<p>It took $150 million and five iterations for TAE Technologies to get to Norman, its national laboratory scale fusion device. The company said it conducted over 25,000 fully-integrated fusion reactor core experiments, optimized using machine learning programs developed in collaboration with Google and processing power from the Department of Energy&#8217;s INCITE program, which leverages exascale-level computing, TAE Technologies said.</p>
<p>The new machine was first fired up in the summer of 2017. Before it could even be constructed TAE Technologies went through a decade of experimentation to even begin approaching the construction of a physical prototype. By 2008, the first construction began on integrated experiments to make a plasma core and infuse it with some energetic particles. The feeder technology and beams alone cost $100 million, Binderbauer said. Then the company needed to develop other technologies like vacuum conditioning. Power control mechanisms also needed to be put in place to ensure that the company&#8217;s 3 megawatt power supply could be stored in enough containment systems to power a 750 megawatt energy reaction.</p>
<p>Finally, machine learning capabilities needed to be tapped from companies like Google and compute power from the Department of Energy had to be harnessed to manage computations that could take what had been the theorems that defined Rostoker&#8217;s life&#8217;s work, and prove that they could be made real.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the time Norman became an operating machine we had four generations of devices preceding it. Out of those there were two fully integrated ones and two generations of incremental machines that could do some of it but not all of it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Fusion energy&#8217;s burning problems</strong></p>
<p>While fusion has a lot of promise as a zero-carbon source of energy, it&#8217;s not without some serious limitations, as Andy Jassby, the former principal physicist at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2017/04/fusion-reactors-not-what-theyre-cracked-up-to-be/">noted in a 2017 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists article</a>.</p>
<p>Jassby wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Earth-bound fusion reactors that burn neutron-rich isotopes have byproducts that are anything but harmless: Energetic neutron streams comprise 80 percent of the fusion energy output of deuterium-tritium reactions and 35 percent of deuterium-deuterium reactions.</p>
<p>Now, an energy source consisting of 80 percent energetic neutron streams may be the perfect <em>neutron </em>source, but it’s truly bizarre that it would ever be hailed as the ideal <em>electrical </em>energy source. In fact, these neutron streams lead directly to four regrettable problems with nuclear energy: radiation damage to structures; radioactive waste; the need for biological shielding; and the potential for the production of weapons-grade plutonium 239—thus adding to the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation, not lessening it, as fusion proponents would have it.</p>
<p>In addition, if fusion reactors are indeed feasible—as assumed here—they would share some of the other serious problems that plague fission reactors, including tritium release, daunting coolant demands, and high operating costs. There will also be additional drawbacks that are unique to fusion devices: the use of a fuel (tritium) that is not found in nature and must be replenished by the reactor itself; and unavoidable on-site power drains that drastically reduce the electric power available for sale.</p></blockquote>
<p>TAE Technologies is aware of the problems, according to a spokesperson for the firm, and the company has noted the issues Jassby raised in its product development, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the callouts to tritium is exactly why TAE has been focused on pB-11 as its feedstock from the very beginning (early 90&#8217;s).  TAE will reach D-T conditions as a natural stepping stone to pB-11, cause it cooks at &#8216;only&#8217; 100M c, whereas pB-11 is upwards of 1M c,&#8221; the spokesperson wrote in a response. &#8220;It would seem like a much harder accomplishment to then scale to 1M, but what this milestone proves is the &#8216;Scaling law&#8217; for the kind of fusion TAE is generating &#8211; in an FRC (the linear design of &#8220;Norman&#8221;, unlike the donut Tokamaks) the hotter the plasma, the more stable it becomes. It&#8217;s the opposite of a [Tokamak].  The milestone gives them scientific confidence they can increase temps beyond DT to pB11 and realize fusion with boron &#8212; cheap, aneutronic, abundant &#8212; the ideal terrestrial feedstock (let&#8217;s not get into mining the moon for helium-3!).&#8221;</p>
<p>As for power concerns, the TAE fusion reactor can convert a 2MW grid feed into 750MW shots on the machine without taking down Orange County&#8217;s grid (and needing to prove it to SCE), and scale power demand in microseconds to mold and course-correct plasmas in real-time, the spokesperson wrote.</p>
<p>In fact, TAE is going to spin off its power management technology into a separate business focused on peak shaving, energy storage and battery management on the grid and in electric vehicles.</p>
<div><strong>A &#8220;safer&#8221; fusion technology?</strong></div>
<p>The Hydrogen-Boron, or p-B11, fuel cycle is, according to the company, the most abundant fuel source on earth, and will be the ultimate feedstock for TAE Technologies&#8217; reactor, according to the company. But initially, TAE, like most of the other companies currently developing fusion technologies will be working with Deuterium-Tritium as its fuel source.</p>
<p>The demonstration facility &#8220;Copernicus&#8221; which will be built using some of the new capital the company has announced raising, will start off on the D-T fuel cycle and eventually make the switch. Over time, TAE hopes to license the D-T technology while building up to its ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Funding the company&#8217;s &#8220;money by milestone&#8221; approach are some fo the world&#8217;s wealthiest families, firms, and companies. Vulcan, Venrock, NEA, Wellcome Trust, Google, and the Kuwait Investment Authority are all backers. So too, are the family offices of Addison Fischer, Art Samberg, and Charls Schwab.</p>
<p>“TAE is providing the miracles the 21st century needs,&#8221; said Addison Fischer, TAE Board Director and longtime investor who has been involved with conservation and environmental issues for decades. Fischer also founded VeriSign and is a pioneer in defining and implementing security technology underlying modern electronic commerce. “TAE&#8217;s most recent funding positions the company to undertake their penultimate step in implementing sustainable aneutronic nuclear fusion and power management solutions that will benefit the planet.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Being a successful early-stage investor is about a lot more than simply identifying trends. A successful VC needs to think several steps ahead. For MaC Venture Capital founder Marlon Nichols, it’s an ability that’s helped him spot big names like Gimlet Media, MongoDB, Thrive Market, PlayVS, Fair, LISNR, Mayvenn, Blavity and Wonderschool early on.</p>
<p>Nichols joined us on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/early-stage-2021/">TechCrunch Early Stage</a> to discuss his strategies for early-stage investing, and how those lessons can translate into a successful launch for budding entrepreneurs. Success involves not only a solid team and great ideas, it also requires the willingness and ability to change and adapt to an ever-changing world.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Getting ahead of the trends</h2>
<p>Anyone can identify trends once they’ve broken, but a successful investor needs to see several steps ahead of the pack. This ability helps VCs know where to focus their attention and, eventually, how to weed out the snake oil from the true value pitches.</p>
<blockquote><p>For us, that means taking a look at emerging behavioral trends and shifts in culture. What we’re looking to understand is where people and companies are going to spend their time and money – not only today, but in the future. So we do research to see if there are supporting factors for this thing sticking around and being successful. If that answer is yes, then we can dig a bit deeper. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 4:33)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indoor farming company AppHarvest this week announced that<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/08/2206486/0/en/AppHarvest-Acquires-Agricultural-Robotics-and-Artificial-Intelligence-Company-Root-AI-to-Increase-Efficiency.html"> it has acquired Root AI</a>. The deal is valued at around $60 million, with $10 million in cash and the reminder coming from AppHarvest stock.</p>
<p>Root AI is a Boston-based robotics startup, with a mission fairly in line with that of its future parent company. We’ve covered the startup a handful of times, including last August, when it announced a $7.2 million seed round. Robotics, generally, have gotten a boost during the pandemic, but agriculture and food production have gotten special looks, as organizations are looking for ways to automate their processes.</p>
<p>Including the aforementioned seed, Root has raised a total of $9.5 million to date, fueled by interest in its Virgo harvesting system. Founder and CEO Josh Lessing will step into a CTO role at AppHarvest if the acquisition clears. The startup is still fairly lean, with 19 full-time employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to quotes from both parties, robot-gathered data for crop yields is a key part of the acquisition.</p>
<p>“Farming as we’ve known it is broken because of the increasing number of variables such as extreme weather, droughts, fire and contamination by animals that make our food system unreliable,” AppHarvest founder and CEO Jonathan Webb said in a release tied to the news. Indoor farming solves for many of those challenges, and the data gathered can exponentially deliver more insights that help us predict and control crop quality and yield.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">President Biden has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/07/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-initial-actions-to-address-the-gun-violence-public-health-epidemic/">announced a new set of initiatives</a> by which he hopes to curb the gun violence he described as &#8220;an epidemic&#8221; and &#8220;an international embarrassment.&#8221; Among other things, the ATF will be closing loopholes in unregulated online sales and so-called &#8220;ghost guns,&#8221; which can be built or printed with no serial numbers or background checks.</p>
<p>Speaking in the White House Rose Garden Thursday afternoon, Biden recounted the many recent mass shootings as horrific tragedies, but pointed out that over a hundred people are shot every day in this country. &#8220;This is an epidemic, for God&#8217;s sake,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;and it has to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before outlining his plans for combating the problem, he made sure to address the inevitable Second Amendment objections from people who believe it is a Constitutional right for anyone to own things like assault rifles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing I&#8217;m about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second Amendment,&#8221; Biden said. &#8220;From the very beginning, you couldn&#8217;t own any weapon you wanted to own. From the very beginning of the Second Amendment existing, certain people weren&#8217;t allowed to have weapons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course federal laws often conflict with state laws on this point, giving rise to surprising sights like heavily armed protestors taking over the Michigan capitol building — quite legally. But the feds do have a few tricks up their sleeves.</p>
<p>Background checks and registration tracking involve federal authorities, and there are loopholes that have appeared or worsened over recent years as online traffic in guns has increased (social networks are notorious for thinly veiled gun trade) and the process of building weapons at home has become easier.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have directed ATF to begin work on an updated study of gun trafficking, one that takes into account the fact that modern guns are not simply cast or forged any more, but can be made of plastic, printed on a 3D printer, or sold in self assembly kits,&#8221; said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, who took the podium after Biden. &#8220;We will ensure that we understand and measure the problem of criminal gun trafficking in a data driven way.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Distributor of plans for 3D-printed guns puts his product back in circulation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/distributor-of-plans-for-3d-printed-guns-puts-his-product-back-in-circulation/embed/#?secret=Z0t4FwMwIZ" data-secret="Z0t4FwMwIZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Ghost guns&#8221; were a hot topic a few years back when several people and organizations, among them <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/cody-wilson-bail/">Defense Distributed</a>, attempted to popularize 3D-printed pistols and assault rifle components. The high-tech angle made the media bite, though of course traditional gun trafficking in the form of smuggling and in-person sales dwarf the scale of anything these sites and services delivered.</p>
<p>But gun building kits do represent a significant loophole in the ATF&#8217;s regulations, which do not require registration or background checks for them. So a person can get 80% of a gun that way, get the other 20% (usually the &#8220;receiver,&#8221; which component qualifies the assembly as a firearm) by printing or another method, and have a gun with no serial number or registration whatsoever.</p>
<p>Garland has proposed a rule for the ATF to adopt that would change this and a few other things, such as easily purchased modifications for pistols that effectively make them into short-barreled rifles; the new rule would require those conversion kits to be registered. This presumably will follow the confirmation of the ATF&#8217;s first director in five years — the position was vacant for the whole last administration — David Chipmen, whom Biden plans to nominate.</p>
<p>Other efforts by the administration include a $5 billion, 8-year investment in community violence intervention programs, a push for &#8220;red flag&#8221; laws that temporarily bar people in crisis from obtaining guns, and a nudge for Congress to start working on legislation that addresses things the Executive can&#8217;t.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is idling more plants and extending shutdowns at other facilities in North America due to a continued shortage of semiconductor chips that are used to control myriad operations in vehicles, including the infotainment, power steering and brake systems.</p>
<p>In an update Thursday, GM indicated that eight assembly plants are affected by the temporary closures. CNBC was the first to report on the<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/08/gm-cutting-production-at-several-plants-due-to-chip-shortage.html"> temporary plant closures</a>. GM confirmed the shutdowns to TechCrunch and added that it plans to restart production next week at its Wentzville Assembly plant in Missouri.</p>
<p>&#8220;GM continues to leverage every available semiconductor to build and ship our most popular and in-demand products, including full-size trucks and SUVs for our customers,&#8221; a spokesperson wrote in an email. &#8220;Our intent is to make up as much production lost at these plants as possible.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As global chip shortage has dragged on, automakers including GM and Ford have had to idle plants and shuffle resources to the production of higher margin vehicles like SUVs. GM told TechCrunch that it has not taken downtime or reduced shifts at any of its full-size truck or full-size SUV plants due to the shortage. It&#8217;s also prompted automakers to build vehicles without specific parts. For instance, GM said last month that certain pickup trucks would be produced <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/03/15/gm-pickups-chip-shortage/4708837001/">without a fuel management module</a>, a device that will prevent these vehicles from achieving top fuel economy performance.</p>
<p>Automakers have also issued guidance on how the shortage will affect financial results in 2021. Ford has said that if the semiconductor shortage scenario is extended through the first half of 2021, the shortage could lower its earnings between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, net of cost recoveries and some production make-up in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>GM said in February that the global shortage of semiconductors will have a short-term impact on its production, earnings and cash flow in 2021.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s Spring Hill Assembly in Tennessee, which builds the Cadillac XT5, Cadillac XT6 and GMC Acadia, will shut down for two weeks beginning April 12. GM is temporarily halting production of the Chevrolet Blazer at the Ramos Assembly in Mexico and Chevrolet Traverse and Buick Enclave at the Lansing Delta Township factory during the week of April 19.</p>
<p>GM also extended downtime at Lansing Grand River Assembly through the week of April 26. This plant, which builds the Chevrolet Traverse and Buick Enclave, has been down since March 15.</p>
<p>The automaker is extending the shutdown at its CAMI Assembly plant in Canada and the Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas, which is where the Chevrolet Malibu and Cadillac XT4 are extended through May 10. Both CAMI and Fairfax have been down since the week of February 8, GM said.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s Bupyeong 2 Assembly in Korea has been operating at half capacity since February 8, and its Gravataí plant in Brazil is taking downtime for the months of April and May.</p>

<p>The sales, which occurred within 20 hours of each other, didn&#8217;t garner the same headlines that the Beeple auction received, but there was a bit of coverage in the tech press, mostly because one of the aliens was sold by Dylan Field, the CEO of design software startup Figma. In a Clubhouse <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb5LapixLbk&amp;t=3236s&amp;ab_channel=TheGoodTimeShow">conversation</a> following the sale, Field said he hoped that a century from now the blocky image he had sold would be seen as the &#8220;Mona Lisa of digital art.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pixelated alien portraits belonged to an NFT platform called <a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks">CryptoPunks</a>. In the world of NFTs, the platform is as close to ancient history as it gets, meaning it&#8217;s almost four years old. There are 10,000 punks, all of which were procedurally generated and claimed for free when the project launched in 2017.</p>
<p>Since then, the economy built around trading these images has sauntered on with a small but passionate community, at least until a few months ago. That&#8217;s when it suddenly exploded, dragging into the fray Silicon Valley CEOs, prominent venture capitalists, famous YouTubers, poker stars and major business personalities. The platform has seen nearly $200 million worth of transaction volume in official deals since launch, according to NFT tracking site <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">CryptoSlam</a>, with 98% of that volume flowing through the platform in the past few months.</p>
<p>The sudden rise in punk prices is owed to an explosion of interest in NFTs largely brought about by climbing cryptocurrency prices, the rise in popularity of Dapper Labs&#8217; NBA Top Shot and the resurgence of the physical collectibles markets, all of which have made some investors more comfortable with the idea of betting on digital goods.</p>
<p>Today, the cheapest punk you can buy will run you about $30,000 in Ethereum cryptocurrency, while the rarest may be worth just shy of $10 million.</p>
<p>CryptoPunks have captured plenty of attention, but even with all eyeballs on the project, people still aren&#8217;t sure exactly what they&#8217;re looking at.</p>
<p>&#8220;In NFT world, people are talking about selling Jack Dorsey tweets, Top Shots and Beeple in the same sentence right now,&#8221; Sotheby&#8217;s CEO Charles Stewart told TechCrunch in an interview. &#8220;The lines can get a little blurry. When you look at CryptoPunks, are they art? Are they collectibles? Are they&#8230; you know, well&#8230; what are they exactly?&#8221;</p>

<h2>A &#8216;more honest&#8217; stock market</h2>
<p>Back in early 2017, John Watkinson and Matt Hall were playing with a pixelated character generator they built, and they were pretty enthusiastic about the fun little pop art portraits they had been cooking up. By June, they had created 10,000 characters with different hairstyles, hats and glasses for a project called CryptoPunks that would be hosted on the nascent Ethereum blockchain. Some punks had a handful of attributes, some had none, some were apes, some were aliens. While the creators had a hand in curating some elements, they let their generator take control of the creativity.</p>
<p>They launched to modest interest from a small community of blockchain enthusiasts who only had to pay a few pennies in Ethereum &#8220;gas&#8221; transaction fees to own their own punk. It was a novel idea, pre-dating the NFT platform CryptoKitties by months and NBA Top Shot by years, but it arrived at the cusp of crypto&#8217;s 2017 wave during the early throes of initial coin offerings, where scams were plentiful and attention was hard to come by. Hall said that about 20-30 punks were claimed in the days following launch.</p>

<p>Then a week later Mashable wrote a <a href="https://mashable.com/2017/06/16/cryptopunks-ethereum-art-collectibles/">story</a> about the fledgling crypto art project, and within hours every punk was gone.</p>
<p>Some users went all-in immediately. One user that went by the username <em>hemba</em> has become something of a cautionary figure in the CryptoPunks community, claiming more than 1,000 punks at launch and selling every one of them before the market took off this year, missing out on tens of millions of dollars in profits at current prices. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Another user who goes by <em>mr703</em> claimed some 703 punks in total at launch, hundreds of which they are still holding onto years later in a collection similarly worth tens of millions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In a Discord chat with the pseudonymous <em>mr703</em>, we asked whether they felt they had enough or if there were any punks they still intended to buy. &#8220;I own all the punks I ever really want,&#8221; they typed back. Their public wallet shows they paid more than $37,000 for a punk in the minutes in between our question and their answer. They spent $35,000 on another one several hours later.</span></p>
<p>Some investors who have already gone all-in backing risky cryptocurrencies see NFTs as a way to diversify their crypto holdings. Others see CryptoPunks as more of a game.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135532" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135532" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2135532 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5759137097_91867fc323_k.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="472" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5759137097_91867fc323_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5759137097_91867fc323_k.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5759137097_91867fc323_k.jpg?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5759137097_91867fc323_k.jpg?resize=768,533 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5759137097_91867fc323_k.jpg?resize=680,472 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5759137097_91867fc323_k.jpg?resize=1536,1066 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5759137097_91867fc323_k.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135532" class="wp-caption-text">CryptoPunks creators Matt Hall and John Watkinson</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;I think that with each year that passes the definition of what is gambling and what is investing move closer and closer together,&#8221; says Mike McDonald, a 31-year-old professional poker player who recently bought his first punk.</p>
<p>Why are some punks worth tens of thousands of dollars while others are worth millions? Users in the thriving CryptoPunks Discord community have had to decide that on their own, combining objective analysis of the rarity of certain design attributes with the more subjective impressions of punk &#8220;aesthetics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Things aren&#8217;t always predictable. Earrings are the most common attribute for punks, commanding much lower price floors than those with beanie hats, which are the rarest attribute. But hundreds of punks are wearing 3D glasses, yet they tend to earn a hefty premium over those with green clown hair even though fewer of those punks exist. Some attributes gain market momentum randomly; for instance, the market for punks wearing hoodies has been particularly hot in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="p1">“Obviously this is a very speculative market&#8230; but it’s almost more honest than the stock market,” user Max Orgeldinger tells TechCrunch. “Kudos to Elon Musk &#8212; and I’m a big Tesla fan &#8212; but there are no fundamentals that support that stock price. It’s the same when you look at GameStop. With the whole NFT community, it’s almost more honest because nobody’s getting tricked into thinking there’s some very complicated math that no one can figure out. This is just people making up prices and if you want to pay it, that’s the price and if you don’t want to pay it, that’s not the price.”</p>
<p>As prices have surged, owning a piece of the CryptoPunks&#8217; finite supply has become a &#8220;digital flex&#8221; in its own right, especially when used as an avatar on social media sites, several punk owners told us. That has drawn plenty of wealthy buyers outside the blockchain world, including influencers like YouTuber Logan Paul who uploaded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esN_Qmp6Vak&amp;ab_channel=IMPAULSIVEClips">video</a> last month detailing his $170,000 purchase of several punks.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you don&#8217;t have a punk, the ecosystem seems like this gentlemen&#8217;s club of the 10,000 people that can afford these kinds of avatars,&#8221; says McDonald.</p>
<p>There is some concern among the community whether all of this outside attention is a sign of an impending crash in prices, though many investors feel reassured by the historical value of CryptoPunks among NFTs. Nevertheless, some of the investors have a hard time convincing those in their lives that what they&#8217;re doing is anything but reckless.</p>
<p>After a recent six-figure punk purchase, user Chris Mintern says his girlfriend was exasperated that he had just dropped more money on a punk than her house was worth. &#8220;She says it&#8217;s all just a bunch of internet nerds who don&#8217;t appreciate the value of money. That to them, it&#8217;s just a game and numbers on a screen,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The community surrounding CryptoPunks has largely bloomed on the chat app Discord in a dedicated group where users that are verified as punk owners tend to drive conversations and can gather attention for up-and-coming NFT projects they&#8217;re betting on.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit of a cult,&#8221; said user <em>thebeautyandthepunk</em> in an interview.</p>
<p>Like many early users, <em>thebeautyandthepunk</em><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> has stayed pseudonymous since claiming a couple dozen punks at launch, telling us that no one in her life has any idea she&#8217;s sitting on an NFT collection likely worth millions &#8212; except her accountant. She did recently decide to make it known that she was one of the few female traders who have been present in the overwhelmingly male CryptoPunks community since the beginning.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I really try to keep my real life and my crypto life completely separate,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But people need to know that women have been [in this space] for a while and we&#8217;re not going anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, all 10,000 punks are scattered across some 1,889 wallets, according to crypto tracker Etherscan. Some of those accounts are inactive and feared dead, with the punks inside them lost on the blockchain forever. The largest single wallet of punks today belongs to the platform&#8217;s creators, holding some 488 punks. It&#8217;s their only ownership in a blockchain-based marketplace where most mechanics are already set in stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re just users now, too. Nothing about our website is specific to us having created the project,&#8221; Watkinson tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Our only equity is through the punks we own. We don’t take a cut of the market or anything.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The NFT high-rollers table</h2>
<p>Today, CryptoPunks&#8217; creators are working on NFTs full time. While they can&#8217;t make any underlying changes to the CryptoPunks contract, they have aimed to improve the website&#8217;s marketplace while hopping into the Discord group to keep an eye on the ever-growing community of users.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;It was never our intention for this to sort of be our careers,&#8221; Watkinson says.</p>
<p>In 2019, the duo debuted a follow-up project called <a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs">Autoglyphs</a>, which brought generative art to the blockchain. It didn&#8217;t boast the pop aesthetic of CryptoPunks, but it added a new layer to their exploration of blockchain art. Hall and Watkinson have built up a company around their various projects called <a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/">Larva Labs</a>, and they are in the process of building up a new NFT project that they hope will have a lower barrier of entry than CryptoPunks and Autoglyphs.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the CryptoPunks get more and more expensive, they’re just hard to get into,&#8221; Hall says.</p>
<p>At around $200 million in official marketplace sales, CryptoPunks&#8217; total lifetime sales volume is about 40% of what Dapper Labs&#8217; NBA Top Shot has achieved in its past several months. Though CryptoPunks has done so with 0.35% of Top Shot&#8217;s total transaction volume, which is fewer than 12,000 trades compared to more than 3.3 million, according to CryptoSlam. Those high transaction numbers spread across millions of NFTs mean much less value per transaction on Top Shot, but a much, much bigger pool of active users.</p>
<p>Last month, Dapper Labs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/nba-top-shot-maker-dapper-labs-is-now-worth-2-6-billion-thanks-to-half-of-hollywood-the-nba-and-michael-jordan/">announced</a> they had raised $305 million at a $2.6 billion valuation as they look to expand their private Flow blockchain to other blockchain &#8220;games&#8221; through more high-profile partnerships. Hall and Watkinson have been watching Dapper Labs&#8217; success, but don&#8217;t think Larva Labs will need venture funding to continue exploring what&#8217;s next for NFTs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather than looking at becoming a large company and doing a deal with the NBA or something like that, we&#8217;re more just looking forward to kind of just continuing to explore the tech possibilities,&#8221; Watkinson said. &#8220;What we love about CryptoPunks is the action, and so we&#8217;d like to find a way back to sort of that level of action, and our next project is going to try to find ways to sort of keep the deal flow going.&#8221;</p>
<p>They have few details to share on the new project, which they said will debut &#8220;relatively soon&#8221; this year.</p>

<h2>The origin of the species</h2>
<p>CryptoPunks lore is largely steeped in the assertion that they are the oldest NFT project on the Ethereum blockchain. It&#8217;s a line that was floated by almost all of the punk owners I spoke with as the main reason they had dumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into the platform. In Paul&#8217;s recent YouTube video, he justified prices to his skeptical friends by noting, &#8220;[CryptoPunks] is the first and that makes it special.&#8221;</p>
<p>But over the past few weeks, holes in that narrative have begun to emerge, as &#8220;crypto archaeologists&#8221; have begun to unearth abandoned NFT projects that were created in Ethereum&#8217;s earliest days, with at least one arriving before CryptoPunks. We recently spoke with Cyrus Adkisson, the creator of a project called <a href="https://etheria.world/">Etheria</a>, which he debuted back in 2015, just three months after Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet went live. The project allowed users to buy up, sell and build on hexagonal swaths of digital land on a large map. It didn&#8217;t develop much of a following at launch and sat abandoned for years on the Ethereum blockchain until Adkisson saw the &#8220;fever pitch&#8221; developing around NFTs and started searching for the passcode to his old account.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember calling my parents toward the end of February, telling them I may be sitting on a goldmine here,&#8221; Adkisson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>After ultimately gaining access to his Etheria account, he then fired off a few tweets from Etheria&#8217;s long-dormant Twitter account, detailing that the bulk of the 914 tiles across two externally tradeable versions were still available and could be claimed for 1 Ether each. Adkisson says by the end of that weekend, his previously empty wallet was filled with $1.4 million worth of Ethereum.</p>

<p class="p1">“With these projects, it’s like, yeah, you have the historical context, but now you need to build a solid foundation with your communities because your real measure is not now, but it’s going to be what your community, size and engagement look like in a year,” says Allen Hena, an NFT enthusiast who helped <a href="https://twitter.com/RealAllenHena">attract attention</a> to the Etheria community last month with a series of blog posts.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the days following the project&#8217;s resurrection, the young community has already seen plenty of disagreement and infighting as Adkisson aims to maintain some level of control over the platform on which plenty have already pinned their retirement plans. Owners are mainly frustrated by Adkisson&#8217;s attempts to make an older version of Etheria externally tradeable, something that would likely make land tiles on the existing contracts considerably less valuable. Since our interview, Adkisson has left Etheria’s Discord server and admins in the group have vowed to continue on without him as he decides which direction he wants to take Etheria 1.0.</p>
<p>While punk owners we talked with are keeping an eye on these newly reemerged projects, they&#8217;re also skeptical that Etheria&#8217;s older status will do much to impact CryptoPunks&#8217; value to NFT history.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;On paper it looks cool but it didn’t actually do anything for the community,&#8221; says user Daniel Maegaard. &#8220;CryptoPunks did all the hard work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maegaard, a 30-year-old crypto investor based in Brisbane, Australia, is more tied up in the value of CryptoPunks than most. He recently sold a particularly rare female &#8220;zero-trait&#8221; punk for more than $1 million. He&#8217;s also the owner of one of the rarest &#8212; some argue the rarest &#8212; punks, the only one with seven unique attributes, a qualifier that has earned it the nickname &#8220;7-atty&#8221; and a sacred place in punk lore. When he bought the punk for about $18,000 in Ethereum last year, it was the most anyone had ever paid. He isn&#8217;t keen to let it go anytime soon, saying he recently turned down a private offer for $4.2 million from a group of investors that hoped to tokenize the NFT and sell fractional shares of it to other users. Part of holding onto it is the potential for further gains, but the real reason, he says, is that he&#8217;s beginning to feel an emotional bond with his collection of digital files.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;These little pixelated faces, it should be easy to give them up. I’ve sold a few punks and I’ve regretted every sale, I experienced that when I sold my zero-trait punk,&#8221; Maegaard says. &#8220;Like, yeah, a million dollars is nice, but I really liked her.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab is preparing for its next launch, currently set to take place in May from its launch facility in New Zealand. The payload for the flight are two satellites to join BlackSky&#8217;s Earth observation constellation, but Rocket Lab has a secondary goal crucial to its aim of adding reusability to its Electron launch vehicle: Recovering the booster stage after its return from space.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Rocket Lab has done a booster recovery; last November, it fished one out of the sea following its aptly-named &#8216;Return to Sender&#8217; mission. For this flight, dubbed &#8216;Running Out of Toes,&#8217; the goal is roughly the same, but the Electron vehicle has some upgrades and modifications that will help Rocket Lab gather even more data, and make progress towards actually fully reusing one of these boosters once they get it back.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were very, very pleased with the condition of the [first] booster we got back with basically no modifications to any of the thermal protection systems,&#8221; Rocket Lab CEO and founder Peter Beck explained in an interview. &#8220;The way that we enter with the booster is obviously engines-first and propagate a big shockwave forward. This next flight is the next iteration where we&#8217;ve upgraded the heat shield to be able to actually carry those loads, because we know those loads now.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Flight one provided plenty of valuable data about what the actual stresses were on the Electron booster during re-entry — information that engineers on the ground could make educated guesses about, but couldn&#8217;t actually really know without a real-world test. The data collected by sensors onboard the rocket during that November flight provided Rocket Lab the ability to redesign Electron&#8217;s heat shield for a &#8220;major increase in performance and strength,&#8221; according to Beck.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rocket Lab makes its first booster recovery after successful launch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/rocket-lab-makes-its-first-booster-recovery-after-successful-launch/embed/#?secret=tUCGTYxFdY" data-secret="tUCGTYxFdY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This second flight will test the efficacy of those improvements, and provide even more data to the Rocket Lab team, which will be used to inform the design of the third and final planned recovery test. That will focus on adjusting the re-entry procedure so that the Electron booster sheds even more of its speed while coming back into the atmosphere, which makes Rocket Lab&#8217;s final recovery steps — a parachute-assisted slowdown and a mid-air helicopter capture — more viable.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be one other design iteration after this, where we will look to scrub even more velocity in the air for more heat off the stage, to get us to that point where it really is worth introducing the other elements of the helicopter to go and pick up a stage that we feel like we could go and re-fly,&#8221; Beck said.</p>
<p>That third and final splashdown test should happen sometime later this year, if all goes to plan. And while Rocket Lab doesn&#8217;t aim to actually re-fly any of the boosters from these three development tests, Beck told me that certain components from the first booster they got back have been re-integrated into this second test vehicle, and the plan is to recover and re-use even more parts for test #3.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;From launch to launch: Peter Beck on building Rocket Lab&#8217;s orbital business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/from-launch-to-launch-peter-beck-on-building-an-orbital-business-from-scratch/embed/#?secret=Tz3q3vk5EZ" data-secret="Tz3q3vk5EZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Beck said that bringing the booster back to the Rocket Lab factory and essentially cutting it into tiny pieces is actually the best way for the company&#8217;s engineers to learn about what happens during re-entry, and what parts of the rocket are affected most.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing like putting a stage back in the factory to really understand,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;You can have all the instrumentation you want, but we brought that stage back here and the first thing we did is, we cut it up. We cut all the heat-affected areas, all of the areas that are in the shadow of flow, and then start doing tensile polls on them to understand the material properties.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of this work drives towards the end goal of re-flying a recovered Electron booster — which will be a major accomplishment not only because it should help Rocket Lab increase its launch pace, but also because the vehicle was never designed for reusability to begin with. I asked Beck whether that first re-flight of a recovered Electron will be a commercial mission, or just a test without a customer payload.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would imagine it would be a commercial mission, simply because we&#8217;re not going to put anything on the pad that we don&#8217;t have really high confidence in anyway,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I suspect the first reused vehicles will have quite a lot of refurbishment on them, because if you look at the only other company that has demonstrated reusability [SpaceX], it&#8217;s been many, many years of learning and understanding. You don&#8217;t just kind of grab a launch vehicle, say it looks good, put it back on the pad and fly again. It&#8217;s a very iterative process of building confidence and assurance.&#8221;</p>

<p>While introducing reusability to Electron has benefits in its own right for that launch vehicle, the process of developing that capability has also been invaluable for Rocket Lab&#8217;s efforts to build out its next spacecraft, the higher-capacity Neutron launch system, according to Beck. Neutron is designed to launch and land propulsively, and to include a lot more usability by design from the very start.</p>
<p>&#8220;Electron was designed to be the world&#8217;s most manufacturable launch vehicle — Neutron is designed to be the most reusable launch vehicle,&#8221; Beck said. &#8220;They&#8217;re very different paradigms, but unusually we now have experience in both. For Neutron, the innovation really is around reusability, and there&#8217;ll be some interesting bits shortly, when we we reveal a little bit more about the vehicle architecture, that will make it very obvious to what degree we&#8217;re going to make this a reusable launch vehicle.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Viewed from the outside, board selection and corporate governance can seem like a bit of a black box — particularly at a startup. Generation Investment Management partner Dave Easton spoke at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/early-stage-2021/">TechCrunch Early Stage</a> about how to build a board as a founder, and specifically how to build a board you can live with. Easton&#8217;s own ample experience serving on boards as both a full member and as an observer, as well as Generation&#8217;s focus on building sustainable, ethically managed, mission-driven businesses helped peel back the curtain on the murky topic of good governance.</p>
<hr />
<h2>On the composition of boards</h2>
<p>Easton noted that many boards end up overcrowded — in terms of both the number of people and also the background of those present. Mixing up the type of board members you have managing your corporate governance is key, he said, especially as a company grows in size and maturity.</p>
<blockquote><p>In terms of fields, the sorts of things that we find that often go wrong is when your board is stacked full of investors. I think investors are great — I&#8217;m an investor. I think there are super useful things investors do. But five investors is not very useful, right — it&#8217;s just more people who will generally think the same. So a typical thing that we&#8217;re doing when we come in is, we&#8217;re saying we&#8217;re not taking a board seat, we&#8217;re gonna give our board seats to an operator — someone who actually knows what they&#8217;re doing. When you&#8217;re in the earliest stages it&#8217;s probably fine to avoid operators and just have one or two investors. Particularly operators who come from, like bigger company backgrounds, they&#8217;re not necessarily so helpful when you&#8217;re getting product-market fit. But as you get bigger and bigger, you know, operators start to trump investors, and we think boards need to move more heavily in that direction. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 09:34)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Don&#8217;t put settled topics up for debate</h2>
<p>On the subject of what should actually take place at well-run board meetings, Easton said that one of the most common pitfalls he&#8217;s encountered is when management sort of performatively offers up subjects for debate. It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s easy to do, but it also ends up not only being wasteful of the time of those present, it also leaves a bad taste in basically everyone&#8217;s mouths.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before Luis von Ahn co-founded Duolingo, a gamified language-learning app used by hundreds of millions around the world, he was fixated on squiggly letters. The entrepreneur was a co-inventor of CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA, or those security prompts you get while browsing the web to verify if you are a human or if you are a robot.</p>
<p>And while von Ahn often jokes that his early inventions were considered annoying (it causes friction when consumers have to decipher letters before logging into their email) reCAPTCHA was impressive enough that Google scooped it up. Since then, von Ahn has moved on to creating another iconic company, this time, one that consumers are happy to see pop up on their screens: Duolingo.</p>
<p>Von Ahn is joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=duolingopost">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> this September 21-23 to talk about the making of a gamified edtech unicorn. The pre-IPO company started as a grad school project, and over the years has become a behemoth enjoyed by more than 500 million users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We’ll get into how von Ahn leveraged crowdsourced translation to grow the app, its roller coaster route to monetization and, of course, the iconic &#8212; and often sassy &#8212; green owl, Duo. We’ll also discuss the broader edtech market for language learning, how the pandemic impacted business and why Duolingo sees opportunity in disrupting not just language, but the tests associated with it, as well.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rPZsWYCKJj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/duolingo-ceo-explains-language-apps-surge-in-bookings/">Duolingo CEO explains language app&#8217;s surge in bookings</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While part of Duolingo fits into the edtech category, some see the startup as it currently stands as a consumer subscription product with a learning hook. Von Ahn can clear the air on what Duolingo is truly solving for &#8212; and what’s ahead for the business.</p>
<p>Von Ahn first presented Duolingo on the Disrupt stage nine years ago, with a website and goal to teach 100 million people a new language. Now, nearly a decade later, he’ll be coming back to explain what happened next. He doesn’t hold back &#8212; so you don’t want to miss this.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=duolingopost&amp;display=true">Disrupt 2021</a> runs September 21 -23 and will be 100% virtual this year. Get your front-row seat to see von Ahn and many, many more for less than $100! Secure your seat now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Happy Robotics Week, to those who celebrate. I know a lot of us are unable to be with our loved ones this year, which means no robotics tree, robotics baskets full of robot eggs and green robot beer. Still, the National Robotics Week organization is <a href="https://www.nationalroboticsweek.org/Events">putting on a bunch of virtual events</a> across 50 states through April 11.</p>
<p>There’s been a bit of financial news over the past week, also worth noting. On Tuesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/robotic-exoskeleton-maker-sarcos-announces-spac-plans/">Sarcos joined the rarified air of robotic SPACs</a>. While it’s true there’s been a flurry of activity on that front in the startup world, robotics companies have been slower to embrace the whole blank-check-reverse-merger deal.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/robotics-company-berkshire-grey-to-go-public-via-spac/"> Berkshire-Grey</a> is the one company that immediately springs to mind.</p>

<p>Sarcos builds robotics and robotic exoskeletons that look like they were designed for a James Cameron movie. The company has already raised a bunch of money, including a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/sarcos-raises-40-million-to-bring-its-guardian-xo-exoskeleton-to-market/"> $40 million round</a>, back in September, but is probably most notable to mainstream readers for being at the center of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/delta-air-lines-shows-off-its-smarter-travel-app-an-exoskeleton-and-more-at-ces/">Delta’s recent high-tech push</a>. The airline plans to use some of the company’s tech to help employees lift large payloads.</p>

<p>San Francisco-based Rapid Robotics, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/rapid-raises-12m-for-its-manufacturing-robotics/">announced a $12 million Series A</a>. That brings the company’s funding to date up to $17.5 million, hot on the heels of a decent-sized seed round. The company’s objective is providing a kind of plug and play solution for robotics manufacturing, and essentially lowering the barrier of entry for manufacturing automation across a range of industries.</p>

<p>SoftBank, which continues to be quite bullish on the space, just <a href="https://autostoresystem.com/news/softbank-to-acquire-40-percent-of-autostore/">acquired 40% of AutoStore for a cool $2.8 billion</a>, putting the Norwegian company’s valuation at $7.7 billion. The company uses robotics to maximize warehouse storage, consolidating it into around a quarter of the space. It already has a sizable footprint, as well &#8212; 20,000 robots deployed at around 600 locations. Per SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son:</p>
<blockquote><p>We view AutoStore as a foundational technology that enables rapid and cost-effective logistics for companies around the globe. We look forward to working with AutoStore to aggressively expand across end markets and geographies.</p></blockquote>

<p>And because it can’t all be investment news (I mean, it can, but who wants that?), some<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/robot-senses-hidden-objects-0401"> cool research out of MIT</a>. Researchers from the school, along with ones from Harvard and Georgia Tech, showcased a robot that uses radio waves to sense hidden objects. The tech allows RF-Grasp to pick up things that are covered up or otherwise out of its line of vision. MIT Associate Professor Fadel Adib describes it as &#8220;superhuman perception.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy SmartTag+, the company&#8217;s competitor to Apple&#8217;s forthcoming lost-item finder known as AirTags, <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/introducing-the-new-galaxy-smarttagplus-the-smart-way-to-find-lost-items">has now arrived</a>. Samsung <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/samsung-unveils-its-newest-tile-competitor-the-galaxy-smarttag/">had first announced</a> its Tile competitor known as the Galaxy SmartTag, a Bluetooth-powered locator, during its press event in January. At the time, it teased that a ultra-wideband (UWB) powered version called the Galaxy SmartTag+ would arrive sometime later in the year, without giving a specific time frame.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s here. The newly launched iteration will offer support for both Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and UWB, and can be attached to the everyday items you want to keep track of &#8212; like backpacks or keychains, for example.</p>
<p>Like Apple&#8217;s rumored (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/apple-accidentally-confirms-the-existence-of-an-unreleased-product-airtags/">accidentally confirmed</a>) AirTags, the SmartTag+ for Samsung device owners offers more precise finding capabilities because of its use of UWB technology, which the recently launched Galaxy SmartTag doesn&#8217;t include.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When items go missing, SmartTag+ users will be able to use AR technology to help locate the tags more easily using their Samsung phone, because of its spatial awareness capabilities. As you get closer to the tag&#8217;s location, you can also opt to have it make a loud ring &#8212; which can help if it&#8217;s fallen under something, like a sofa cushion.</p>
<p>Like Tile&#8217;s UWB device, SmartTag+ also supports a sort of community find type of feature where any nearby Galaxy device that&#8217;s opted in will be able to help locate lost items and notify their owners through the SmartThings Find network. Samsung says this data is encrypted so the tag&#8217;s location is only known to its owner.</p>
<p>But unlike the earlier SmartTag, which has expanded to include tags that come in pink and green, the SmartTag+ comes only in black and gray at launch.</p>
<p>Because the new beacons rely on UWB, Samsung says they will only work with Galaxy devices that include UWB technology, including the Galaxy Note20 Ultra, Galaxy S21+, Galaxy S21 Ultra, and Galaxy Z Fold2.</p>
<p>The SmartTag+&#8217;s arrival comes at a time when the lost item beacon market is poised for a shakeup.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s plans to enter this space, where today businesses like Tile dominate, could be fairly disruptive. Apple&#8217;s AirTags will leverage UWB to capture spatial and directional data, which will make finding lost items with the tags attached easier and more accurate. But AirTags will also integrate with Apple&#8217;s Find My app, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/e-bikes-and-earbuds-among-the-first-third-party-hardware-to-support-apples-find-my-tracking/">which has now opened up to third-party manufacturers</a> as of this week, including the makers of earbuds and e-bikes, among others.</p>
<p>Notably absent from that early lineup is Tile, which also has its own UWB tracker on the way. Tile doesn&#8217;t want to give up the customer relationship it has already established via its own app and hand that over to Apple instead, we understand. Instead, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">it plans to offer its own UWB tracker</a> and AR finding features through its own iOS app.</p>
<p>Samsung, however, doesn&#8217;t have that issue as its first-party trackers are designed for its own devices. This SmartTag+ is basically the AirTag for Samsung owners, and if and when Apple launches its own beacons, the demand for the Android version could be impacted.</p>
<p>The company will begin to sell the new SmartTag+ on April 16th.</p>
<p>Samsung&#8217;s earlier Galaxy SmartTags cost $29.99. The new SmartTag+ are $10 more at $39.99 in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Andium, a company focused on remote field monitoring of assets including oil and gas wells has just raised some not-insignificant cash in an investment round led by <a href="https://www.ogci.com/climate-investments/">OGCI Climate Investments</a>, a firm formed by the largest oil companies in the world.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Launched in 2014 to &#8220;support&#8221; the targets laid out in the Paris Agreement to limit global greenhouse gas emissions, OGCI has invested in 21 projects to date.</p>
<p>With Andium, the oil majors join existing investors including Tom Miglis, the former chief investment officer of Citadel Securities and Talis Capital in backing a company developing technologies for natural gas flare monitoring, tank telemetry and object detection.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it provides oil and gas companies with real-time information from remote locations at a far lower cost than other solutions.</p>
<p>Few technologies are less exciting than sensors and monitoring equipment, but there are also few tech services that are more vital to staunching the flow of greenhouse gas emissions. As Mark Tomasovic, a partner at the renewable investment firm, Energize tweeted (to me), &#8220;A few companies are involved in monitoring and reducing methane emissions from producing oil and gas wells&#8230; Given that there are over [1 million] wells in the U.S. and methane is 28x more potent than CO2, these startups have had more of an impact on global climate change then Tesla.&#8221;</p>

<p>Given that there are over 1M wells in the U.S. and methane is 28x more potent than CO2, these startups have had more of an impact on global climate change than Tesla</p>
<p>&mdash; Mark Tomasovic (@MarkTomasovic) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkTomasovic/status/1379476179162370048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that visibility is paramount in change leadership and operational excellence, and our remote monitoring technologies are specifically designed to offer companies an expedited path to achieve their sustainability goals,” said Jory Schwach, the chief executive of Andium, in a statement.</p>
<p>Schwach, a serial entrepreneur whose previous forays into the business world included GlobalRim, a solar global positioning system company, and an offline communications service, started out developing a battery-powered tracking system for the logistics industry.</p>
<p id="b3f8" class="io ip dr iq b ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk ig dj eo" data-selectable-paragraph="">&#8220;I spent the better part of two years building a battery-powered tracking solution for long haul trailers so the market could replace brokers with ‘shared assets’. I failed fast and often on the hardware and realized that the real value was in the continually changing product requests that would be much more easily solved with a software change,&#8221; Schwach <a href="https://medium.com/authority-magazine/meet-the-disruptors-jory-schwach-of-andium-on-the-three-things-you-need-to-shake-up-your-industry-a8f44435a183">told the Medium publication Authority Magazine</a>. &#8220;I decided that building a new kind of operating system for small devices could be big business if I leveraged the OS to customize products based on changing use cases while managing the hardware and infrastructure on behalf of the client.&#8221;</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">Andium&#8217;s technology uses off the shelf cameras and microphones with an artificial intelligence overlay to provide real-time monitoring of all sorts of industrial assets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The transparency created by monitoring and measuring methane is essential to reducing emissions,” said Pratima Rangarajan, CEO of OGCI Climate Investments.  “Andium’s low-cost innovative solution lowers the barrier for operators of all sizes to adopt and implement best practices and we are pleased to support their growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At first glance, <a href="https://quiq.com">Quiq</a> and <a href="https://www.snaps.io">Snaps</a> might sound like similar startups — they both help businesses talk to their customers via text messaging and other messaging apps. But Snaps CEO Christian Brucculeri said &#8220;there&#8217;s almost no overlap in what we do&#8221; and that the companies are &#8220;almost complete complements.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Quiq (based in Bozeman, Montana) is acquiring Snaps (based in New York). The entire Snaps team is joining Quiq, with Brucculeri becoming senior vice president of sales and customer success for the combined organization.</p>
<p>Quiq CEO Mike Myer echoed Bruccleri&#8217;s point, comparing the situation to dumping two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle on the floor and discovering &#8220;the two pieces fit perfectly.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More specifically, he told me that Quiq has generally focused on customer service messaging, with a &#8220;do it yourself, toolset approach.&#8221; After all, the company was founded by two technical co-founders, and Myer joked, &#8220;We can&#8217;t understand why [a customer] can&#8217;t just call an API.&#8221; Snaps, meanwhile, has focused more on marketing conversations, and on a managed service approach where it handles all of the technical work for its customers.</p>
<p>In addition, Myer said that while Quiq has &#8220;really focused on the platform aspect from beginning&#8221; — building integrations with more than a dozen messaging channels including Apple Business Chat, Google’s Business Messages, Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp — it doesn&#8217;t have &#8220;a deep natural language or conversational AI capability&#8221; the way Snaps does.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yeHoF4sNqg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/19/snaps-series-a/">Snaps raises $6M to expand its marketing platform for messaging apps</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Snaps raises $6M to expand its marketing platform for messaging apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/19/snaps-series-a/embed/#?secret=yeHoF4sNqg" data-secret="yeHoF4sNqg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Myer said that demand for Quiq&#8217;s offering has been growing dramatically, with revenue up 300% year-over-year in the last six months of 2020. At the same time, he suggested that the divisions between marketing and customer service are beginning to dissolve, with service teams increasingly given sales goals, and &#8220;at younger, more commerce-focused organizations, they don’t have this differentiation between marketing and customer service&#8221; at all.</p>
<p>Apparently the two companies were already working together to create a combined offering for direct messaging on Instagram, which prompted broader discussions about how to bring the two products together. Moving forward, they will offer a combined platform for a variety of customers under the Quiq brand. (Quiq&#8217;s customers include Overstock.com, West Elm, Men’s Wearhouse and Brinks Home Security, while Snaps&#8217; include Bryant, Live Nation, General Assembly, Clairol and Nioxin.) Brucculeri said this will give businesses one product to manage their conversations across &#8220;the full customer journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The key term you&#8217;re hearing is conversation,&#8221; Myer added. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about a ticket or a case or a question [&#8230;] it&#8217;s an ongoing conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/19/snaps-series-a/">Snaps had raised $13 million</a> in total funding from investors including Signal Peak Ventures. The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://box.com">Box</a> announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/">getting a $500 million investment</a> from private equity firm KKR this morning, it was hard not to see it as a positive move for the company. It has been operating under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">the shadow of Starboard Value</a>, and this influx of cash could give it a way forward independent of the activist investors.</p>
<p>Industry experts we spoke to were all optimistic about the deal, seeing it as a way for the company to regain control, while giving it a bushel of cash to make some moves. However, early returns from the stock market were not as upbeat as the stock price was plunging this morning.</p>
<p>Alan Pelz-Sharpe, principal analyst at Deep Analysis, a firm that follows the content management market closely, says that it&#8217;s a significant move for Box and opens up a path to expanding through acquisition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The KKR move is probably the most important strategic move Box has made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/26/a-year-after-ipo-depressed-stock-price-not-bringing-box-ceo-down/">since it IPO’d</a>. KKR doesn’t just bring a lot of money to the deal, it gives Box the ability to shake off some naysayers and invest in further acquisitions,&#8221; Pelz-Sharpe told me, adding &#8220;Box is no longer a startup its a rapidly maturing company and organic growth will only take you so far. Inorganic growth is what will take Box to the next level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dion Hinchcliffe, an analyst at Constellation Research, who covers the work from home trend and the digital workplace, sees it similarly, saying the investment allows the company to focus longer term again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Box very much needs to expand in new markets beyond its increasingly commoditized core business. The KKR investment will give them the opportunity to realize loftier ambitions long term so they can turn their established market presence into a growth story,&#8221; he said.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tTZOWww205"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/box-looks-to-balance-growth-and-profitability-as-it-matures/">Box looks to balance growth and profitability as it matures</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Box looks to balance growth and profitability as it matures&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/box-looks-to-balance-growth-and-profitability-as-it-matures/embed/#?secret=tTZOWww205" data-secret="tTZOWww205" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pelz-Sharpe says that it also changes the power dynamic after a couple of years of having Starboard pushing the direction of the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;In short, as a public company there are investors who want a quick flip and others that want to grow this company substantially before an exit. This move with KKR potentially changes the dynamic at Box and may well put Aaron Levie back in the driver&#8217;s seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Josh Stein, a partner at DFJ and early investor in Box, who was a long time board member, says that it shows that Box is moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it makes a ton of sense. Management has done a great job growing the business and taking it to profitability. With KKR’s new investment, you have two of the top technology investors in the world putting significant capital into going long on Box,&#8221; Stein said.</p>
<p>Perhaps Stein&#8217;s optimism is warranted. In its most recent <a href="https://www.boxinvestorrelations.com/news-and-media/news/press-release-details/2021/Box-Reports-Fiscal-Year-2021-Revenue-of-771-Million-Up-11-Percent-Year-Over-Year/default.aspx">earnings report from last month</a>, the company announced revenue of $198.9 million, up 8% year-over-year with FY2021 revenue closing at $771 million up 11%. What&#8217;s more, the company is cash-flow positive, and has predicted an optimistic future outlook.</p>
<p>&#8220;As previously announced, Box is committed to achieving a revenue growth rate between 12-16%, with operating margins of between 23-27%, by fiscal 2024,&#8221; the company reiterated in a statement this morning.</p>
<p>Investors remains skeptical, however, with the company stock price getting hammered this morning. As of publication the share price was down over 9%. At this point, market investors may be waiting for the next earnings report to see if the company is headed in the right direction. For now, the $500 million certainly gives the company options, regardless of what Wall Street thinks in the short term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’ve got a great idea and a strong founding team. So now what? When VCs come knocking, it’s important to make sure you’re well positioned to make deals. Fenwick &amp; West partner (and business lawyer) Dawn Belt joined us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/early-stage-2021/">TechCrunch Early Stage</a> to break down some of the terms that trip up first-time entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Belt has been involved in a number of key Silicon Valley moves, including EV company Proterra’s recent decision to go public via SPAC, as well as IPOs for Bill.com and Facebook. Here, she discusses key concepts like equity and the right of first refusal, and the role they play in the early stages of startup funding.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How financially savvy should founders be?</h2>
<p>When it comes to navigating early-stage deals, how important is it to have someone on the founding team with a deep knowledge of these financial guidelines?</p>
<blockquote><p>I actually don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s really necessary. I think that it&#8217;s nice to have, and it&#8217;s good to be able to do this, but that&#8217;s not the core competency of the company. That’s actually a function. It&#8217;s pretty easy for you to outsource to somebody like me at the time when you need it and get the advice then. It&#8217;s more important for you to be really focused on building a good business, and then being open minded and a good listener and learner. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 27:48)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
