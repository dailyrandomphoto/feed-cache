										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more people are venturing out into the world this summer (safely, we hope!), Snapchat wants to make it easier for people to find restaurants, stores, parks, and other interesting spots in their neighborhood. Today, Snapchat is starting to roll out the My Places feature on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/snap-map/">Snap Map</a>, which connects users with over 30 million businesses. Users can log their favorite spots, send them to friends, and find recommendations.</p>
<p>My Places has three main tabs: Visited, Favorites, and Popular. Visited lists places you&#8217;ve checked into on Snapchat, and Favorites saves, well, your favorites. But the Popular tab is particularly interesting, since it marks the first time that Snapchat is using an algorithm to provide personalized recommendations to help people engage with the world around them. The algorithm considers where you are, what you&#8217;ve tagged or favorited already, and where your friends and other Snapchatters have visited.</p>
<p>This further differentiates the social-forward Snap Map from more established resources like Google Maps and Apple Maps, which you can&#8217;t really use to find out what restaurants your friends like. Sure, Snapchat can&#8217;t give you directions to that trendy sushi bar, but it&#8217;s not meant to, just like how Google Maps isn&#8217;t meant to show you what bar all your friends went to without you last night.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2183241" style="width: 338px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183241" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2183241" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-2.21.00-PM.png?w=328" alt="" width="328" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-2.21.00-PM.png 508w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-2.21.00-PM.png?resize=72,150 72w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-2.21.00-PM.png?resize=145,300 145w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-2.21.00-PM.png?resize=328,680 328w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-2.21.00-PM.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183241" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snapchat</p></div></p>
<p>Snapchat shared survey results indicating that its users are more likely on average to engage in &#8220;post-pandemic&#8221; activities (is that a good thing?), and added that 44% of Snapchatters turn to the Snap Map to find places around them that they&#8217;re interested in.</p>
<p>With over 250 million monthly active users on Snap Map, the company announced an update in May called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-brings-partner-centric-layers-to-its-social-map-used-by-250-million-people/">Layers</a>, which lets partner companies add data directly to their own map. So far, Snapchat has collaborated with Ticketmaster and The Infatuation, a restaurant recommendation website &#8212; these partnerships help users see where they can find live entertainment, or what great restaurants are hidden in plain sight. Snapchat plans to further integrate Layers into Snap Map and My Places later this year.</p>
<p>Last week, Snap announced that during Q2 this year, it grew both revenue and daily active users at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/snap-had-its-best-quarter-in-four-years/">highest rates</a> it has achieved in the last four years. Year over year, the app grew 23%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart&#8217;s investments in software and retail technologies it used to transform its business from a brick-and-mortar to one that combines both in-person and online shopping will now be made available to other retailers for the first time, the company <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/07/28/walmart-to-offer-technologies-and-capabilities-to-help-other-businesses-navigate-their-own-digital-transformation">announced</a> today. Through a strategic partnership with Adobe, Walmart will integrate access to Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace, as well as its various online and in-store fulfillment and pickup technologies, into the Adobe Commerce Platform.</p>
<p>The technologies will be made available to both Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source customers, <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/07/27/adobe-walmart-partner-integrate-fulfillment-technologies-marketplace-adobe-commerce.html#gs.7l2itu">Adobe says</a>.</p>
<p>The deal will allow Walmart to potentially reach thousands of small to mid-sized retailers, who will effectively be able to tap into the same tools that one of the largest global retailers is using to run their business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Through the partnership, Adobe retail customers will be able to do things like show store pickup eligibility and available pickup times online; offer multiple pickup options like curbside and in-store pickup; provide their store associates with mobile tools to pick for orders, validate item selections and handle substitutions; and use tools to communicate with customers about their pickup orders, like those where customers can alert store associates of their ETA or arrival for curbside pickup.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the partnership will allow retailers to syndicate and sell their products across Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace.</p>
<p>The arrangement not only aims to benefit Walmart&#8217;s bottom line as it offers new revenue streams related to retail technologies, it could also serve as another tool in Walmart&#8217;s battle with Amazon for online retail dominance.</p>
<p>Retail businesses will use the Adobe Commerce platform to reach an expanded set of customers by listing products on Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace and then leverage Walmart&#8217;s Fulfillment Services to offer two-day shopping across the U.S.</p>
<p>And this, in turn, could boost the number of available products sold on Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace, which is still largely dwarfed by Amazon.</p>
<p>Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/how-pandemic-helped-walmart-battle-amazon-marketplace-sellers-2021-04-14/">had grown to an estimated 70,000 sellers</a> in 2020, fueled by a surge in online shopping triggered by the pandemic, according to third-party estimates. This was a more than doubling over 2019. Today, the marketplace is <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/walmart/number-of-sellers">topping 100,000 sellers,</a> per Marketplace Pulse data. Amazon&#8217;s Marketplace, on the other hand, counts an <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/amazon/number-of-sellers">estimated 6.3 million total sellers</a> worldwide, 1.5 million of which are currently active, per estimates.</p>
<p>Part of Walmart&#8217;s problem in scaling its marketplace business could be related to its ease-of-use on the seller side. Many smaller sellers <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/platforms/as-walmart-marketplace-grows-it-still-faces-hurdles-to-compete-with-amazon/">have reported that</a> Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace is far more difficult to use than Amazon&#8217;s, and they&#8217;ve complained about waiting months to hear back from Walmart about whether they were approved to sell on the platform.</p>
<p>Adobe&#8217;s partnership could help to address some of those challenges.</p>
<p>Adobe also notes it&#8217;s working to consolidate its other channel solutions into a single, unified extension that would allow its retail customers to sell across multiple sales channels &#8212; including <a href="https://magento.com/products/amazon-sales-channel">Amazon&#8217;s</a> &#8212; using one, integrated tool for easy account setup and catalog syndication.</p>
<p>This is the first time Walmart has made its retail technologies available to other businesses, the company said. And it has yet to forecast what sort of revenue the new partnership could bring in. But it&#8217;s a path that Amazon has also been pursuing in recent years to maximize the return on investment from its novel, retail innovations, like its A.I. and computer vision-powered <a href="https://justwalkout.com/">Just Walk Out system</a> that lets customers skip the checkout line.</p>
<p>&#8220;The core mission of helping people save money and live better is at the heart of every idea including Scan &amp; Go and checkout technologies, AI-powered smart substitutions and pickup and delivery,&#8221; said Suresh Kumar, chief technology officer and chief development officer of Walmart Inc., in a statement. &#8220;Combining Adobe’s strength in powering commerce experiences with our unmatched omni-customer expertise, we can accelerate other companies’ digital transformations,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Adobe’s retail customers in the U.S. will be able to integrate Walmart’s technologies in their own storefronts starting in early 2022, the companies said. Pricing and other details will be provided closer to launch.</p>
<p>While today&#8217;s announcement concerns channel partner Adobe, who will help to resell the technologies, Walmart also has a GoToMarket team that will target retailers directly.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Leaders become great not because of their power, but because of their ability to empower others.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that most tech companies tout their culture as &#8220;unique&#8221; or &#8220;open,&#8221; but when you take a closer look, it’s often merely surface level. Yes, you may be dog-friendly or offer unlimited beer on tap, but how are you helping your employees become the best versions of themselves? We’re at our best when our employees are at their best, so we do everything in our power to make that a reality.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			We’re at our best when our employees are at their best, so we do everything in our power to make that a reality.					</blockquote>

	</p>
<p>After successfully running Vincit in Finland and Switzerland, in 2016 we made the jump to the United States, setting up an office in California. Although we had moved over 5,000 miles to a new country, it was important that our two main KPIs remain the same: Employee happiness and customer satisfaction. We believe that happy employees make clients happy, and happy clients refer you to others. Therefore, it was essential that this positive and prosperous workplace environment followed us to the United States.</p>
<p>So beyond traditional benefits, like full medical coverage, 401k matching and standard office amenities, we tapped into our Finnish roots to build and provide our employees with an uninhibited, supportive workplace. We keep our company culture as transparent as possible and fully believe in the power of empowering our employees. We have no managers and no real role hierarchy. Employees do not have to go through an approval process on anything they are working on.</p>
<p>We encourage our employees to make a trip to Finland to visit our headquarters. Instead of &#8220;Lunch &amp; Learn&#8221; meetings, we host &#8220;Fail &amp; Learn&#8221; meetings where employees get to share something that didn’t work and what they learned from it. And once a month, we let an employee become the CEO for a day.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the &#8220;CEO of the Day&#8221; program is one of our most popular initiatives. The program gives our employee the reins for 24 hours with an unlimited budget. The only requirement? The CEO must make one lasting decision that will help improve the working experience of Vincit employees. Whatever the CEO of the Day decides, the company sticks with. They can purchase something for the company, change a policy, update a tool we use … Really, anything that they come up with can be done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When co-founders Songe LaRon and Dave Salvant first began barbershop tech platform <a href="https://getsquire.com/">Squire</a> in 2016, they leaned in quite literally: the duo bought a barbershop in Chelsea, New York to see first-hand how the business worked. For one year, the co-founders religiously worked at the shop, now owned by a larger barbershop chain, handling every bit of the business (except cutting hair).</p>
<p>Five years later, the co-founders view that first-hand experience of the barber industry as a key moment in the history of Squire, now a 175-person company with a tech platform used by over 2,000 shops across three continents. After last raising a Series C in December, and tripling its valuation, Squire announced today that it has raised a $60 million round led by Tiger Global.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Q81A5kTNOU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/squire-haircuts-coronavirus-crv-34-million-series-b/">Squire balances clean fades with the coronavirus</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Squire balances clean fades with the coronavirus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/squire-haircuts-coronavirus-crv-34-million-series-b/embed/#?secret=Q81A5kTNOU" data-secret="Q81A5kTNOU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And, it tripled its valuation, again. Off of 300% year over year revenue growth, the New York startup is now valued at $750 million. It&#8217;s a massive uptick: A little over a year ago, Squire was valued at $75 million.</p>
<p>Like many startups these days, Squire wasn’t searching for capital when Tiger Global, which participated in its Series B and C rounds, offered to lead its next financing. The startup has only spent 10% of its previous round, a $45 million equity round, and now has tens of millions more of money in its bank. Ultimately, its decision to bring on more capital is so it can expand in the U.K. and Canada more aggressively &#8211; even in the wake of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/los-angeles-based-boulevard-has-raised-11-million-for-its-software-to-manage-salons-and-spas/"> early-stage competitors like Boulevard.</a> Squire’s dry powder also puts the co-founders in a position where they can acquire companies, a strategy that Salvant is into and plans to be “aggressive about.”</p>
<p>Squire also announced today the official launch of a product that has been in the roadmap since inception: Squire Capital. Squire Capital is a money management platform with tools that are tailored to the needs of barbershop operations, such as instant payments. Squire’s core business has been more around appointments, loyalty programs, and the installment of contactless payment, now with a fintech layer that aims to offer a more niche service than current financial services heavyweights like Square or Paypal.</p>
<p>Fintech is a “natural next frontier” for Squire, says Salvant, because the startup already has deep insights into how its businesses operate and how they process sales; now, it wants to add another service so it can offer a more holistic experience to them.</p>
<p>Squire Capital was built with <a href="https://www.bond.tech/">Bond</a>, a venture-backed fintech infrastructure startup that aims to help enterprise operations launch their own banking products. After experimenting with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/squire-series-c/">$15 million debt financing arm</a> around the time of its Series C, Squire isn’t offering loans at this time &#8211; hoping to find a better way to scale offerings in the future.</p>
<p>Squire is on route to becoming a historical, and unfortunately still rare, Black-led unicorn. Salvant talked about the significance of that feat, noting that this was “the optimal outcome” when founding the company. He hopes that VCs and investors will start to invest more in Black founders with Squire as a data point of a success story.</p>
<p>“Let’s face it, we’re not typical founders, we don’t look the same and we don’t act the same,” Salvant said. “I just want to serve as a lighthouse and this is validation for myself, my co-founder, but more importantly, what’s coming after us.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s hard to argue that any technology company has had a greater impact in the past decade than BioNTech, the mRNA-based therapeutics pioneer behind the world&#8217;s most widely-used COVID-19 vaccine. Developed in record time in partnership with Pfizer, thanks to an existing partnership to work on immunization for the common flu, BioNTech&#8217;s mRNA inoculation is without a doubt one of the biggest medical innovations of the past century.</p>
<p>BioNTech co-founder and CEO Uğur Şahin isn&#8217;t stopping there, of course: the company recently announced that it would be developing an mRNA-based vaccine targeting malaria, an illness that still kills more than 400,000 people per year. It also has treatments for a range of cancers in process in its development pipeline, and has announced plans to address HIV and tuberculosis with future candidates.</p>
<p>This year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ursheetpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=ursheetpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disrupt 2021</a>, Şahin will join us along with Mayfield Fund Partner Ursheet Parikh, a key investor in BioNTech. Both Şahin and Parikh will be talking to us about how the COVID-19 vaccine came to be, but more importantly, about what the future holds for mRNA technology and its potential to address a wide range of chronic healthcare problems that have been tough challenges to solve for decades or even centuries. We&#8217;ll also be talking about what it means to build a biotech startup with true platform potential, and how that might differ now as compared to what investors were looking for just a few short years ago.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Şahin and Parikh are just two of the many high-profile speakers who will be on our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ursheetpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=ursheetpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disrupt Stage</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ugursahinpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=ugursahinpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extra Crunch Stage</a>.

					<description><![CDATA[While the rise of the Delta variant is extending the company’s work-from-home policy through October 18, it’s not entirely clear what happens after that date.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even for tech companies who create the tools for remote work, returning to the office is proving a major challenge. After early work-from-home recommendations last March, companies like Google eventually closed up shop, requiring employees to take their work home with them. The intervening year and change have been a fraught balancing act for the company (along with most of the world), which began outlining return-to-work plans for some employees as early as May 2020.</p>
<p>As Delta and other COVID-19 variants threaten anticipated returns to normalcy, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai offered a clearer look at the company’s new normal. In a letter to employees reprinted on <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/vaccines-and-our-return-to-office-plans/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29">the Google Keyword blog</a>, Pichai noted that all employees working out of one of Google’s campuses will need to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>“We’re rolling this policy out in the U.S. in the coming weeks and will expand to other regions in the coming months,” Pichai wrote. “The implementation will vary according to local conditions and regulations, and will not apply until vaccines are widely available in your area.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Further complicating matters is the second bullet point. While the rise of the Delta variant is extending the company’s work-from-home policy through October 18, it’s not entirely clear what happens after that date (assuming the virus doesn’t force another shift in the goal posts) to unvaccinated employees, who may not be able to work out of a Google office or remotely.</p>
<p>The post does, however, note some exceptions for those unvaccinated for “medical or other protected reasons.” Google hasn&#8217;t clarified how it will enforce such exceptions.</p>
<p>“For those of you with special circumstances, we will soon be sharing expanded temporary work options that will allow you to apply to work from home through the end of 2021,” Pichai wrote. “We’re also extending Expanded Carer’s Leave through the end of the year for parents and caregivers.”</p>
<p>Other tech giants like Apple have also pushed back return-to-office plans and implemented mask mandates in retail stores as restrictions have gone into effect amid increasing COVID-19 rates. Others, including Facebook, are sticking with original fall reopening plans.</p>
<p>“Expert guidelines state that vaccines are highly effective at preventing variants of COVID-19, including the Delta variant,” a spokesperson for the social media giant<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-office-is-back-what-if-covid-has-other-plans-11627099214"> recently told The Wall Street Journal</a>. “Our timelines to reopen our offices haven’t changed.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Fisker is investing $10 million in private-investment-in-public equity (PIPE) funding for the merger of Allego and special purpose acquisition company Spartan Acquisition Corp III.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than a year after its own SPAC merger, electric vehicle startup Fisker has turned investor to support EV charging company Allego.</p>
<p>Fisker is investing $10 million in private-investment-in-public equity (PIPE) funding for the merger of Allego and special purpose acquisition company Spartan Acquisition Corp III. The merger, announced Tuesday, puts Allego at a pro forma equity value of $3.14 billion.</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to inject the EV charging provider with $702 million in cash, including $150 million in PIPE from Fisker, investors Landis+Gyr, as well as funds and accounts managed by London-based VC firm Hedosophia and ECP. Funds managed by Apollo Global Management affiliates and Meridiam, the majority shareholder of Allego, also participated in the PIPE. (Apollo is in the process of acquiring Verizon Media Group, which includes TechCrunch.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fisker, the sole EV automaker contributing to the PIPE, is interested in Allego&#8217;s infrastructure. The company operates more than 26,000 charging points throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Fisker has agreed to “a strategic partnership to deliver a range of charging options for its customers in Europe,” according to Allego. It includes a provision granting a free year of charging on the Allego network to drivers that purchase Fisker Ocean SUV between the beginning of 2023 to March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>The two companies are also working on a “seamless charging experience” for Fisker drivers using Allego chargers, the EV maker said in a separate statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allego has been a long-standing pioneer in the push to create a seamless pan-European electric vehicle charging network,&#8221; CEO Henrik Fisker said. &#8220;Our investment in the PIPE is motivated by strategic and tactical considerations, ensuring we have a stake in the future of EV charging networks while delivering tangible benefits to our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>California-based Fisker is aiming to start deliveries of its all-electric Ocean SUV in November 2022, but it hasn’t always been a smooth road to pre-production. Henrik Fisker, a serial automotive entrepreneur best known for being the designer behind luxury vehicles like the Aston Martin V8 Vantage, raised nearly $1 billion in last year’s SPAC merger with Apollo Global Management Inc. That deal skyrocketed the startup’s valuation to $2.9 billion, but expectations deflated somewhat after major deals with Volkswagen fell apart.</p>
<p>Fisker has taken an outsourcing approach to its roster of electric vehicles. The Ocean will be produced via a long-term manufacturing agreement with Magna, Inc. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/fisker-and-foxconn-sign-deal-to-build-electric-vehicles/">signed an additional agreement</a> with Taiwanese company Foxconn, the lead manufacturer of iPhones, to develop a new EV by the end of 2023 that will be sold under the Fisker brand.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Like Microsoft and Apple in the wake of their after-hours earnings reports, Shopify shares are having a muted reaction to the better-than-expected results.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canadian e-commerce juggernaut Shopify this morning reported its <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Press-Release-Q2-2021.pdf">second-quarter financial performance</a>. Like Microsoft and Apple in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/microsoft-bests-earnings-estimates-as-azure-posts-51-growth-shares-fall/">their after-hours earnings reports</a>, its shares are having a muted reaction to the better-than-expected results.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 2021, Shopify reported revenues of $1.12 billion, up 57% on a year-over-year basis. The company&#8217;s subscription products grew 70% to $334.2 million, while its volume-driven merchant services drove their own top line up 52% to $785.2 million.</p>
<p>Investors <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/shopify-tops-1-billion-in-quarterly-sales-for-the-first-time-as-e-commerce-spending-stays-strong-11627471417">had expected</a> Shopify to report revenue of $1.05 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shopify also posted an enormous second-quarter profit. Indeed, from its $1.12 billion in total revenues, Shopify managed to generate $879.1 million in GAAP net income. How? The outsized profit came in part thanks to $778 million in unrealized gains related to equity investments. But even with those gains filtered out, Shopify&#8217;s adjusted net income of $284.6 million more than doubled its year-ago Q2 result of $129.4 million. Shopify&#8217;s earnings per share sans unrealized gains came to $2.24, far ahead of an expected 97 cents.</p>
<p>After reporting those results, Shopify shares are up less than a point.</p>
<p>In light of somewhat muted reactions to Big Tech earnings surpassing expectations, it&#8217;s increasingly clear that investors were anticipating that leading tech companies would trounce expectations in the second quarter; their earnings beats were largely priced-in ahead of the individual reports.</p>
<p>The rest of Shopify&#8217;s quarter is a series of huge figures. In the second three-month period of 2021, the company posted gross merchandise volume (GMV) of $42.2 billion, up 40% compared to the year-ago period. That was more than a billion dollars <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3719731-shopify-q2-2021-earnings-preview">ahead of expectations</a>. And the company&#8217;s monthly recurring revenue (MRR) grew 67% to $95.1 million in the quarter. That&#8217;s quick.</p>
<p>Shopify is priced like the growth will continue. Using its Q2 revenue result to generate an annual run rate for the firm, Shopify is currently valued at around 43x its present top line. That&#8217;s aggressive for a company that generates the minority of its revenues from recurring software fees, an investor favorite. Instead, investors seem content to pay what is effectively top dollar for the company&#8217;s blend of GMV-based service revenues and more traditional software incomes.</p>
<p>Consider the public markets bullish on the continued pace of e-commerce growth.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how BigCommerce, a Shopify competitor and fellow public company, performs when it reports earnings in early August. Shares of BigCommerce are up more than 3% today in wake of Shopify&#8217;s results. Ironic given Shopify&#8217;s relaxed market reaction to its own results? Sure, but who said the public markets are fair?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the minutes before its quarterly earnings call this morning, Spotify played advertisements for its Originals &amp; Exclusives, like the true crime show &#8220;Deathbed Confessions,&#8221; and the sex and relationships podcast &#8220;Call Her Daddy,&#8221; which Spotify recently acquired in <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/spotify-call-her-daddy-alex-cooper-exclusive-1234996840/">a deal worth $60 million</a>. Sure, it&#8217;s kind of hilarious to hear a recording of host Alex Cooper&#8217;s voice say, &#8220;Hey, daddy gang!&#8221; as investors log in to an 8 AM call, but the subtext rang clear: Spotify is serious about growing its podcast business.</p>
<p>Given how many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/spotify-acquires-podz-a-podcast-discovery-app/">podcasting companies</a> Spotify has acquired over the past few years, it would be concerning if there hadn&#8217;t been significant growth in this realm. Among Spotify users who already listen to podcasts, podcast listening increased 30% year over year, with total hours consumed up 95%. Meanwhile, podcast ad revenue increased by 627%, which out-performed expectations. Spotify attributes this success to a triple-digit year over year gain at its in-house studios (The Ringer, Parcast, Spotify Studios, and Gimlet), and exclusive deals with &#8220;The Joe Rogan Experience&#8221; and the Obamas&#8217; Higher Ground studio. Spotify also referenced its November <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">acquisition of Megaphone</a>, a podcast hosting and ad company.</p>
<p>&#8220;The continued out-performance is is currently limited only by the availability of our inventory, which is something we&#8217;re actively solving for,&#8221; said CEO Daniel Ek. &#8220;The days of our ad business accounting for less than 10% of our total revenue are behind us, and going forward, I expect ads to be a substantial part of our revenue mix.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In April, Spotify launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/spotify-launches-paid-podcasts-through-new-anchor-feature/">paid podcast subscriptions</a> &#8212; through Anchor, the podcast host that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">bought in 2019</a>, creators can choose to certain content behind a paywall. Apple launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-go-live-worldwide/">similar feature</a> too, but it&#8217;s still too early to know how these subscription services will impact listeners and creators. However, Spotify did share a bit more information about its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-spotify-audience-network-an-audio-ad-marketplace/">Audience Network</a>, an audio ad marketplace. Since its rollout in April, Spotify&#8217;s &#8220;monetizable podcast inventory&#8221; tripled. Spotify has also seen a &#8220;meaningful&#8221; increase in unique advertisers and a &#8220;double-digit lift&#8221; in CPMs (cost per thousand ad impressions), but didn&#8217;t provide specific figures.</p>
<p>Still, the more power a platform like Spotify has over the podcasting industry, the fewer options creators will have for monetization &#8212; already, the ubiquity of streaming platforms has taken a toll on musicians, who are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/justice-at-spotify-demands-better-compensation-and-increased-transparency-for-musicians/">working together</a> to demand better compensation from Spotify. The <a href="https://www.unionofmusicians.org/justice-at-spotify">Justice at Spotify</a> movement points out that on average, artists get $0.0038 per stream of a song, which means that a song needs to be streamed 263 times to make a single dollar. Spotify has continued to grow during the pandemic, but since live shows are musicians&#8217; best way to make money in the age of streaming, artists have struggled while it&#8217;s unsafe to go on tour.</p>

<p>On this morning&#8217;s earnings call, Ek pointed to live performances on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Greenroom</a>, Spotify&#8217;s Clubhouse clone, as a potential way for musicians to increase revenue. In the past quarter, Spotify has tested <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/spotify-launches-a-virtual-concert-series-with-the-black-keys-and-more/">live concerts</a> as an income stream, partnering with artists like The Black Keys. Still, smaller artists might not trust the platform given its refusal to make streaming itself a more viable way to get paid for their work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Live is a meaningful thing for many of our creators, and it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re excited about,&#8221; said Ek, adding that Spotify saw positive results from its digital live events thus far. &#8220;We want to provide as many opportunities for creators to create more ways to turn a listen into a fan, and turn fans into super fans, and increase the monetization for those creators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Spotify missed its target for monthly active users (MAUs) in Q2, other key metrics trended upward, like paid subscriber growth and revenue. The platform attributes this road bump in MAU growth to the lingering impact of COVID-19, as well as an issue Spotify had with its third-party email verification system.</p>
<p>&#8220;In full disclosure, this was an issue on our end,&#8221; said CFO Paul Vogel. &#8220;The estimate right now was that it was about 1 to 2 million of MAU growth that was impacted by the friction created by this email verification change. It&#8217;s since been corrected and should not be an impact in Q3.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of Spotify&#8217;s 365 million MAUs, 165 million (about 42.5%) are paid subscribers &#8212; that&#8217;s still far beyond its next biggest competitor, Apple Music, which had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/apple-music-surpasses-60-million-subscribers/">60 million subscribers</a> in 2019, but hasn&#8217;t released updated figures since.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Anomaly detection is one of the more difficult and underserved operational areas in the asset-servicing sector of financial institutions. Broadly speaking, a true anomaly is one that deviates from the norm of the expected or the familiar. Anomalies can be the result of incompetence, maliciousness, system errors, accidents or the product of shifts in the underlying structure of day-to-day processes.</p>
<p>For the financial services industry, detecting anomalies is critical, as they may be indicative of illegal activities such as fraud, identity theft, network intrusion, account takeover or money laundering, which may result in undesired outcomes for both the institution and the individual.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			There are different ways to address the challenge of anomaly detection, including supervised and unsupervised learning.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Detecting outlier data, or anomalies according to historic data patterns and trends can enrich a financial institution’s operational team by increasing their understanding and preparedness.</p>
<h2>The challenge of detecting anomalies</h2>
<p>Anomaly detection presents a unique challenge for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, the financial services industry has seen an increase in the volume and complexity of data in recent years. In addition, a large emphasis has been placed on the quality of data, turning it into a way to measure the health of an institution.</p>
<p>To make matters more complicated, anomaly detection requires the prediction of something that has not been seen before or prepared for. The increase in data and the fact that it is constantly changing exacerbates the challenge further.</p>
<h2>Leveraging machine learning</h2>
<p>There are different ways to address the challenge of anomaly detection, including supervised and unsupervised learning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Single-use plastic containers make up a huge amount of the world&#8217;s waste, but so far no one has come up with a good way to replace them that&#8217;s also easy for consumers and cost-effective. <a href="https://algramo.com/en/home/">Algramo</a> may have cracked this nut with a combination of reusable containers and distribution points that both makes and saves money, and it&#8217;s about to expand its footprint in a big way with a new $8.5M funding round.</p>
<p>Founded in Chile nearly a decade ago, Algramo is now findings its legs as companies in multiple industries find themselves under immense pressure to go green.</p>
<p>One compelling way to reduce waste is to cut down on single-use plastics, which of course are common for everything from cleaning supplies to soft drinks. The difficulty is figuring out how exactly to do that while not passing the cost on to consumers. If the product is eco-friendly but costs twice as much, only the wealthy will buy it and those working on a tight budget have to go, against their better judgment, with the cheaper, worse option.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;People are deciding between their pocket or their planet,&#8221; said CEO José Manuel Moller. &#8220;So we needed to be cheaper and better. So rather than make things more complex, we&#8217;re trying to make things more simple.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182734" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/José-Manuel-Moller-Founder-and-CEO-Algramo-and-Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182734" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2182734" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/José-Manuel-Moller-Founder-and-CEO-Algramo-and-Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station.png" alt="José Manuel Moller (Founder and CEO Algramo) and Unilever_s Mobile Refill Station" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/José-Manuel-Moller-Founder-and-CEO-Algramo-and-Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/José-Manuel-Moller-Founder-and-CEO-Algramo-and-Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/José-Manuel-Moller-Founder-and-CEO-Algramo-and-Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/José-Manuel-Moller-Founder-and-CEO-Algramo-and-Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/José-Manuel-Moller-Founder-and-CEO-Algramo-and-Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/José-Manuel-Moller-Founder-and-CEO-Algramo-and-Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2182734" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Algramo</p></div></p>
<p>The solution they&#8217;ve arrived at after years of testing is a modified label for existing products, like detergent or shampoo, that includes an RFID tag that lets the consumer easily refill the bottle at a dispenser. Sold at bulk prices and having removed the cost of packaging (30 percent of the product&#8217;s cost, Moller estimated), it&#8217;s cheaper and requires nothing but going to a different shelf at the store.</p>
<p>The breakthrough wasn&#8217;t the idea, though, it was the relationships with big brands. If someone has to drive past their normal grocery store to refill your dish soap, they&#8217;re more likely to just buy a new bottle. Similarly, if only products on offer for bulk refilling are random off-brand ones, the same thing happens. So Algramo has had to make the case to the Walmarts and Unilevers of the world — and very recently they started to listen, at least at the local level.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was going to happen with or without Algramo,&#8221; said CEO José Manuel Moller. &#8220;But we&#8217;re integrating into their supply chains, working with the retailers and the brand so they don&#8217;t disrupt existing relationships. And actually, ordering the product in bulk saves them about 60 percent of the space.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are arrangements in place with Unilever, Nestlé, Colgate-Palmolive, and Walmart Chile.  By offering a turnkey solution that brings together big brands and big retailers and saves consumers a little cash, everyone gets what they want. Originally Algramo operated using a fleet of small vehicles equipped with dispensers, but ultimately the retail avenue proved to be the more successful one.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182735" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182735" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2182735" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station1.jpg" alt="Unilever_s Mobile Refill Station(1)" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station1.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Unilever_s-Mobile-Refill-Station1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2182735" class="wp-caption-text">The vehicles still exist, though, as this kid is happy to emphasize.</p></div></p>
<p>There are now Algramo stations all over Chile, with around 50,000 users repurchasing products in bulk. Those products, by the way, were determined not by profitability but by which is the worst polluter. The worst by far, Moller said, is beverages, but those present a different challenge — one the company is happily taking on but not quite ready to debut.</p>
<p>Instead, there are frequently used products like laundry soap and toiletries — even dog food (dry, obviously&#8230; for now). And Algramo was careful to ensure that users can buy as much or as little as they want at the bulk rate, making it more accessible for people who have to make every penny count.</p>
<p>The work in Chile has helped validate the idea at scale, and now the company is raising money ahead of a smattering of pilots around the world. There are projects underway in Jakarta, New York, Mexico, and London, all of which no doubt require a lot of local footwork, since different regulations, sub-companies, and distribution networks will necessitate new contracts and agreements everywhere they attempt to make a beachhead.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what the $8.5M series A is all about: the global push. It was led by Mexico&#8217;s Dalus Capital, with participation from (deep breath) Angel Ventures, FEMSA Ventures, Volta Ventures, Impact Assets, University Venture Fund, Century Oak Capital and Closed Loop Partners’ Ventures Group (the last of which led the 2019 seed).</p>

<p>Moller said that there are parallel efforts along the lines of Algramo, but that ultimately their platform may very well end up compatible with the others. Owning both the retail and brand relationships is paramount, then those with the customer, but the last step may be adapted to different circumstances. For instance, if there&#8217;s a successful reverse logistics system in place (such as the reusable food containers common all over India) that may be part of the solution, and if someone like a grocery chain were to build their own hardware solution, Algramo would be happy to operate at least partly behind the scenes. (Also, they own several patents.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all pie in the sky for now, as Algramo focuses on building its own presence in various major markets. If you&#8217;re in one of the locations mentioned, keep your eye out at your local big retail or grocery chain for the Algramo station, or just <a href="https://algramo.com/en/home/">check the map at the bottom of their website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What’s big enough, bold enough and influential enough to inspire more than 10,000 people around the world to carve out three days from their intensely busy schedules? If you said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=48hoursleft&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=48hoursleft&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>, the grand matriarch of startup tech conferences, well friend, you’d be right on the money.</p>
<p>And speaking of money, you have just 48 hours left to score the early-bird price on TC Disrupt Innovator, Founder and Investor passes. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=48hoursleft&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=48hoursleft&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy any of these passes</a> and attend all three days of Disrupt for less than $100. Here’s the catch: The early bird price expires on <strong>July 30 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>Don’t miss the dynamic 1:1 interviews and panel discussions on the Disrupt Stage. We’ve tapped high-profile speakers — all leading voices in their fields — to download their insight, trends and sage advice. You’ll hear U.S. Secretary of Transportation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/us-secretary-of-transportation-pete-buttigieg-is-coming-to-disrupt-draft/">Pete Buttigieg</a> discuss some of the major challenges of moving people and packages around the block and across the globe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Houseplant COO, Haneen Davies will join company co-founders Michael Mohr and Seth Rogen — who, it seems, has a somewhat successful side hustle as a Hollywood writer, director and actor — for a lively CBD: Cannabis Business Discussion.</p>
<p>Head on over to the Extra Crunch Stage where you’ll find strategic insight across a range of essential startup skills. Think fundraising, product iteration, tech stack development and growth marketing.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick peek at just some of what’s going down Extra Crunchy.</p>
<p><strong>How to Cultivate a Community for your Company that Actually Lasts:</strong> The word of the year in startup-land is “community.” In this panel, Community Fund’s Lolita Taub, Commsor’s Alex Angel and Seven Seven Six’s Katelin Holloway will extract buzz from reality and help founders understand the growing importance of chief community officers in startup culture and, ultimately, financial success today.</p>
<p><strong>The Path for Underrepresented Entrepreneurs:</strong> Founding a startup comes with a wide array of challenges but, unfortunately, underrepresented founders face an extra layer of bias, both conscious and unconscious. We’ll talk with Hana Mohan (MagicBell), Leslie Feinzaig (Female Founders Alliance) and Stephen Bailey (ExecOnline) about their journeys, as founders, through fundraising and scaling — and as advocates who can offer tactical insights and advice.</p>
<p>We’re just warming up, folks. You’ll hear from execs, founders and CEOs from companies like Twitter, Calendly, Mirror, Evil Geniuses, Andreessen Horowitz and plenty more. Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">the Disrupt 2021 agenda</a>. We’ll add even more speakers, events and ticket discounts in the coming weeks. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#6141988e-b433-4082-ad44-e4b86a66c471">Register for updates</a> so you don’t miss out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We know how much you love a good startup pitch-off. Who doesn&#8217;t? It combines the thrill of live, high-stakes entertainment with learning about the hottest new thing. Plus, you get to hear feedback from some of the smartest folks in the industry, thus learning how to absolutely crush it at your next pitch meeting with a VC.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, we&#8217;re introducing a special summer edition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> that&#8217;s all pitch-off, all the time.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition?ref=12c1c3225394">July 21</a> and <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition-july-28?ref=05f802c5b3e8">July 28</a>, Extra Crunch Live will feature startups exhibiting in the Startup Alley at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ecljuly2021suapost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=eclsuajuly&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September. Those startups will pitch their products/businesses to a pair of expert VC judges, who will then give their live feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is usually a combination of an interview with a founder/investor duo and an audience pitch-off. But as it&#8217;s summer, and Disrupt is right around the corner, we thought it would be fun to bring you even more pitches and even more feedback.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On July 21, our expert VC judges will be Alexa von Tobel of Inspired Capital and Anis Uzzaman from Pegasus Tech Ventures. As a special thank you, all attendees of this episode of Extra Crunch Live will be entered into a random drawing for a chance to win one of three free tickets to TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. Following the event, we&#8217;ll randomly select 3 winners and send details on how to redeem their passes. Do you need to submit any additional information to enter the drawing? Nope. All you need to do is register for Extra Crunch Live by clicking the link below and attend the event on July 21st.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the user interface concept Google debuted today, developers are now able to see how this feature will look to the end user.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of Apple&#8217;s advances into consumer privacy with initiatives like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency">App Tracking Transparency</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">App Store privacy labels</a>, Google recently announced its own plans to introduce a new &#8220;<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">safety section</a>&#8221; on Google Play that offers more information about the data apps collect and share, and other security and privacy details. Today, the company is sharing for the first time what the new section&#8217;s user interface will look like, along with other requirements for developers.</p>
<p>In May, Google <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">explained</a> the safety section would be designed to easily communicate to users how apps are handling their data so they could make informed choices. It said app developers would need to disclose to users whether their app uses security practices like data encryption, whether it follows Google Play&#8217;s Families policy for apps aimed at kids, whether users have a choice in data sharing, whether the app&#8217;s safety section had been verified by a third party, and if the app allowed users to request data deletion at the time of uninstalling, among other things.</p>
<p>In the user interface concept Google debuted today, developers are now able to see how this feature will look to the end user.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the safety section, users will be able to see the developer&#8217;s explanation of what data the app collects followed by those other details, each with its own icon to serve as a visual indicator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">When users tap into the summary, they&#8217;ll be able to then see other details like what data is collected or shared &#8212; such as location, contacts, personal information (e.g., name, email address), financial information and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">They&#8217;ll also be able to see how the data is used &#8212; for app functionality, </span>personalization<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, etc. &#8212; and whether data collection is optional. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183102" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183102" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2183102" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183102" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Google says it wants to give developers plenty of time to prepare for these Play Store changes, which is why it&#8217;s now sharing more information about the data type definitions, user journey and policy requirements of the new feature. </span></p>
<p>It notes that all developers will have to provide a privacy policy by April 2022. Before, only apps that collected personal and sensitive user data were required to do so. Developers will also be required to share accurate and complete information about all the data in their safety section, including how it&#8217;s used by the app&#8217;s third-party libraries and SDKs. This is in line with what Apple demands for its apps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183103" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183103" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2183103" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/timeline.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/timeline.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/timeline.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/timeline.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/timeline.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/timeline.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/timeline.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183103" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In October 2021, developers will be able to submit their information in the Google Play Console for review ahead of the planned launch of the safety section in Google Play, which is scheduled for the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>The company also notes it&#8217;s offering some buffer time after the section&#8217;s launch before apps must have their safety section approved by Google. However, the company says apps will have to be approved by Q2 2022 or risk having their app submissions or app updates rejected. And if an app doesn&#8217;t provide an approved safety section, the app will say &#8220;No information available.&#8221;</p>
<p>The change will help highlight how many active developers are present on Google Play, because those will be the ones who will adopt the new policy and showcase how their apps collect and use data.</p>
<p>The question that remains is how stringent Google will be about enforcing its new guidelines and how carefully apps will be reviewed. One interesting note here is that conscientious developers will be able to submit their safety section for a third-party review and then be able to promote that to users concerned about app data privacy and security.</p>
<p>This could help to address some potential criticism that these safety sections aren&#8217;t factual. That&#8217;s been a problem for Apple since the launch of its App Store privacy labels. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/29/apple-privacy-nutrition-label/">The Washington Post discovered</a> that a number of apps were displaying false information, making them less helpful to the users whose data they aimed to protect.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, however, Google declined to share more details about how the third-party verification process will work.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Duolingo, a consumer edtech company, is now more valuable per revenue dollar than the median public enterprise SaaS business.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the Chinese technology market digests a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">new regulatory landscape</a> impacting the country&#8217;s edtech market in a sharply negative manner, U.S. education technology companies have something to cheer about: Duolingo&#8217;s IPO priced very well.</p>
<p>The language-learning unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/duolingos-ipo-could-cast-golden-halo-on-edtech-startups/">initially targeted an $85 to $95 per share IPO price range</a>. That interval was later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/duolingo-boosts-ipo-price-target-in-boon-to-edtech-startups/">raised to $95 to $100 per share</a>. And then, last night, Duolingo <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/duolingo-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering-301342683.html">priced at $102 per share</a>, just over its raised range.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the sort of IPO pricing run that we tend to see from hot enterprise software companies (SaaS) that investors have favored heavily in recent quarters. But the stock market has also provided nigh-indulgent valuations to consumer-facing tech companies with strong brands, like Airbnb. So, the Duolingo IPO&#8217;s pricing strength should not be an utter surprise.</p>
<p>But it is a welcome result for U.S. edtech, regardless. When the company set its first IPO price range, TechCrunch noted that it was on track to earn a new, higher valuation. This led us to the following set of conclusions:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Duolingo poses a strong debut, consumer edtech startups will be able to add a golden data point to their pitch decks. A strong Duolingo listing could also signal that mission-driven startups can have impressive turns.</p></blockquote>
<p>And now Duolingo has managed to price <em>above</em> its <em>raised</em> range. Yeehaw, as they say.</p>
<p>In more prosaic terms, Duolingo has set a higher multiple for edtech revenue than we expected it to, implying that the exit value of edtech top line could be greater than private-market investors anticipated. After all, Duolingo was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/language-learning-app-duolingo-confirms-it-has-raised-35m-on-a-2-4b-valuation/">valued at around $2.4 billion last November</a>. At its IPO price, the company&#8217;s nondiluted valuation is now $3.66 billion, not counting 765,916 shares that its underwriters may purchase at the $102-per-share price if they so choose.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[The startup gives teams a way to streamline the commission process and avoid inaccurate budgets, payouts, and 'unhappy sales reps due to poor sales commission planning, reporting and administration.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://quotapath.com">QuotaPath</a>, which has developed a commission-tracking solution for sales and revenue teams, has raised $21.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Insight Partners.</p>
<p>Existing backers ATX Ventures, Integr8d Capital, Stage 2 Capital and HubSpot Ventures also participated in the financing, which brings the startup&#8217;s total funding to $26.3 million since its 2018 inception.</p>
<p>The funding comes amid a year of growth for the startup, which has dual headquarters in Austin and Philadelphia. Specifically, QuotaPath has seen 600% revenue growth since January 2021. It has over 5,000 users on the platform, 40% of which are paid. Customers include Guru, Contractbook, Mailgun, Cloud Academy, SaaSOptics and OSG.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AJ Bruno, Cole Evetts and Eric Heydenberk founded QuotaPath with the mission of helping “companies build and scale high-performing, motivated growth teams.” The startup said it gives teams a way to streamline the commission process and avoid inaccurate budgets, incorrect payouts, and “unhappy sales reps due to poor sales commission planning, reporting and administration.”</p>
<p>Through real-time CRM integrations with Salesforce, HubSpot and Close.com, sales reps are able to glean more insight into earnings and quota attainment, the company said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;6 VCs talk the future of Austin&#8217;s exploding startup ecosystem&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/6-vcs-talk-the-future-of-austins-exploding-startup-ecosystem/embed/#?secret=4R84dtUNiB" data-secret="4R84dtUNiB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Bruno is no stranger to startups, having co-founded Austin-based PR analytics company TrendKite, which sold to rival Cision in 2019 for $225 million. It was there that Bruno ran the sales and management teams, and about “30 folks into it,” was having some issues with compensation and commission. It took a month and getting several people involved to get the situation sorted. After trying to onboard a sales and commission tool for eight months and “failing miserably,” Bruno saw an opportunity.</p>
<p>“The reps needed to understand what their comp plans were and they didn&#8217;t have real-time visibility into the earnings and forecasting of their compensation,” he said. So he and Evetts (who was director of revenue and sales operations at TrendKite) ultimately set about creating a workflow to solve the problem. Heydenberk joined as a technical co-founder and the company went on to raise about $5 million in pre-seed and seed funding.</p>
<p>“What we ultimately said was going to be our north star is that we want the sales team and the sales reps to easily understand the compensation plans, and to do that, we had to build an onboarding setup where it didn&#8217;t look like a spreadsheet that was in Excel because most sales reps don&#8217;t understand Excel,” Bruno recalled. The team then spent a year working with end users and sales reps to build the back-end infrastructure of the platform so that sales teams could “interpret what was actually happening and all the mechanisms behind it.”</p>
<p>Requirements were that it was fast to onboard (less than one week) and easily adjustable so that customers could make changes in real-time themselves and not have to wait on a company to make them.</p>
<p>“With QuotaPath, a sales team can forecast more earnings and create more goals around what they want to do,” Bruno said, “and connect those goals to the bottom line of the company.”</p>

<p>The startup launched its paid platform in June 2020 and works with companies with as few as three reps to as many as a few hundred that range from SaaS to commerce shops to low-tech businesses such as wedding venues and funeral homes.</p>
<p>“With 10.5 million salespeople in the U.S., this is a very large market,” Bruno said. Indeed, there are a number of other startups addressing the space. Earlier this year,<a href="http://captivateiq.com/"> CaptivateIQ</a>, which has developed a no-code platform to help companies design customized sales commission plans, announced it had raised $46 million in a Series B round led by Accel.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>QuotaPath currently has 28 employees and plans to use its new capital to double its headcount by year’s end. It also plans to work on scaling partnerships and expanding product offerings to finance and HR functions.</p>
<p>Rachel Geller, managing director at Insight Partners, is taking a seat on the company’s board as part of the financing. She said that a priority of Insight Onsite, the firm’s ScaleUp engine, is to help its portfolio “build high-performing and scalable sales and marketing functions.”</p>
<p>“Our sales experts are in the trenches understanding the challenges sales teams face, and tracking sales commissions is top of mind,” she said. “Organizations need a formula-free solution to their current pain of spreadsheets and legacy solutions, and QuotaPath presents a clear alternative.”</p>
<p>In particular, Geller said Insight was impressed by QuotaPath’s “ease of use and fast time to deploy” compared to other solutions.</p>
<p>“QuotaPath customers can be up and running in days,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter this morning will launch a pilot in the U.S. aimed at testing the potential for e-commerce on its platform. The company is introducing a new &#8220;Shop Module&#8221; that offers brands, businesses and other retailers the ability to showcase their products to Twitter users directly on the business&#8217; profile. Users will then be able to scroll through a carousel of product images in the module and tap through on a product they&#8217;re interested in purchasing. This opens up the business&#8217;s website inside the Twitter app itself, where the customer can learn more about the product in question and opt to make a purchase.</p>
<p>The Shop Module will appear in a new, dedicated space at the top of a supported Twitter profile, which can be seen by U.S. users in English on iOS devices.</p>
<p>The company told TechCrunch that only businesses with a Professional Profile will be able to use the feature at this time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Professional Profiles, which <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBusiness/status/1384968745156755458">began testing in April</a>, give businesses, nonprofits, publishers and creators the ability to display specific information about their business directly on their profile, including things like their address, phone number, operating hours and more. Essentially, it&#8217;s the Twitter equivalent to something like a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/pages/set-up">Facebook Page</a> for a business.</p>
<p>At launch, the new Shop Module will be made available to only a small group of pilot testers. In addition to gaming retailer <a href="https://twitter.com/GameStop" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/GameStop&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627564431868000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg0cqZDRjihyEmld5SL90gWhxMyQ">@GameStop</a> and travel brand <a href="https://twitter.com/ArdenCove" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/ArdenCove&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627564431868000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8ppJKhlLMylrdio9TEqhhboJCqg">@ArdenCove</a>, Twitter says there will only be approximately 10 other brands across the lifestyle, traditional retail, gaming, media and entertainment, tech and telco industries who will gain access to the new feature.</p>
<p>At present, Twitter isn&#8217;t offering a way for interested businesses to sign up for the pilot because the company is only in the initial phases of testing this feature, it said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183081" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183081" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2183081" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Arden-Cove-GIF.gif?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183081" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>While Twitter users often discuss products on the app and even reach out to companies directly for help with purchases, it&#8217;s unclear whether users will come to view Twitter as a shopping platform.</p>
<p>With the pilot, Twitter aims to better understand what could help it make that shift by tracking which types of products drive traffic to online retailers. For example, it wants to determine whether people are inspired by online conversations in the heat of the moment &#8212; like sports fans buying team apparel &#8212; or whether Twitter users could be encouraged to make purchases of a more lasting impact, like products for a new skincare routine. Having a diverse lineup of early pilot testers will help the company to compare data across verticals to learn what works best.</p>
<p>Twitter says it will also work directly with businesses to better understand their needs through the creation of a new Merchant Advisory Board, which will consist of &#8220;best-in-class examples&#8221; of merchants on Twitter.</p>
<p>The company earlier this year mentioned its plans to expand into e-commerce. At <a href="https://investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/twitter-analyst-day/default.aspx">Twitter&#8217;s Analyst Day</a> presentation in February, where it first announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">its Super Follow platform</a> for creators, the company also briefly spoke about its e-commerce investments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re … starting to explore ways to better support commerce on Twitter,” Twitter revenue lead Bruce Falck said during the event. “We know people come to Twitter to interact with brands and discuss their favorite products. In fact, you may have even noticed some businesses already developing creative ways to enable sales on our platform.</p>
<p>“This demand gives us confidence in the power of combining real-time conversation with an engaged and intentional audience. Imagine easily discovering, and quickly purchasing, a new skincare product or trendy sneaker from a brand you follow with only a few clicks,” Falck added.</p>
<p>Since then, Twitter has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/twitter-tests-new-e-commerce-features-for-tweets/">tested a new e-commerce feature for tweets</a>, which allowed businesses to link out to online product pages &#8212; like those on a Shopify store, for instance.</p>

<p>Twitter CFO Ned Segal <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/social-commerce/2021/twitter-cfo-points-to-ecommerce-for-future-monetization/">also touted</a> the potential to shop on Twitter when speaking to investors at the J.P. Morgan Technology, Media and Communications conference in May, noting that people &#8220;do a lot of research on Twitter before they buy something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s entry into online shopping comes at a time when major tech companies and social platforms are ramping up their investments in e-commerce. Facebook has made significant moves into e-commerce with shopping features across <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/facebook-shops/">Facebook, Instagram</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/facebook-whatsapp-e-commerce-features/">WhatsApp</a>, including with initiatives like online storefronts, integrated <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-instagram-checkout">checkout</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/instagram-launches-a-new-section-for-shopping-product-drops/">product drops</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/instagram-expands-shopping-on-igtv-plans-test-of-shopping-on-reels/">video shopping</a> and more.</p>
<p>Shopify has also partnered with a number of tech platforms, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/shopify-expands-its-one-click-checkout-shop-pay-to-any-merchant-on-facebook-or-google/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/">Google</a>, to make it easier for consumers to connect with products sold by its merchants.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Twitter previously attempted to run a commerce operation and failed. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/17/bye-buy-on-twitter/">In 2017, the company began to wind down its &#8220;Buy&#8221; button product</a>, which had allowed Twitter users to click to make purchases, and the retailer partnerships associated with that effort due to lack of traction. Clearly, the company believes the time is now right to try again.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A review of the logs by TechCrunch found contact information, details of parking tickets and parking offenses, and some partial card payment numbers and expiry dates.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you parked your car in one of the thousands of parking spots across Calgary, there&#8217;s a good chance you paid the Calgary Parking Authority for the privilege. But soon you might be hearing from the authority after a recent security lapse exposed the personal information of vehicle owners.</p>
<p>The parking authority oversees about 14% of the paid parking spots in the Calgary region, and lets drivers pay to park their cars by a parking kiosk, online, or through the phone app by entering their vehicle&#8217;s license plate number and payment details.</p>
<p>But a logging server used to monitor the authority&#8217;s parking system for bugs and errors was left on the internet without a password. The server contained computer-readable technical logs, but also real-world events like payments and parking tickets that contained a driver&#8217;s personal information.</p>
<p>A review of the logs by TechCrunch found contact information, like driver&#8217;s full names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses and postal addresses, as well as details of parking tickets and parking offenses — which included license plates and vehicle descriptions — and in some cases the location data of where the alleged parking offense took place. The logs also contained some partial card payment numbers and expiry dates.</p>
<p>None of the data was encrypted.</p>
<p>Because the server&#8217;s data was entangled with logs and other computer-readable data, it&#8217;s not known exactly how many people had their information exposed by the security lapse. (In 2019, the Calgary Parking Authority issued <a href="https://financialpost.com/entrepreneur/fp-startups/for-small-business-success-listening-to-your-critics-is-just-as-important-as-listening-to-your-fans">more than 450,000 parking tickets</a>, up by 69% in five years.)</p>
<p>Security researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/hak1mlukha">Anurag Sen</a> found the exposed server and asked TechCrunch for help in reporting it to its owner. The server was secured on Tuesday, a day after TechCrunch contacted the authority.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the authority confirmed that the server was exposed since May 13, though data seen by TechCrunch shows records dating back to at least the start of the year. The authority also told TechCrunch that the exposure was due to human error and that it was investigating its logs to determine if anyone else had access to the server.</p>
<p>&#8220;We at the CPA take this very seriously,&#8221; Moe Houssaini, the acting general manager for the Calgary Parking Authority, told TechCrunch in a statement. &#8220;Any public access has been disabled and we are actively investigating to determine what exact data was impacted and what unauthorized access may have occurred. We apologize to our customers and will be reaching out to all individuals who may have been impacted. Protecting the security of our systems and privacy of our customers is a top priority of the CPA. It was an isolated error, and the database has now been secured. We are reviewing our procedures to ensure that this does not happen again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Calgary Parking Authority recently made headlines after it <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7824723/calgary-parking-authority-cancels-tickets-vaccine-clinic/">canceled</a> more than a thousand parking tickets for drivers who were attending a COVID-19 vaccination center in the city.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, New York-based cashless parking startup ParkMobile <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/parkmobile-breach-exposes-license-plate-data-mobile-numbers-of-21m-users/">reported a data breach</a> that saw personal account information and license plates on some 21 million customers taken by hackers. The company blamed the breach on <a href="https://support.parkmobile.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058639032-Security-Notification-March-2021">a vulnerability</a> in an unspecified piece of third-party software.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Elon Musk mused that Tesla's batteries may eventually be two-thirds iron-based and one-third nickel-based across its products. 'And this is actually good because there’s plenty of iron in the world.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk earlier this week made his most bullish statements yet on iron-based batteries, noting that Tesla is making a “long-term shift” toward older, cheaper lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cells in its energy storage products and some entry-level EVs.</p>
<p>The Tesla CEO mused that the company&#8217;s batteries may eventually be roughly two-thirds iron-based and one-third nickel-based across its products. “And this is actually good because there’s plenty of iron in the world,” he added.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s comments reflect a change that is already underway within the automotive sector, mainly in China. Battery chemistries outside of China have been predominantly nickel-based &#8212; specifically nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) and nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA). These newer chemistries have become attractive to automakers due to their higher energy density, letting original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) improve the range of their batteries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If Musk&#8217;s bullishness is heralding a genuine shift across the EV industry, the question is whether battery makers outside of China will be able to keep up.</p>
<p>Musk is not the only automotive executive to signal a return to the LFP formula. Earlier this year, Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company would use LFP batteries in some commercial vehicles. Meanwhile, Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess announced during the company’s inaugural battery day presentation that LFP would be used in some VW entry-level EVs.</p>
<p>On the energy storage front, Musk&#8217;s comments about using LFP-based chemistries in Powerwall and Megapack are in line with other stationary energy storage companies pushing for iron-based formulas. “The stationary storage industry wants to move to LFP because it&#8217;s cheaper,” Sam Jaffe, who heads the battery research firm Cairn Energy Research Advisors, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>LFP battery cells are attractive for a few different reasons. For one, they’re not dependent on ultra-scarce and price-volatile raw materials like cobalt and nickel. (Cobalt, which is predominantly sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo, has undergone additional scrutiny due to inhumane mining conditions.) And while they are less energy-dense than nickel-based chemistries, LFP batteries are much cheaper. This is good news for those looking to spur the shift to electric vehicles because lowering the cost per vehicle will likely be key to greater EV adoption.</p>
<p>Musk clearly sees a major future for iron-based chemistries at Tesla, and his comments have helped thrust LFP back into the spotlight. But there&#8217;s one place where they&#8217;ve remained the star of the show: China.</p>
<h2>China’s monopoly on LFP</h2>
<p>“LFP is pretty much only produced in China,” Caspar Rawles, head of price and data assessments at the research firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explained in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>China’s dominance in LFP battery production in part relates to a series of key LFP patents, which are managed by a consortium of universities and research institutions. This consortium came to an agreement with Chinese battery makers a decade ago under which the manufacturers would not be charged a licensing fee providing that the LFP batteries were used only in Chinese markets.</p>
<p>Hence, China cornered the LFP market.</p>
<p>Battery makers in China may benefit most from a potential tectonic shift toward LFP &#8212; specifically BYD and CATL, the latter of which already manufactures LFP batteries for Tesla vehicles built and sold in China. (Volkswagen, meanwhile, has a substantial stake in Chinese LFP maker Gotion High-Tech.) These b<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">attery makers aren’t slowing down: In January, CATL and Shenzhen Dynanonic signed an agreement with a local Chinese province to build an LFP cathode plant at a cost of $280 million over three years.</span></p>
<p>The LFP patents are due to expire in 2022, industry analyst <a href="https://roskill.com/news/batteries-the-true-drivers-behind-lfp-demand-new-safety-standards-costs-ip-rights-esg-simplified-battery-pack-designs/">Roskill explains</a>, which could give battery manufacturers outside China time to start shifting some of their production toward iron-based formulas. However, all of the planned battery factories in Europe and North America, many of which are joint ventures with South Korean industry giants like LG Chem or SK Innovation, are still focused on nickel-based chemistries.</p>
<p>“For the U.S. to take advantage of LFP&#8217;s strengths, North American manufacturing will be necessary,” Jaffe explained. “Everyone building a gigafactory in the U.S. today is planning on making high nickel chemistries. There&#8217;s an enormous unmet need for locally manufactured LFP batteries.”</p>
<p>Rawles said he expects some LFP capacity in North America and Europe in the coming years, particularly after the patents expire. He pointed out that both CATL and SVOLT, another battery maker, have been making moves in Germany &#8212; but both of these companies are Chinese, which leaves open the question of whether other Asian or Western companies can compete in the LFP market. (Stellantis chose SVOLT as one of its battery suppliers from 2025 onwards.)</p>
<p>On the energy storage front, Jaffe said he thinks “it&#8217;s inevitable that most stationary storage systems will eventually be LFP.”</p>
<p>However, not all is lost for domestic manufacturing in the United States. “The good news for building local LFP manufacturing is that the supply chain is simple: Outside of lithium, it&#8217;s iron and phosphoric acid, two cheap materials already made [in the U.S.] in large quantities,” Jaffe added.</p>
<p>In the end, it is not a question of one battery chemistry versus another. What’s more likely is what we’ve already started to see from automakers, including Tesla: Iron-based batteries will be used predominately in entry-level and cheaper vehicles, while nickel-based cells will be used for higher-end and performance cars. Many consumers will likely be content with a 200- to 250-mile-range vehicle that&#8217;s thousands of dollars cheaper than one with a range of 300 to 350 miles.</p>
<p>Automakers have also begun making moves to take control of the battery supply, whether through vertical manufacturing or joint ventures with established battery companies. That means that growing LFP capacity in North America and Europe is not only likely, but inevitable.</p>

<p>Rather than recognize the skills I possessed, employers could only see my still-developing English and my lack of a college degree. They failed to take into account my years of experience working with technology and electronics because the route I had taken was too unfamiliar.</p>
<p>It’s a situation all too common for the more than <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/our-solutions/stars-insights/reach-stars-report/">70 million workers in the U.S.</a> who are <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/stars/">skilled through alternative routes (STAR)</a> — especially for the <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/our-solutions/stars-insights/hispanic-stars/">13.5 million Hispanic STAR</a> workers like me out there today. If the employers who are <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cybersecurity-job-openings-united-states/">struggling to fill open tech roles</a> want to overcome the growing “skills gap,” then it’s a situation that must change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When I arrived in the U.S., I applied to countless IT jobs, from customer service to computer repair. Every company rejected me before they even gave me the chance to show what I could do. Had employers taken the time to talk to me, they would have learned I started fixing my neighbors’ phones and computers at the age of 12, and that I had already sailed through a series of computer classes on networking, basic coding, cybersecurity, scripting and computer repairs.</p>

<p>Even as I continued to learn English and mastered coding and cybersecurity concepts, companies failed to recognize what I could bring to the table. My background was too unfamiliar to make it past most employment filters that relied on degree requirements. I was often screened out of the hiring process before showcasing my talents, and I faced the biases of hiring managers who weren’t used to candidates like me. I could only get cleaning jobs or work at factories and fast food restaurants — places where I felt all my skills were going to waste.</p>
<p>I ended up getting lucky, and thanks to mentoring and hiring support through a follow-on to President Obama’s <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/technology/techhire">TechHire Initiative</a>, doors began to open. After years of struggling, I could finally get my foot in the door, meet hiring managers and showcase my skills. I am now working as a cybersecurity associate, but my career could have begun much earlier.</p>
<p>Sadly, this story is a familiar one for far too many STAR workers, especially Hispanic people. Many of them aren’t as lucky as I am.</p>
<p>The statistics are sobering. About 31 million workers — including millions of Hispanic workers — possess skills that qualify them for higher-paying roles they are never considered for. Recent research shows, for instance, that there are 114,000 Hispanic workers employed as food and hospitality service managers, who have the skills to transition to similarly skilled jobs as community and social services managers, where wages are nearly 50% higher.</p>
<p>Hispanic STAR workers <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/our-solutions/stars-insights/navigating-stars-report/#wpcf7-f2868-o1">are also less likely</a> to transition to higher-wage jobs than their white counterparts, and even when they are able to make such a transition, they are compensated less for their skills.</p>
<p>Employers must begin building more promising pathways that are accessible to all workers. The need for this shift has only grown over the last year as the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted Hispanic and Latino communities. Hispanic or Latino workers accounted for <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2021/03/05/496733/latinos-face-disproportionate-health-economic-impacts-covid-19/">nearly one-quarter</a> of the pandemic’s initial job losses. Even as the economy continues to slowly recover, the unemployment rate for those workers sits at 8.6%, compared with 5.7% for white workers. The fallout has been especially pronounced among Hispanic and Latina women. In December, they <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/08/covid-job-losses-women-december-us-unemployment-rate/">accounted for 45%</a> of all job losses.</p>
<p>All this is happening while employers say they are struggling to find workers to fill open positions, even as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/15/966376492/millions-are-out-of-a-job-yet-some-employers-wonder-why-cant-i-find-workers">millions remain unemployed</a> and job postings have <a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/02/02/job-postings-through-jan-29/">begun to return</a> to pre-pandemic levels. The narrative around <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/09/09/the-labor-market-doesnt-have-a-skills-gap-it-has-an-opportunity-gap/">skills gaps</a> continue to be perpetuated by employers, and they <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2021-02-01-covid-19-has-widened-the-skills-gap-but-it-also-presents-an-opportunity-to-close-it">may have worsened</a> during the COVID-19 crisis. These gaps are <a href="https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/projecting-future-skill-shortages-through-2029/">expected to cost</a> the U.S. economy $1.2 trillion over the following decade, but most of these gaps aren’t actually real. They’re just the consequence of employers ignoring workers who learned their skills through alternative routes.</p>
<p>By rethinking hiring barriers like degree requirements, employers can more easily find job-ready talent and improve diversity at the same time. Such shifts can lead to even more systemic change down the road.</p>
<p>My success doesn’t end with me, as there is a multiplier effect to hiring STAR workers. Now that I have a strong foothold in the industry, I am able to help other members of my community. I formed an organization called Rhode Island Group for Hispanic Technology (RIGHT) to provide training in basic computing, coding, cybersecurity and digital literacy — all in Spanish.</p>
<p>If America is going to build back better, employers need to seek out and hire more workers who are skilled through alternate routes. They must begin to look beyond the traditional signals of employability and expand their understanding of what makes a good employee. Those who fail to do so will continue to miss out on the more than 13 million talented Hispanic STAR workers like me.</p>
