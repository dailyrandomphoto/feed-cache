										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ex.co">Ex.co</a> is announcing its very first acquisition — it&#8217;s buying <a href="https://www.cedato.com">Cedato</a>, a video monetization startup founded in 2015.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/playbuzz-becomes-ex-co-and-expands-its-content-marketing-platform/">Previously known as Playbuzz</a>, Ex.co is short for The Experience Company, and it provides publishers and other customers with an easy way to add interactive and visual elements (such as polls and product recommendations) to their content. The company says its publisher business grew revenue by 300% between 2018 and 2020.</p>
<p>According to co-founder and CEO Tom Pachys, over the past year, he&#8217;s become convinced that artificial intelligence is &#8220;taking over everything we do.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We started searching for companies that did video in a sophisticated way, meaning using [machine learning] as part of their core engines,&#8221; Pachys said. &#8220;When I say that, I mean things like choosing the right content, choosing the right ad, knowing how to manage an [ad] auction in the right way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Cedato stood out because it&#8217;s able to do all of this without affecting page load time, this will be increasingly important to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/staying-ahead-of-the-curve-on-googles-core-web-vitals/">Google&#8217;s Core Web Vitals measurements</a>, and therefore to search rankings.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FEioKlTRj9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/playbuzz-becomes-ex-co-and-expands-its-content-marketing-platform/">Playbuzz becomes Ex.co and expands its content marketing platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Playbuzz becomes Ex.co and expands its content marketing platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/playbuzz-becomes-ex-co-and-expands-its-content-marketing-platform/embed/#?secret=FEioKlTRj9" data-secret="FEioKlTRj9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;It’s always a tradeoff between efficiencies and revenues in general,&#8221; Pachys said. &#8220;But for [Cedato], in a very surprising way, they can increase speed and increase revenues.&#8221;</p>
<p>By adding Cedato&#8217;s technology, Ex.co will be able to offer its customers things like predictive recommendations for video content, header bidding for video ads and improved support for connected TVs. Conversely, the company will continue to support existing Cedato customers while also offering them additional products.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re not taking anything away, we&#8217;re just adding more solutions,&#8221; Pachys said.</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but the entire Cedato team (based in New York and Israel) will be joining Ex.co.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the company’s inception, Cedato has been laser-focused on creating the most advanced video tools with a simple, customer-first approach,&#8221; said Cedato founder and CEO Ron Dick in a statement. &#8220;Ex.co has a similar vision, powerful technology, and a large, loyal clientele base. Working together enables us to offer cutting-edge technology to our range of global partners, continuing to lead the way with product innovation that supports the market’s primary needs.”</p>
<p>Pachys added that Ex.co is looking to make another AI-related acquisitions, with the next one likely coming on the commerce side.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every time an emergency responder or police officer responds to a 911 dispatch, they enter an unknown terrain. What’s the incident? Who’s involved? Is anyone dangerous or holding a weapon? Is someone injured and perhaps has an underlying health condition that the responders need to know about? As prominent news stories this week and over the last few years constantly remind us, having the right context while responding can turn a potential tragedy into a much more positive story.</p>
<p><a href="https://rapidsos.com">RapidSOS</a> is a startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/03/rapidsos/">I’ve been watching for years</a>. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/rapidsos-raises-85m-for-its-emergency-response-data-platform/">raised an $85 million Series C round this February</a> to bring real-time location information from all sorts of devices — from Apple and Android smartphones to Sirius XM satellite radios — into the hands of 911 call centers when users make an emergency call. Accurate location can help dispatchers send responders to exactly the right place, offering faster assistance and therefore saving lives.</p>
<p>The company announced this morning a new partnership with <a href="https://www.axon.com">Axon</a>, the company behind Taser, the electroshock weapon designed as a non-lethal alternative to traditional firearms, and a variety of body cams and other technologies for public safety officials. In recent years, Axon has increasingly emphasized a suite of cloud offerings that can fuse data from its devices with software to creates operations systems for public safety agencies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Through the partnership, Axon will integrate the data that its devices generate such as body cam footage and Taser discharge alerts into <a href="https://rapidsos.com/our-latest/introducing-jurisdiction-view/">RapidSOS’s Jurisdiction Review</a>, which is used by dispatchers to place a location and relevant information from a caller a visual map. For instance, a dispatcher might now know the location of police or medical responders, and be able to update a 911 caller on the estimated time of arrival or whether they need help getting access to a location.</p>
<p>Likewise, RapidSOS’s location, medical, and other information that it pulls in from user devices during an emergency call will be sent to Axon Respond devices. Frontline responders will therefore have direct access to a 911 caller’s location information or <a href="https://www.emergencyprofile.org">medical information if they have a profile setup</a>, without having to wait for a dispatcher to route those facts to them.</p>
<p>Josh Pepper, VP of product management at Axon, said “What we&#8217;re always trying to do is how can we get [first responders] the right information about the incident, the right information about the people involved, the right information about the location and all of the disposition of the units involved, as fast and as accurately as we can … so that they can have situational awareness of what&#8217;s happening.” RapidSOS’s data will augment other information streams, helping first responders make those critical split-second decisions.</p>
<p>Michael Martin, CEO and co-foudner of RapidSOS, said “for the first time now, your smartphone, your 911 responder and the police officer in the field can all simultaneously and transparently share data with each other.”</p>
<p>In tech, we are used to having comprehensive information about our products through data analytics. In the emergency space — even today — first responders can lack even the most rudimentary information like location when responding to a call. RapidSOS, Axon and a slew of other companies are trying to bridge that digital divide.</p>

Image Credits: RapidSOS</p></div></p>
<p>This is the Jurisdiction View from RapidSOS’s platform, with a few elements added to mockup how Axon&#8217;s information will be integrated into the product. The two starred badges represent the locations of responding police officers in the field, converging on the location (green pin) of a 911 caller. In the bottom-right corner, a live body cam feed from a police officer can be routed straight to a 911 dispatcher, giving them a real-time look at what is transpiring on the ground. Meanwhile in the info box to the left, we can see that a Taser weapon was fired (noted under “Device Alerts”) and the 911 dispatcher can text to the responding officer directly through the platform.</p>
<p>The companies said the partnership will bear fruit this year as both platforms integrate the data streams into their respective products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In Hefei, a Chinese city known for its relics from the Three Kingdoms period and its manufacturing industry today, Maxim Rate was thrilled to find a small studio crafting a Western role-playing game, a genre that attracts lovers of gritty aesthetics and dark storylines.</p>
<p>&#8220;The design and computer graphics are really good. You can&#8217;t tell they are a Chinese team,&#8221; said Rate.</p>
<p>Rate&#8217;s mission is to find Chinese studios like the bootstrapped Hefei team and help them woo international players. As Chinese regulators<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/china-restarts-game-approval-process/"> tighten rules on game publishing</a> and make licenses hard to obtain in recent years, small studios find themselves struggling. Since last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/over-2500-games-removed-from-apples-china-app-store-in-early-july-as-crackdown-begins/">Apple has pulled thousands of unlicensed games</a> from its Chinese App Store <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/china-roundup-apple-closes-app-store-loophole/">at the behest of local authorities</a>. Small-time developers begin to look beyond their home turf.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The problem is these startups have no experience in overseas expansion,&#8221; said Rate.</p>
<p>An avid gamer himself, Rate quit his job at a Chinese cross-border payment firm last year and launched a part-incubator, part-investment vehicle to take Chinese games abroad. The firm, called <a href="http://www.westwardgaming.com/">Westward Gaming Ventures</a>, took inspiration from Zheng He, a Chinese diplomat and explorer who embarked on state-sponsored naval expeditions to the &#8220;Western Oceans&#8221; during the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>Westward plans to raise 200 million yuan ($30 million) for its debut fund, Rate told TechCrunch in an interview. It plans to deploy the capital over the next three years with an intended check size of 2-4 million yuan per studio. It&#8217;s currently in talks with 20-30 teams that span a wide range of genres.</p>
<p>The Chinese fund being established is a so-called Qualified Foreign Limited Partners Fund, which, for the first time, will enable foreign investors (USD and EUR) to invest directly in Chinese gaming firms. Only a few institutions own a license for QFLP, and while Westward itself doesn&#8217;t hold one, it gains legitimacy for direct foreign investment by partnering with the private equity arm of a major Chinese financial conglomerate, which declined to be named at this stage.</p>
<p>To navigate such regulatory complications, Westward also seeks help from its advisors, including one that oversaw the legal and financial process of one of the largest joint ventures established between Chinese and foreign gaming firms in recent years. The partnership, which can&#8217;t be named, was also the first time a foreign entity has become the majority shareholder in a gaming joint venture in China.</p>
<p>China limits foreign investments in areas it considers sensitive, such as value-added services, so many companies resort to setting up elaborate offshore entities to receive overseas funding. The restriction makes it difficult for resource-strapped studios to land foreign investors, who could help them venture into global markets. They are left with the option of getting backed or bought by Chinese giants like Tencent or ByteDance.</p>
<h2>Rise of Chinese plays</h2>
<p>The idea of Westward is not just to lower the barriers for independent Chinese games to secure foreign capital but also better prepare them for overseas expansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese gaming studios, big or small, used to rely heavily on ads for user acquisition when they went abroad,&#8221; said Rate. &#8220;Sometimes a game would take off, but the team had no idea why, so they continued to test. Those who failed may just give up.&#8221;</p>
<p>But taking a game abroad is not as simple as translating it, hitting the publish button and launching an ad campaign on Facebook.</p>
<p>Westward&#8217;s plan is to get involved in a game&#8217;s early development phase and help them position: Is it an RPG? Is the targeted user a casual or serious player? What&#8217;s the graphic style? In addition, the firm also plans to supply developers with workspace, technical assistance, marketing and localization expertise, connection to publishers, and overseas operation help.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142158" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142158" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2142158" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2461619085857_.pic_.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="492" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2461619085857_.pic_.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2461619085857_.pic_.jpg?resize=150,72 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2461619085857_.pic_.jpg?resize=300,144 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2461619085857_.pic_.jpg?resize=768,369 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2461619085857_.pic_.jpg?resize=680,327 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2461619085857_.pic_.jpg?resize=1536,738 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2461619085857_.pic_.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2142158" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Westward Gaming Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>To provide post-investment support, Westward has partnered up with V+ Gaming Society, an incubator for games headquartered Shenzhen, which Westward also calls home.</p>
<p>Chinese tech companies are facing mounting challenges in the West as geopolitical tensions rise. Many now prefer calling themselves &#8220;global firms&#8221; and even deny their Chinese roots outright.</p>
<p>But for Westward, the games it helps doesn&#8217;t need to pretend they are non-Chinese. &#8220;Most players don&#8217;t consider where a game is from if it is a really good game,&#8221; said Rate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually hope to see elements of Chinese culture in these games that can be understood by overseas players.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amy Ho, a partner at Westward along with Rate and Edward He, said one of the few Chinese games that have managed to be both &#8220;Chinese&#8221; and transcend cultural boundaries is Chinese Parents. The simulation game became a global hit by letting users experience what it is like to raise a child in China.</p>
<p>The benchmark Rate gave was the generation of Japanese games that began exporting 20-30 years ago, which he described as &#8220;Japanese&#8221; in spirit but &#8220;globalized&#8221; in graphics and game design.</p>
<p>There have already been globally successful titles from Chinese makers like Tencent and rising studios Lilith and Mihoyo. In the past, many Chinese users on Steam would be asking foreign titles to rush out Chinese versions. Now, it&#8217;s not uncommon to see Western users demanding English editions of Chinese games, Rate observed.</p>
<p>Rather than politics, the bigger challenge, especially for small studios, is how to &#8220;collect key data for product iteration while complying with local privacy laws,&#8221; said Ho.</p>
<p>50-70% of Westward&#8217;s capital will come from Chinese institutions. The presence of Chinese investments inevitably leads to questions around censorship. Ho said while Westward provides resources and capital to studios, it will work to ensure their independence from investor influence.</p>
<p>If things go well, Westward could help facilitate cultural exchange between China and the rest of the world. Beijing has been trying to export the country&#8217;s soft power, and games may be a suitable conduit, suggested Rate. Amid the ongoing trade war, having foreign fundings in Chinese companies may also do good to China&#8217;s &#8220;brand&#8221;, he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electronic health records (EHR) have long held promise as a means of unlocking new superpowers for caregiving and patients in the medical industry, but while they&#8217;ve been a thing for a long time, actually accessing and using them hasn&#8217;t been as quick to become a reality. That&#8217;s where Medchart comes in, providing access to health information between businesses, complete with informed patient consent, for using said data at scale. The startup just <a href="http://www.medchart.com/post/business-beyond-care">raised $17 million across Series A and seed rounds</a>, led by Crosslink Capital and Golden Ventures, and including funding from Stanford Law School, rapper Nas and others.</p>
<p>Medchart originally started out as more of a DTC play for healthcare data, providing access and portability to digital health information directly to patients. It sprung from the personal experience of co-founders James Bateman and Derrick Chow, who both faced personal challenges accessing and transferring health record information for relatives and loved ones during crucial healthcare crisis moments. Bateman, Medchart&#8217;s CEO, explained that their experience early on revealed that what was actually needed for the model to scale and work effectively was more of a B2B approach, with informed patient consent as the crucial component.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really focused on that patient consent and authorization component of letting you allow your data to be used and shared for various purposes,&#8221; Bateman said in an interview. &#8220;And then building that platform that lets you take that data and then put it to use for those businesses and services, that we&#8217;re classifying as &#8216;beyond care.&#8217; Whether those are our core areas, which would be with your, your lawyer, or with an insurance provider, or clinical researcher — or beyond that, looking at a future vision of this really being a platform to power innovation, and all sorts of different apps and services that you could imagine that are typically outside that realm of direct care and treatment.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bateman explained that one of the main challenges in making patient health data actually work for these businesses that surround, but aren&#8217;t necessarily a core part of a care paradigm, is delivering data in a way that it&#8217;s actually useful to the receiving party. Traditionally, this has required a lot of painstaking manual work, like paralegals poring over paper documents to find information that isn&#8217;t necessarily consistently formatted or located.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that we&#8217;ve been really focused on is understanding those business processes,&#8221; Bateman said. &#8220;That way, when we work with these businesses that are using this data — all permissioned by the patient — that we&#8217;re delivering what we call &#8216;the information,&#8217; and not just the data. So what are the business decision points that you&#8217;re trying to make with this data?&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What leading HealthTech VCs are investing in&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/what-tech-gets-right-about-healthcare/embed/#?secret=FRV53WCc7m" data-secret="FRV53WCc7m" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To accomplish this, Medchart makes use of AI and machine learning to create a deeper understanding of the data set in order to be able to intelligently answer the specific questions that data requesters have of the information. Therein lies their longterm value, since once that understanding is established, they can query the data much more easily to answer different questions depending on different business needs, without needing to re-parse the data every single time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where we&#8217;re building these systems of intelligence on top of aggregate data, they are fully transferable to making decisions around policies for, for example, life insurance underwriting, or with pharmaceutical companies on real world evidence for their phase three, phase four clinical trials, and helping those teams to understand, you know, the the overall indicators and the preexisting conditions and what the outcomes are of the drugs under development or whatever they&#8217;re measuring in their study,&#8221; Bateman said.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Ameet Shah, Partner at co-lead investor for the Series A Golden Ventures, this is the key ingredient in what Medchart is offering that makes the company&#8217;s offering so attractive in terms of long-term potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you want is you both depth and breadth, and you need predictability — you need to know that you&#8217;re actually getting like the full data set back,&#8221; Shah said in an interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s all these point solutions, depending on the type of clinic you&#8217;re looking at, and the type of record you&#8217;re accessing, and that&#8217;s not helpful to the requester. Right now, you&#8217;re putting the burden on them, and when we looked at it, we were just like &#8216;Oh, this is just a whole bunch of undifferentiated heavy lifting that the entire health tech ecosystem is trying to like solve for. So if [Medchart] can just commoditize that and drive the cost down as low as possible, you can unlock all these other new use cases that never could have been done before.&#8221;</p>

<p>One recent development that positions Medchart to facilitate even more novel use cases of patient data is the 21st Century Cures Act, which just went into effect on April 5, provides patients with immediate access, without charge, to all the health information in their electronic medical records. That sets up a huge potential opportunity in terms of portability, with informed consent, of patient data, and Bateman suggests it will greatly speed up innovation built upon the type of information access Medchart enables.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s just going to be an absolute explosion in this space over the next two to three years,&#8221; Bateman said. &#8220;And at Medchart, we&#8217;ve already built all the infrastructure with connections to these large information systems. We&#8217;re already plugged in and providing the data and the value to the end users and the customers, and I think now you&#8217;re going to see this acceleration and adoption and growth in this area that we&#8217;re super well-positioned to be able to deliver on.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s children and teens want more power and control over their spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while there are a number of financial services and apps out there aimed at helping this demographic save and invest money (Greenlight being among the most popular and well-known), one startup is coming at the space from another angle: helping younger people also better manage their spend.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://tillfinancial.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Till Financial</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">describes itself as</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a collaborative family financial tool that aims to empower kids to become smarter spenders. The New York-based company’s banking platform is designed to encourage “open and honest” discussions between parents and their kids. And it has just raised $5 million to help it advance on that goal.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slew of investors put money in the round, including Elysian Park Ventures, Melinda Gates&#8217; venture fund Pivotal Ventures with Magnify Ventures, Afore Capital, Luge Capital, Alpine Meridian Ventures, The Gramercy Fund, SM Ventures (the family office of the founders/CEOs of Stadium Goods) and Lightspeed Venture Partners&#8217; Scout Fund. Also participating were angel investors such as the founders of fintech Petal, the founders of alcohol marketplace Drizly, the president of Transactis, and the president of 1800Flowers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of Till’s goal is to help kids “learn by doing” and gain confidence in spending decisions. It arms them with a bank account, digital and physical debit card and goal-based savings. For example, say a teen wants to buy an iPad, they can set up an account that they can save toward that iPad and give family members (such as grandparents, for example) the opportunity to pitch in the same amount, or more. They can also set up recurring payments for things like Netflix or Spotify subscriptions so they can get a taste of what it’s like to pay regular bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parents and the current banking options miss the point when they just focus on savings. We need to first prepare kids to be Smarter Spenders, supported by savings and investing,” said Taylor Burton, who founded the company with Tom Pincince. “On Till, kids learn to spend with intention and purpose, while parents gain confidence and trust based on transparency and accountability.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Pincince, the market is clearly underserved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The legacy banks really don’t care about this young person and the early digital players are really missing the mark,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And despite the plethora of apps targeting the demographic, Pincince believes there’s plenty of room for the right players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is you&#8217;re talking about a swath of kids under the age of 18 and over the age of eight that is the single largest unbanked population,” he said. “We&#8217;re not fighting to be the top of your son&#8217;s wallet. We&#8217;re fighting to be the first product into that wallet.”</span></p>
<p>Indeed, it&#8217;s a big market &#8212; the average middle-class family in the U.S. spends <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/090415/cost-raising-child-america.asp#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20middle%2Dincome%20parents,thanks%20to%20economies%20of%20scale." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/090415/cost-raising-child-america.asp%23:~:text%3DOn%2520average%252C%2520middle%252Dincome%2520parents,thanks%2520to%2520economies%2520of%2520scale.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619129543046000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFF0qp7Nj_Fr2FyJBruFw23JFOCA">$284,570</a> per child by the time they turn 18.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform is free to all families and, early on, attracted the attention of Peggy Mangot, operating partner/COO of PayPal Ventures. She invested personally in Till in its pre-seed rounds. Prior to PayPal, Mangot r</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an development of Greenhouse, Well Fargo’s fee-free mobile banking app that aimed to help younger users build responsible spending habits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mangot has three kids and recalls that when they were shopping online, she’d give them her credit card. Or, if they were going to the corner store or meeting with friends, she’d give them cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But that way, the money is meaningless to them. They didn’t really know how to understand what things cost and there was no sense of ownership,” she said. “It was just me handing over cash or a card.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What attracted her the most about Till, Mangot said, was the team’s approach to treat younger people “with respect and agency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also believes that by helping children and teens understand important financial lessons at a younger age, the world will ultimately be full of more responsible adults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By putting these tools in the hands of these young people early, they&#8217;ll have years and years of experience before they&#8217;re more independent and have to manage their paycheck and bills,” Mangot told TechCrunch. “Once you have mass adoption, it&#8217;s going to create a much more financially literate, confident and in control set of young adults than we&#8217;ve ever had.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides making money on interchange fees, Till aims to earn revenue by partnering with merchants to offer rewards to users. It also plans to earn referral fees by referring the teens to other financial institutions when they get older and have different needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not our intention to be your son or daughter&#8217;s forever bank. It&#8217;s our intention to be the first bank,” P</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incince said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, they hit the age of maturity, we&#8217;re actually giving them a high-five off of our platform and introducing them to maybe their first college loan or their first credit card.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When we last heard from <a href="http://bigid.com">BigID</a> at the end of 2020, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/bigid-keeps-rolling-with-70m-series-d-on-1b-valuation/">was announcing a $70 million</a> Series D at a $1 billion valuation. Today, it announced a $30 million extension on that deal valuing the company at $1.25 billion just 4 months later.</p>
<p>This chunk of money comes from private equity firm Advent International, and brings the total raised to over $200 million across 4 rounds, according to the company. The late stage startup is attracting all of this capital by building a security and privacy platform. When I spoke to CEO Dimitri Sirota in September 2019 at the time of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/05/bigid-announces-50m-series-c-investment-as-privacy-takes-center-stage/">$50 million Series C</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/bigid-keeps-rolling-with-70m-series-d-on-1b-valuation/">,</a> he described the company&#8217;s direction this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’ve separated the product into some constituent parts. While it’s still sold as a broad-based [privacy and security] solution, it’s much more of a platform now in the sense that there’s a core set of capabilities that we heard over and over that customers want.”</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sirota says he has been putting the money to work, and as the economy improves he is seeing more traction for the product set. &#8220;Since December, we’ve added employees as we’ve seen broader economic recovery and increased demand. In tandem, we have been busy building a whole host of new products and offerings that we will announce over the coming weeks that will be transformational for BigID,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He also said that as with previous rounds, he didn&#8217;t go looking for the additional money, but decided to take advantage of the new funds at a higher valuation with a firm that he believes can add value overall. What&#8217;s more, the funds should allow the company to expand in ways it might have held off on.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was important to us that this wouldn’t be a distraction and that we could balance any funding without the need to over-capitalize, which is becoming a bigger issue in today’s environment. In the end, we took what we thought could bring forward some additional product modules and add a sales team focused on smaller commercial accounts,&#8221; Sirota said.</p>
<p>Ashwin Krishnan, a principal on Advent’s technology team in New York says that BigID was clearly aligned with two trends his firm has been following. That includes the explosion of data being collected and the increasing focus on managing and securing that data with the goal of ultimately using it to make better decisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we met with Dimitri and the BigID team, we immediately knew we had found a company with a powerful platform that solves the most challenging problem at the center of these trends and the data question,&#8221;Krishnan said.</p>
<p>Past investors in the company include Boldstart Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners and Tiger Global. Strategic investors include Comcast Ventures, Salesforce Ventures and SAP.io.</p>

<p>As Earth Week draws to a close (thankfully) new partnerships announced over the past week show the potential for new technologies to transform old businesses.</p>
<p>Yesterday the New York-based<a href="https://zx-ventures.com/"> ZX Ventures</a>, the investment and innovation arm of AB InBev, said that it would be partnering with <a href="https://www.clarafoods.com/">Clara Foods</a>, a developer of protein production technologies including (but not limited to), brewing egg substitutes. That&#8217;s right, the makers of Budweiser are hatching a scheme to make other kinds of liquids that are less potable and more poachable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In that case, the yolk would definitely be on you, future consumer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since day one, Clara has been on a mission to accelerate the world’s transition to animal-free protein, starting with the egg. More than one trillion eggs are consumed globally every year and corporate commitments for cage-free aren’t enough,&#8221; said Arturo Elizondo, the chief executive and co-founder of Clara Foods. &#8220;We’re thrilled to be partnering with the world’s largest fermentation company to work together to enable a kinder, greener, and more delicious future. This partnership is a major step towards realizing our vision.&#8221;</p>

From 2019 to 2020 investments in alternative proteins soared from just over $1 billion to $3 billion led by investments in plant protein products. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> Good Food Institute</p></div></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There are market-driven reasons for the partnership. Demand for high quality proteins is expected to jump up to 98% by 2050,<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12089"> according to research cited by the two companies</a>.</p>
<p>“Meeting the increased demand for food requires breakthrough solutions built on collaboration and innovation that spans several industry domains – both old and new. The ancient and natural process of fermentation can be further harnessed to help meet future demands in our global food system,” said Patrick O&#8217;Riordan, founder &amp; CEO at BioBrew, ZX Ventures&#8217; new business line trying to apply large-scale fermentation and downstream processing expertise beyond beer. “We look forward to exploring the development of highly-functional, animal-free egg proteins with Clara Foods in a scalable, sustainable and economically viable manner.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, there&#8217;s a meeting of the minds happening in St. Louis where cereal giant <a href="https://www.postconsumerbrands.com/">Post</a> is investing in <a href="https://www.hungryplanetfoods.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=ad&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwvYSEBhDjARIsAJMn0ljBwqDZJLiZMmY-ubQbeMdJoGlUKMVPMJAejipnDnj_yviMmii6h2AaAh-vEALw_wcB">Hungry Planet</a>, a startup making meat a range of meat replacements.</p>
<p>Formed from the same Seventh Day Adventist focus on plant-based diet and health as a core of spirituality<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/secret-ingredient-kelloggs-corn-flakes-seventh-day-adventism-180964247/"> that launched the Kellogg&#8217;s cereal empire</a>, Post has long been a rival to the corn flake king with its grape nuts cereal and other grain-based breakfast offerings.</p>
<p>Now the company has led a $25 million investment in Hungry Planet, which aims to provide meat-based replacements for crab cakes, lamb burgers, chicken, pork, and beef. Additional investors included the Singapore-based environmentally sustainable holding company, <a href="https://trirec.co/">Trirec</a>.</p>
<p>Alternative proteins are a big business. Last year, companies developing technologies and businesses to commercialize alternative sources of protein raised over $3 billion, <a href="https://gfi.org/blog/2020-state-of-the-industry-highlights/#:~:text=Now%2C%20new%20data%20released%20this,meat%20companies%3B%20and%20fermentation%20companies">according to the industry tracker, the Good Food Institute</a>.</p>
<p>“Over the past year, the alternative protein industry has demonstrated not only resilience but acceleration, raising significantly more investment capital in 2020 than in prior years,” said GFI director of corporate engagement Caroline Bushnell, in a statement. “These capital infusions and the funding still to come will facilitate much-needed R&amp;D and capacity building to enable these companies to scale and reach more consumers with delicious, affordable, and accessible alternative protein products.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s all part of a push to provide more plant-based alternatives to animal proteins in a bid to halt planetary deforestation and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with animal husbandry.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Humanity needs solutions that match the scale and urgency of our problems,” said Elizondo. “</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinswitch Kuber, a startup that allows young users in India to invest in cryptocurrencies, said on Thursday it has raised $25 million in a new financing round as it looks to expand its reach in India, the world&#8217;s second largest internet market and also the place where the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/">future of private cryptocurrencies remains uncertain for now</a>.</p>
<p>Tiger Global financed the entire Series B funding round of Coinswitch Kuber and valued the three-year-old Indian startup at over $500 million. The announcement of Series B comes just three months after Coinswitch closed its $15 million Series A round from Ribbit Capital, Sequoia Capital India, and Kunal Shah. The Bangalore-based startup has raised $41.5 million to date.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported earlier this month that the New York-headquartered technology hedge fund <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">had led or was in advanced stages of talks</a> to lead investments in many Indian startups including Coinswitch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://coinswitch-kuber.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=12710535283&amp;utm_content=117438816701&amp;utm_term=coinswitch&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwvYSEBhDjARIsAJMn0ljLbNiLfH9RP2FbcRTumZI3YRZBqK1lseHe1nb7xf5twk0aepNAYLgaAlo9EALw_wcB">Coinswitch Kuber</a> is one of the handful of startups operating in the cryptocurrency space today. The crypto exchange allows users to buy slivers of several popular cryptocurrencies. A user on Coinswitch, for instance, can buy small sachets of bitcoin and other currencies for as low as 100 Indian rupees ($1.3)-worth.</p>
<p>The startup said it has amassed over 4.5 million users, more than half of whom are aged 25 or younger. In the past 11 months, Coinswitch Kuber said it processed transactions over $5 billion.</p>
<p>But how the startup, which aims to add 5.5 million by the end of this year, performs in the future is not entire in its hand.</p>
<p>While trading of private cryptocurrency such as bitcoin is currently legal in India, New Delhi is widely expected to introduce a law that bans all private cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Ashish Singhal, co-founder and chief executive of Coinswitch Kuber, said he is optimistic that India will not ban private cryptocurrencies, but said the startup closed the financing round with Tiger Global before New Delhi&#8217;s indication to formulate a law.</p>
<p>&#8220;This investment round brings us at par with some of the most sought after cryptocurrency companies in the world and sets us up for the long run,” said Singhal.</p>
<p>In recent months, some crypto startups in India have started to explore a contingency plan in the event the nation does end up banning cryptocurrency trading in the country. Many startups are today building in India, but focusing on serving customers overseas.</p>
<p>&#8220;As they build India’s leading cryptocurrency platform, CoinSwitch is well positioned to capture the tremendous growing interest in crypto among retail investors. We are excited to partner with CoinSwitch as they innovate in this emerging asset class,” said Scott Shleifer, Partner at Tiger Global, in a statement.</p>

<p><a href="https://about.smartnews.com/en/">SmartNews</a> announced today that its tools to help Japanese users find nearby COVID-19 vaccine bookings have reached more than one million users just a week after launching. The news discovery unicorn decided to create Vaccine Alert and Map features for its Japanese app because many people there are frustrated by the speed of vaccine rollouts. In the United States, where vaccinations are going much faster, SmartNews just released a feature that lets people find appointments by zip code today.</p>
<p>The company has more than 20 million monthly active users combined in Japan and the United States.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/news/ntv20210405002/">public opinion poll by Nippon TV</a>, more than 70% of Japanese people are dissatisfied with its slow vaccine rollout. That sentiment was echoed in SmartNews&#8217; own research, which surveyed 900 people aged 65 to 79 at the beginning of April, and found that more than 90% felt there was insufficient information available about when and where they could get vaccinated. Challenges included the lack of a central portal for vaccine booking information, meaning local government offices and healthcare providers were inundated with questions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142137" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-37.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142137" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2142137" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-37.png?w=383" alt="A screenshot of SmartNews' vaccine locater feature for the American version of its app" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-37.png 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-37.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-37.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-37.png?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-37.png?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-37.png?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-37.png?resize=1152,2048 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-37.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2142137" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot of SmartNews&#8217; vaccine finder feature for the American version of its app</p></div></p>
<p>To create its Vaccine Alert and Map, SmartNews aggregated information from 1,741 municipalities across Japan. The Vaccine Alert lets users know when they are eligible to get a shot based on their location, age, occupation and health conditions. The Vaccine Map combines data from about 37,000 facilities, so people can see where bookings are available near them or get notified when their healthcare providers begin taking reservations.</p>
<p>The features were released on April 12, the day vaccinations began for elderly people in Japan, and had more than one million users a week later. This is in part because SmartNews is one of the country’s most popular news aggregator apps and also because the new features were covered by TV Asahi, a major TV station.</p>
<p>A company representative told TechCrunch that many people who signed up for the vaccine features were already SmartNews users, but it has also seen new downloads as people share their vaccination appointments with friends and family.</p>

In the latest development, <a href="https://getbux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bux</a> &#8212; a startup form Amsterdam that lets people invest in shares and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) without paying commissions (its <a href="https://getbux.com/zero-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pricing</a> is based on flat €1 fees for certain services, no fees for others) &#8212; has picked up some investment of its own, a $80 million round that it.</p>

Founder Nick Bortot is stepping away and Yorick Naeff, an early employee of the company who had been the COO, is taking over. Bortot will remain a shareholder and involved with the company, which will be using to expand its geographical footprint and expand its tech platform and services to users, said Naeff in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we started, Bux has been trying to make investments affordable and intuitive, and that will still be the case,&#8221; he said. The average age of a Bux customer is 30, so while affordable and intuitive are definitely priorities to capture younger users, it also means that if Bux can earn their loyalty and show positive returns, they have the potential to keep them for a long time to come.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is coming from an interesting group of investors. Jointly led by Prosus Ventures and Tencent (in which Prosus, the tech division of Naspers, is a major investor), it also included ABN Amro Ventures, Citius, Optiver, and Endeit Capital &#8212; all new investors &#8212; as well as previous backers HV Capital and Velocity Capital Fintech Ventures.</p>
<p>Naeff said in an interview that Bux isn&#8217;t disclosing its valuation with this round. But for some context, he confirmed that the startup has around 500,000 customers across the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, France and Belgium, using not just its main Bux Zero app, but also Bux Crypto and Bux X (a contracts for difference (CFDs) app).</p>
<p>Crypto remains a niche but extremely active part of the wider investment market and Naeff described Bux Crypo &#8212; formed out of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/09/bux-acquires-blockport/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bux acquiring Blockport last year</a> &#8212; as &#8220;very profitable.&#8221; The company had only raised about $35 million before this round, and it&#8217;s been around since 2014, so while he wouldn&#8217;t comment on wider profitability, you can draw some conclusions from that.</p>
<p>For some further valuation context, another big player in trading in Europe, eToro,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in March</a> announced it was going public by way of a SPAC valuing it at $10 billion. (Note: eToro is significantly bigger, adding 5 million users last year alone.)</p>
<p>Others in the wider competitive landscape include Robinhood out of the US, which had plans but appeared to have stalled in its entry into Europe; Trade Republic out of Germany, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/trade-republic-a-german-robinhood-raises-67m-led-by-accel-and-founders-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $67 million a year ago</a> from the likes of Accel and Founders Fund; and Revolut, which has been running a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/revolut-launches-stock-trading-in-limited-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trading app for some time</a>.</p>
<p>The opportunity that Bux is targeting is a very simple one: technology, and specifically innovations in banking and apps, have opened the door to making it significantly easier for the average consumer to engage in a new set of financial services.</p>

Social media is also playing a major role here, opening up conversations around investing that have been traditionally run between professionals in the industry.</p>
<p>“We’re looking for industries that solve big societal needs and fintech continues to be one of them,&#8221; said Sandeep Bakshi, who heads up investments for Prosus in Europe, in an interview. &#8220;Interest rates being what they are, there are no opportunities for individuals to save and that represents a massive opportunity, and we’re happy to partner and be a part of the journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although there is a wave of so-called neo-brokers in the market today, Bux&#8217;s unique selling point, Naeff said, is the company&#8217;s tech stack.</p>
<p>In comparison to others providing trading apps, he said Bux is the first and only one of them to have built a full-stack system of its own.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not on top of existing broker, which makes it a nimble and modular,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is especially critical because fintech is a game of scale, but every market is completely different when you consider tax, payment systems and the ID documents that one needs in order to fill KYC requirements.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that is before you consider that doing business in Europe means doing business in a number of different languages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our system is here to scale across Europe,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The fact that we are live in five countries, and the only neo-broker doing that, shows that this modular system is working.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, the scaling opportunity is one of the reasons why China&#8217;s tech giant Tencent, owner of WeChat and a vast gaming empire, has come on board.</p>
<p>“We are excited about backing BUX as they are the leading neo-broker in Europe and have been able to build a platform that is sustainable and scalable. BUX is the only neo-broker in Europe that offers zero commission investing without being dependent on kickbacks or payments for order flow. This ensures that its interests are fully aligned with its customers. We will support BUX in its journey of pursuing consistent growth for the years to come”, said Alex Leung, Assistant GM at Tencent, Strategic Development, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johannesburg-based investment company <a href="https://www.foundersfactory.africa/">Founders Factory Africa</a> (FFA) today announced a partnership with <a href="https://smallfoundation.ie/">Small Foundation</a> that will see it select 18 agritech startups for an acceleration and incubation program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Foundation is a Dublin-based philanthropic organization that focuses on the rural and agriculture sector in sub-Saharan Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this partnership, Small Foundation is making an undisclosed investment in FFA to build and scale agritech startups on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The partnership stands to make a significant impact across the continent by supporting agritech startups who can innovate and improve the delivery of a range of services to smallholder farmers and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the agricultural sector,&#8221; an excerpt in a statement read</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the South African-based venture development and investment company founded by <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/roorogers">Roo Rogers</a> and <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/alinatruhina">Alina Truhina</a>, early-stage founders will need to apply to join the Founders Factory Africa Venture Scale or Venture Build portfolios</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These startups will have access to funding between $100,000 to $250,000 and hands-on technical support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a change from when the company launched in 2018. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">FFA is an extension of the Founders Factory organisation that has invested in more than 130 companies globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, FFA launched its <a href="https://digestafrica.com/founders-factory-africa">first vertical in fintech</a> when it partnered with the continent&#8217;s largest bank, Standard Bank, to invest in fintech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of the startups include Bwala, LipaLater, MVXchange and OkHi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following year, it took on a second investor in South African healthcare company Netcare Group and, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/founders-factory-africa-and-netcare-to-fund-35-health-tech-startups/">via the partnership</a>, invested in health-tech startups like RxAll, Redbird and Wellahealth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zrtlRWwmta"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/founders-factory-africa-and-netcare-to-fund-35-health-tech-startups/">Founders Factory Africa and Netcare to fund 35 health-tech startups</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Founders Factory Africa and Netcare to fund 35 health-tech startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/founders-factory-africa-and-netcare-to-fund-35-health-tech-startups/embed/#?secret=zrtlRWwmta" data-secret="zrtlRWwmta" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year when we reported this partnership, startups in FFA&#8217;s Venture Scale accelerator program received a £30,000 cash investment and £220,000 in support services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Those in the Venture Build program received £60,000 cash and £100,000 toward support.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this third partnership, Truhina says FFA will be investing a total of $300,000 in cash and hands-on support for companies in its Venture Scale program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, startups in Venture Build will be receiving up to $250,000 in funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Venture Scale program involves providing support for existing startups operating in seed to pre-Series A stages</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other hand,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Venture Build program is for founders wanting to launch a startup in Africa, who may or may not have a concept or an idea</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, there are 23 companies across FFA&#8217;s Scale and Build portfolios. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These startups, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa, have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised more than $7 million during and after the program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Truhina says FFA plans to increase this number to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 90 startups in total by 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will build, scale and invest in 88 startups with current FFA investors (Standard Bank, Netcare and Small Foundation) until 2024</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We plan to continue to take on new investors and continue to work on the continent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">indefinitely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1849264 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Founders-Factory-Africa.jpg?w=680" alt="Founders Factory Africa" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Founders-Factory-Africa.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Founders-Factory-Africa.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Founders-Factory-Africa.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Founders-Factory-Africa.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Founders-Factory-Africa.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Founders-Factory-Africa.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Founders-Factory-Africa.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Founders-Factory-Africa.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While FFA is dedicating a fund for agritech startups, it has invested in other startups with agritech solutions for instance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nigeria&#8217;s Foodlocker. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company forecasts foodstuff demand through machine learning and helps buyers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">procure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> goods from smallholder farmers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But despite this proposition, FFA classifies the startup as a fintech investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Foodlocker was a company we selected and invested in under our Fintech portfolio, as the startup has a financial component</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With Small Foundation, we are setting up a new dedicated agritech sector,&#8221; said Truhina. Small Foundation joins </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard Bank and Netcare in the peculiarity of assistance offered to FFA portfolio startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From sector expertise and footprint across the continent to access to clients, POCs and pilots, these investors are trying to fill in the gap in sectors ripe for exponential growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But though fintech has caught on well with both local and international investors, the same cannot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for health tech and agritech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/">Briter Bridges</a>, fintech accounted for 31% of the total $1.3 billion raised by African startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Health-tech startups accounted for 9%, while agritech startups represented </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 7%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Foundation wants to improve this number in its own little way, and concurrently has a plan to &#8220;end extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conor Brosnan, the CEO and chair of the foundation, holds that tackling the sector&#8217;s biggest issues with the FFA will bring the company toward achieving this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">objective</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a pivotal time to invest in the growing area of agritech in Africa, which has transformative potential for local livelihoods</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see FFA’s highly skilled teamwork with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">immensely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> talented African entrepreneurs to deliver scaled solutions to some of the biggest challenges faced by the sector,” he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In three years, Founders Factory Africa has managed to enlist the services and finances of three influential partners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yet, it has 55 more startups to invest in before 2024, so we should expect an increased investment activity and more partnerships to fund startups in other sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm also has fresh capital in the works for its portfolio companies as it advances, though. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the process of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raising a $35 million &#8220;Africa Seed Fund&#8221; which will exist alongside FFA and execute follow-on capital in some portfolio companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earth imaging is an increasingly crowded space, but Satellite Vu is taking a different approach by focusing on infrared and heat emissions, which are crucial for industry and climate change monitoring. Fresh from TechCrunch&#8217;s Startup Battlefield, the company has raised a £3.6M ($5M) seed round and is on its way to launching its first satellite in 2022.</p>
<p>The nuts and bolts of Satellite Vu&#8217;s tech and master plan are described in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/satellite-vu-aims-to-scope-out-the-whole-globe-with-thermal-vision/">our original profile of the company</a>, but the gist is this: while companies like Planet have made near-real-time views of the Earth&#8217;s surface into a thriving business, other niches are relatively unexplored — like thermal imaging.</p>
<p>The heat coming off a building, geological feature, or even a crowd of people is an enormously interesting data point. It can tell you whether an office building or warehouse is in use or empty, and whether it&#8217;s heated or cooled, and how efficient that process is. It can find warmer or cooler areas that suggest underground water, power lines, or other heat-affecting objects. It could even make a fair guess at how many people attended a concert, or perhaps an inauguration. And of course it works at night.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141993" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141993" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2141993" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu2.jpg" alt="An aerial image side by side with a thermal image of the same area." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu2.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141993" class="wp-caption-text">You could verify, for instance, which parts of a power plant are active, when.</p></div></p>
<p>Pollution and other emissions are also easily spotted and tracked, making infrared observation of the planet an important part of any plan to monitor industry in the context of climate change. That&#8217;s what attracted Satellite Vu&#8217;s first big piece of cash, a grant from the U.K. government for £1.4M, part of a £500M infrastructure fund.</p>
<p>CEO and founder Anthony Baker said that they began construction of their first satellite with that money, &#8220;so we knew we got our sums right,&#8221; he said, then began the process of closing additional capital.</p>
<p>Seraphim Capital, a space-focused VC firm whose most relevant venture is probably synthetic aperture satellite startup Iceye, matched the grant funds, and with subsequent grant the total money raised is in excess of the $5M target (the extra is set aside in a convertible note).</p>

<p>&#8220;What attracted us to Satellite Vu is several things. We published some research about this last year: there are more than 180 companies with plans to launch smallsat constellations,&#8221; said Seraphim managing partner James Bruegger. But very few, they noted, were looking at the infrared or thermal space. &#8220;That intrigued us, because we always thought infrared had a lot of potential. And we already knew Anthony and Satellite Vu from having put them through our space accelerator in 2019.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&#8217;re going to need every penny. Though the satellites themselves are looking to be remarkably cheap, as satellites go — $14-15M all told — and only seven will be needed to provide global coverage, that still adds up to over $100M over the next couple years.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2046029" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2046029" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2046029" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg" alt="Simulated image of a Satellite Vu imaging satellite." width="1024" height="662" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg?resize=1536,993 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg?resize=2048,1324 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SSTL-satellite-vu.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2046029" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Satellite Vu</p></div></p>
<p>Seraphim isn&#8217;t daunted, however: &#8220;As a specialist space investor, we understand the value of patience,&#8221; said Bruegger. Satellite Vu, he added, is a &#8220;poster child&#8221; for their approach, which is to shuttle early stage companies through their accelerator and then support them to an exit.</p>
<p>It helps that Baker has lined up about as much potential income from interested customers as they&#8217;ll need to finance the whole thing, soup to nuts. &#8220;Commercial traction has improved since we last spoke,&#8221; said Baker, which was just before he presented at TechCrunch&#8217;s Disrupt 2020 Startup Battlefield:</p>
<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder="5f5fc40cd7e1932b282f5d0f" post-id="2046133"></div> </p>
<p>The company now has 26 letters of intent and other leads that amount to, in his estimation, about a hundred million dollars worth of business — if he can provide the services they&#8217;re asking for, of course. To that end the company has been flying its future orbital cameras on ordinary planes and modifying the output to resemble what they expect from the satellite network.</p>
<p>Companies interested in the latter can buy into the former for now, and the transition to the &#8220;real&#8221; product should be relatively painless. It also helps create a pipeline on Satellite Vu&#8217;s side, so there&#8217;s no need for a test satellite and service.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141994" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141994" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2141994" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg" alt="An aerial image side by side with a thermal image of the same area." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/satvu1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141994" class="wp-caption-text">Another example of the simulated satellite imagery &#8211; same camera as will be in orbit, but degraded to resemble shots from that far up.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We call it pseudo-satellite data — it&#8217;s almost a minimum viable product.We work with the companies about the formats and stuff they need,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;The next stage is, we&#8217;re planning on taking a whole city, like Glasgow, and mapping the whole city in thermal. We think there will be many parties interested in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>With investment, tentative income, and potential customers lining up, Satellite Vu seems poised to make a splash, though its operations and launches are small compared with those of Planet, Starlink, and very soon Amazon&#8217;s Kuiper. After the first launch, tentatively scheduled for 2022, Baker said the company would only need two more to put the remaining six satellites in orbit, three at a time on a rideshare launch vehicle.</p>
<p>Before that, though, we can expect further fundraising, perhaps as soon as a few months from now — after all, however thrifty the company is, tens of millions in cash will still be needed to get off the ground.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand access to electric mopeds &#8212; the small, motorised scooters that you sit on, not kick &#8212; has been a small but persistent part of the multi-modal transportation mix on offer to people in cities these days. Today, a startup out of The Netherlands is announcing some funding with ambitions to make e-mopeds more mainstream, and to expand into a wider set of vehicle options.</p>
<p><a href="https://nl.go-sharing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go Sharing</a>, which has a fleet of around 5,000 e-mopeds across in 30 cities in three countries &#8212; The Netherlands, Belgium and Austria &#8212; has picked up €50 million (around $60 million). The startup, based near Utrecht, plans to use the funding to expand its footprint for e-mopeds; add electric cars and e-bikes to its app; and continue building out the technology underpinning it all.</p>
<p>Go Sharing believes tech will be the answer to creating a profitable operation, using AI algorithms to optimize locations for e-mopeds, encouraging people to drop off in those locations with incentives like discounts, and keeping that network charged.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Germany, the UK and Turkey are next on Go Sharing&#8217;s list of countries, the company said.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Opportunity Partners &#8212; a firm based out of Amsterdam that also backs online supermarket <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/amsterdams-crisp-an-online-only-supermarket-raises-e30m-series-b-led-by-target-global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crisp</a>, with the startup&#8217;s founders &#8212; CEO Raymon Pouwels, Doeke Boersma, and Donny van den Oever &#8212; also participating. A previous round of about $12 million came from Rabo Corporate Investments, the VC arm of the banking giant.</p>
<p>In a world where we now have many choices for getting around cities &#8212; taxis, public transport, push and electric bikes, scooters, walking, carpools, car rentals or our own cars &#8212; e-mopeds occupy an interesting niche in the mix.</p>
<p>They can be faster than bikes and scooters &#8212; 25 km per hour is a typical speed limit in cities, 40 km per hour in less dense areas &#8212; more agile than cars, completely quiet compared to their very noisy fuel-based cousins, and of course much more eco-friendly. For those managing fleets, they less likely to break down and need replacing than some of the other alternatives like e-bikes and e-scooters.</p>
<p>But they also represent a higher barrier to entry for picking up customers: riders need a license to operate them as you would other moving vehicles, and in some (but not all) places they need to wear helmets; and the operators of fleets need to sort out how required insurance will work and need special permits as a vehicle provider in most places, and they can also face the same issue as other vehicles like bikes and kick scooters of being a <a href="https://eindhovennews.com/news/2020/08/green-go-sharing-scooters-causing-parking-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public nuisance when parked</a>.</p>
<p>That mix of challenges &#8212; and the fact that fleets can be expensive to operate and might even if all the boxes are ticked still not attract enough users &#8212; has meant that the e-moped market has been a patchy one, with some startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/coup-shuts-down-its-electric-moped-scooter-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shutting down</a>, some cancelling cities after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/revel-pulls-electric-mopeds-after-failing-to-make-a-dent-in-austins-car-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low demand</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/electric-moped-startup-revel-returns-to-new-york-with-helmet-selfie-other-in-app-safety-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retreating over and then returning</a> with better safety measures.</p>
<p>Yet with on-demand transport companies increasingly looking to provide &#8220;any&#8221; mode in their multi-modal plays to capture more consumers at more times, they remain a class of vehicle that the bigger players and newer entrants will continue to entertain. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/lime-adds-shared-electric-mopeds-to-the-mix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lime earlier this year</a> said it was adding e-mopeds to its fleet in certain cities. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/uber-integrates-electric-moped-service-cityscoot-in-paris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uber teamed up with Cityscoot</a> in Paris to integrate the e-moped&#8217;s fleet into its app. Cityscoot itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/cityscoot-raises-another-25-6-million-for-its-electric-moped-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised some funding last year</a> and is active in several cities across Europe.</p>
<p>And while it can be work to get permits and other regulatory aspects in place to operate services, Pouwels said that Go Sharing was finding that many municipalities actually liked the idea of bringing in more e-mopeds as an eco-friendly alternative to more vehicles &#8212; the idea being to provide a transport option to people who are not interested in kick-scooters or bikes and might have driven their own cars, meaning they already have licenses.</p>
<p>The eco-friendly option is also motivating how the company is planning out other parts of its strategy:</p>
<p>&#8220;What we have heard from regulators is that they want to motivate people to walk or move in other ways, for example with bicycles,&#8221; Pouwels said in an interview. &#8220;What we’ve seen with kick scooters is that they &#8216;deactivate&#8217; people. This is why we see bikes [not adding e-scooters] as the healthy way of moving forward.&#8221; The plan with adding electric cars, he said, is to address the needs of people to travel longer distances than shorter inner-city journeys.</p>
<p>Handling supply for its services is coming by way of <a href="https://www.greenmo.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GreenMo</a>, a sister operation run by Boersma that has been procuring and running a rental service of e-mopeds that are used by drivers for delivery services, with some 10,000 bikes already used this way. GreenMo recently acquired Dutch startup e-bike and a took a majority stake in Belgian company zZoomer, to expand its fleet.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["With the COVID-19 pandemic, it's easier to land remote jobs and stay in Zagreb, which will positively impact the Croatian startup ecosystem."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups may not spring to mind when speaking about the beautiful country of Croatia. Indeed, the country is most popular as a tourist destination, and given that tourism accounted for <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/e1fa2868-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/e1fa2868-en">about 20% of its GDP in 2018</a>, to an extent, its pre-pandemic focus was mostly on growing its share of the international tourism market.</p>
<p>But Croatia&#8217;s entrepreneurs haven&#8217;t been quiet: Startups like <a href="http://Infobip.com">Infobip</a> and <a href="http://Rimac.com">Rimac</a> are significant local hero businesses now, and the region can boast of high-quality talent in the tech, automotive, manufacturing, and agtech spaces. With only two venture capital firms operating in the capital of Zagreb, the startup scene is still young, but the country&#8217;s relatively recent EU membership has given it access to a growing set of direct investment instruments.</p>
<p>The current tax framework on capital gains tax (zero if you hold the shares for more than two years) and a new &#8216;digital nomad&#8217; visa are helping to attract investors and talent to the city, which is also close to some of the best beaches in the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Access to fresh, outside capital is always a catalyst for growth, so to get an inside look at Zagreb&#8217;s fast-growing startup ecosystem, we spoke with nine local founders, investors and C-level executives.</p>
<p>According to the respondents, Zagreb&#8217;s strongest tech areas include HR solutions, automotive, fintech, mobile gaming, IoT, insurtech, and AI. The city&#8217;s angel investor scene isn&#8217;t very strong yet, but that could be attributed to the ecosystem&#8217;s youth.</p>

<p>The city has an excellent work-life balance, and most of the talent wants to stay there. &#8220;Now, with the COVID-19 pandemic, it&#8217;s easier to land remote jobs and stay in Zagreb, which will positively impact our ecosystem,&#8221; one of the investors said.</p>
<p>However, with competition heating up, startups looking for larger, serious investment will probably have to look beyond the country&#8217;s borders while trying to retain their engineering talent. Luckily, an increasing number of international investors are looking at Zagreb for their deal flow pipeline.</p>
<p>Some top Croatian startups include: Agrivi, Amodo, Ascalia, Bellabeat, Cognism, Degordian, Dok-Ing, Infobip, Mindsmiths, OptimoRoute, Oradian, Photomath, Repsly, ReversingLabs, ScoreAlarm, Sportening and AdScanner.</p>

<h2>Lucija Ilicic, CEO, PlatePay</h2>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Photomath, Sportening, and Mindsmiths.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Mostly revenue-oriented.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
People would choose to live and move here during the pandemic. Some of them did, especially having in mind that Croatia now has the digital nomad visa.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc)</strong><br />
Investors: Fil Rouge Capital, Feelsgood, Zicer, Bird Incubator; Founders: Ivan Klarić, Damir Sabol, Mislav Malenica, Mate Riimac</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
The Croatian startup ecosystem really grew during last year and has huge potential. I see it as a perfect place for digital nomads, home of a few new unicorns and a European center for AI solutions development.</p>
<p><strong>Can you recommend any companies that should appear in our global Startup Battlefield competition?</strong><br />
Sportening, Mindsmiths, and of course, PlatePay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Julien Coustaury, partner, Fil Rouge Capital</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?</strong><br />
Strong in fintech, automotive, insurtech, and AI. We are excited that the whole ecosystem is growing strong with flagships such as Rimac, Optimoroute, Oradian, Infobeep, Agrivi, Tvbeat, Orqa, and Bellabeat, and our relevant funding partners with us and a new PE fund that have just been creating. There is money, talent and we have unicorns in Croatia. Very few weaknesses in Croatia at the moment, especially with the current tax framework on capital gains (zero if you hold the shares for more than two years) and the digital nomad visa. A giant leap for the region!</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Oradian, Lebesgue, Optimoroute, Gideon Brothers, Worcon, TVbeat, Orqa, Ascalia, Epoets Society, Hoss, Jade, Miret, My Valet, Sendbee, She’s Well, Spotsie, Taia, TDA, and Twire.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
The ecosystem still a bit small to talk about the vertical focus. [We have] two active funds: SC ventures and Fil Rouge Capital. FRC runs an accelerator program along the YC model. The angel scene is a bit disappointing at the moment with not a lot of investments. Funderbeam [is] pretty active here. The quality and quantity is amazing at the moment in Croatia, probably a factor of the ecosystem being rather young.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
The current fiscal climate makes it very attractive for people to relocate/stay in Zagreb, no doubt. One million people here; proximity to one of the best seas in the world — all the ingredients are here to make it the beacon of the up and coming startup world!</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc)</strong><br />
FRC is definitely the main player in Zagreb; SC ventures, Funderbeam, Novak Law for lawyers, Algebra University, ZICER, Hub 385, Step RI.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
No doubt a key hub in Europe on par with Vienna.</p>
<p><strong>Can you recommend any companies that should appear in our global Startup Battlefield competition?</strong><br />
Oradian, Lebesgue, Optimoroute, Gideon Brothers, Worcon, TVbeat, Orqa, Ascalia, Epoets Society, Hoss, Jade, Miret, My Balet, Sendbee, She&#8217;s well, Spotsie, Taia, TDA, and Twire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Josip Orsolic, CEO, Lilcodelab</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?</strong><br />
IT, automotive, manufacturing, farming (different SaaS and IoT solutions).</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Rimac Automobili, Microblink, Five, Nanobit, Agrivi.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s a small circle of people and not a lot of diversity, although it is getting better. Many new young successful investors emerged in the last few years.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
They will stay, maybe go to the suburbs, but just looking at the rental prices for flats/apartments I don&#8217;t see any shift in people moving outside of the city.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc)</strong><br />
Mate Rimac, Damir Sabol, Alan Sumina, Tomislav Car, Luka Abrus.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
I believe the tech scene is going to grow more and more. Many companies from other countries are opening up engineering hubs in Zagreb. There is a lot of talent, people are drawn to tech jobs; it is heavily covered by the media. Each success is celebrated and covered by the media, so there is a feeling that tech companies are being pushed, even though there are other successful companies from other industries.</p>
<p><strong>Can you recommend any companies that should appear in our global Startup Battlefield competition?</strong><br />

<h2>Vedran Tolic, founder &amp; CBO, Q agency</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?</strong><br />
Strongest: Online betting, HR solutions, fintech, mobile gaming, IoT.<br />
Weakest: Gaming for serious platforms; AI solutions are still in their infancy.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
PhotoMath, Agrivi, SofaScore, TalentLyft, Jenz, and Bellabeat.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
The scene is getting stronger, but for any serious investment, startups have to look beyond our borders.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
Zagreb has an excellent work-life balance, and most of the talent want to stay here. Now, with the COVID-19 pandemic, it&#8217;s easier to land remote jobs and stay in Zagreb, which will positively impact our ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc)</strong><br />
Founders: We have many charismatic founders who are raising awareness around startups and entrepreneurship in general. They are reaching large audiences and getting attention from government, the education system and the public.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
Shifting from mostly agency work for foreign companies to a more product-oriented scene — especially in AI and ML. Products will revolve around customer and employee engagement, automation and prediction of processes which are today done by a large workforce.</p>
<p><strong>Can you recommend any companies that should appear in our global Startup Battlefield competition?</strong><br />
Photomath, Agrivi, Bellabeat, Jenz</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bozidar Pavlovic, managing director, airt</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?</strong><br />
AI, SaaS, electric cars manufacturing, and software development in general.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Rimac Automobili, Nanobit, Infinum, Five, Agrivi, Aircash, Identyum, Airt, Mindsmiths, Electrocoin, Agency 04, Oradian, Microblink, Photomath, Agency Q, Revuto, Optimoroute, Amodo, Lemax, Ampnet, RobotiqAI, and Velebit AI.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
The scene is growing recently — Zagreb is capital of Croatia, thus attracting capital and people. A recent near-unicorn (Rimac, with heavy investment from Hyundai and Porsche) helped raise visibility for this vibrant ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
Even before the pandemic, Zagreb was very attractive for tech experts worldwide due to its appealing price of accommodation, security, comfort of living and relatively high salaries. I am expecting to see the masses return after vaccination.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc)</strong><br />
Davor Runje, Nikola Pavesic, Drazen Orescanin, Frane Sesnic, Tin Tezak, Ante Magzan, and Luka Sucic.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
I see it blooming, mostly due to upcoming adoption of EUR as a local currency.</p>
<p><strong>Can you recommend any companies that should appear in our global Startup Battlefield competition?</strong><br />
Amodo, Agrivi, Photomath, Identyum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Matej Zelic, COO, Spotsie</h2>
<p><strong>What industry sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?</strong><br />
Oil and energy, Industry 4.0. Most excited to be a part of digital transformation in the old-fashioned industries.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Rimac, Agrivi, Oradian, Miret, SofaScore.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
The startup ecosystem in Croatia is still in early stages of development. The investment scene (except a few business angels) started a  few years ago backed by EU with just two VCs (FRC and SVC) without a strategic plan and focus.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
People will stay here.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc)</strong><br />
Fil Rouge Capital, South Central Ventures. Mate Rimac, Damir Sabol, Frane Sesnic</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
Because of micro-location, the digital nomad program, and IT talent pool, Zagreb is on the way to becoming the No. 1 tech location in CEE and Europe.</p>

Agrivi, Repsly.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Very poor startup ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
Most of the last year was in partial lockdown.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)</strong><br />
Sasa Cvetojecic, Hrvoje Prpic, Fil Rouge Capital, Bird Incubator.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
At the same place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Vedran Blagus, investment manager, South Central Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?</strong><br />
Industry is very agnostic. Most of them work in B2B or the enterprise space. They lack B2C knowledge, growth/expansion plan and investor relations.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
AdScanner, Agrivi, ReversingLabs, TalentLyft, Sportening, Codemap, Gideon Brothers.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Two VCs operating &#8211; Fil Rouge Capital (Pre-Seed, Seed, Series A &#8211; industry agnostic; B2C and B2B) and South Central Ventures (Seed, Series A, B2B). In the past six to twelve months, C-level executives from corporates started investing in startups in early stages (up to EUR 200k), but keep their investments below the radar.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out, or will others move in?</strong><br />
I believe that it will stay the same as it is. Development/operations in Zagreb, expansion to other European cities by opening offices there.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city? (e.g. investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc)</strong><br />
Founders &#8211; Matija Zulj, Marin Curkovic, Mate Rimac, Marin Saric, Alan Sumina, Matija Kopic.<br />
Investors &#8211; Luka Sucic, Stevica Kuharski, Vedran Blagus.<br />
Lawyers &#8211; Marijana Sarolic Robic.<br />
Media &#8211; Ivan Brezak Brkan, Bernard Ivezic.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
Founders who exited companies they&#8217;ve been building for the past 10 years will found new companies and/or invest in early stage startups. More international investors looking at Zagreb for pipeline/investments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Daniel Stefanic, investor</h2>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Infobip, Rimac seem to be hottest ones in Croatia.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
There&#8217;s some incredibly smart people involved in STEM in Croatia &#8211; world class. They just need better pathways to commercialisation and access to capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Being an expectant mom can be frightening, as can mothering an infant or toddler. The answers don&#8217;t come automatically, and while there&#8217;s no shortage of books and websites (and advice from grandparents) about how to parent at every stage, finding satisfying information often proves a lot harder than imagined.</p>
<p>There are online social groups that deliver some of the social and emotional support that new parents need, no matter where they live. There are <a href="https://www.parents.com/parenting/moms/mom-groups-worth-joining-on-facebook/">many dozens</a> of mom communities on Facebook, for example. However, it&#8217;s because there&#8217;s room for improvement on this theme &#8212; big groups can feel isolating, bad information abounds &#8212;that <a href="https://www.oathcare.com/">Oath Care</a>, a young, four-person San Francisco-based startup, just raised $2 million in seed funding from XYZ Ventures, General Catalyst, and Eros Resmini, former CMO of Discord and managing partner of the Mini Fund.</p>
<p>What is it building? Founder Camilla Hermann describes it as a subscription-based mobile app that&#8217;s focused on improving the lives of new mothers by combining parents who have lots in common with healthcare specialists and moderators who can guide them in group chats, as well as one-on-one video calls.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More specifically, she says, for $20 per month, Oath matches pregnant and postpartum moms in circles of up to 10 based on factors like stage of pregnancy, age of child, location, and career so they can ask questions of each other, with the help of a trained moderator (who is sometimes a mother with older children).</p>
<p>Oath also pushes curriculum that Oath&#8217;s team is developing in-house to members based on each group&#8217;s specific needs. Not last, every group is given collective access to medical specialists who can answer general questions as part of the members&#8217; subscription and who are also available for consultations when individualized help is needed.</p>
<p>Hermann says the pricing of these 15-minute-long consultations is still being developed, but that the medical experts with whom it&#8217;s already working see the app as a form of lead generation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting concept, one that could be taken in a host of directions, acknowledges Hermann who says she was inspired to cofound the company based on earlier work developing a contact tracing technology created to track outbreaks like Ebola in real time.</p>
<p>As she said yesterday during a Zoom call with TechCrunch and her cofounder, Michelle Stephens, a pediatric clinician and research scientist: &#8220;We&#8217;ve fundamentally misunderstand something really important about health in the West; we think that [changes] happen to one person at a time or one part of the body at a time, but it always happens in interconnected systems both inside and outside the body, which fundamentally means that it is always happening in community.&#8221;</p>
<p>For her part, Stephens &#8212; who was introduced to Hermann at a dinner years ago &#8212; says her motivation in cofounding Oath was born out of research into childhood stress, and that by &#8220;better equipping parents to be those positive consistent caregivers in their child&#8217;s life,&#8221; Oath aims to help enable stronger, more intimate child-parent bonds.</p>
<p>It might sound grand for a mobile app, but it also sounds like a smart starting point. Though the idea is to match mothers in similar situations at the outset to help bolster theirs and their children&#8217;s health, it&#8217;s easy to imagine the platform evolving in a way that brings together parents in numerous groups based on interests, from preschool applications to autism to same-sex parenting. It&#8217;s easy to see the platform helping to sell products that parents need. It&#8217;s easy to imagine the company amassing a lot of valuable information.</p>
<p>Indeed, says Hermann, the longer-term vision for Oath is to create rich datasets that it hopes can be used to improve health outcomes, including by identifying health issues earlier. Relatedly, it also hopes to build relationships with health systems and payers in order to increase access to its products.</p>
<p>For now, Oath is mostly just trying to keep up with demand. Hermann says the &#8220;small and scrappy&#8221; company found its first 50 users through Facebook ads, and that this base quickly tripled organically before Oath was forced to create a growing waitlist for what has been a closed beta until now. (Oath is &#8220;anticipating a full launch in late summer,&#8221; says Stephens.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say the company isn&#8217;t thinking at all about next steps.</p>
<p>While right now it is &#8220;laser focused on building out the most exceptional experience for this specific cohort of users in this specific period of time of their lives,&#8221; says Hermann, once it builds out many more communities of small trusted groups with &#8220;high engagement and high trust,&#8221; there is &#8220;a lot you can layer on top of that. It&#8217;s virtually limitless.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A French startup that set out to bring a new approach to driver education and road safety, and then used that foothold to expand into the related area of car insurance, is today announcing a big round of funding to continue building its service across Europe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ornikar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ornikar</a>, which prepares people for driving tests by providing online drivers education courses, lets those users organize in-person lessons with driving instructors, provides a booking system for taking their written and practical examinations, and finally provides them with competitive rates for getting car insurance as new drivers, has raised €100 million ($120 million).</p>
<p>The company intends to use the funding to expand its business. Drivers education services are live today in France and Spain, while insurance is offered today only in France: the plan will be to expand both of those to more markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series C is being led by KKR, with previous investors Idinvest, BPI, Elaia, Brighteye, and H14 also participating. Benjamin Gaignault, Ornikar&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Flavien LeRendu (who also jointly holds the title of CEO), said the startup is not disclosing its valuation, but we understand from a source that it is around $750 million. The company has raised $175 million to date.</p>
<p>Ornikar has been around since 2013 and was founded, in Gaignault&#8217;s words, &#8220;to disrupt driving education.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coming into the market at a time when most of the process of organizing, learning and booking your driving education was not only very fragmented but completely offline, Ornikar&#8217;s internet-based offering represented a step change in how French people learned to drive: the process not only became easier, but on average about 40% cheaper to arrange.</p>
<p>Ornikar&#8217;s driving education business today includes not just online course materials and booking services, but a network of instructors across 1,000 towns and cities in France, and a business that launched last year in Spain, under the Onroad brand. Some 1.5 million people have taken Ornikar&#8217;s driving education courses to date, with another 2 million using its driving school, with growth accelerating: 420,000 new customers signed up with Ornikar in the last year alone.</p>
<p>Last year was a tricky one for companies in the business of transportation. People were generally staying put and not traveling anywhere, but when they were getting around, they wanted plenty of their own space to do so.</p>
<p>Translating that to markets like France and Spain where many towns will have solid public transportation and taxi services, people might have opted to use these less, looking instead to private vehicles in their place. And translating that to Ornikar, Gaignault said that people being at home more, and looking to use the time productively with a view to driving more in the future, the startup saw business growing by 30% each month last year.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it was in the middle of the pandemic that Ornikar launched its car insurance product, which came out of the same impetus as the driver education services: it was built to fill a hole in the market rethought with Ornikar&#8217;s users in mind.</p>
<p>Car insurance in France &#8212; a €17 billion ($20 billion) market annually &#8212; is dominated by big players, and when it comes to first-time drivers and looking for competitive rates, &#8220;the bigger companies are not comfortable with user experience,&#8221; said Gaignault. &#8220;It’s pretty poor and not aligned with expectations of the customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The car insurance product &#8212; sold as Ornikar Assurance &#8212; is now on track to hit some 20,000 users by August (when it will have been in the market for a year).</p>
<p>While it accounts today for a small fraction of Ornikar&#8217;s revenues compared to its driver education platform, that take up &#8212; not just from alums of Ornikar&#8217;s drivers ed, but from those who had never used an Ornikar service before &#8212; is a good sign that it&#8217;s on to something big, Gaignault said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In October we noticed that 80% of our new insurance customers were not coming from Ornikar but from social media, Google ads and other outside sources,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we decided to create a new business unit and explore a business as an insuretech.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, he added, that will not be at the expense of the driving education: the two go hand in hand for a common goal of improving how people drive and improving road safety. Indeed, Gaignault said he envisions a time when one will feed into the other: not only will the driving school serve as a way of bringing in new insurance customers, but insurance rates can be impacted by how many driving courses a person takes to keep their knowledge of the driving code and best practices fresh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ornikar has done a tremendous job creating a great experience for students and driving instructors through engaging online education courses and a well-designed marketplace,&#8221; said Patrick Devine, director at KKR and member of the Next Generation Technology Growth investment team. &#8220;We are thrilled to invest behind Benjamin, Flavien, and their talented team as they expand internationally and accelerate their insurance offering following the successful launches of Onroad in Spain and Ornikar Assurance.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One never knows how a confirmation hearing will go these days, especially one for a young outsider nominated to an important position despite challenging the status quo and big business. <a href="http://www.linamkhan.com/">Lina Khan</a>, just such a person up for the position of FTC Commissioner, had a surprisingly pleasant time of it during today&#8217;s Senate Commerce Committee confirmation hearing — possibly because her iconoclastic approach to antitrust makes for good politics these days.</p>
<p>Khan, an associate professor of law at Columbia, is best known in the tech community for her incisive essay &#8220;Amazon Antitrust&#8217;s Paradox,&#8221; which laid out the failings of regulatory doctrine that have allowed the retail giant to progressively dominate more and more markets. (She also recently contributed to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/big-tech-blows-a-collective-raspberry-at-the-houses-antitrust-report/">House report on tech policy</a>.)</p>
<p>When it was published, in 2018, the feeling that Amazon had begun to abuse its position was, though commonplace in some circles, not really popular in the Capitol. But the growing sense that laissez-faire or insufficient regulations have created monsters in Amazon, Google, and Facebook (to start) has led to a rare bipartisan agreement that we must find some way, any way will do, of putting these upstart corporations back in their place.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This in turn led to a sense of shared purpose and camaraderie in the confirmation hearing, which was a triple header: Khan joined Bill Nelson, nominated to lead NASA, and Leslie Kiernan, who would join the Commerce Department as General Counsel, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?511008-1/nasa-administrator-ftc-commissioner-confirmation-hearing">for a really nice little three-hour chat</a>.</p>

<p>Khan is one of several in the Biden administration who signal a new approach to taking on Big Tech and other businesses that have gotten out of hand, and the questions posed to her by Senators from both sides of the aisle seemed genuine and got genuinely satisfactory answers from a confident Khan.</p>
<p>She deftly avoided a few attempts to bait her — including one involving Section 230; wrong Commission, Senator — and her answers primarily reaffirmed her professional opinion that the FTC should be better informed and more preemptive in its approach to regulating these secretive, powerful corporations.</p>
<p>Here are a few snippets representative of the questioning and indicative of her positions on a few major issues (answers lightly edited for clarity):</p>
<p><strong>On the FTC getting involved in the fight between Google, Facebook, and news providers:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Everything needs to be on the table. Obviously local journalism is in crisis, and i think the current COVID moment has really underscored the deep democratic emergency that is resulting when we don&#8217;t have reliable sources of local news.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also cited the increasing concentration of ad markets and the arbitrary nature of, for example, algorithm changes that can have wide-ranging effects on entire industries.</p>

<p><strong>On Clarence Thomas&#8217;s troubling suggestion that social media companies should be considered &#8220;common carriers&#8221;:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I think it prompted a lot of interesting discussion,&#8221; she said, very diplomatically. &#8220;In the Amazon article, I identified two potential pathways forward when thinking about these dominant digital platforms. One is enforcing competition laws and ensuring that these markets are competitive.&#8221; (i.e. using antitrust rules)</p>
<p>&#8220;The other is, if we instead recognize that perhaps there are certain economies of scale, network externalities that will lead these markets to stay dominated by a very few number of companies, then we need to apply a different set of rules. We have a long legal tradition of thinking about what types of checks can be applied when there&#8217;s a lot of concentration and common carriage is one of those tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should clarify that some of these firms are now integrated in so many markets that you may reach for a different set of tools depending on which specific market you&#8217;re looking at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(This was a very polite way of saying common carriage and existing antitrust rules are totally unsuitable for the job.)</p>
<p><strong>On potentially reviewing past mergers the FTC approved:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The resources of the commission have not really kept pace with the increasing size of the economy, as well as the increasing size and complexity of the deals the commission is reviewing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was an assumption that digital markets in particular are fast moving so we don&#8217;t need to be concerned about potential concentration in the markets, because any exercise of power will get disciplined by entry and new competition. Now of course we know that in the markets you actually have significant network externalities in ways that make them more sticky. In hindsight there&#8217;s a growing sense that those merger reviews were a missed opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Here Senator Blackburn (R-TN) in one of the few negative moments fretted about Khan&#8217;s &#8220;lack of experience in coming to that position&#8221; before asking about a spectrum plan — wrong Commission, Senator.)</p>
<p><strong>On the difficulty of enforcing something like an order against Facebook:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;One of the challenges is the deep information asymmetry that exists between some of these firms and enforcers and regulators. I think it&#8217;s clear that in some instances the agencies have been a little slow to catch up to the underlying business realities and the empirical realities of how these markets work. So at the very least ensuring the agencies are doing everything they can to keep pace is gonna be important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In social media we have these black box algorithms, proprietary algorithms that can sometimes make it difficult to know what&#8217;s really going on. The FTC needs to be using its information gathering capacities to mitigate some of these gaps.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>On extending protections for children and other vulnerable groups online:</strong></p>
<p>Some of these dangers are heightened given some of the ways in which the pandemic has rendered families and children especially dependent on some of these [education] technologies. So I think we need to be especially vigilant here. The previous rules should be the floor, not the ceiling.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall there was little partisan bickering and a lot of feeling from both sides that Khan was, if not <em>technically</em> experienced at the job (not rare with a coveted position like FTC Commissioner), about as competent a nominee as anyone could ask for. Not only that but her highly considered and fairly assertive positions on matters of antitrust and competition could help put Amazon and Google, already in the regulatory doghouse, on the defensive for once.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lot has changed in the last decade-ish of instant photography, yet all the while the boxy build of instant cameras has stayed more or less intact. Modern instant shooters have slimmed down and put on<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/gift-guide-photography-2020-best-photography-gifts-ideas-for-photographers/"> a variety of calming pastel tones</a>, but they&#8217;re not exactly slender.</p>
<p>But lo, Polaroid — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/27/weve-come-full-rectangle-polaroid-is-reborn-out-of-the-impossible-project/">the new Polaroid, not the old Polaroid</a> — has done a thing. The company says its latest camera, the Polaroid Go, is the world&#8217;s smallest analog instant camera. And you know, yeah, it looks really quite small.</p>
<p>How small is small? It&#8217;s 4.1 inches long, 2.4 inches tall and a little over 3 inches wide. The Go is undeniably tiny but boasts a handful of useful features, including a selfie timer, selfie mirror and the ability to take dreamy double exposures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the promo photos, Polaroid&#8217;s models hold it like a delicate canapé or casually wield it with a few dainty fingers as it dangles from various stylish-looking accessories (camera straps? necklaces?). The company really wants people to wear this thing, it seems, and I for one am not above it.</p>

<p>With the Go, Polaroid continues the sort of annoying but I guess necessary instant photography trend of making a new film format, which in this case is basically a miniaturized version of its iconic old-school square film. And while the camera is teeny, TechCrunch&#8217;s own tiny camera-haver and forthcoming review writer Devin Coldewey says you don&#8217;t actually lose much size in the shots compared to something like the Instax Mini.</p>
<p>Polaroid claims that the Go marks the &#8220;most significant and exciting change to the Polaroid form factor in decades&#8221; and it&#8217;s probably not wrong. The company&#8217;s improbable return from the dead was likely more exciting, but we don&#8217;t want to undermine how cute this thing is. Let&#8217;s just hope it makes pictures good.</p>
<p>The Polaroid Go will join the Polaroid Now, its standard though now hideously bloated sibling, and the OneStep+, which blends digital and analog and connects to a phone over Bluetooth. It&#8217;s <a href="https://us.polaroid.com/collections/go-film-bundle">on preorder now and will retail for $100</a>, which is the same amount you&#8217;d pay for the regular old new Polaroid camera. But why would you?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[TechCrunch spoke with UiPath CFO Ashim Gupta today to learn more about his company's foray into the public markets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After an upward revision, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/a-cooling-trend-in-public-markets-makes-uipaths-down-round-ipo-a-win-for-the-company/">UiPath priced its IPO last night at $56 per share</a>, a few dollars above its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/uipath-raises-ipo-range-still-targets-lower-valuation-than-final-private-round/">raised target range</a>. The above-range price meant that the unicorn put more capital into its books through its public offering.</p>
<p>For a company in a market as competitive as robotic process automation (RPA), the funds are welcome. In fact, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">RPA has been top of mind</a> for startups and established companies alike over the last year or so. In that time frame, enterprise stalwarts like SAP, Microsoft, IBM and ServiceNow have been buying smaller RPA startups and building their own, all in an effort to muscle into an increasingly lucrative market.</p>
<p>In June 2019, Gartner reported that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-meteoric-rise-from-unknown-startup-to-35b-rpa-juggernaut/#:~:text=the%20fastest-growing%20area">RPA was the fastest-growing area</a> in enterprise software, and while the growth has slowed down since, the sector is still attracting attention. UIPath, which Gartner found was the market leader, has been riding that wave, and today’s capital influx should help the company maintain its market position.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that when the company had its last private funding round in February, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">brought home $750 million</a> at an impressive valuation of $35 billion. But as TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/uipaths-first-ipo-pricing-could-be-a-warning-to-late-stage-investors/">noted over the course of its pivot to the public markets</a>, that round valued the company above its final IPO price. As a result, this week&#8217;s $56-per-share public offer wound up being something of a modest down-round IPO to UiPath&#8217;s final private valuation.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cu8kiBOfF4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">Robotic process automation platform UiPath raises $750M at $35B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Robotic process automation platform UiPath raises $750M at $35B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/embed/#?secret=cu8kiBOfF4" data-secret="cu8kiBOfF4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Then, a broader set of public traders got hold of its stock and bid its shares higher. The former unicorn&#8217;s shares closed their first day’s trading at precisely $69, above the per-share price at which the company closed its final private round.</p>
<p>So despite a somewhat circuitous route, UiPath closed its first day as a public company worth more than it was in its Series F round — when it sold 12,043,202 shares sold at $62.27576 apiece, per SEC filings. More simply, UiPath closed today worth more per-share than it was in February.</p>
<p>How you might value the company, whether you prefer a simple or fully-diluted share count, is somewhat immaterial at this juncture. UiPath had a good day.</p>
<p>While it’s hard to know what the company might do with the proceeds, chances are it will continue to try to expand its platform beyond pure RPA, which could become market-limited over time as companies look at other, more modern approaches to automation. By adding additional automation capabilities — organically or via acquisitions — the company can begin covering broader parts of its market.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with UiPath CFO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashim-gupta-0372ba5/">Ashim Gupta</a> today, curious about the company’s choice of a traditional IPO, its general avoidance of adjusted metrics in its SEC filings, and the IPO market’s current temperature. The final question was on our minds, as some companies have pulled their public listings in the wake of a market described as &#8220;challenging&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Why did UiPath not direct list after its huge February raise?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
