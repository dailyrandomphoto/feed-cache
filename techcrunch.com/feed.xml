										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the company has temporarily pulled back the latest version of the company&#8217;s Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software less than a day after its release.</p>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-2">&#8220;Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452345284483235841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1452345284483235841%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F24%2F22743628%2Felon-musk-tesla-fsd-beta-10-3-rollback-issues-phantom-fcw">Musk tweeted on Sunday</a>. &#8220;Please note, this is to be expected with beta software. It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA (quality assurance), hence public beta.&#8221;</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-2">This news comes as Tesla is under fire from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">regulators questioning the safety</a> of its advanced driver assistance system that is branded &#8220;Autopilot&#8221; after several vehicles crashed into parked first responder vehicles while the system was engaged. Autopilot comes standard on Tesla vehicles. The so-called FSD software is an additional $10,000 and offers more automated driving features.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223109" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p data-testid="paragraph-2">However, Tesla vehicles are not self-driving. It is still an advanced driver assistance system, and drivers need to be fully attentive even when FSD is engaged. A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/mit-study-finds-tesla-drivers-become-inattentive-when-autopilot-is-activated/?tpcc=ECTW2020">recent MIT study</a> found drivers tend to be less attentive which can lead to safety risks.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-2">Version 10.3 was meant to be released to some Tesla owners on Friday, and on Saturday Musk said they would need to wait another day.</p>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-4">&#8220;Regression in some left turns at traffic lights found by internal QA in 10.3&#8221; he tweeted on Saturday. &#8220;Fix in work, probably releasing tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-4">Videos posted by beta users of the 10.3 software show multiple Forward Collision Warnings despite there being no immediate danger, and some vehicles even auto-braked without reason. Drivers also took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qeu10x/known_fsd_beta_103_taccautosteer_bug/">social media</a> to post issues including a disappearing Autosteer option, problems with traffic aware cruise control and Autopilot panic. Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452330803015335939">tweeted that the company is working on the issues with Autopilot and cruise control</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p data-testid="paragraph-4">Musk has not yet shared a possible release date for the next version of FSD.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Groww has tripled its valuation to $3 billion in just six months as the Indian fintech startup looks to broaden its offerings and help more millennials start their investment journey in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Iconiq Growth led the Bangalore-based startup’s $251 million Series E financing round. Alkeon, Lone Pine Capital and Steadfast as well as existing investors Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, YC Continuity, Tiger Global, and Propel Venture Partners “significantly” participated in the new round.</p>
<p><a href="http://groww.in">Groww</a>, which has now raised over $390 million to date, was valued at $250 million in September last year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">$1 billion in April this year</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223108" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch reported last month that Groww was in talks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/indias-groww-in-talks-to-raise-funds-at-a-3-billion-valuation/">finalize a $250 million round at a $3 billion valuation</a>. The startup had multiple termsheets, the report added.</p>
<p>Groww helps millennials invest in mutual funds, futures, derivatives, stocks, and initial public offerings. Lalit Keshre, co-founder and chief executive of Groww, told TechCrunch in an interview that the startup is working to introduce several more asset classes for its users to invest. &#8220;We plan to offer them all asset classes eventually,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are making a difference in the lives of millions of Indians by democratizing access. And it seems the journey has just begun with such a huge opportunity ahead of us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Groww is tapping into a huge market. More than 200 million people in India transact money digitally, but fewer than 30 million currently invest in mutual funds and stocks. The startup had over 15 million registered users earlier this year, two-thirds of whom are first-time investors. Additionally, more than 60% of Groww users are in smaller cities and towns of India.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup didn&#8217;t update its user base figure today, but Keshre said Groww has grown significantly in the past 18 months as more Indians begin to explore investments.</p>
<p>“The financial services market in India is already large, growing rapidly, and ripe for disruption. During the last couple of years, Groww has demonstrated that they are ready to seize that opportunity through strong accelerating momentum predicated on strength of technology,” said Yoonkee Sull, partner at ICONIQ Growth, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Driven by an exceptional product-oriented team, Groww is already amongst the leading investment platforms in India, showcasing strong unit economics and customer cohorts. We are excited to participate in the company’s vision to be the primary financial platform for Indian consumers.”</p>
<p>Keshre said the startup will deploy the fresh capital for its long-term growth and educating the first time investors.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported earlier that Groww, like a handful of other India startups, is studying cryptocurrency. Keshre said the startup won&#8217;t offer such investment opportunity to users until the Indian regulator clears it. The Indian startup is currently on track to clock about $35 million in ARR, the publication reported.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stripe has made its second investment in India, just days after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/stripe-acquires-recko-its-first-acquisition-in-india-to-add-reconciliation-to-its-payment-services-stack/">disclosing the first</a>. One of the world’s most valuable startups has backed Bangalore-based SaaS fintech firm Clear, the two said Sunday evening.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old Indian startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/17/indias-cleartax-raises-12m-to-expand-into-new-financial-services/">formerly known as ClearTax</a>, said it has raised $75 million in its Series C funding. The round was led by Kora Capital. Stripe, as well as Alua Capital, Think Investments and several other existing investors participated in the round, which brings the startup’s all-time raise to over $140 million. The new round values the Indian startup at over $700 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p><a href="https://cleartax.in">Clear</a> &#8212; which counts Y Combinator, Sequoia Capital India, Founders Fund, and Elevation Capital among its earliest investors &#8212; helps individuals and businesses file their tax returns. It also provides wealth management advice to individuals, and helps businesses with e-invoicing and credit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222977" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup says over 6 million individuals, and more than 1 million small and medium-sized businesses and over 30,000 enterprises use its platform.</p>
<p>In the past 18 months, said Archit Gupta, Clear founder and chief executive in an interview with TechCrunch, the startup’s SaaS platform has grown five times. Clear said it processes over 10%, up from 3% in 2016, of India’s business invoices with a GMV of $400 billion.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2222980" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stripe-cleartax-tweet.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="567" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stripe-cleartax-tweet.jpg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stripe-cleartax-tweet.jpg?resize=150,142 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stripe-cleartax-tweet.jpg?resize=300,284 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stripe-cleartax-tweet.jpg?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Clear’s marquee offering, ClearTax, started at a time when e-filing was not as popular in India. But the startup found itself in a good spot thanks to government regulations in the following years. (The government made e-filing mandatory in the country five years ago, for instance.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the number of people in India, home to 1.4 billion people, who pay taxes is still fairly low. (Only about 60 million individuals pay taxes in India.) That has been one of the reasons why Clear has expanded its offerings to serve businesses and also broadened to services such as credit and wealth management.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Clear as they innovate at scale in the Indian SaaS ecosystem, enabling enterprises and SMEs to automate their workflows around taxation, invoicing and several other adjacencies,” said Nitin Saigal, Kora’s founder and CIO, in a statement.</p>
<p>Gupta said the startup will deploy the fresh funds to broaden its offerings and is also beginning to expand overseas. Clear, which is already serving businesses in the Middle East, plans to expand to cater to similar businesses in Europe soon, he said.</p>
<p>“We welcome Kora, Stripe and our other incoming investors. Kora has strong experience in technology players in emerging markets and Stripe is a global technology company that builds economic infrastructure for the internet &#8211; we are excited to learn from both of them,” he said.</p>
<p>“India is on a massive digitisation journey and we are fortunate to be in the perfect storm of electronic invoicing, GST, UPI, cheap mobile internet and rapid adoption of technology due to Covid-19. We are doubling down on our SaaS platform to help businesses with collateral free debt and payments. This funding also gives us fuel for our international expansion.”</p>
<p>Stripe has yet to enter the Southeast Asia and India markets in a meaningful way. The firm has teams at both the regions, but has yet to make inroads in either. If it chose to expand to the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, it would compete with YC and Sequoia Capital India-backed Razorpay, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/salesforce-backs-indian-payments-startup-razorpay/">received funds from Salesforce</a> and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/18/razorpay-160-million-raise-valuation-hits-3-billion/">last valued at $3 billion</a>. Like Clear and Razorpay, Stripe is also backed by Y Combinator.</p>
<p>Stripe has already backed at least one more Indian startup, according to sources.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As social-audio apps like Clubhouse, Beams, Pludo, Racket and Quest have gained popularity in the last year, more marketers, product teams and up-and-coming competitors are beginning to explore the strategies that are making and breaking the user experience in this space.</p>
<p>On one side, these products were fairly straightforward when they first hit the market because content creators could simply sign up, create audio rooms or short-form podcasts, and then set a time for a broadcast. But as more and more negative user feedback bubbles to the top of internet forums, now is a good stopping point to consider just how “social” social audio should be.</p>
<p>We know social audio isn’t meant to imitate YouTube, Twitter or Facebook, whose user experiences are largely built around one-way communication. But if we exclude them, who should social-audio companies consider while developing their strategy?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222525" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Given my background in television and marketing, it should come as no surprise that I believe social audio needs to leverage the same strategies used by major news organizations.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, here are five of the easiest ways social-audio app teams can do it.</p>
<h2>Organize for inclusion</h2>
<p>When we think about the design of apps, the things that typically come to mind are the placement of the hamburger stack, the font types and the ease of the ability of the user to get in and out of their account.</p>
<p>But what we rarely think about is how the design supports or doesn’t support disabled users. A notable &#8212; and reasonable &#8212; concern that emerged last year as social audio took off was the lack of accessibility features for people with impaired sight or hearing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Small text makes it harder for people with impaired vision to navigate the apps, and the lack of captioning makes it difficult for those who are deaf to enjoy the conversations.</p>
<p>If you think about it, restaurants and movie theaters typically have a way for patrons to use a different menu in Braille or larger print, or they offer captioning for audience members who need an additional layer of support to enjoy the show. Social audio app teams and designers should include accessibility checkpoints in the workflow to address these concerns early in the development road map.</p>
<h2>In the first year, leverage journalists and hosts</h2>
<p>Marketing social-audio apps to content creators is a great way to pull in early adopters, but it could be better to identify experienced hosts and journalists that are willing to work with your brand in its beta stage as well.</p>
<p>Why? Because when you’re building an app that will eventually take up a portion of the media market, credibility is king.</p>
<p>Content creation and credibility aren’t mutually exclusive. And vetting by experienced journalists and hosts who have experience producing live shows and moderating public feedback can improve the audience’s experience.</p>
<p>Not to mention, if you start with a lineup of talent that knows the ropes, you can buy yourself time on the user education offerings. By having credible figureheads lead your conversations, they will also set the tone for how creators who are onboarded after them should use the platform effectively.</p>
<h2>Mimic big media</h2>
<p>What do Spotify, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, ABC, NBC, CBS and the BBC all have in common? Programming.</p>
<p>If someone wants to know what’s coming on at 8 o’clock tonight on ABC, it’s easy for them to find out and set aside time to watch a show. With Netflix, audiences know about changes in the lineup weeks if not months in advance.</p>
<p>Consider having a lineup of rooms or shows that are produced by in-house talent. This way, the user audience has a reason to be on the platform even if their favorite creators are on hiatus.</p>
<p>Yes, some content creators are savvy enough to let their audience know when they will be back, but not all have the support of a producer or experienced team to make sure they can maintain a presence.</p>
<p>At first glance, this doesn’t seem like a big issue to the app teams, because you’re betting on the content creator to come back and bring their audience. But this is where the apps are actually losing engagement: If the creators aren’t consistent and the audience doesn’t know when to expect them back, and the user doesn’t receive suggestions to similar audio rooms or shows quickly, they lose interest and stop returning.</p>
<p>And later, when they are asked why they stopped using the platforms, their review is typically negative because they didn’t see the continued value.</p>
<h2>When creators receive complaints, educate immediately</h2>
<p>When entertainers mess up, all it takes is a few groups of people to air their concerns, and before you know it, their career takes a huge hit. Sometimes this happens because the content creator has acted maliciously, but other times it’s due to honest mistakes or sheer ignorance.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: If you’re swift to remove the creator, not only does it tarnish their career, but it strips others in the community of the education needed about what to do in a similar circumstance &#8212; and how to reconcile the initial concerns privately and publicly.</p>
<p>Given the live nature of these platforms, these snafus are guaranteed to pop up, and for that reason, it’s a good idea to figure out how to address issues in a way that’s supportive to all involved.</p>
<p>The suggestion here is to either create a training program that the content creator would have to complete before they are allowed to return to the platform, or your company can partner with online or in-person training courses to educate people on topics relating to things like race, culture or social issues.</p>
<p>I liken it to getting a ticket for a moving violation and being required to attend traffic school. These app teams should think of a similar solution that allows creators to navigate being in the public eye and learning as they go. Not all content creators are trained as journalists. If they are targeted in the marketing, there should be a strategy to retain them as active participants on the platform, even after mistakes come up.</p>
<h2>Launch a content council</h2>
<p>Last but certainly not least, the moment your company goes into beta testing, it would be wise to create a content council to address any areas of sensitivity that may come up on your platform.</p>
<p>In the same way that startups have advisory boards, consider forming a content council with industry experts in diversity, equity and inclusion, disabilities, global affairs, politics, LGBTQIA advocacy, race, healthcare and social justice, just to name a few. This takes the pressure off of the internal employees to know how to tackle tough topics on the platform. It also provides the company with someone who is engaged with the business internally. These experts could be helpful if the platform faces any controversy around hot-button topics.</p>
<p>As the social-audio space continues to expand, so will the ways creators and audiences engage with the platforms. But whether that growth continues to spike through the rest of 2021, one thing is for sure, the social-audio space may be bigger than what it’s currently portraying itself to be, and as a content creator and end user, I can’t wait to see what opportunities will open up in this space.</p>

<p>Now, I turn to the question of Chinese character output—monitors, printers, and related peripherals—where still more challenges confronted engineers seeking to render Western-manufactured personal computers and computer peripherals compatible with Chinese character text.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222791" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While we call them “peripherals,” suggesting a sort of supporting role, they are in fact at the very center of computing in Chinese, from the extreme limitations that Chinese computing faced in the 1970s and 80s to the immense strides and successes it has experienced from the 1990s onward.</p>
<p>During the early rise of consumer PCs in the 1980s, no Western-manufactured personal computer, printer, monitor, operating system, or other peripheral was capable of handling Chinese character input or output—not “out of the box,” at least. To the contrary, all of these devices exhibited the same kind of English-language and Latin alphabetic bias found in, for example, the early history of telegraphic codes and mechanical typewriters, as <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chinese-typewriter">I’ve explored in my other research</a>.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, what ensued in China and the Chinese-speaking world was a period of intense hacking and modding. Element by element, engineers in China and elsewhere rendered Western-manufactured computing hardware and software compatible with Chinese. It was a messy, decentralized, and often brilliant period of experimentation and innovation.</p>
<p>When we turn our attention to this broader ecology of computing—on printers, monitors, and all of the other “stuff” needed to make computing work—part two of this series on Chinese computing spotlights two conclusions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First, the dominance of alphabet-based computing—“alphabetic order,” as I call it—went far beyond the question of keyboards and computer memory. Like the typewriter before them, computing devices, languages, and protocols were by and large invented first in English-language contexts, and only later “extended” to other languages and to writing systems other than the Latin alphabet. To achieve even basic functionality, Chinese engineers needed to constantly push against the boundaries of off-the-shelf computing peripherals, hardware, and software.</p>
<p>Second, I’ll dismantle the oversimplified idea of Chinese “copycatting” and “piracy” that has dominated, then as now, Western accounts of Chinese computing during this pivotal period in the late 1970s and 1980s. When encountering programs such as “Chinese DOS,” the knee-jerk reaction in the Western world has been to treat them as just more &#8220;Chinese knock-offs.&#8221; What this simplistic narrative fails to understand is that without the kinds of “forgeries” we will examine in this article, none of these Western-designed software suites would have worked <i>at all </i>in the context of Chinese character computing.</p>
<h2>Dot-matrix printing and the metallurgical depths of alphabetic order</h2>
<p>The first peripheral we need to examine is the printer—specifically, dot-matrix printers. From the standpoint of Chinese computing, the politics of dot-matrix printing began with the then-dominant configurations of industry standard printer heads—the 9-pin printer heads found in practically all mass-manufactured dot-matrix printers during the 1970s.</p>
<p>These commercial dot-matrix printers were able to produce low-resolution Latin alphabet bitmaps with just one pass of the printer head. This was not by accident, of course. Rather, the choice of nine pins was “tuned” to the needs of low-resolution Latin alphabetic printing.</p>
<p>The same printer heads, however, were incapable of printing low-resolution Chinese character bitmaps in anything less than two full passes of the printer head. Two-pass printing dramatically increased the time needed to print Chinese as compared to English and also introduced graphical inaccuracies, whether due to inconsistencies in the advancement of the platen, uneven ink registration, paper jams, or otherwise.</p>
<p>Aesthetically, two-pass printing could also result in characters with differing ink densities on their upper versus their lower halves. Worse, in the absence of any mod, all Chinese characters would be at least twice the height of English words, no matter the font size being used. This created comically distorted printouts in which English words appeared austere and economical, while Chinese characters appeared grotesquely oversized. Such print-outs also wasted large amounts of paper, with every document looking something like a large-print children’s book.</p>
<p><em>An example illustration of how these printer heads work is provided in this video, courtesy of the author:</em></p>

<p>Latin alphabet-centrism ran deeper than one might initially expect, moreover, as illustrated in the work of early Chinese computing pioneer Chan Yeh. Setting out to digitize Chinese characters and basing his system on a bitmap grid of 18-by-22, Yeh’s initial idea was an obvious one: to reduce the diameter of the pins so as to fit more of them on the printer head. As he discovered, however, the solution would not be so simple.</p>

<p>The Latin alphabetic bias of impact printing, he found, was encoded within the very metallurgical properties of printer components. Simply put, the metal alloys used to fabricate printer pins were themselves calibrated to 9-pin Latin alphabetic printing, such that reducing their diameters to the sizes needed for Chinese would result in pin deformation or breakage.</p>
<p>To compensate, engineers tricked Western-built printers into fitting as many as 18 dots in roughly the same amount of vertical space as nine normally spaced dots.</p>
<p>Their technique was ingenious and simple. Following standard, two-pass printing, an initial array of dots was laid down during the first pass of the printing head. Rather than laying down this second array of dots beneath the first, however, they tricked the printer into registering them <i>in between</i> the first set of nine dots, almost like the teeth of a zipper fastening together.</p>
<p>To achieve this effect, engineers rewrote printer drivers to hack the printer’s paper advance mechanism, refining it so that it rotated at an extremely small interval (as small as 1/216<sup>th</sup> of an inch).</p>
<p>Pin configurations weren’t the only challenge. Commercially produced dot-matrix printers were also tuned to the ASCII character encoding system, and thus unable to handle Chinese text <i>as text</i>. In English-language word processing, printing was not an act of transmitting a raster image to the printer. Rather, English-language text could be directly delivered via the printer driver as ASCII-encoded text, which resulted in much faster printer speeds.</p>
<p>In order for Western-built dot-matrix printers to print Chinese characters, however, there was no way to use these printers’ “text” mode. Instead, the printers once again had to be tricked, this time in order to print Chinese characters using the graphics mode typically reserved for printing raster images.</p>
<p>For students of the Chinese language, the irony here will be apparent: in order for Chinese characters to function on early Western-built dot-matrix printers, Chinese characters had to treated as <i>pictures </i>or <i>pictographs. </i>Pictographs were something that Westerners had long assumed Chinese characters to be, even though they are not (with few exceptions). But in the context of dot-matrix printing, “pictographs” were indeed what they had no choice but to become.</p>
<p>Eventually, a new family of impact printers began to be released on the commercial market: 24-pin dot-matrix printers, featuring pin diameters of 0.2 mm (as compared to 0.34mm on 9-pin printers). Unsurprisingly, the leading manufacturers of these new printers were largely Japanese companies such as Panasonic, NEC, Toshiba, Okidata, and more. Given the need to print characters required by the Japanese language, Japanese engineers needed to solve similar challenges as their Chinese counterparts.</p>
<h2>Pop-up modernity: Chinese character monitors</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2222795" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222795" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2222795" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="521" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg 1648w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg?resize=300,230 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg?resize=768,588 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg?resize=680,521 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg?resize=1536,1176 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222795" class="wp-caption-text">Patent document image demonstrating the conversion of Chinese characters into bitmap rasters. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Thomas S. Mullaney East Asian Information Technology History Collection, Stanford University</p></div></p>
<p>Yet another domain within the ecology of Chinese computing was that of mass-manufactured computer monitors. In certain respects, the politics of monitors were similar to those of printers, particularly with regards to the issue of character distortion. Unavoidably, even the lowest-resolution Chinese character bitmaps occupied upwards of twice the vertical and horizontal space of Latin alphabetic letters, making the Chinese in bilingual texts appear comically oversized (such as can be seen in this story&#8217;s featured image).</p>
<p>Standard, Western-manufactured computer monitors could also fit a far smaller number of Chinese characters on screen than Latin letters, both in terms of line length (the number of characters per line) and depth (the number of lines per screen). Chinese language users could thus see only small portions of their texts at any one time.</p>
<p>Then there were challenges unique to Chinese character display: the pop-up menu. Because of the inherently iterative process of Chinese input, in which users are constantly being presented with Chinese characters that fulfill the criteria provided by their keystrokes, an essential feature of Chinese computing is a “window”—whether software-based or hardware-based—that enables the user to review these Chinese character candidates.</p>
<p>Although the pop-up menu is a ubiquitous feature of Chinese computing from the 1980s onward, this feedback technique dates back to the 1940s. In a 1947 experimental Chinese typewriter designed by Lin Yutang, there was a key component of the machine the inventor called his “Magic Eye”: in effect, the first “pop-up menu” in history, albeit a mechanical one.</p>
<p>With the advent of personal computers, mechanical windows such as those found on the MingKwai, Sinotype, Sinowriter, or otherwise, were integrated into the computer’s main display. It became a software-governed “window” (or bar) on the screen, rather than a separate, physical device.</p>
<p>This pop-up menu placed further constraints on the already precious real estate of the computer monitor, however. What we might term “pop-up menu design” became a critically important area of research and innovation within Chinese personal computing from its inception. Companies experimented with different menu styles, formats, and behaviors, attempting to strike a balance between the requirements of input, screen size, and the preferences of users.</p>
<p>There were trade-offs to each option. Menus that displayed a larger number of character candidates at once increased the likelihood of more rapidly finding one’s desired graph, but came at the cost of screen space. Smaller windows, while less intrusive, required the user to scroll through “pages” of character candidates, if the user’s desired graph was not found amongst the top recommendations.</p>
<p>As a consequence of these strict limitations, Chinese engineers and firms were constantly seeking next-generation monitors. While this was perhaps true for the global market at large—since higher resolution monitors represent something of an “inherent good” for consumers—nevertheless, the motivating reasons for this hunger for high-resolution was dramatically different for the Chinese-language market.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: No ESC</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2222793" style="width: 507px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222793" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2222793" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg?w=497" alt="" width="497" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg 1288w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg?resize=110,150 110w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg?resize=219,300 219w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg?resize=768,1052 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg?resize=497,680 497w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg?resize=1122,1536 1122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222793" class="wp-caption-text">Inaugural issue of the magazine &#8220;Chinese Computing&#8221;. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Thomas S. Mullaney East Asian Information Technology History Collection, Stanford University</p></div></p>
<p>As brilliant as each of these mods might have been, at the end of the day they remained just that: <i>modifications</i>. The autonomy and authority to create original systems—that is, the systems that subsequently needed to be modified—was ultimately where power was concentrated.</p>
<p>While the practice of modding tended to lead to a wide array of systems, it often came at the expense of interoperability. Modding required constant vigilance, moreover—no one-time “set it and forget it” solution was possible.</p>
<p>With every new computer program released on the market—and every new version of every computer program—programmers in China had to “debug” them line by line, insofar as programs themselves contained code which could set, or reset, parameters for the computer monitor, for example.</p>
<p>For most English-language word processing programs, for example, the baseline assumption baked into such programs was a 25-by-80 character display format (<i>zifu fangshi xianshi</i>). Since this format was incompatible with Chinese character display, engineers had to manually change every place in the program code where this 25-by-80 format was set. They did so, tellingly enough, using standard-issue “DEBUG” software. Through accumulated experience, engineers steadily learned their way around the assembly code bowels of leading programs.</p>
<p>Once modded, moreover, underlying operating systems and programs could always change. Shortly after the development of CCDOS and other systems, for example, IBM announced its move to a new operating system: the PS/2. “China and Chinese-language have been thrown into turmoil,” one article from 1987 wrote, noting that no existing Chinese-language systems—whether in Taiwan or on the mainland—had yet to be adapted to it. “The race is on for developers to come up with the best match for IBM’s MS/DOS platform.”</p>
<p>From an historical perspective, modders are vulnerable to misrecognition and erasure. In their time and place, their work was often misrecognized as mere theft or piracy, rather than as necessary acts of re-engineering to render incompatible machines compatible with the Chinese language. In a January 1987 issue of <i>PC Magazine</i>, for example, one cartoonist lampooned Sinicized operating systems. “It Runs on MSG-DOS,” the cartoon’s caption read.</p>
<p>As Western manufacturers slowly incorporated many of these Chinese mods into the core architectures of their systems (as well as Japanese and other non-Western ones), it is all too easy to forget that such changes were inspired by the work of engineers in China and the non-Western world. In sum, it is all too easy to retroactively imagine that the Western-built computer has always been language-agnostic, neutral, and welcoming.</p>
<p>This critical period of computing history has gone completely unwritten, and for a very simple reason. In the United States, and the Western world more broadly, none of these mods have been understood in terms of “experimentation,” let alone “innovation.” Instead, another set of words was—and continues to be—reserved for them: “copycatting,” “mimickry,” “piracy.” As Chinese engineers reverse-engineered Western-built dot-matrix printers, enabling them to print Chinese characters; or retrofitted Western-designed operating systems to make possible the use of Chinese input method editors, all that most Western observers could see was “theft.”</p>

<p><div id="attachment_2223023" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223023" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223023" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg" alt="XPILOT 3.5 and City NGP - Xpeng" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg 2364w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223023" class="wp-caption-text">XPILOT 3.5 and City NGP</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xpeng is planning to roll out the next generation of its ADAS, called Xpilot, to drivers in select cities during the first half of 2022. Xpilot 3.5 will feature &#8220;City Navigation Guided Pilot (NGP)&#8221; and will only be available to drivers of Xpeng&#8217;s P5 family sedan, which can be built with lidar, millimeter-wave radar and a 3D visual perception network that can recognize, classify and position multiple targets – all of which is essential for city-level NGP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The last Xpilot version, 3.0, which was available to drivers of Xpeng&#8217;s P7 sedan, handled highway-level NGP, through which Xpeng was able to gather nearly 12 million kilometers, or 7.5 million miles, of data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xpilot 3.5 will have a strategic planning module with advanced prediction capabilities that uses a combination of rule-driven and data-driven AI to handle city scenarios, like avoiding static objects and vulnerable road users, as well as lane changing at any speed, according to Xpeng. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xpeng’s approach to reaching full autonomy is similar to Tesla’s, in that it aims to go through Level 2 autonomy, or ADAS systems, on its way to reaching Level 5. (<a href="https://www.sae.org/news/press-room/2018/12/sae-international-releases-updated-visual-chart-for-its-%E2%80%9Clevels-of-driving-automation%E2%80%9D-standard-for-self-driving-vehicles">SAE International</a> describes Level 2 autonomy as a system that mainly has support features, like adaptive cruise control and brake support. It describes Level 5 autonomy a system that can drive anywhere under all conditions.) Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/the-station-tesla-rolls-out-its-fsd-beta-button-delivery-deals-heat-up-micromobility-evolves/">Tesla released a software update</a> that allows customers to request access to its Full Self-Driving Beta (FSD Beta) software. FSD includes capabilities like automatic lane change, moving into and out of parking spots and autosteering, which is currently not yet available for city streets. Tesla has given no date as to when it will bring this capability to cities, but it will be powered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/tesla-backs-vision-only-approach-to-autonomy-using-powerful-supercomputer/">using </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only vision and neural network processing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Human-machine co-pilot functions will remain critical for the foreseeable future,” said XinZhou Wu, VP of autonomous driving at Xpeng, during the event. “Our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mission is to progressively transition from advanced driver assistance to full autonomous driving, with a clear roadmap to first completely connect all driving scenarios. Our closed-loop data operation, software iteration and mass production capability – all created in-house – put us in pole position to significantly improve safety and resolve the industry’s long-tail issues.”</span></p>
<p>Just as Tesla charges for its FSD software, so does Xpeng for its Xpilot. Xpeng didn&#8217;t say how much version 3.5 would cost, but version 3.0 currently costs about $3,200 (RMB 20,000), which can be purchased outright or paid for via annual subscription, an Xpeng spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>

<h3><b>Xpilot 4.0 to provide full-scenario point-to-point ADAS</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xpeng’s Xpilot 4.0, which is planned for a roll out in the first half of 2023, would give the startup an edge on its race to full autonomy. The plan is to be the first to deliver full-scenario assisted smart driving experiences, from turning the vehicle on to parking it and everything in between. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This version of Xpilot will require a lot of compute power, so Xpeng is building a hardware upgrade for version 4.0, “with 508 TOPS ECU compute power supported by two Orin-X autonomous driving System-on-the-Chip (SOC) units, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">8-million-pixel front-view binocular camera and 2.9-million-pixel side-view cameras (covering front, rear, left and right view), and a highly integrated and expandable domain controller,” the company said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>A spokesperson for Xpeng told TechCrunch Xpilot 4.0 will not go into any of the automaker&#8217;s existing vehicles, but rather will end up in an as yet unannounced vehicle. It&#8217;s likely that this new model will be an SUV, says the spokesperson, but Xpeng hasn&#8217;t released any information about it so far.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of next year, as Xpeng prepares to bring Xpilot 4.0 to market, the automaker aims to have 75 million miles of highway NGP driven and 22 million miles of city NGP driven, as well as a 90% penetration rate of its memory parking function, Valet Parking Assist (VPA). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xpeng also stressed the importance of safety when churning out all of this ADAS, and smart driving is only one aspect of that. The startup announced an upgrade to its user interface and operating system. The Xmart OS 4.0 promises a detailed display complete with a 3D rendering of the environment surrounding the vehicle. The OS will roll out next year in new vehicle models, said Xiaopeng. Xpeng is also rolling out version 2.0 of its voice assistant, which it says can listen, process and execute at the same time, to help make rides smoother for drivers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, just as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/tesla-third-quarter-earnings-safety-score/">Tesla has released a safety score for drivers</a> looking to test its FSD Beta software, and also get heaps of data for its budding insurance line, Xpeng is unleashing a safety test to help drivers understand the boundaries of the Xpilot before activating it. Drivers will receive a smart driving score before they are able to use Xpilot, and if the driver monitoring system finds them to be driving irresponsibly down the line, it will deduct points from their overall score and possibly revoke Xpilot access. </span></p>
<h3><b>Superchargers that give up to 125 miles range in five minutes</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Xpeng wants to create the smart mobility ecosystem of the future, it needs to power it. The startup already has 1,648 free charging stations in its network and 439 branded supercharging stations throughout China, but during its Tech Day, Xpeng revealed plans to produce its next generation “X-Power” superchargers based on a 800V high-voltage mass-production Silicon Carbide charging platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The X-Power chargers will be able to give EVs enough juice to go up to 200 kilometers, or 125 miles, in just five minutes, and an average of 30 vehicles can be charged on one supercharger at a time, says Xpeng. The startup is also planning to roll out lightweight 480 kW high-voltage supercharging piles, which come with Xpeng vehicles so owners can charge their cars, for the first time. In order to support this supercharging network, Xpeng says it will launch power storage facilities in both piles and mobile vehicles. </span></p>
<p>Xpeng did not share when this new charging tech will make it to market.</p>
<h3><b>A flying car that also drives</b></h3>
<p>[gallery ids="2222954,2222955,2222957,2222945"]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the event, Xpeng revealed its new goal to become the world&#8217;s top low-altitude manned flying vehicle manufacturer, in large part fueled by its mission to create its </span>sixth generation flying car. But this is not just any flying car. This one will also be able to drive on the road.</p>
<p>A video presented during the event showed a rendering of a very sexy looking car, even sexier than the <a href="https://en.xiaopeng.com/p7.html">Xpeng P7</a>, that converts from a normal car to a flying car through a foldable rotor mechanism. Xpeng says the low-altitude flying vehicle will be 50% the weight of the P7 and be about 18 feet in length at first with plans to make it shorter eventually. It&#8217;ll have both a steering wheel for road operations as well as a single lever for flight modes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The new flying car will also feature an advanced environmental perception system that can fully evaluate the surrounding environment and weather conditions to conduct safety assessments before take-off, says the company. The system will evaluate the data it picks up against driving objectives to ensure a safe take-off and landing, and during the flight the advanced perception and flight control algorithm will be used to avoid obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xpeng is planning to begin mass production for this contraption, which is being developed by Xpeng affiliate urban air mobility (UAM) company HT Aero, as soon as 2024. The final design, which Xiaopeng said would be more understated than the current renderings, is to be decided sometime next year. The CEO also said Xpeng is aiming for the cost to be lower than $157,000 (RMB 1 million).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Xpeng led HT Aero&#8217;s $500 million Series A raise, and HT Aero has produced other UAM vehicles for Xpeng, most recently the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210923006034/en/XPeng-Backed-HT-Aero-Unveils-Flying-Vehicle-City-Usage-Scenarios">Xpeng X2, which is Xpeng&#8217;s fifth gen flying car that can seat two people</a>. A spokesperson from Xpeng told TechCrunch the sixth gen flying car will be built for similar city use cases, like going from the office to the airport, or other similar trips under 30 minutes of flight time. Xpeng&#8217;s philosophy is to sell direct to consumer, so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how low-altitude air regulations shift to handle a rather fast go-to-market strategy. Xiaopeng said he hopes to work with regulators to get to a place where Xpeng can legally mass-produce flying cars for private use by 2024, but didn&#8217;t go into more detail.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Riding the path to smart mobility on a robotic pony</strong></h3>
<p>Last month, Xpeng teased a pony-style robot that kids could ride and interact with. The quadruped would ideally be so perceptive that it would be able to detect human emotions. During its Tech Day, Xpeng went into further detail about how it foresees smart robots like this pony becoming an intelligent platform for an integrated smart mobility system that can address far more complex autonomy challenges than vehicles.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223022" style="width: 1656px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223022" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2223022 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png" alt="Woman in office loads Xpeng robotic pony with treats to be delivered" width="1646" height="930" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png 1646w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png?resize=1536,868 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1646px) 100vw, 1646px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223022" class="wp-caption-text">Woman in office loads Xpeng robotic pony with treats to be delivered in a video presented during Xpeng&#8217;s 2021 Tech Day.</p></div></p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just for kids. During the presentation, Xpeng played a video demonstrating how the cute robotic pony could be used to deliver snacks and other parcels in an office setting – a nod to the horse&#8217;s historic role in mobility history to transport objects. (In that same video, Xpeng possibly teased another robotic animal that was also hanging out in the fictional office, and this one looked a bit like<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618043/xiaomi-cyberdog-robot-dog-quadruped-specs-price"> Xiaomi&#8217;s creepy robot dog</a>.)</p>
<p>Xiaopeng said Xpeng is leaning towards creating a quadruped like a pony rather than a bipedal robot because four legs are more stable than two. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/top-five-highlights-of-elon-musks-tesla-ai-day/">During Tesla&#8217;s AI Day</a>, the company announced its plans to create a bipedal humanoid robot to handle human tasks like grocery shopping.</p>
<p>The robot will be trained to perceive a diverse environment and multiple targets with 3D route planning, and it&#8217;ll be able to recognize users through facial, body and voiceprint, says Xpeng. It is also experimenting with technologies like dynamic acoustic mapping, bionic hearing, a bionic sense of smell and even a bionic tactile experience through plantar and fingerprint touch and skin sensing. Xpeng&#8217;s robots will have a 360-degree camera module and lidar sensing system, as well as object recognition and sound field sensory technology so that it can get the most precise model of the environment to interact with.</p>
<p>During the event, Xiaopeng mentioned that by next year, two major iterations to the robotic pony would make it look completely different than the renderings Xpeng has displayed today. A spokesperson for Xpeng told TechCrunch that there&#8217;s no timeline on a path to market for the robotic pony, as of yet, but there is a prototype that&#8217;s still in the development stage. Given the immense AI and hardware challenge for Xpeng to create a fully autonomous robot and the price tag associated with that challenge, it&#8217;s safe to assume the company is many years out from commercializing this tech.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the adoption of greater target recognition and precise interaction, 3D route planning that enables more complex terrain mobility and enhanced bionic senses, XPeng will bring greater application scenarios to support wider mobility, greater autonomous planning, and stronger human-machine interaction for the future of smart mobility,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>On Equity this week, we discussed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/nerdwallet-gen-z-and-the-value-of-the-written-word/">the value of the written word.</a> You can imagine that the resulting argument is inherently biased, considering we are three journalists who have bet our livelihoods on ink; but, I promise, there’s more nuance here beyond how important a lede is.</p>
<p>We recently published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1/">a recent deep dive on Automattic</a>, the commercial media company behind the WordPress publishing platform. Founded in 2005, Automattic is one of the few companies that has been able to evolve and expand its way through a graveyard of media sites. Valued at $7.5 billion, it has also convinced investors of the financial promise of its vision.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222699" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Part 1: Origin story “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-origin/">How doing everything wrong turned Automattic into a multibillion dollar media powerhouse</a>” (3,850 words/15 minutes)</li>
<li>Part 2: Open source development “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-developers/">There’s nothing Automattic about balancing commercial growth with an open source developer community</a>” (2,500 words/10 minutes)</li>
<li>Part 3: Acquisitions and future strategy “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-acquisitions/">Can social and e-commerce transform the future of the open web?</a>” (2,350 words/9 minutes)</li>
<li>Part 4: Remote work culture “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-remote/">The future of remote work is text</a>” (2,000 words/8 minutes)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was most struck by how text has shaped Automattic’s hiring process: The company offers a purely written interview, where potential new hires never need to reveal their face or voice to anyone through the recruitment funnel. It takes away the inherent bias that comes with a Zoom interview, which, at its core, is just a digital version of a face-to-face interview. Monica Ohara, chief marketing officer of WordPress.com, explained more about her thinking:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You normally think you’ve got to talk to them; see them on video. With text only, you remove all this bias and focus on the content of what they’re saying, and also test for a style of communication that’s really important in a distributed team.</p>
<p>“In Silicon Valley, everyone is competing for the same people that would add diversity to your pool. Which is great for those people, but what about all the others who don’t have those opportunities because of where they were born or live? For me, I was born in the Philippines and if I hadn’t had the luck to move here, I’d be living a different life.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Rethinking the value of text, the same way we rethink <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/3-views-on-the-future-of-meetings/">how many synchronous meetings</a> should be on our calendar, feels like the natural next step for companies figuring out how to scale distributed work. Even in a world seemingly ruled by short-form video, words — and sound — seem to matter in a way that other formats never will.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about PayPal’s reported new friend, the Chinese venture capital market and not at all about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/facebooks-next-chapter-just-might-make-sense/">Facebook’s impending new rebrand. </a></p>
<h2>PayPal picks Pinterest</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2221010" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221010" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2221010" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pay-pal-pinterest.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pay-pal-pinterest.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pay-pal-pinterest.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pay-pal-pinterest.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pay-pal-pinterest.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pay-pal-pinterest.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pay-pal-pinterest.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221010" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>We rushed to Twitter Spaces this week after rumors came out that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/paypal-said-to-be-exploring-potential-acquisition-of-pinterest/">PayPal may be buying Pinterest for a reported $45 billion.</a> The fintech giant has been on an acquisition spree of sorts, but scooping up a social, photo-sharing platform may signal its hungry to own the content — not just the customer.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>This feels nostalgic. PayPal potentially joining forces with a more content-focused e-commerce business comes more than a half-decade after it divorced from eBay. But, as Finix Chief Growth Officer Jareau Wadé pointed out, Pinterest is not a shopping destination like eBay — it’s a place where shopping begins for nearly 450 million users.</p>
<p>In a Substack post, Wadé makes the following argument to describe why <a href="https://jareau.substack.com/p/why-is-paypal-buying-pinterest?r=iydo&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=">PayPal may buy Pinterest:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>At its core, Pinterest is more like Google than eBay. It’s a search engine that conducts over 5 billion searches per month for fuzzy, hard-to-describe ideas where pictures, rather than words, are often the best place to start. It also has a growing ads business that produced $613 million last quarter, up 125% YoY. With Pinterest, PayPal would be buying the top of the funnel — the awareness and interest stages — for millions of websites on the internet. PayPal would provide Pinterest with the bottom of the funnel, allowing them to see the purchases that result from shopping that began on Pinterest.</p>
<p>Imagine if PayPal could use their core product and the commerce assets they’ve acquired over the past five years to build a deconstructed sales funnel, not just for one website, but for the whole internet.</p></blockquote>

<p>Data from CB Insights shows us that, aside from a single outsized 2018 round, China’s third quarter of 2021 was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/china-venture-capital-q3-2021/">the best three-month period for Chinese startups ever</a> — both in deal value and deal count.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222086" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Google lowers its Play Store commissions. </strong>In a significant move, Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/google-lowers-play-store-fees-to-15-on-subscriptions-apps-as-low-as-10-for-media-apps/">announced</a> it would lower commissions on subscription-based apps to 15% from day one, instead of 30% for the first year, which then drops to 15% in year two and beyond (like Apple offers). It also announced that apps participating in its new <a href="https://play.google.com/console/about/mediaprogram/">Play Media Experience Program</a> could see their commissions adjusted to as low as 10%. This program includes apps where the content costs account for the majority of sales, including video streaming, music and e-books apps. Google also competes in some of these areas with its own services and is under increased threat of regulation globally, as well as engaged in lawsuits over app store fees, including one in the U.S. with Epic Games. The new fees will kick in on January 1, 2022 and follow Google&#8217;s previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">announced</a> reduction of commissions from 30% to 15% on the first $1 million of developer earnings. Google says 99% of developers will qualify for a service fee of 15% or less. Sensor Tower data indicates Google Play saw $38.8 billion in overall consumer spending in 2020, earning it $11.6 billion in in-app purchases.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Apple introduced a new set of App Store Guidelines which include three key changes, including those to anti-steering rules.</strong> One of the changes is the result of a previously announced settlement agreement with a class of U.S. app developers. It clarifies that developers are allowed to communicate with their customers about other payment methods available outside their app. Related to this, another new guideline explains that apps may request customer information like name and email, but the request must be optional for the user and shouldn&#8217;t prevent them from using the app. The third guideline is unrelated to legal action, and simply details how developers can use a new App Store feature, called in-app events, which rolls out next week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Trump announced his <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-launching-social-media-platform-truth-social/story?id=80697031">plans</a> to launch a new social networking app,</strong> which of course he&#8217;s calling Truth Social. The former president was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/twitter-trump-banned-forever/">banned</a> from major social platforms following the January 6 attack on the Capitol, for using his account to incite violence. According to a press release this week, Trump Media and Technology Group will merge with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738240/donald-trump-truth-social-spac-dwac-stock-merger">SPAC</a> called Digital World Acquisition Group to launch Truth. But before you go thinking Trump has built his own Twitter, it turns out the new network is actually just a fork of the open-source Mastodon codebase. Mastodon is released under the AGPLv3 license, which requires the code and its modifications to be made public. Truth has not done so, even though screenshots and investigations <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgm5k/truth-social-is-mastodon-trump">clearly reference</a> Mastodon. Instead, the Truth website falsely claims all its source code is proprietary. This means <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgm5k/truth-social-is-mastodon-trump">Truth is in violation</a> of the Mastodon licensing agreement, and the organization is <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/nice-start-trumps-truth-app-may-violate-terms-of-open-source-code-its-built-on">now seeking legal counsel</a>. Ironically, <em>Truth is starting off with a lie. Who would have guessed it!</em></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Android apps arrive on Windows 11.</strong> Microsoft this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/microsoft-starts-testing-android-apps-on-windows-11/">began testing Android apps on Windows</a>. The company brought around 50 Android apps to the Windows 11 Insider Program, allowing users to try apps including the Amazon Kindle app, The Washington Post app, Clash of Kings, Coin Master and Lego Duplo World, among others. The apps will run on both AMD and Intel devices with the apps running on the Windows Subsystem for Android (powered by Intel Bridge Technology). PCs will need to have virtualization enabled, run Windows 11 and you&#8217;ll need an Amazon account to access the Amazon Appstore. Now that the apps can run, next comes the real question:<em> will anyone care to use them?</em></p>

<li><strong>Google also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/google-introduces-pixel-pass-an-all-in-one-subscription-combining-phones-and-premium-services/">announced</a> Pixel Pass, an all-in-one subscription that combines a brand-new Pixel phone with access to Google&#8217;s premium services.</strong> The service is available at $45 per month for the Pixel 6 and $55 per month for the Pixel 6 Pro and includes YouTube Premium, YouTube Music Premium, 200 GB of cloud storage with Google One, Google Store discounts and a Google Play Pass subscription to free apps and games without ads or in-app purchases.</li>
<li><strong>Among the new features coming to Pixel 6 first is an updated Phone app</strong> that will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/google-makes-calling-businesses-less-painful-with-features-for-seeing-wait-times-phone-tree-options-and-more/">show callers the expected wait times</a> for toll-free numbers, and which will help guide callers through businesses&#8217; phone trees by having Google Assistant listen to the options and display them as text.</li>

<li><strong>Google Play now allows app developers <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/10/launching-data-safety-in-play-console.html">to fill out their &#8220;Data Safety&#8221; info</a> for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNAS_0IcHtM">section</a> that will come to the Play Store in February.</strong> Once live, users will be able to view details about the data collected by the app and how developers will use that data alongside the app&#8217;s listing.</li>

If the other person accepts, both accounts will appear in the post or the Reels header and content will be shared to both sets of followers. It also added new effects called Superbeat and Dynamic Lyrics. The former intelligently applies special effects to music to the beat of the user’s song and the latter displays 3D lyrics.</li>

<h3>Messaging</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Messenger added new AR experiences for group video calls.</strong> Unlike traditional AR effects, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/facebook-messenger-is-adding-new-ar-experiences-for-group-video-calls/">the new &#8220;Group Effects&#8221;</a> apply to everyone in the call at the same time.

Spatial audio was first introduced in 2019, but had not yet been available through mobile on headphones. The feature is offered to Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers only.</li>
<li><strong>Spotify<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/spotify-opens-up-access-to-video-podcast-publishing-to-anchor-creators/"> opened up</a> access to a new tool for creators that will allow them to begin publishing their video podcasts to its service.</strong> The tool will be provided by the company’s podcast creation platform Anchor, and expands on the global launch of video podcasts last year, which encompassed only a select group of creators.

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google&#8217;s Stadia game-streaming service is going white label.</strong> The company had earlier said it would offer its services to partners, and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/20/batman-arkham-knight-white-label-stadia-att/">now AT&amp;T Wireless customers will be able to stream</a> &#8220;Batman: Arkham Knight&#8221; from their browser&#8230;but on their desktop, not phone (oddly). This is the first in-the-wild example of Stadia&#8217;s white-labeling, however. More are likely to come.</li>
<li><strong>App Annie <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/mobile-gaming/app-annie-game-iq-just-got-smarter/">updates</a> its Game IQ market intelligence tool</strong> with enhancements including Feature Tagging, Genre Summary and Tag Trends.</li>

<h3>Government &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Yahoo Finance iOS app <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/21/yahoo-finance-app-pulled-from-chinese-app-store">was removed</a> from China&#8217;s App Store.</strong> Neither Apple nor Yahoo commented on the matter, but it&#8217;s possible the app was pulled because it was being used as a way to read news stories from media outlets that are typically blocked by the Chinese government.</li>
<li><strong>Apple also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/apple-removes-a-popular-quran-app-in-china-after-request-from-local-regulators/">removed</a> a popular Quran app in China after a request from local regulators.</strong> The app allowed users to read the Islamic religious text and other prayer-related information.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok and Snap<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/21/tiktok-snapchat-are-testifying-first-time-their-peers-are-double-digits/"> will testify before Congress</a> for the first time</strong> next week as part of lawmakers&#8217; investigation into how Big Tech platforms are impacting kids&#8217; safety.

</ul>
<h3>Security &amp; Privacy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tencent says it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-22/google-bing-can-now-search-wechat-content-as-tencent-opens-up">fixed a vulnerability</a> that made some WeChat content available to Google and Bing</strong>, both of which are blocked in China. Ahead of the news, there was speculation that Beijing regulators had won a victory in their push to stop tech firms from building walled gardens which blocked rivals from accessing data in each others&#8217; services.</li>
<li><strong>Google&#8217;s Play Protect service is <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-splits-play-protect-into-a-dedicated-app-but-its-not-yet-clear-whats-in-store-for-it-/">split off</a> into its own app with Android 12.</strong> The safety service scans for malware on your device, and could be now easier to update as a standalone application.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Team! Happy Saturday. It’s Friday afternoon as I write this to you, so I hope you are not at your desk. We’re having fun today, so please read this from the couch.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7040-a-good-friend-will-always-stab-you-in-the-front">well-known Wildeism</a> goes that friends stab you in the front, which is true enough to make the quip worth remembering. It came to mind over the last week or two as I pondered the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-its-own-nft-platform-to-take-on-opensea/">decision by Coinbase to get into the NFT game</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222691" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A few facts will help detail why the Wilde reference fits the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>a16z co-founder ​​Marc Andreessen sits on <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/governance/board-of-directors/default.aspx">the board of Coinbase</a>, a company that his firm backed before it went public.</li>
<li>a16z <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/03/18/investing-in-opensea/"><em>led</em> OpenSea’s Series A</a>, a $23 million transaction that gave the NFT marketplace quite a lot of cash and cachet.</li>
<li>Coinbase Ventures <a href="https://ventures.coinbase.com/">also invested in OpeanSea</a>, one of a great many investments that the corporate venture capital firm has made.</li>
<li>And then Coinbase announced that it was getting into NFTs, driving a huge number of signups for its waitlist.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a href="https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces">crypto-watching group DappRadar</a>, OpenSea is the biggest NFT marketplace today. Coinbase may swamp it if the users that have signaled interest in its competing solution wind up actually buying and selling NFTs on the well-known crypto-investing platform.</p>
<p>Which would put OpenSea in something of a pickle.</p>
<p>It’s fine for VCs to stay on corporate boards after they go public if they so choose and their portfolio companies retain them. Some VCs make a habit out of public board membership. Marc Andreessen is on Facebook’s board, for example, which <a href="https://investor.fb.com/leadership-and-governance/default.aspx">notes in its blurb on the man</a> that he previously held board seats at eBay and HP. Cool.</p>
<p>But it gets a little sticky when the investor in question stays on the board of a portfolio company after it goes public and decides to directly take on portcos of that same investor’s firm. Where that investor still works. If I was OpenSea and saw Marc on the Coinbase board at the same time as his venture firm was on my cap table, while Coinbase decided to attack my market, I’d be pissed.</p>
<p>Friends stab you in the front?</p>
<p>Also recall that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/facebook-scales-back-its-crypto-ambitions-once-again/">Facebook’s latest crypto push</a> is in partnership with, you guessed it, Coinbase!</p>
<p>There have been other ironies lately involving Facebook board members. For example, Peter Thiel is <a href="https://investor.fb.com/leadership-and-governance/default.aspx">on Facebook’s board</a>. And he’s <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/billionaire-peter-thiel-donates-dollar10-million-to-hillbilly-elegy-author-jd-vances-potential-senate-run/ar-BB1eBZLJ">backing J.D. Vance, an aspiring politician</a>. Notably, J.D. Vance <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/21/j-d-vance-blake-masters-we-must-stop-facebook-election-meddling/">is attacking Facebook while running for office</a>. While the OpenSea saga is a bit irksome to watch as big companies working to sink smaller concerns is not really my favorite thing, watching Facebook money circulate back to biting Facebook in the ass <em>is</em> hilarious because no small fries were harmed in the process.</p>
<p>Still, though, you have to wonder if we shouldn’t spread the board seats around a little bit. Else a16z is going to keep finding itself working to undercut the very founders it backs.</p>
<h2>Volvo and other IPOs</h2>
<p>I meant to find time this week to dig into the Volvo offering, but failed. You can take a look at the <a href="https://investors.volvocars.com/~/media/Files/V/Volvo-Cars-IR/documents/prospectus-summary-volvo-car-ab-publ-18-october-2021.pdf">company’s notes on itself here</a>. Recall that Volvo has split from Polestar, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/26/swedish-ev-maker-polestar-reportedly-preparing-to-go-spac-at-21b-valuation/">going public via a SPAC</a>.</p>
<p>And as this week came to a close, Braze filed to go public. More on that company and its S-1 first thing on Monday.</p>
<p>More to come, including a look into the high-stakes startup race to build the best corporate gifting platform (no joke),</p>

		Anamarie Huerta Franc is managing director of <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company/innovation/labs.html">SAP Labs</a> in the U.S., responsible for leading cross-company collaboration, location strategy, communications and employee engagement for development employees across the country.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Why do we go to the office?</p>
<p>This is not a rhetorical question. Do we go to be around other people and work collaboratively? Do we go because it’s a dedicated location that allows us to focus on our work in a unique way? Do we go because we believe it’s necessary to be “seen”? Do we go because we’re just <em>supposed to</em>, because it’s what we’ve always done?</p>
<p>At SAP, it’s important not only that we find answers to these questions, but that our employees play a role in answering them — and in building the hybrid workplace of the future.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222017" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Just this summer, we rolled out a brand-new, hybrid work pilot program at our offices in Palo Alto. For months, we’ve been testing different floor plans and setups, a variety of work schedules, the most productive uses of space and the ideal structure and composition of meetings. We’ve also been providing manager and leadership training, enablement and more that’s suited for this new world.</p>
<p>So, what have we learned? And how can you apply some of the lessons to your business?</p>
<h2>Getting to work: What our employees had to say</h2>
<p>Early employee feedback — from before and during the early stages of the pilot program — showed that demand existed for a high-utilization, high-energy workspace. We just had to find a way to build it so that people could use it not just when they needed to, but when they wanted to. So, what factors would make people want to come into the office?</p>
<p>Our research found four main factors:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Peer-to-peer learning<em> — </em></strong>Our employees are passionate about building out their network, and many cited peer-to-peer learning as an opportunity to quickly advance their careers and learn how SAP builds and innovates on its products.</p>
<p>While the majority of our onboarding, training and learning opportunities are still held virtually, we are now exploring hybrid options to give employees the opportunity to meet with each other in-person if they prefer.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration<em> — </em></strong>If COVID permits, many people crave in-person interaction, according to our research. Video calls may be functional, but nothing matches the ability to sit across the table and brainstorm, learn and grow together.</p>
<p>Collaboration has been a major driving force for the employees participating in the hybrid work pilot program. We see a wide variety of our employees whiteboarding and sharing screens to solve complex problems together. The key is ensuring that they’re in a space equipped with high-quality video and audio equipment so that team members who are physically present and remote can be equally engaged.</p>
<p><strong>Community building<em> — </em></strong>All-hands meetings, Q&amp;A sessions and other team-building events just hit differently when you’re all in the same physical space. Many employees we surveyed mentioned semiregular get-togethers as clear benefits of being in the office.</p>
<p>We’ve only just started experimenting with hosting employee events in our physical offices again, and they look much different than they did before — smaller, outdoors and with COVID precautions in place. Before our first event, we asked ourselves: Will employees want to come? The answer was, overwhelmingly, yes.</p>
<p>We opened a sign-up for an employee meeting and within minutes, registration was full, with double the amount on a waiting list. The energy the day of the meeting was palpable, and the feedback from employees was very positive — they were thrilled to be together again.</p>
<p><strong>Intention<em> — </em></strong>Many people told us that they simply miss their office routine. For some, having the ability to get dressed in the morning, drive to work and sit at a desk with team members offers an unmatched productivity and focus boost.</p>
<p>Not all employees come to the office for teamwork and community. Some simply prefer to separate their personal and professional spaces and are looking for individual quiet areas where they find themselves most productive. Open collaboration spaces are essential in the office, but so too are quiet zones and phone booths.</p>
<p>One way we’ve tried to put these attributes into action is via scrum neighborhoods in our physical offices. The environments are designed with 15 to 20 available desks, set in beautiful and creatively liberating office spaces built to empower collaboration and teamwork. We’ve even built a mobile app to help achieve high utilization of the space. Teams can use the app to coordinate when they come to the office together, and book spaces and phone rooms.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, we’ve worked with our leaders to better enable them to manage in our new reality, avoiding bias and molding the traditional manager-employee relationship into a more human and empathetic one.</p>
<h2>Early lessons from the pilot program</h2>
<p>This is only the beginning. Though the pilot program itself is well underway, we will not stop studying and testing the best ways to promote and optimize hybrid work for our employees going into the future.</p>
<p>We found that 80% of our employees want a mix of home and office work in the future. We also discovered that 80% intend to live in relatively close proximity to an office.</p>
<p>Still, many are uncomfortable returning at this particular moment. For those who have come into the office during the pilot program, though, many have specifically cited the peace and tranquility of an office working environment, the productivity of in-person meetings and amenities (like free coffee, snacks and lunch) as notable benefits. In addition, our leaders and managers feel better prepared to lead and manage in this environment, based on the communities of practice we have fostered with them.</p>
<p>With “normal” likely never to fully return, we must remain committed to continuous experimentation and introspection to determine what works and what doesn’t. Because the hybrid work model can’t just be successful in theory; it has to be successful in practice.</p>
<p>For instance, we’ve realized that many employees grew accustomed to being able to dramatically shift their working hours in the last year — whether working early in the morning or late at night to accommodate home and family life — and that eliminating a commute and an office has been a great adjustment for some on our team. Conversely, there are some previously in-person initiatives that still need to be rethought in order to improve overall execution and reach — and to make the employee experience more inclusive, regardless of location.</p>
<p>The questions we must ask ourselves are clear. Now, we just have to find our way to the answers.</p>
<h2>What’s next? Using the &#8220;why&#8221; to find the &#8220;how&#8221;</h2>
<p>At the same time, 2020 managed to hit pause and fast-forward on our work realities, a contradiction many of us are still learning to manage and operate within. We hope the lessons of our hybrid work pilot program can help inform the future of the office and productivity in this context, along with enabling our employees and leaders to navigate these changes. Moving into 2022, our pilot program findings will help inform our global flex work policies, giving regions around the world a baseline to determine what works best for them.</p>
<p>There is no better time to think through the answers than right now. So join us. Turn your “why” into a “how” and empower your employees to build the workplace of the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As wave after wave of regulatory crackdowns have dominated China tech news in 2021, one can be excused for losing track of what is being regulated, who is doing the regulating, and what exactly the regulations are. From <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/strategist-on-chinas-regulation-of-its-tech-giants-fintech.html">fintech</a> to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-coming-data-laws-leave-firms-with-more-questions-than-answers-2021-08-27/">data management</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/the-casualties-of-chinas-education-crackdown/">education</a>, the rules of the game are being re-written by a range of agencies, often at a rate faster than all but the keenest observers can follow.</p>
<p>For antitrust, a newly-empowered bureaucratic entity appears to be sending the signal that we are only at the beginning of a large-scale reorganization of how Chinese internet firms interact with consumers, vendors, and the state. Formed only three years ago as a merger of already-existing agencies, the State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) has quickly become a force to be reckoned with, reshaping how companies view risk and opportunity in the market with the world’s most internet users.</p>
<p>Having already levied hefty <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/11/china-tech-stocks-rise-after-meituan-hit-with-antitrust-fine.html%23:~:text=The%252520fine%252520equated%252520to%2525203,of%252520an%252520anti%25252Dmonopoly%252520investigation.">fines</a> on the likes of Alibaba and Meituan, recent developments suggest that SAMR is only getting started. On October 13, <i>Reuters</i> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-china-readies-plan-elevate-status-antitrust-unit-sources-2021-10-13/">reported</a> that China is considering upgrading the antitrust bureau within SAMR to deputy-ministerial status, under the name of the National Antimonopoly Bureau.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222826" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The elevated ranking would reportedly help antitrust investigators gain resources when examining mergers and acquisitions and would also help to strengthen SAMR&#8217;s in-house capability to conduct research that it has previously had to outsource. This would be aligned with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-chinas-antitrust-regulator-bulking-up-crackdown-behemoths-widens-2021-04-11/">previous reporting</a> that the agency had been planning to considerably expand its workforce.</p>
<p>That portends further choppy waters for China’s tech giants and others competing for market share. It’s also rapidly changing the investor calculus of how to value some of the fastest-growing companies in the world.</p>
<h2>Trusts and the antitrust blowback</h2>
<p>This sort of regulatory blowback is hardly unprecedented. Known for its opulence and extreme inequality, the “Gilded Age” of the decades that followed the American Civil War saw the rise of the U.S. as an industrial and economic superpower. The period was marked by a weak central government and the rise of the country’s hyper-wealthy corporate interests and industrialists with names like Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Morgan, whose monopolies dominated economics, politics, and society.</p>
<p>While a time of great innovation and dynamism, its excesses also brought about the corrective measures of Theodore Roosevelt’s Progressive Era at the turn of the century, in which regulatory measures were taken to conserve natural resources, protect consumers and break up corporate monopolies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As several <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/chinas-gilded-age-paradox-economic-boom-and-vast-corruption">observers</a> have noted, present-day China has more than a few parallels with America as it transitioned from the Gilded to the Progressive Era: with a country stricken by social inequality, environmental degradation and behemoth corporate interests, Xi Jinping has consolidated control over the reins of the state and is attempting to curb the excesses that have resulted from decades of transformative growth.</p>
<p>Like Roosevelt, Xi appears to view his country’s most valuable corporations as oversized giants whose dominance threatens the long-term health of its economy and society. Yet while Roosevelt busted oil and railroad monopolies, Xi seems to have his sights set squarely on China’s world-leading internet companies.</p>
<h2>Redefining “monopoly” for the platform economy</h2>
<p>As China’s leaders seek to turn the page on the country’s Gilded Age through digital-era trust-busting, it is also looking to re-examine how monopolies are defined. For China and the rest of the world alike, this means crafting regulations that address the unique characteristics of market power in the digital economy. “As many of the large internet platforms are two-sided marketplaces, regulation needs to consider both consumer and merchant protections,” explains Michael Norris, a Shanghai-based analyst for market research firm AgencyChina. “Effective regulation needs to walk a tightrope between consumer protections, merchant interests, and platform economics.”</p>
<p>This stands in contrast to the longstanding established norm in the U.S. of the <a href="https://laweconcenter.org/resource/tldr-consumer-welfare-standard/">Consumer Welfare Standard</a>, which directs courts and regulators to focus on the effects that challenged business practices have on consumers, rather than on alleged harms to specific competitors. For a digital economy in which the largest players such as Alibaba or Amazon function largely as intermediaries between vendors and consumers, and which use their massive scale to outmatch their competition, increasing numbers of policymakers have argued that the Consumer Welfare Standard is insufficiently comprehensive.</p>
<p>SAMR appears to be taking that position as well, given the targets of its investigations and the penalties it has levied thus far. <a href="https://qz.com/1994879/what-is-erxuanyi-which-led-to-alibabas-2-8-billion-fine/">Alibaba</a> and <a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202110/t20211008_335364.html">Meituan</a> have each been slapped with fines of 3-4 percent of annual revenue for their longstanding “choose one from two (er xuan yi 二选一)” practices, in which merchants were pressured to use the platform exclusively. While this practice was at times explicit, it often was exercised through more subtle or deceptive means, exploiting the data and recommendation algorithms that play such a prominent role in determining a merchant’s success. Some such tactics were listed in the recent SAMR announcement as it concluded its Meituan investigation.</p>
<p>Along such lines of forced exclusivity, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has also directed internet firms to tear down their “<a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008506/chinese-tech-companies-vow-to-tear-down-their-walled-garden-">walled gardens</a>,” and cease their formerly common practice of blocking competitors’ links on their platforms. Though adding complications for some firms, the banning of such behavior seems to be welcomed among Chinese consumers, as the inability to share Alibaba’s links on Tencent’s WeChat platform was a common annoyance.</p>
<p>SAMR has also ordered Tencent Music Entertainment to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-regulator-bars-tencent-exclusive-rights-online-music-2021-07-24/">cease</a> its exclusive deals with record labels, levying a minor fine of 500,000RMB (roughly $77,000), but also calling into question the business models of other content platforms whose business models rely heavily on exclusive deals with sought-after content producers.</p>
<h2>A challenging time for investors</h2>
<p>For investment firms, a greater concern may be in the heightened scrutiny over mergers and acquisitions. In July, a $5.3 billion merger between China’s leading game-streaming platforms Huya and Douyu was <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3141283/beijings-decision-block-tencents-douyu-huya-merger-deal-marks-end">terminated</a> two days after a SAMR decision to prohibit it, the first “adverse” merger control decision adopted by SAMR and its predecessor against a transaction without foreign participation.</p>
<p>Indeed, China’s antitrust push, coupled with its broader wave of regulations, have investors rethinking their strategy in the country. One anonymous employee of a prominent VC firm complained of greatly increased complications in gaining approval for a recent merger proposal, citing a far more invasive screening from SAMR than was previously expected, with questions ranging from business models and practices to issues of national security. In the end, the firm decided not to move forward with the deal.</p>
<p>Questions also loom large for the superstar firms that once headlined equity investors’ China portfolios. For many large, platform-based firms, consistent profitability has remained elusive. The prospect of continued growth and the profits that can be extracted from future market dominance was central to their once-soaring share prices and valuations. The e-commerce and food delivery fields in which Alibaba and Meituan operate, for example, are famously high volume/low margin areas. The fines, which amounted to 3-4% of top-line sales volume, do serious damage to already thin bottom lines.</p>
<p>Perhaps most worrisome to investors are the limited windows when they can achieve exits for their China-based investments. In addition to increased deal scrutiny that make mergers and acquisitions more difficult, regulatory roadblocks to IPOs are popping up where they have not been seen before. Though the dramatic eleventh-hour halting of Ant Group’s late-2020 listing sent shockwaves through the financial community, it was also seen as an anomaly: had it gone through, it would have been the biggest public offering in history. The intervention to block it was also conducted by China’s powerful central bank, and reportedly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-president-xi-jinping-halted-jack-ma-ant-ipo-11605203556">ordered</a> by Xi Jinping himself.</p>
<p>What we are now seeing is a growing number of regulatory agencies further down the bureaucratic hierarchy who have both the power and the mandate to interfere with IPOs if they deem it necessary.</p>
<p>There is, of course, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), China’s counterpart to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has announced a new cross-agency <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/china-market-regulations/china-forms-cross-agency-team-to-crack-down-on-securities-misbehaviour-idUSKBN2GC12C">task force</a> to crack down on illegal activities in the country’s capital markets as a number of the regulator’s former leaders are charged with <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2021-10-06/another-former-china-securities-official-under-investigation-101783541.html">corruption</a>.</p>
<p>After ride-hailing platform Didi Chuxing <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-regulators-suggested-didi-delay-its-u-s-ipo-11625510600">ignored</a> warnings not to go through with their U.S. offering until after conducting a thorough examination of its network security, the Cyberspace Administration of China (the country’s chief cybersecurity watchdog) appears to be dedicated to making an example out of the company, removing it from app stores and placing the future of both the firm and its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-didi-co-founder-liu-told-associates-she-plans-leave-sources-2021-09-20/">leaders</a> in question.</p>
<p>Finally, as SAMR is given elevated status, it is highly likely that it will also have the power to determine if and how a company is allowed to go public.</p>
<p>For investors hoping for IPOs, the road to their exit is lined with a growing number of checkpoints whose standards seem to be getting progressively tighter.</p>
<h2>How far will China’s antitrust mandate go?</h2>
<p>With an elevated regulator coupled to a sweeping mandate, China’s antitrust campaign can now potentially reach areas where very little precedent has been set. Compounded with the authoritarian nature of China’s political system, there is very little that firms can do to fight back. In many cases, the best they can try for is to comply, and maintain a positive working relationship with authorities, as the alternative is far worse.</p>
<p>“Chinese authorities are very adept at using reputational sanctions,” explained University of Hong Kong law professor Angela Huyue Zhang while appearing on <a href="https://technode.com/2021/03/19/china-tech-investor-chinese-antritrust-exceptionalism-with-angela-huyue-zhang/">my podcast</a> to discuss her book <i>Chinese Antitrust Exceptionalism</i>. “They are very adept at leaking information to (state media) and there are different ways that they can announce an investigation, leading to different levels of media publicity.” Zhang went on to cite Alibaba’s $90 billion drop in market capitalization after the mere announcement of an antitrust investigation on Christmas Eve of 2020. As Didi is also now experiencing, the reputational taint of being outside of Beijing’s good graces can be as damaging as any formal punishment.</p>
<p>With investigations into Alibaba and Meituan now concluded, it may be the case that the scrutiny into “choose one from two” practices are wrapping up. However, fear and speculation outweighs the certainty at the moment, as a newly-empowered and staffed-up SAMR likely has plenty on its to-do list.</p>
<p>One popular theory is that the beefed-up SAMR will spend more of its muscle targeting subsidized group-buying practices that helped propel the rise of social e-commerce firms like Pinduoduo, but which also can place strong downward pressure on prices, hurting small vendors. In March, SAMR <a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202103/t20210303_326448.html">slapped</a> minor fines on five firms for illegal behavior around group-buying practices. As such practices have been known to be quite common among China’s internet platforms, there could be considerably more to be found if regulators continue to dig, as well as harsher penalties, perhaps, to follow.</p>
<p>“Previous SAMR-issued fines and commentary show they take a harsh view of subsidies used to sell goods and services below cost,” says Norris. “A stronger penalty regime is what SAMR needs if it&#8217;s to create an effective deterrent to subsidy-driven growth.”</p>
<p>What is also worth noting is the extraterritorial nature with which antitrust can be used, particularly as a countermeasure to U.S. sanctions. “In 2018, there was an onslaught of sanctions on Huawei and ZTE and other Chinese tech companies, and this was really a wakeup call for the Chinese government, which realized that the U.S. has such strong extraterritorial sanctioning power,” said Zhang. “One of the tools that [the Chinese government] came up with was antitrust, as it allows them to exert extraterritorial jurisdiction over foreign business.”</p>
<p>This came into play significantly in mid-2018, when Qualcomm <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nxp-semicondtrs-m-a-qualcomm/qualcomm-ends-44-billion-nxp-bid-after-failing-to-win-china-approval-idUSKBN1KF193">abandoned</a> a proposed $44 billion acquisition of Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors after struggling to get SAMR approval for the deal. Though U.S.-China relations appear to be somewhat brought back from the brink of the Trump years, it is clear that China considers extraterritorial antitrust measures to be an arrow in its quiver.</p>
<p>What we do know is that for both foreign and domestic firms alike, the free-wheeling days of China’s Gilded Age are quickly becoming a thing of the past, and that antitrust is a powerful tool in forcing that transition to happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Technology has never agreed with boundaries. Even the most detailed satellite snapshots of Earth show no borders. From the printing press to the airplane, the telephone to social media, technological progress has helped us transcend time and place. And when it hasn’t sent memes around the world, it has ignited revolutions.</p>
<p>We’ve grown used to technology’s subversive ability, but that is not the way it has always been. Far from overcoming borders, technology has more often than not been used to change them. From ancient Rome and China to the British Empire to the United States, the story of world history can be told as one in which those who harness technology prevail.</p>
<p>Until about thirty years ago.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222809" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, technological progress has been largely set apart from politics. Consumer demand, not affairs of state, drove society forward.</p>
<p>This benign neglect brought us tremendous benefits: smartphones, electric cars – the World Wide Web! Can we imagine making it through the last 18 months without Zoom, TikTok, or Amazon Prime? But the tone has shifted as of late. For the first time in living memory, politics is perhaps the most important factor in the future of tech.</p>
<p>That’s why today we’re launching the <strong>TechCrunch Global Affairs Project</strong>.</p>
<p>After several decades of near impunity, the world’s tech titans are facing a rapidly changing political environment. European regulators hound tech multinationals on tax, privacy and monopoly abuses. Chinese authorities are clipping the wings of the country&#8217;s most powerful companies while restricting their foreign competitors. And in a politically divided America, an energized antitrust drive is one of the few policy areas that has momentum – and bipartisan consensus.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This scrutiny comes as tech companies increasingly act more like nation-states than corporations. Facebook now has a judicial branch; tech tycoons have reached orbit, going where only governments have gone before; and cryptocurrencies pose the greatest threat to the monetary power of governments since the invention of money.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, governments are making supple use of technology for their own ends. Instead of giving aid and comfort to dissidents, tech is now being wielded to repress them. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/toolkit-nso-pegasus-iphone-android/">recent controversy over Israeli firm NSO Group</a> is only the latest example of dictators deploying sophisticated tools like ransomware to monitor their political opponents (or worse).</p>
<p>Tech might be a tactical tool, but it has become a strategic objective. Not since the U.S.-Soviet arms and space races has technology had such geopolitical salience. Huawei is only the most prominent example of tech competition as a proxy for geopolitics. From Taiwan to Sweden, Brussels to Beijing, tech policy and foreign policy are increasingly one and the same.</p>
<p>The truth is that from now on, the fate of states will depend more than ever on the technologies they hold. And the fate of technology companies more often than not will be intertwined with the states they reside in. Who controls the most advanced technology, experts say, will determine the world order<a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/geopolitics/2021/09/the-nuclear-tinderbox-why-the-indo-pacific-is-the-new-arena-of-great-power-rivalry"> of the 21st century.</a> And after a multi-decade free-for-all, the time for choosing sides has arrived for many.</p>
<hr />
<p>So before we go any further, let me introduce myself. I’m a California native, a writer and policy wonk by background, who has lived in New York and spent time in Washington, London, and Paris. I’ve been a speechwriter, worked at a major foundation, consulted for political campaigns, and co-authored a best-selling book. While my focus is foreign policy and national security, I’ve also worked on a wide range of issues; at TechCrunch, I’ve written about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/lets-give-tech-philanthropists-the-benefit-of-the-doubt-on-covid-19/">philanthropy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/startups-are-transforming-global-trade-in-the-covid-19-era/">trade</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/28/how-huawei-is-dividing-western-nations/">5G</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/is-washington-prepared-for-a-geopolitical-tech-race/">US-China relations</a>.</p>
<p>While I will occasionally contribute to this series, my primary role will be as curator and editor. We’ve invited some of the world’s leading experts and practitioners to share their thoughts on how technology is impacting their field. From cyber to drones, AI to the future of democracy itself, our contributors will take you through the latest developments in their field and explain how tech is helping them chart a course for the future. They’ll connect the dots, so to speak, between bits and bombs, code and COVID, networks and nations.</p>

<p>There are some elephants in the room. Competition with China looms large, but so does cooperation with allies. With COP26 coming up in a bit more than a week, climate change – and the tech sector’s ability to make an impact – is vital. And understanding how technology’s power to bolster or undermine civic discourse is essential if we are to preserve democracy and protect human rights.</p>
<p>This week, we’re starting with pieces on several topics not always considered in connection with technology. Matt Rogers, co-founder of Nest, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/heres-how-startups-can-help-solve-climate-change/">writes about the role of startups in tackling climate change</a>. Phil Levy, chief economist at Flexport, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/decoupling-tech-supply-chains-would-do-more-harm-than-good/">discusses what &#8216;decoupling&#8217; from China would mean for tech supply chains</a>. And Robert Karanja of Omidyar Network <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/digital-id-tech-is-moving-fast-goodid-will-ensure-it-doesnt-break-things/">explores the perils of digital ID</a> – and how it can be implemented securely and fairly.</p>
<p>This series is an experiment, and like the best software, we aim to iterate. Please share your thoughts with us and send us your ideas. Our goal in the weeks ahead is to elucidate, inform, and hopefully provoke a little bit too. I hope you’ll join us.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The best way to drive lasting change is to create opportunities where the right thing to do is also the easy thing to do. The upcoming COP26 climate conference has the unique opportunity to incentivize new talent to innovate and deploy the widest variety of solutions possible to make this happen.</p>
<p>When it comes down to a split-second decision or a force of habit, the average consumer will always choose the more convenient path, even if that path is the &#8220;wrong thing to do.&#8221; Technology, coupled with deep empathy for the user experience, has the opportunity to meet consumers where they are – to offer solutions that not only meet the bare minimum of conveniently solving a problem, but also do so in a way that is better for more people.</p>
<p>All too often, I see companies – tech and otherwise – lose sight of this principle.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222802" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Let’s take a long-institutionalized example: recycling. Everyone knows that recycling is key to reducing waste and, in turn, mitigating climate change. We simply cannot keep making waste at the same rate that we are currently. Recycling is an attempt to alleviate the waste burden on the planet. The concept of recycling is simple: reuse old things in new ways. However, when the average consumer is faced with a split second decision between the blue bin or black bin, it’s much easier to toss an item into the black bin rather than take the necessary step(s) to investigate the exact recyclability of that item.</p>
<p>On the other hand, at Nest, we knew that average households wasted a huge chunk of energy when the thermostats were left set at the same temperature all day. We also knew that the last thing busy people (and everyone is a busy person) needs is to remember to set or reset their thermostat based on weather patterns, time of day or energy consumption spikes.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to tell someone to turn their thermostat off, because it’s good for the planet. It’s another thing to simply turn off their thermostat for them, automagically. When we added automation, energy usage data, app controls and a design that makes temperature regulation feel cutting edge, we had a product that we knew would drive lasting change. On average, the Nest Learning Thermostat saved 10-12% energy on heating and 15% energy on cooling per household (more stats <a href="https://nest.com/thermostats/real-savings/">here</a>).</p>
<p>At Nest, we made energy saving in the home the cool thing to do, sure. But that’s not all. We educated our customers to see their personal cost benefit as well as the planet’s. Nest made it easier and more convenient for the average consumer to do the right thing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But let’s zoom out from Nest.</p>
<p>This is a pivotal moment for technology to solve big problems. The biggest and most time-crucial of these problems being climate change. We have the opportunity to use the advancements we’ve achieved over the last few decades to make it easier for everyone — yes, everyone — to get involved with saving the planet. We need to create, fund, and champion technology that actually does good in tandem with doing well.</p>
<p>As an investor, I see tech companies either embracing or ignoring this principle every day. A few years ago, I met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arch-rao">Arch Rao</a>, founder of <a href="https://www.span.io/">Span</a>, and was immediately struck with how his idea makes a cumbersome task easier and, in so doing, causes positive change. Today, it’s really hard to electrify your home. Sure, you could install a solar panel or a battery in your basement, but it’s challenging for home owners to know if these instruments are actually helping them to save energy. Span is an electric panel that lets the homeowner control every circuit in the home right remotely through a phone app. Span introduced user-centered design to an unsexy category: home electricity.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This begs the question: if we can apply human-centered design, technology, great UX and end-to-end product thinking to more areas (no matter how “boring”), what kind of solutions can we build? What kind of big problems could we solve?</p>
<p>We’ve made great progress in moving towards solar and renewables, but it’s not enough. We must plan and dedicate resources towards solutions across all industries. This call to action may start at tech, but it needs support from investors, non-profit advocacy groups, and policymakers. And we need the leaders gathered in Glasgow later this month to set out a roadmap of incentives. There are no silver bullets to climate change and there is no one person, idea or company that will solve it. It takes all of us, it takes all our ideas.</p>
<p>Simply put: people are motivated to do the right thing, but only so far as it is more convenient. As we build, let us embrace human nature as our challenge. Technology that stands the test of convenience will ultimately stand the test of time to drive lasting change. How can we make doing the right thing easier than doing the wrong thing? Figure that out, teach others how to do the same, and we will put ourselves a position to save the world.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">For a technology sector that would much prefer to focus on growth over geopolitics, the push for U.S.-China “decoupling” poses an inescapable threat. The fuzziness of the concept only increases the danger.</p>
<p>U.S. distrust of China, particularly in technology, is nothing new. Indeed, Congress took action to keep Huawei and ZTE out of U.S. telecommunications almost a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huawei-zte/u-s-lawmakers-seek-to-block-china-huawei-zte-u-s-inroads-idUSBRE8960NH20121008">decade</a> ago, during the Obama administration.</p>
<p>But during the administrations of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, there was a broad push to engage in dialogue and find common ground between the world’s two biggest economies. As China emerged as a leading global economy and became an increasingly important trading partner to the U.S., (<a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/index.html">accounting</a> for 2.5% of U.S. imports in 1989 and rising to a peak of 21.6% in 2017), there were moves to incorporate it into the U.S.-led global trading system. In 2005, Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick put forward the idea of China as a &#8220;<a href="https://www.ncuscr.org/sites/default/files/migration/Zoellick_remarks_notes06_winter_spring.pdf">Responsible Stakeholder,</a>” under the assumption that embracing China’s entry into the global trading system would ensure that it helped that system continue to function.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222822" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Not long before that, the U.S. had agreed to China’s <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-04-02/was-letting-china-wto-mistake">2001 accession</a> to the World Trade Organization. But while it was seen by many as a turning point, it was really just a waypoint. That year, China’s share of U.S. imports was already 9.0%. Growth in Chinese imports, moreover, reflected a rebalancing of Asian trade more than anything else; from 1989 to 2017, Asia’s share (including China) of U.S. imports grew from 42.3% to just 45.2%. China’s relative growth instead ate into the share of countries like Japan and Malaysia, reflecting a reordering within Asia. The standard system of trade accounting overplayed this shift, as a good that was finished in China and had 10% Chinese value added would count as 100% Chinese for trade statistics.</p>
<p>Regardless of what was labeled as produced where, the bottom line was that a well-developed Asian supply chain incorporated China as a major player. With increased engagement, however, and very different economic systems, the points of economic disagreement between China and the United States accumulated. During the Trump administration, dialogue took a back seat to new <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-investment-policy-watch/trump-trade-war-china-date-guide">trade barriers</a>. The United States applied tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese imports and China responded with barriers of its own. Although the Trump tariffs were initially cast as temporary measures meant to achieve finite policy objectives, some key policymakers within the Trump administration saw value in diminished interaction between the two countries.</p>
<p>Matthew Pottinger, who served as Deputy National Security Adviser under President Trump, subsequently <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2021-08-23/beijings-american-hustle">wrote</a> that “important U.S. institutions, especially in finance and technology, cling to self-destructive habits acquired through decades of ‘engagement,’ an approach to China that led Washington to prioritize economic cooperation and trade above all else.” His solution calls for bold steps “to frustrate Beijing’s aspiration for leadership in … high-tech industries.” The Biden administration recently <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/04/china-tariffs-biden-trade-514996">announced</a>, after a prolonged review, that it was maintaining the Trump tariffs and Congress has pushed to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/08/senate-passes-bipartisan-tech-and-manufacturing-bill-aimed-at-china.html">fund initiatives</a> that would subsidize technological independence. These moves for lessening dependence, particularly in technology, have fallen under the broader rubric of “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5ca525f7-cb40-468a-a294-5938d11af6a5">decoupling</a>.”</p>
<p>Amidst all the newfound enthusiasm for U.S. decoupling from China, one might imagine that the term is well-defined. Yet it takes relatively little probing to discover a lack of clarity. Of course, the above-mentioned tariffs have served to discourage trade between the two countries, but how far is this policy meant to go?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Does decoupling mean the U.S. will turn away from inbound and outbound <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3149563/us-china-technology-fdi-crashes-decoupling-not-imminent">foreign direct investment</a>? What about portfolio investment, such as the purchase of U.S. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/china-s-holdings-of-u-s-treasuries-hit-highest-since-july-2019%3Fsref=ZdtLveG1">Treasuries</a>? Does it mean that the U.S. should avoid importing final goods produced by Chinese firms? What about European firms producing in China? What about U.S. firms producing in China? Or European or U.S. firms producing outside China but incorporating Chinese parts? Or companies selling into the Chinese market and thus, presumably, subject to Chinese influence?</p>
<p>The sheer breadth of economic interactions between the two giant economies illustrates the implausibility of a clean divide between them. Instead, the most likely result of an attempt at exclusion would be another reordering, not China’s disappearance as a supply chain power. This is particularly true when other global economic powers, such as the European Union, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3146920/biden-cant-assume-europe-fully-board-us-china-policy">do not share</a> even the vague objective of decoupling.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The nebulous nature of the decoupling push poses a particular threat to the tech sector. Over decades, the push to take advantage of scale economies and to drive down production costs has resulted in highly-integrated global tech production. Further, in subsectors that have recently emerged as particularly contentious, such as the production of <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-illusion-of-decoupling-the-semiconductor-industry-latest-us-restrictions-on-china-short-sighted/">semiconductors</a>, investments have to be made at large scale and well in advance. That leaves the sector especially vulnerable to rapidly-shifting rule changes, as policymakers struggle to give substance to a problematic concept at a time of difficult supply chain disruptions. Policy responses that shower the sector with subsidies, as some bills in Congress have <a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/chips/">proposed</a>, seem appealing, but lose their effectiveness when countries such as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f59173b6-211c-4446-aa57-5c9b78d602c2">Japan</a> move to match them.</p>
<p>A world in which the United States provides an extreme answer to the above questions and is absolutist in its separation from China is likely to be one in which the United States cripples itself technologically, denying itself <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/US-China-decoupling-easier-said-than-done-Western-Digital-CEO">access</a> to globally-competitive sourcing and empowering competitors elsewhere. The only politically viable alternative at the moment, a world in which the United States takes a more moderate stance and struggles to find a middle ground, is likely to be an unpredictable one in which rules are constantly evolving.</p>
<p>In either case, proponents of U.S.-China decoupling will find such a move counterproductive. Far from resolving strategic policy concerns, its primary impact may be to challenge U.S. technology leadership instead.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated many technological shifts – how many of us knew what Zoom was before last spring? Rapidly-developed mRNA COVID vaccines are themselves a case study in scientific and technological progress. Now efforts in the United States and Europe to require proof of said vaccination for a number of activities offer a preview of the immense opportunities possible as identification evolves – as well as a warning of its potential pitfalls if not done right.</p>
<p>In the United States, proof, for the moment anyway, is accomplished via a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-22/fake-covid-vaccine-cards-paper-format-open-to-outright-fraud">small piece of black and white paper</a> — or even just a picture of it — with details of one’s vaccination record often handwritten. It feels like an artifact from another era. Contrast that to the European Union’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en">Digital COVID Certificate</a>. Its scannable QR code can instantly access data from government health systems revealing vaccination status, COVID-19 test results, and even acquired immunity from an infection.</p>
<p>The Digital COVID Certificate is an example of a digital ID. Governments are increasingly adopting these technologies in order to solve a global problem: the lack of official ID for <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/global-dataset">one billion people</a> around the world. This is a huge barrier to participating in modern society – limiting access to jobs, school and even engaging in the basic activities of everyday life. Digital IDs can make it easier and safer for individuals to bank, vote, travel, obtain government services, and safeguard their social media profiles and interactions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222815" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But here’s the problem: digital IDs can also be used to restrict freedoms, increase surveillance, and actually make it harder to do many of the things they are supposed to facilitate. For example, over the last couple of years, concerns in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-health-tech/privacy-concerns-as-india-pushes-digital-health-plan-id-idUSKCN26D00B">India over privacy protections</a> — and in Kenya over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/africa/kenya-biometric-id.html">documentation requirements</a> that were excluding already marginalized communities — have made national digital ID programs contentious issues (indeed, the Kenyan High Court <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001426183/huduma-namba-declared-invalid">ruled</a> the IDs invalid after finding the government failed to properly safeguard citizen privacy in the rollout). Even in Europe, critics worry that its <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/08/16/covid-vaccine-passports-are-important-but-could-they-also-create-more-global-inequality">EU COVID</a> certificates could end up restricting the movements of people in low-income countries who can’t comply with the stringent “chain of trust” often involved in establishing digital IDs.</p>
<p>This is part of a larger trend over the last decade, with individuals at all levels of society becoming increasingly reliant – and to a certain extent captive – to digital tools and platforms outside of their control. This digital transformation has been given added urgency during the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift to virtual interactions. If we are to fulfill the promise of digital ID systems, they must be paired with robust policies and the technical architecture that will ensure they expand rather than contract individuals’ rights and liberties.</p>
<p>More people need a voice to ensure these systems expand, rather than erode, freedoms and opportunities, but too often the needs, experiences, and rights of citizens, residents, and consumers are not considered in developing digital ID technologies and policies. These missed opportunities can lead to severe consequences—digital ID programs that jeopardize privacy, present security risks, and exclude, marginalize, and even endanger users. Governments and businesses that rely on such flawed programs risk data breaches, cyberattacks, economic consequences, and the loss of public trust.</p>
<p>In the last few years, a coalition of privacy and security advocates began working with businesses, governments, and civil society organizations to advance their shared belief in the many benefits of digital IDs—and address their equally intense concerns about their many risks. They developed a pathway for developing digital IDs so that they live up to a standard called <a href="https://www.good-id.org/en/">Good ID.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Good ID approach involves following a framework of practices to design ID programs and policies that empower people to freely and safely engage with the digital world. Digital IDs should prioritize privacy and security and be treated as protected assets controlled by individuals and safeguarded by law. Good ID also elevates the importance of inclusion, transparency, and accountability. It promotes ways for individuals to play a major role in their own identity management. For example, a company in Canada is <a href="https://www.good-id.org/en/articles/enhancing-digital-ids-for-canadian-tribes-still-shipping-paper-documents-in-the-us/">working with Indigenous communities</a> there to develop secure digital IDs that can make it easier to protect rights that are guaranteed by the federal government.</p>
<p>The push for Good ID has inspired a global movement that includes grassroots organizations like <a href="https://namati.org/">Namati</a> and <a href="https://paradigmhq.org/">Paradigm Initiative</a>, researchers like <a href="https://itsrio.org/pt/home/">ITS Rio</a> and <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/digital-pathways">Oxford University</a>, initiatives like <a href="https://www.mosip.io/">MOSIP</a>, <a href="https://smartafrica.org/">Smart Africa</a> and <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/cpages/home">Women in Identity</a>, institutions like the <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> and <a href="https://www.weforum.org/projects/digital-identity">World Economic Forum</a>, philanthropic leaders like <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/">Mozilla Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, as well as my own organization, <a href="http://omidyar.com">Omidyar Network</a>. The #GoodID movement has created dialogues while pursuing research and advocacy that engages residents, governments, technologists, and businesses.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Already, this global advocacy effort has influenced national debates in nearly 40 countries. At least 25 countries have adopted elements of Good ID. Most importantly, there are now some 1.2 billion people around the world who have access to better ID systems that allow them to more fully and safely engage in their societies, economies, and election processes. Yet the work of this community will continue until digital IDs everywhere become worthy of the public’s trust.</p>
<p>In the last five years, digital ID has evolved from a novel innovation to an increasingly common technology, one with far reaching implications that are prompting attention from a wide range of stakeholders. There is no going back, paper vaccination cards notwithstanding. Yet digital ID systems are being implemented so rapidly that the danger of getting it wrong — of causing harm — is palpable.</p>
<p>That’s why the global push to harness sophisticated, cutting-edge technologies to create digital ID systems can benefit from a focus on good policies, transparent processes, and accountability. The ethos of the tech community is famously to ‘move fast and break things.&#8217; With the #GoodID movement, we can reconcile that impulse when it comes to digitizing society with the needs, experiences, and rights of everyday citizens.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Over the past two weeks, Anna Heim has interviewed Bashir from Arbisoft. They were recommended to us through our survey; we'd love to know which software consultants you'd recommend to other startups.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;In 2007, I, along with a few other colleagues, founded Arbisoft because we loved solving a variety of computing problems rather than staying close to one particular domain or technology vertical. We felt it was much easier to do that in a software services company than a software product company,&#8221; says Yasser Bashir, co-founder of Arbisoft. &#8220;In addition to our love for software development, we also had strong ideas on the kind of culture that would likely inspire smart people to do their best in a technology-focused organization. Arbisoft is a manifestation of many of those ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, Anna Heim has interviewed Bashir from Arbisoft as part of our Experts project. They were recommended to us through our <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">survey;</a> we&#8217;d love to know which software consultants you&#8217;d recommend to other startups. We also had guest columns focused on growth marketing about growth tactics and early-stage comm teams, but more on that below.</p>
<h2>Software Consulting</h2>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="https://arbisoft.com/">Arbisoft</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Omri Traub, CEO of <a href="https://www.popcart.com/">Popcart</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“We were able to create a high-performance dev team that includes dev, QA and DevOps. We had access to top talent and, importantly, elasticity in hiring. If we wanted to add a developer, we could have an incredible one join our team in under one week. It would have taken us weeks and months to recruit and hire a developer in Boston or the U.S.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222579" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="https://www.solwey.com/ ">Solwey Consulting</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Paul Shaked, <a href="https://sandlandsleep.com/">Sandland</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“They helped us tremendously &#8212; a not so great dev team in Europe built our site with no documentation and lots of sloppy code, but Solwey was able to come in and sort through everything. Not to mention, our e-comm site is built on a headless CMS x Shopify checkout. Solwey was one of the only teams that was able to jump in and really get things to a good place with almost no major delays due to tech debt.”</p>
<p><strong>Consultant:</strong> <a href="https://managedkube.com/">Planetary</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Ryan Doney, <a href="https://getadlunam.com/">Ad Lunam </a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“I vetted several different consultancies, and Planetary not only brought technical expertise to the table, but their startup-specific mindset meant that it was incredibly easy to get aligned on our mission, and how to best build it. Josh is a great talent, and he&#8217;s built a remarkable team. Their work dramatically cut down our time to market, as well as giving us a ready-made jumping off point to start iterating on our product.”</p>
<p><strong>Consultant:</strong> <a href="https://managedkube.com/">OpenCubicles</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Anonymous<br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“The OpenCubicles team helped us improve our infrastructure utilization, response time and other aspects critical to e-commerce success. We were able to rationalize cloud infrastructure costs due to thorough analysis and optimization. They helped us automate many aspects of operations. Would recommend to those looking for reliable technology services, especially e-commerce development.”</p>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="https://www.thinknimble.com/">ThinkNimble</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Philip Deng, <a href="https://grantable.co/">Grantable</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“They are focused on helping startups succeed and they care deeply about the missions of the companies they help. They brought us way forward in terms of our design and also connected us with lots of thoughtful people beyond the company who have helped us move forward.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/arbisoft-co-founder-yasser-bashir-on-building-trust-with-early-stage-startups/">Arbisoft co-founder Yasser Bashir on building trust with early-stage startups:</a> Anna and Bashir spoke about how Arbisoft has grown over the past 13 years, how they build trust with their clients and the startup scene in Pakistan. Bashir says, &#8220;I have been very involved with the startup and tech ecosystem in the country since its inception. It is indeed taking off like a rocket ship right now, and we couldn’t be more excited about it. This year, startups raised more funding than all of the previous years combined. Arbisoft is excited because many of these startups need technology services, and therefore, we have a new and exhilarating market at our disposal.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Growth Marketing</h2>
<p><strong>Marketer:</strong> Ki from <a href="https://within.co/">WITHIN</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Anonymous<br />
<strong>Testimonial:</strong> “Ki has been supporting our business for over three years, and every time he finds unique ways to exceed expectations. From launching new products that sell out in days rather than weeks, being able to onboard new members of our team so they can contribute faster, and being someone that can work at a strategic level with our VPs and at the data-driven level with analysts, his range is truly outstanding and I believe he is in the 1% of the 1% of marketers.”</p>
<p><strong>Marketer:</strong> Kaveh from <a href="https://within.co/">WITHIN</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Anonymous<br />
<strong>Testimonial:</strong> “Kaveh is one of the most empathetic and collaborative marketers I have ever worked with. Our team was largely brand marketers and Kaveh did a great job of bridging their world and our profit-optimized media strategy seamlessly (even if it meant an after-hours marketing jam session). Not only that, but you could tell he really cared about the brand, catching small issues with the site and sharing them with the team proactively, etc.”</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 400px;" data-tf-widget="bwwIWF03"></div>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/smart-growth-tactics-can-put-account-based-marketing-within-reach-for-startups-and-smbs/">(TechCrunch+) Smart growth tactics put account-based marketing within reach for startups and SMBs:</a> Jonas van de Poel, head of content marketing at Unmuted, says, “F​​or many startups and SMBs, successfully setting up account-based marketing strategies can feel like a pipe dream. Startups still struggling to find product-market fit wouldn’t dream of being able to identify and map out their ideal customer profile (ICP) clearly enough. At the same time, small and midsize businesses often lack the resources to invest in elaborate multitouch-point content marketing strategies.” Van de Poel shares what account-based marketing is, the importance of mapping a customers journey to marketing content and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/hiring-is-just-the-first-step-when-building-an-early-stage-comms-team/">(TechCrunch+) Hiring is just the first step when building an early-stage comms team:</a> Yousuf Khan, partner at Ridge Ventures, writes about not just the importance of having an early-stage comms team, but the importance of communicating with them. Khan says, “It’s not just important to have relationships between executives and media — you should have solid relationships with your comms people, too. Allow them to get to know you, your likes and dislikes, the environments in which you thrive and where you feel most comfortable.”</p>

<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Three Easy Steps to Capture Global Opportunities<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by KUDO</em><br />
As our economy becomes increasingly global, is your business prepared to succeed? KUDO co-founder and CEO Fardad Zabetian shares his insights on how to capture global opportunities.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Data Warehouse — The Foundation of the Modern Data Stack<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by RudderStack<br />
</em>The modern data stack is changing rapidly, with new technology emerging every day. Increasingly, though, architectures are being built around the data warehouse. In this panel discussion, Ben Gotfredson, global startup program manager at Snowflake, and Adam Gross, ex-CEO at Heroku, join RudderStack founder and CEO Soumyadeb Mitra to discuss why this new architecture has emerged, what specific technologies are driving the trend and what the data stack of the future looks like.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>9 Security Tips For Startups<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by Vanta<br />
</em>When startups are in the beginning stages of growth, it becomes harder to balance between taking necessary security measures and bringing the product to market. You don’t want to slow iteration speed, but you also know that there are security steps that need to happen in order to grow the business. How do you balance these competing objectives? Christina Cacioppo, co-founder and CEO of Vanta, shares nine practical tips for building your product with security in mind and how to engage in conversations around security expectations from the start.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong><span class="schedule-item__title">Disrupting Product Innovation<br />
</span></strong></span><em>Presented by Onshape, a PTC Business</em><br />
Innovation is a business imperative in today’s global economy. In fact, 84% of executives say innovation is key to their growth strategy, according to a McKinsey report. While companies need to innovate at scale to stay competitive, engineers need the right tools to avoid the many challenges associated with the product development process. In this session, hear Jon Hirschtick’s entrepreneurial journey and how cloud and SaaSification of the industry can accelerate product innovation as well as tips on scaling businesses into multimillion-dollar companies.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Accelerate your growth using agile market research throughout the product lifecycle<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by Momentive.ai<br />
</em>Conducting market research at each stage of your product lifecycle is a critical component to a successful product launch and sustained growth in an increasingly competitive market. While traditional market research can be costly and require a specialized team, agile market research software makes it possible for anyone on your team to get the insights you need fast. Join Momentive.ai to learn how to conduct your own market research to identify what kinds of products and features users value most, get insight into the competitive landscape and track your brand’s awareness and shifting perceptions over time.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>How do High-growth Companies Use Technology to Inform Strategy and Drive Results?<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by SAP<br />
</em>Fast-growing companies are in a constant state of transition, as high performance and growth can lead to ever-changing business priorities and challenges. Hear from a couple of SAP’s hypergrowth customers about how they use technology to inform their strategy and ultimately drive business results. SAP Managing Director, Midmarket and Ecosystem, Greg Petraetis will share how businesses grow from being innovators to disruptors to category leaders and how the technology they choose can impact the future of their business productivity.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Optimizing SaaS Productivity — Why SaaS Sprawl Prohibits Growth?<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by LeanIX</em><br />
SaaS represents an increasing share of the installed software estate — in cloud-born companies, often 100%. If not managed and optimized, an uncontrolled adoption leads to SaaS sprawl, sometimes called “Shadow IT.” Sub-optimized usage of SaaS subscriptions, increased risk and audit exposures will become a headache when scaling a business. André Christ, LeanIX co-founder and CEO, leads this talk illustrating frequent pitfalls and proposes the needed processes, skills and capabilities of the emerging SaaS management discipline for CEOs, CFOs and CIOs.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Things Fall Apart At $10MM ARR: Lessons For Growing Your SaaS Company<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by <span class="sponsors-label__sponsor-name">Vista Equity Partners<br />
</span></em>The strategies that get you to $10 million ARR look very different to those that get you to $50 million or even $100 million. At the $10 million growth inflection point, most software companies need to pivot their approach and often find they are facing new &#8212; often seemingly insurmountable &#8212; challenges. The team at Vista Equity Partners &#8212; one of the largest enterprise software investors in the world with over $81 billion AUM &#8212; have worked with many founders and companies to successfully bridge this transition. In this session, Rene Stewart, co-head of Vista’s growth-stage Endeavor Fund, discusses the missteps and misconceptions around software company growth and what you can do to achieve success that scales beyond $10 million ARR.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Taking Your People from Startup to Scale<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by SAP<br />
</em>As your business grows, you need to help your people grow with you. And, in a world that is transforming faster than ever, the methods of developing your team don’t cut it. In this session you’ll hear from Max Wessel, chief learning officer at SAP, about how to build a culture and workforce that is flexible, adaptable and fit for a rocket ship.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Future Forward — How Machine Learning and Human-in-the-Loop Approaches Are Expanding the Capabilities of Automation<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by AKASA<br />
</em>Digital transformation efforts in a number of industries have driven massive adoption of robotic process automation (RPA) over the past decade. The hard truth is that RPA is a decades-old technology that is brittle, with real limits to its capabilities. It will always have some value in automating work that is simple, discrete and linear. However, the reason automation efforts often fall short of their aspirations is because so much of life is complex and constantly evolving — too much work falls outside of the capabilities of RPA. In this talk, Varun Ganapathi, co-founder and CTO of AKASA, will discuss how exceptions and outliers can actually make automation stronger and how emerging machine-learning-based technology platforms combined with human-in-the-loop approaches are already expanding what it is possible to automate across a number of industries.</p>

<p>Friday! Dear friends, we <em>made</em> it to the end of the week. It was a big, busy few days, so give yourself a round of applause. Looking ahead, not only do we have earnings from Facebook and Alphabet and Microsoft and Robinhood next week, but our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/well-be-discussing-why-its-automations-moment-at-tc-sessions-saas-on-oct-27th/">super-great SaaS event is taking place on Wednesday</a>. I’m hosting and doing a panel or two, so see you there for all the fun! – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/the-trump-spac-is-doing-stonk-things-which-is-hilarious/"><strong>Public markets welcome Trump SPAC:</strong></a> Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s new media company announced yesterday that it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/">go public via a SPAC-led transaction</a>. Today, investors spent quite a lot of money bidding up shares in the blank-check company that will take Trump Media and Technology Group public. In retrospect, however, of <em>course</em> the SPAC became a memestock given its lack of fundamentals or, well, product.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/snap-q-3-2021-earnings/"><strong>Snap suffers from supply-chain, Apple woes:</strong></a> U<strong>.</strong>S. social networking company Snap saw around a fifth of its value disappear today after it reported earnings following the end of trading yesterday. In short, despite a pretty good quarter, Snap’s growth expectations for Q4 were way under expectations. Why? Changes to iOS from Apple and supply-chain issues leading to reduced advertiser demand. TechCrunch also discussed how Snap’s issues help <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/facebooks-next-chapter-just-might-make-sense/">make the argument for Facebook’s metaverse push</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/brex-raises-300m-at-a-12-3b-valuation/"><strong>Brex raises again (again):</strong></a><strong> </strong>The corporate spend and expense reporting market can apparently absorb an infinite amount of capital, a fact that we learned again recently after TechCrunch broke the news that Brex once again raised more money at a higher price. This may kick off fundraising for Brex’s various competitors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We have our usual run of startup news below, but before we get into that, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/working-to-understand-rent-the-runways-ipo-valuation/">spent a few words today thinking through Rent the Runway’s expected IPO price range</a> and how it stacks up against related companies. We have questions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/intelligent-implants-seed-round/"><strong>Startup hopes to help you grow backbone:</strong></a><strong> </strong>We really shouldn’t make spine-based jokes given that someone will find them in poor taste, but <a href="https://twitter.com/haje">Haje Jan Kamps</a> started with his headline, so please direct all complaints in that direction. Regardless, Intelligent Implants has raised $8.7 million for its health-focused hardware that could help with back health.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/how-lunchclub-landed-a-preemptive-term-sheet-from-lightspeed/">How Lunchclub landed a preemptive term sheet from Lightspeed:</a></strong> One of TechCrunch’s best &#8212; if also best-hidden &#8212; talents, <a href="https://twitter.com/NeeshaTambe">Neesha Tambe</a> wrote up a recent talk we had with a startup concerning how it managed to raise preemptive cash from a major investor. Founders, this is for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/a16z-base-partners-cook-up-15m-in-funding-for-colombia-cloud-kitchen-concept-foodology/"><strong>More money for cloud kitchens:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The global effort to build and fund shared kitchens for meal prep tuned for delivery continues to attract capital; this time with a16z and Base Partners dicing up $15 million for Bogotá-based Foodology. Here’s hoping that the startup uses the funds to help make meals and doesn’t make a meal out of it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/pledge-raises-4-5m-seed-round-to-build-a-carbon-measurement-and-removal-api/"><strong>Transport companies can now “Pledge” to offset their carbon footprint:</strong></a> A startup called Pledge wants to help “freight forwarding, ride-hailing, travel and last-mile delivery” companies dispense with the implicit carbon costs of their businesses. The startup just raised $4.5 million from “Visionaries Club with participation from Chris Sacca’s Lowercarbon Capital and Zinal Growth,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/india-ofbusiness-in-talks-to-raise-new-funds-at-over-4-5-billion-valuation/"><strong>OfBusiness in talks to raise again (again!):</strong></a> Er, OfBusiness is back in our pages. The company raised money this April. And last month. And now it is doing so again. This time at a valuation of more than $4.5 billion, TechCrunch reports. That’s a 50% bump from its last round.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hiring is just the first step when building an early-stage comms team</h2>
<p>There are a few places where founders can cut corners, but your first comms hire is not one of them. Companies that choose not to invest in finding the best person for this role will inevitably regret it later.</p>
<p>Since these are the people tasked with bringing your message to the outside world, &#8220;look for a strategic partner rather than a manager,&#8221; advises Yousuf Khan, partner at Ridge Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should be able to discuss your product and industry as well as anyone on your sales team. If that sounds like a tall order, it is — yet another reason to properly invest in the role.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/accountable-tech-mainstreet-against-big-tech/"><strong>Tech watchdog isn’t big on Big Tech’s leverage of small biz for PR:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Facebook and other tech giants love to tell you stories about how their products and services help one small business or another. It’s a way of both humanizing megacorps and creating a smokescreen to avoid more lucid scrutiny. Main Street Against Big Tech is spending money to push back on the matter.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/elon-musk-says-starship-should-be-ready-for-first-orbital-launch-next-month-pending-regulatory-approval/"><strong>SpaceX’s Starship rocket could fly as soon as next month:</strong></a> But it will need regulatory approval, TechCrunch reports. Regardless, the news is good for you spaceheads out there — the sooner SpaceX can move the commercial space industry forward by another peg, the sooner its competitors will have to catch up, benefiting us all.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/revue-now-lets-you-subscribe-to-newsletters-directly-on-your-twitter-timeline/"><strong>Twitter now allows users to subscribe to Revue newsletters in their timelines:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Twitter is probably going to get away with favoring its own product given its modest scale when set next to companies like Facebook, but its product work on Revue — a newsletter product it previously bought — is turning heads all the same. Twitter is currently taking on two well-known a16z bets, namely Substack (with Revue) and Clubhouse (with Spaces).</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage entrepreneurs who are eager to ship usually spend more time calculating their startup’s monthly burn rate than selecting an optimal development environment.</p>
<p>As a result, technical debt starts to accumulate. And accumulate.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Senior Writer Romain Dillet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/how-do-you-select-the-right-tech-stack/">interviewed Jill Wetzler, VP of Engineering at Pilot, and Preeti Somal, EVP of Engineering at HashiCorp</a>, to learn more about how they evaluate third-party vendors, select open-source components and think ahead with regard to engineering capabilities.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222614" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<hr />
<p>“All you’re doing that sprint is working off your tech debt backlog,” said Somal. “I think the really key thing is to recognize it, find a strategy to work with it, and don’t let it build to a point where it just feels like you’re going to take a massive hit on productivity.”</p>
<p>Their discussion, which took place at TechCrunch Disrupt, also addressed the value of using test suites and selecting a reliable continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) framework.</p>
<p>“What are the things that can help our team move really fast and ship really fast?” asked Wetzler. “Because I think that is the name of the game when you’re talking about a startup. It just comes down to how you can get your code out the door as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading TechCrunch+, and I hope you have an excellent weekend.</p>

<p>Offering consumers affordable options for high-end clothing and accessories is innovative, but Rent the Runway’s recent IPO filing makes the company’s “overall business profile” look “unsteady,” writes Alex Wilhelm in today’s edition of The Exchange.</p>
<p>But because its price range indicates that Rent the Runway is a unicorn in waiting, “we have to take it seriously.”</p>

<p>The tide is high for startup founders who are looking to raise their first round in October 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But easy money can create special pressure for early-stage founders, according to Lightup.ai founder Manu Bansal.</p>
<p>“You can’t speed up GTM with more money. If valuations go up astronomically, I remind myself that I have to deliver performance,” he says.</p>
<p>“If I cannot show traction, sooner or later this beast will come back to haunt me. I’d rather avoid the price runners.”</p>

<p>Plaid has steadily expanded its payments toolkit for years, but yesterday, it unveiled new services that integrate its infrastructure deeper with partners’ payment flow.</p>
<p>It is a potential game-changer, as millions of merchants “now have a low-cost alternative to avoid credit card processing fees that cut into their margins,” writes Ryan Lawler.</p>

<p>Fintech in Latin America is on fire, and nowhere more so than in Mexico — startups in the sector roped in nearly 20% of all capital invested in the region last year.</p>
<p>“Considering that nearly 40 million people in Mexico (almost a third of the population) are unbanked, fintech has been a necessary vehicle for fresh routes for credit, insurance and remittances,” writes Jen Laloup, CEO of Mobile Growth Association.</p>

<p>Technology should enhance customer service operations, but automation can risk making the experience feel a little robotic.</p>
<p>Joyce Lee, Alorica’s chief culture officer, shares four actionable steps companies can take to foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with an inclusive onboarding process.</li>
<li>Host interactive forums.</li>
<li>Implement an ongoing speaker series.</li>
<li>Define your commitment.</li>
</ul>
<p>“The more diverse your people are, the more they can relate to a diverse customer base,” she writes.</p>

<h2>Udemy targets valuation of $4B in major edtech IPO</h2>

<p>In other IPO news, edtech provider Udemy could well be worth more than $4 billion after its upcoming debut, which it expects to price at $27-$29 per share.</p>
<p>“It’s a modest bump in worth for the company, which was last valued at $3.32 billion during its $50 million November raise,” write Natasha Mascarenhas and Alex Wilhelm, who studied its S-1/A filing.</p>
<p>But slowing revenue growth means the company will need to convince potential investors that its business has more mountains to climb.</p>
<p>“While few would argue that digitization and rapid re-skilling are impacting workforces across the world, some may need to be convinced that enterprise edtech is the solution to the resulting gaps.”</p>

<p>There are a few places where startup founders can cut corners, but your first comms hire is not one of them.</p>
<p>Companies that choose not to invest in finding the best person for this role will inevitably regret it later. Since these are the people tasked with bringing your message to the outside world, &#8220;look for a strategic partner rather than a manager,&#8221; advises Yousuf Khan, partner at Ridge Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should be able to discuss your product and industry as well as anyone on your sales team. If that sounds like a tall order, it is — yet another reason to properly invest in the role.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Zillow announced that it was hitting pause on its iBuying operations earlier this week, but rival Opendoor says it is expanding operations and plowing ahead.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Zillow announced that it was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-17/zillow-pauses-home-purchases-as-snags-hit-tech-powered-flipping?sref=1SlQD502">hitting pause on its iBuying operations</a> earlier this week, the news sent shockwaves through the real estate industry.</p>
<p>Zillow blamed the pause on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/zillow-gets-outplayed-at-its-own-game-11634551201">labor and supply constraints</a> that were hampering its ability to quickly renovate and efficiently turn over its housing inventory. The announcement sent Zillow’s stock plummeting 10% in the day after the report, while driving competitor Opendoor higher.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The key to Opendoor’s recent market expansion can be tied to a fundamental retooling of its playbook for launching in a new city or region.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Given the overlap between operations &#8212; Opendoor is in 23 of the 25 markets where Zillow was purchasing homes &#8212; there was some question about whether Opendoor was affected by the same shortages. But while Zillow is pulling back, Opendoor says it is plowing ahead.</p>
<p>Over the past nine months, Opendoor has aggressively expanded operations and has been growing its inventory. The company purchased 8,500 homes in the second quarter &#8212; more than double Zillow’s tally &#8212; and said it had contracts to purchase another 8,200 homes in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Shortly after Zillow confirmed the pause in its iBuying operation, Opendoor issued a statement which said, “We know how important certainty and convenience are to homeowners seeking to move and we’ve worked hard over the past seven years to ensure we can continue to deliver our experience at scale. Opendoor is open for business and continues to scale and grow.”</p>
<p>Basically, Opendoor has no plans to slow down anytime soon. The company can cite a combination of proprietary data, centralized operations and an increasingly digital process for evaluating homes and making offers as just some of the reasons why it has been able to more than double the number of markets it operates in over the past nine months.</p>
<h2>Data, data, everywhere</h2>
<p>The key to any successful iBuying business is the use of data to make a competitive offer to sellers while also having a strong understanding of the price you can expect to garner when you put the home back up for sale.</p>
<p>That data, and how you model it, becomes even more crucial in a dynamic real estate market like the one that has emerged over the past 18 months, where historically low interest rates and unprecedented demand constrained inventory and led to home price appreciation in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>“Our job as a company is to provide a really compelling and competitive offer to sellers,” said Opendoor CTO Ian Wong. “If we can&#8217;t offer a competitive offer on the single largest asset most people have, they simply won&#8217;t take [it].”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
