										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A change to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy?lang=en#privacy-us">TikTok&#8217;s U.S. Privacy Policy</a> on Wednesday introduced a new section that says the social video app <em>&#8220;may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information&#8221;</em> from its users&#8217; content. This includes things like <em>&#8220;faceprints and voiceprints,&#8221;</em> the policy explained. Reached for comment, TikTok could not confirm what product developments necessitated the addition of biometric data to its list of disclosures about the information it automatically collects from users, but said it would ask for consent in the case such data collection practices began.</p>
<p>The biometric data collection details were introduced in the newly added section, &#8220;Image and Audio Information,&#8221; found under the heading of &#8220;Information we collect automatically&#8221; in the policy.</p>
<p>This is the part of TikTok&#8217;s Privacy Policy that lists the types of data the app gathers from users, which was already fairly extensive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The first part of the new section explains that TikTok may collect information about the images and audio that are in users&#8217; content,<em> &#8220;such as identifying the objects and scenery that appear, the existence and location within an image of face and body features and attributes, the nature of the audio, and the text of the words spoken in your User Content.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>While that may sound creepy, other social networks do object recognition on images you upload to power accessibility features (like describing what&#8217;s in an Instagram photo, for example), as well as for<a href="https://www.business2community.com/facebook/facebooks-new-image-recognition-algorithm-can-scan-your-picture-for-advertising-opportunities-02202720"> ad targeting</a> purposes. Identifying where a person and the scenery is can help with AR effects, while converting spoken words to text helps with features like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/tiktok-adds-auto-captions-to-make-videos-accessible-to-hard-of-hearing-and-deaf/">TikTok&#8217;s automatic captions.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FNSgZvfPRF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/tiktok-adds-auto-captions-to-make-videos-accessible-to-hard-of-hearing-and-deaf/">TikTok adds auto captions to make videos accessible to hard of hearing and deaf</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok adds auto captions to make videos accessible to hard of hearing and deaf&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/tiktok-adds-auto-captions-to-make-videos-accessible-to-hard-of-hearing-and-deaf/embed/#?secret=FNSgZvfPRF" data-secret="FNSgZvfPRF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The policy also notes this part of the data collection is for enabling <em>&#8220;special video effects, for content moderation, for demographic classification, for content and ad recommendations, and for other non-personally-identifying operations,&#8221;</em> it says.</p>
<p>The more concerning part of the new section references a plan to collect biometric data.</p>
<p>It states:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information as defined under US laws, such as faceprints and voiceprints, from your User Content. Where required by law, we will seek any required permissions from you prior to any such collection.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The statement itself is vague, as it doesn&#8217;t specify whether it&#8217;s considering federal law, states laws, or both. It also doesn&#8217;t explain, as the other part did, why TikTok needs this data. It doesn&#8217;t define the terms &#8220;faceprints&#8221; or &#8220;voiceprints.&#8221; Nor does it explain how it would go about seeking the &#8220;required permissions&#8221; from users, or if it would look to either state or federal laws to guide that process of gaining consent.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s important because as it stands today, <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/biometrics/biometric-data">only a handful of U.S. states</a> have biometric privacy laws, including Illinois, Washington, California, Texas and New York. If TikTok only requested consent, &#8220;where required by law,&#8221; it could mean users in other states would not have to be informed about the data collection.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, a TikTok spokesperson could not offer more details on the company&#8217;s plans for biometric data collection or how it may tie in to either current or future products.</p>
<p>&#8220;As part of our ongoing commitment to transparency, we recently updated our Privacy Policy to provide more clarity on the information we may collect,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The company also pointed us to an <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/our-approach-to-security">article about its approach to data security</a>, TikTok&#8217;s latest <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/transparency-report-2020-2">Transparency Report</a>Â and the recently launched <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/privacy-and-security-on-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/privacy-and-security-on-tiktok/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622845675873000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGI8mMx0o_xJ8hWVqssD_nh5LwlkA">privacy and security hub</a>, which is aimed at helping people better understand their privacy choices on the app.</p>

<p>The biometric disclosure comes at a time when TikTok has been working to regain the trust of some U.S. users.</p>
<p>Under the Trump administration, the federal government attempted to ban TikTok from operating in the U.S. entirely, calling the app a national security threat because of its ownership by a Chinese company. TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/tiktok-files-for-injunction-against-pending-trump-app-ban/">fought back </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/tiktok-sues-the-u-s-government-over-its-forthcoming-ban/">against the ban </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/tiktok-launches-a-new-information-hub-and-twitter-account-to-correct-the-record-it-says/">went on record to state</a> it only stores TikTok U.S. user data in its U.S. data centers and in Singapore.</p>
<p>It said it has never shared TikTok user data with the Chinese government nor censored content, despite being owned by Beijing-based ByteDance. And it said it would never do so, if asked.</p>
<p>Though the TikTok ban was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/second-federal-judge-rules-against-trump-administrations-tiktok-ban/">initially stopped in the courts</a>, the federal government appealed the rulings. But when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tiktoks-forced-sale-to-oracle-is-put-on-hold/">President Biden took office</a>, his administration put the appeal process on hold <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-sale-to-oracle-walmart-is-shelved-as-biden-reviews-security-11612958401">as it reviewed the actions </a>taken by his predecessor. And although Biden has, as of today, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/03/executive-order-on-addressing-the-threat-from-securities-investments-that-finance-certain-companies-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/">signed an executive order</a> to restrict U.S. investment in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/us/politics/biden-china-surveillance-order.html">Chinese firms linked to surveillance</a>, his administration&#8217;s position on TikTok remains unclear.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>It is worth noting, however, that the new disclosure about biometric data collection follows <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tiktok-reaches-92-million-settlement-bipa-lawsuit-022605/">a $92 million settlement in a class action lawsuit against TikTok</a>, originally filed in May 2020, over the social media app&#8217;s violation of Illinoisâ Biometric Information Privacy Act. The consolidated suit included more than 20 separate cases filed against TikTok over the platform&#8217;s collection and sharing of the personal and biometric information without user consent. Specifically, this involved the use of facial filter technology for special effects.</p>
<p>In that context, TikTok&#8217;s legal team may have wanted to quickly cover themselves from future lawsuits by adding a clause that permits the app to collect personal biometric data.</p>
<p>The disclosure, we should also point out, has only been added to the U.S. Privacy Policy, as other markets like the EU have stricter data protection and privacy laws.</p>
<p>The new section was part of a broader update to TikTok&#8217;s Privacy Policy, which included other changes both large and small, ranging from corrections of earlier typos to revamped or even entirely new sections. Most of these tweaks and changes could be easily explained, though &#8212; like new sections that clearly referenced TikTok&#8217;s e-commerce ambitions or adjustments aimed at addressing the implications of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency</a> on targeted advertising.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, TikTok still has plenty of data on its users, their content and their devices, even without biometric data.</p>
<p>For example, TikTok policy already stated it automatically collects information about users&#8217; devices, including location data based on your SIM card and IP addresses and GPS, your use of TikTok itself and all the content you create or upload, the data you send in messages on its app, metadata from the content you upload, cookies, the app and file names on your device, battery state and even your keystroke patterns and rhythms, among other things.</p>
<p>This is in addition to the &#8220;Information you choose to provide,&#8221; which comes from when you register, contact TikTok or upload content. In that case, TikTok collects your registration info (username, age, language, etc.), profile info (name, photo, social media accounts), all your user-generated content on the platform, your phone and social network contacts, payment information, plus the text, images and video found in the device&#8217;s clipboard. (TikTok, as you may recall, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304228/tiktok-security-ios-clipboard-access-ios14-beta-feature">got busted by Apple&#8217;s iOS 14 feature</a> that alerted users to the fact that TikTok and other apps were accessing iOS clipboard content. Now, the policy says TikTok &#8220;may collect&#8221; clipboard data &#8220;with your permission.&#8221;)</p>

<p>The content of the Privacy Policy itself wasn&#8217;t of immediate concern to some TikTok users. Instead, it was the buggy rollout.</p>
<p>Some users reported seeing a pop-up message alerting them to the Privacy Policy update, but the page was <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewericdoes/status/1400115048782045187">not available</a> when they tried to read it. Others <a href="https://twitter.com/diegheaux/status/1400223230577762310">complained</a> of seeing the pop-up repeatedly. This issue doesn&#8217;t appear to be universal. In tests, we did not have an issue with the pop-up ourselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration has replaced and expanded Trump-era restrictions on investing in certain Chinese firms deemed supportive of that country&#8217;s surveillance and military apparatus. Major tech, space and telecom companies are listed in the initial 59 covered by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/03/executive-order-on-addressing-the-threat-from-securities-investments-that-finance-certain-companies-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/">the executive order</a>, with more to come by order of the Treasury.</p>
<p>&#8220;I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside the PRC and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse, constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,&#8221; writes President Biden in the introduction to the order.</p>
<p>The E.O. has its roots in the Trump administration&#8217;s long-running and evolving blacklist of Chinese companies, whether for government procurement, private investment by U.S. firms, or other purposes. Major tech companies like ZTE and Huawei <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/15/trump-declares-national-emergency-to-protect-u-s-networks-from-foreign-espionage/">were put on the list straight away in 2019</a>, but others were steadily added over time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Biden order refines these orders, revising certain portions and expanding others, particularly in the definition of what constitutes dangerous behavior or collaboration with Chinese authorities. Notably it stretches this to cover companies involved in domestic surveillance of Uygur Muslims in China and political dissidents in Hong Kong and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The new list of companies includes many of those listed over the last two years and adds plenty more. Seemingly any major company that deals with tech, communications or aerospace is at risk of being entered on the list, from China Mobile and China Unicom to China Aerospace, Hikvision and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/the-trump-administration-will-add-smic-chinas-largest-chipmaker-to-its-defense-blacklist-report/">SMIC</a>. Direct investment in the companies is disallowed, as is investing in an intermediary such as an index fund that includes one of the prohibited companies.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The Treasury â rather than the Defense Department, as it was previously â is given the responsibility of maintaining and updating the list, either adding to or subtracting from it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tackling these challenges head-on is consistent with the Biden administrationâs commitment to protecting core U.S. national security interests and democratic values, and the administration will continue to update the list of PRC entities as appropriate,&#8221; read a fact sheet accompanying the order.</p>
<p>Clearly the White House aims to continue and refine the trade war with China started by Trump. Whether U.S. pressure will be enough to influence Chinese policy or if the international community&#8217;s support will be necessary may soon be clear as the president goes to visit allies in search of support on this and other measures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aurora, the autonomous vehicle company that acquired Uber ATG last year, has assembled a team of outside experts, shared new details about its operations in a self-assessment safety report and launched a <a href="https://aurora.tech/safety">website</a>Â as part of a broader effort to win over consumers wary of the technology that they may someday share the road with, or even use.</p>
<p>Aurora said Thursday it has tapped experts in aviation safety, insurance, medicine and automotive safety â all people from outside of the niche AV industry â to provide an outside perspective on the company&#8217;s overall approach to safety, to look for gaps in its system and advise on the best ways to share its progress and record with regulators and the public. The advisory group is designed to augment Aurora&#8217;s existing safety efforts, which includes on-road testing and development.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think for a while we&#8217;ve almost done the &#8216;Field of Dreams&#8217; analysis where it&#8217;s like, &#8216;well if we build it they will come, just look at iPhones,'&#8221; Nat Beuse, Aurora&#8217;s head of safety said in a recent interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;We are always comparing it to these other consumer products, and I&#8217;m not so sure that is actually how we win over the hearts and minds of consumers in every single community in the United States.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Beuse, who previously led the safety team at Uber ATG and once oversaw automated-vehicle developments at the U.S. Department of Transportation, said the goal is for driverless vehicles â whether that&#8217;s robotaxis shuttling people or trucks hauling freight â to be adopted broadly. That can&#8217;t happen, he said, without being able to measure and show the public that the technology is safe. He noted that public trust is one of the two biggest threats he sees to the AV industry.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TmKmo5uAq5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/inside-zooxs-six-year-ride-from-prototype-to-product/">Inside Zoox&#8217;s six-year ride from prototype to product</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Inside Zoox&#8217;s six-year ride from prototype to product&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/inside-zooxs-six-year-ride-from-prototype-to-product/embed/#?secret=TmKmo5uAq5" data-secret="TmKmo5uAq5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;If all we worry about is a small number of people who get exposed to [AVs] we will never see the benefits of this technology and the broad scale, sweeping changes and the impact that it can have on our lives in a beneficial way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have to do a lot more there [gaining public trust]. Beuse added that gaining public trust should be done in concert with the government.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think for too long it&#8217;s been, &#8216;You, industry, you solve it. You&#8217;re building this stuff,'&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I really think it&#8217;s a partnership. Of course, we&#8217;re building the tech, we have a huge responsibility, but also the government has a huge, huge role to play and helping us kind of get the public on board.&#8221;</p>
<p>The members of the <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/aurora-shares-safety-report">safety advisory board</a> include Intelligent Transportation Society of America President and CEO Shailen Bhatt, Dave Carbaugh, the former chief pilot for flight-operations safety at Boeing and Victoria Chibuogu Nneji, the lead engineer and innovation strategist at Edge Case Research. Other members include Biologue President Jeff Runge, who is also a former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Adrian Lund, managing member of HITCH42, LLC and former president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety andÂ GHS Aviation Group CEO George Snyder.</p>
<p>The committee, which has already been meeting, is comprised of people who &#8220;don&#8217;t live and breathe the tech,&#8221; Beuse said.</p>
<p>Most importantly, for Aurora and the rest of the industry, is addressing the looming question of &#8216;how safe is safe enough?&#8217; when it comes to driverless vehicles. One metric that has been adopted, and increasingly criticized, is comparing vehicle miles traveled and vehicle miles per &#8220;disengagement,&#8221; an industry jargon term that means a human safety operator has taken over from the computer driving the vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been pretty adamant that that&#8217;s not a real metric because you can drive around in a parking lot and generate some interactions and that&#8217;s a whole lot different than if you&#8217;re driving in a city â and oh by the way, that&#8217;s a whole lot different if you&#8217;re driving on the highway,&#8221; Beuse explained.</p>
<p>Aurora is part of the <a href="https://avsc.sae-itc.org/">Automated Vehicle Safety Consortium</a> (AVSC), which includes Daimler, Ford, GM, Honda, Lyft, Motional, SAE and Toyota, that is working to come up with better safety metrics. The new Aurora safety advisory board isn&#8217;t working directly on the AVSC project, however it is providing general guidance that could help in this effort.</p>
<p>While there is still more work to be done to validate these new metrics, the group does have a handful that it thinks are pretty promising, Beuse said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Software as a service has been thriving as a sector for years, but it has gone into overdrive in the past year as businesses responded to the pandemic by speeding up the migration of important functions to the cloud. Weâve all seen the news of SaaS startups <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/in-2020-vc-exits-fell-70-while-saas-matured-report-6656821.html">raising large funding rounds</a>, with deal sizes and valuations <a href="https://www.saastr.com/what-it-takes-to-really-raise-capital-in-2021/">steadily climbing</a>. But as tech industry watchers know only too well, large funding rounds and valuations are not foolproof indicators of sustainable growth and longevity.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Failing to come across as a unique, differentiated company will likely mean settling for an exit that feels mediocre instead of incredible.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>To scale sustainably, grow its customer base and mature to the point of an exit, a SaaS startup needs to stand apart from the herd at every phase of development. Failure to do so means a poor outcome for founders and investors.</p>
<p>As a founder who pivoted from on-premise to SaaS back in 2016, I have focused on scaling my company (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/activecampaign-raises-240m-at-a-3b-valuation-as-marketing-and-sales-automation-come-into-focus-for-smbs/">most recently crossing 145,000 customers</a>) and in the process, learned quite a bit about making a mark. Here is some advice on differentiation at the various stages in the life of a SaaS startup.</p>
<h2>Launch and early years</h2>
<p>Differentiation is crucial early on, because itâs one of the only ways to attract customers. Customers can help lay the groundwork for everything from your product roadmap to pricing.</p>
<p>The more you know about your target customersâ pain points with current solutions, the easier it will be to stand out. Take every opportunity to learn about the people you are aiming to serve, and which problems they want to solve the most. Analyst reports about specific sectors may be useful, but there is no better source of information than the people who, hopefully, will pay to use your solution.</p>
<p>The key to success in the SaaS space is solving real problems. Take DocuSign, for example â the company found a way to simply and elegantly solve a niche problem for users with its software. This is something that sounds easy, but in reality, it means spending hours listening to the customer and tailoring your product accordingly.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunchâs biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 3, 2021. If you are a startup founder or early employee or investor, thereâs good news on the TechCrunch front today: The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/announcing-the-disrupt-2021-extra-crunch-stage-agenda/">start of the Disrupt agenda is live</a>! Itâs going to be one hell of a show for anyone interested in startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/the-existential-cost-of-decelerated-growth/">and how they grow</a>. See you there! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/united-airlines-agrees-to-purchase-15-boom-supersonic-airliners/"><strong>United goes Boom</strong></a><strong>:</strong> News broke today that United Airlines has agreed to purchase 15 supersonic jets from Boom, a startup focused on building them. For Boom, the deal is a big happening, evidence of material market demand for its products. And, given how much planes cost in general, a huge set of bookings for the company to show to its investors that have plowed nearly a quarter billion dollars into the company, according to Crunchbase.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-launches-its-premium-subscription-twitter-blue-initially-in-canada-and-australia/"><strong>Twitter is Blue</strong></a><strong>:</strong> No, the social media company isnât sad. Quite the opposite. Instead, Twitterâs subscription service Blue is going live in two markets for a few dollars per month. Itâs something of a very public test of what Twitter hopes &#8212; we presume &#8212; will be a globally available subscription option for those of us who canât stop tweeting.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/"><strong>Womenâs health remains an underinvested startup niche</strong></a><strong>: </strong>TechCrunchâs Natasha Mascarenhas dug into the world of hormonal health for the blog today, asking why there arenât unicorns in the huge market. Itâs a great read.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>Weâre dividing up todayâs startup and venture capital news into two buckets. The first comprises early-stage rounds, and the latter investments in upstarts that are a bit more mature.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/"><strong>Indiaâs early-stage market accelerates</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Manish Singh reports for TechCrunch that a host of Indian startups are in the process of raising money. He broke an ocean of news in his piece on the matter, not only underscoring how active the global venture market is, but just how hard it can be to keep track of all the activity.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/simplified-raises-2-2-million-in-seed-to-bring-automated-content-creation-to-marketers/"><strong>Simplified raises $2.2M to support marketing creative</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Marketers are expected to generate lots of content. Simplified is taking on Canva and that huge market need in a single go. And now itâs backed by Craft Ventures.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ganaz-raises-7m-a-round-to-rethink-how-agriculture-workers-get-hired-and-paid/"><strong>Ganaz raises $7M to help agricultural workers get paid</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Not every tech company has to cater to the tech elite or the wealthy. Ganaz is betting that its business &#8212; focused on what we described as changing âhow people with little documentation and no bank account get paid and send money with a modern workforce stackâ &#8212; is going to be a hit. Given how huge the agricultural sector is, its wager makes some sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, on the late-stage front:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/gong-going-gangbusters-grabs-250m-series-e-on-7-25b-valuation/"><strong>Gong raises $250M for sales automation</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Gongâs rapid growth and latest funding was part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/the-existential-cost-of-decelerated-growth/">my column this morning</a> because of how interesting they proved to be. In short, the sales automation company has roughly tripled its valuation to more than $7 billion since last August. How? By growing by more than 2x in the last year.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/realtime-robotics-raises-a-31m-series-a/">Realtime Robotics raises $31M for real-time robotics</a>: </strong>Bostonâs startup scene is more than biotech, it should be clear by now. Realtime Robotics is one such Beantown startup that isnât building new drugs. Instead, Brian Heater reports, itâs building robot software to âhelp companies deploy systems with limited programming, offering adaptable controls that work for multiple systems at once.â</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/leolabs-raises-65m-series-b-for-its-satellite-monitoring-and-collision-detection-service/">LeoLabs raises $65M to keep satellites from hitting each other</a>: </strong>As SpaceX sends bushels of internet satellites into space, the issue of crowding in near-Earth orbit will only get stickier. LeoLabs is betting that keeping expensive space tech from hitting other space tech, or even space trash, is going to be a growth industry.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3 lessons we learned after raising $6.3M from 50 investors</h2>
<p>Two years ago, founders of calendar-assistant platform Reclaim were looking for a &#8220;mango&#8221; seed round â a boodle of cash large enough to help them transition from the prototype phase to staffing up for a public launch.</p>
<p>Although the team received offers, co-founder Henry Shapiro says the few that materialized were poor options, partially because Reclaim was still pre-product.</p>
<blockquote><p>So one summer morning, my co-founder and I sat down in his garage â where weâd been prototyping, pitching and iterating for the past year â and realized that as hard as it was, we would have to walk away entirely and do a full reset on our fundraising strategy.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a guest post for Extra Crunch, Shapiro shares what he learned from embracing failure and offers three conclusions &#8220;every founder should consider before they decide to go out and pitch investors.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Big Tech was busy yet again today, with news from Waymo, Twitter and Blackstone. We also have to talk about the law.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/waymos-driverless-taxi-service-can-now-be-accessed-on-google-maps/"><strong>You can now hail Waymo taxis in Google Maps</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Vertical integration, baby! Itâs a jam if you are a platform company that makes self-driving cars, operates a taxi service, and also publishes what I presume is the most popular mapping software in the world.</li>
<li>In related news: Waymo, bring self-driving taxis to Providence, Rhode Island, you cowards!</li>
<li>In related apologies: Waymo is not made up of cowards, but merely businesspeople who should invest more of their testing budget in Providence, Rhode Island.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/"><strong>Twitter wants to hear you talk</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Twitter is bringing its Spaces product more front-and-center in its mobile experience. Sure, all you use Twitter for today is tweets, but Big Tweet will soon want to send your newsletters, host your chats, and, well, distribute your Fleets as well.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/supreme-court-hacking-cfaa-ruling/">A court case draws limits around a controversial American hacking law</a>: </strong>Per TechCrunch, the U.S. Supreme Court âruled that a police officer who searched a license plate database for an acquaintance in exchange for cash did not violate U.S. hacking lawsâ in a âlandmark ruling [that] concludes a long-running case that clarifies the controversial Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or CFAA.â</li>
<li>In terms of legal news and tech, itâs nice to have some good news.</li>
<li>And, finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/blackstone-acquires-tech-publisher-idg-for-1-3b-as-private-equity-strikes-again/"><strong>Blackstone is buying IDG</strong></a><strong>:</strong> While your humble TechCrunchers are somewhat sensitive to the idea of private equity buying media properties, the Blackstone-IDG deal is yet another example of the trend.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In April, Medium CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/ev">Ev Williams</a> wrote a memo to his staff about the companyâs shifting culture in the wake of a challenging year.</p>
<p>âA healthy culture brings out the best in people,â he wrote. âThey feel psychologically safe voicing their ideas and engaging in debate to find the best answer to any question â knowing that their coworkers are assuming good intent and giving them the benefit of the doubt because they give that in return.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few paragraphs later, Williams wrote that while counterperspectives and unpopular opinions are âalways encouragedâ to help make decisions, ârepeated interactions that are nonconstructive, cast doubt, assume bad intent, make unsubstantiated accusations, or otherwise do not contribute to a positive environment have a massive negative impact on the team and working environment.â</p>
<p>He added: âThese behaviors are not tolerated.â</p>
<p>The internal memo, obtained and verified by TechCrunch, was published nearly one month after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307415/medium-union-effort-stalls-one-vote-short-majority-cwa">Medium staffâs unionization attempt failed to pass</a>, and roughly one week after Williams announced <a href="https://ev.medium.com/medium-editorial-team-update-8679bcb9fe81">a pivot of the company&#8217;s editorial ambitions</a> to focus less on in-house content and more on user-generated work.</p>
<p>Mediumâs editorial team got voluntary payouts as part of the shift, with VP of Editorial Siobhan OâConnor and the entire staff of GEN Magazine stepping away.</p>
<p>However, several current and former employees told TechCrunch that they believe Mediumâs mass exodus is tied more to Williamsâ manifesto, dubbed &#8220;the culture memo,&#8221; than a pivot in editorial focus. Since the memo was published, many non-editorial staffers â who would presumably not be impacted by a shift in content priorities â have left the company, including product managers, several designers and dozens of engineers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="k0BgkZ44Mi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/the-future-of-gig-work-could-involve-unions-and-co-ops/">The future of gig work could involve unions and co-ops</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The future of gig work could involve unions and co-ops&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/the-future-of-gig-work-could-involve-unions-and-co-ops/embed/#?secret=k0BgkZ44Mi" data-secret="k0BgkZ44Mi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Those departing allege that Williams is trying to perform yet another reset of company strategy, at the cost of its most diverse talent. One pull of internal data that includes engineers, editorial staff, the product team, and a portion of its HR and finance team, suggests that, of the 241 people who started the year at Medium, some 50% of that pool are now gone. Medium, which has hired employees to fill some vacancies, denied these metrics, stating that it currently has 179 employees.</p>
<p>Medium said that 52% of departures were white, and that one third of the company is non-white and non-Asian. The first engineer that TechCrunch spoke to said that minorities are overrepresented in the departures at the company.Â They also added that, when they joined Medium, there were three transgender engineers. All have since left.</p>
<h2>&#8220;A beloved dictator vibe&#8221;</h2>
<p>In February, a number of Medium employees â led by the editorial staff â <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278684/medium-union-unionizing-communications-workers-america">announced plans to organize into a union</a>. The unionization effort was eventually defeated after falling short by one vote, a shortfall that some employees think was due to Medium executives pressuring staff to vote against the union.</p>
<p>The month after the unionization effort failed, Medium announced an editorial pivot. The company offered new positions or voluntary payouts for editorial staff. A number of employees left, which is not uncommon in the aftermath of a tense time period such as a failed unionization and the offer of a clear, financially safe route out.</p>
<p>In April, Williams posted the culture memo outlining his view on the companyâs purpose and operating principles. In the memo, he writes that âthere is no growth without risk-taking and no risk-taking without occasional failureâ and that âfeedback is a gift, and even tough feedback can and should be delivered with empathy and grace.â The CEO also noted the company&#8217;s commitment to diversity, and how adapting to âopportunities or threats is a prerequisite for winning.â</p>
<p>Notably, Medium has gone through a number of editorial strategy changes, dipping in and out of subscriptions, in-house content, and now, leaning on user-generated content and paid commissions.</p>
<p>âTeam changes, strategy changes and reorganizations are inevitable. Each personâs adaptivity is a core strength of the company,â the memo reads.</p>
<p>The memo doesnât explicitly address the unionization attempt, but does talk about how Medium will not tolerate ârepeated interactions that are nonconstructive, cast doubt, assume bad intent, make unsubstantiated accusations, or otherwise do not contribute to a positive environment [but] have a massive negative impact on the team and working environment.â</p>
<p>Employees that we spoke to think that Williamsâ memo, while internal rather than publicly posted, is reminiscent of statements put out by <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804">Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong</a> and <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5">Basecamp CEO Jason Fried,</a> which both banned political discussion at work due to its incendiary or &#8220;distracting&#8221; nature. While the Medium memo doesnât wholly ban politics, the first engineer said that the âundertoneâ of the statement creates a ânot safe work environment.â Frustrated employees created a side-Slack to talk about issues at Medium.</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, Medium said that &#8220;many employees said they appreciated the clarity and there were directors and managers involved in shaping it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The month of the memo, churn tripled at the company compared to the month prior and was 30 times higher than the January metric, using an internal data set obtained by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The second engineer that spoke to TechCrunch left the company last month and said that the memo didnât have anything âegregiousâ at first glance.</p>
<p>âIt was more of a beloved dictator vibe, of like, your words are vague enough that theyâre not enforceable on anything else, and it looks good on paper,â they said. âIf you just saw that memo and nothing else, itâs not a Coinbase memo, itâs not a Basecamp memo.â</p>
<p>But, given the timing of the memo, the engineer said their interpretation of Williamsâ message was clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Medium wants] to enforce good vibes and shut down anything that is questioning &#8216;the mission,&#8217;â they said.</p>
<h2><strong>Medium&#8217;s extremeÂ </strong></h2>
<p>The same engineer thinks that âvery few people left because of the editorial pivot.â Instead, the engineer explained a history of problematic issues at Medium, with a wave of departures that seem to be clearly triggered by the memo.</p>
<p>In July 2019, for example, Medium chose to publish a series that included <a href="https://gen.medium.com/singer-joy-villa-on-the-risks-and-rewards-of-going-maga-c1078c4ba7b9">a profile</a> of Trump supporter Joy Villa with the headline âI have never been as prosecuted for being Black or Latina as I have been for supporting Trump.â</p>
<p>When the Latinx community at Medium spoke to leadership about discomfort in the headline, they claimed that executives from editorial didnât do anything about the headline until it was mentioned in a public Slack channel. One editor asked anyone who had gone through the immigration process or was a part of the Latinx community to get in a room and explain their side, a moment that felt diminishing to this employee. The headline only changed when employees posted in a public Slack channel about their qualms.</p>
<p>âThey think caring is enough,â the employee said. âAnd that listening is merciful and really caring, and therefore theyâre really shocked when that is not enough.â</p>
<p>The third engineer who spoke to TechCrunch joined the company in 2019 because they were looking for a mission-driven company impacting more than just tech. They realized Medium had âdeeper issuesâ during the Black Lives Matter movement last summer.</p>
<p>âThere were deeper issues that I just hadn&#8217;t heard about because I wasn&#8217;t part of them. That just kind of got slid under the rug,â they said, such as the Trump supporter profile. The former employee explained how they learned that HR had ignored a report of an employee saying the N-word during that time, too. Medium said this is false.</p>
<p>âI don&#8217;t feel like I needed the memo to really understand their true colors,â they said.</p>
<p>After The Verge and Platformer published a report on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22349175/medium-layoffs-union-evan-williams-blogger-twitter-subscription">Mediumâs messy culture and chaotic editorial strategy</a>, the second engineer said that multiple employees who were assumed to be tied to the story were pressured to resign.</p>
<p>âThe way I see it, they fought dirty to defeat the union,â the first engineer said. âBut it wasn&#8217;t a total success because all of these people have decided to leave in the wake of the decision, and that&#8217;s the cost. The people who are left basically feel like they have to nod and smile because Medium has made it clear that they donât want you to bring your full self to work.â</p>
<p>The engineer said that Mediumâs culture of reckoning is different from Coinbase because of the mission-oriented promise of the former.</p>
<p>âSome companies, like Coinbase, have said that âwe want people who are not going to bring politics and social issues to work,â so if you join Coinbase, thatâs what you are expecting, and thatâs fine,â they said. âBut Medium specifically recruited people who care about the world, and justice, and believe in the freedom of speech and transparency.â</p>
<p>The engineer plans to officially resign soon and already has interviews lined up.</p>
<p>âItâs a good job market out there for software engineers, so why would I work for a company that is treating their own people unfairly?â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you didnât want to shell out $9.99 per month to watch the meme-worthy iCarly reboot, now you wonât have to. On Monday, Paramount+ will launch its ad-supported Essential Plan, priced at $4.99 per month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This less expensive plan will replace the CBS All Access plan, which included commercials, but also granted access to local CBS stations. If youâre currently subscribed to that $5.99 per month plan, you can keep it. But starting Monday, it wonât be around anymore for new subscribers.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes the Essential Plan different from CBS All Access? Subscribers on the new tier will get access to Marquee Sports (including games in the NFL, UEFA Champions and Europa Leagues), breaking news on CBSN, and all of Paramountâs on-demand shows and movies. This includes offerings from ViacomCBS-owned channels like BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, the Smithsonian Channel and more. But, local live CBS station programming will no longer be included. So, if thatâs a deal-breaker, you might want to subscribe to CBS All Access this weekend.Â </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The existing Premium Plan ($9.99 per month) removes commercials and adds support for 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision. Like other streaming services, only Premium subscribers will have access to mobile downloads.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both plans include access to parental controls and up to six individual profiles. The service doesnât have a watch list at this time. But that has become a baseline feature for being competitive in this space, so itâs not a matter of if, but when.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For comparison, the basic Netflix plan costs $8.99 per month, but only lets you watch on one screen at a time. That makes it harder to share an account with family or friends. Their standard tier is $13.99, making it a bit pricier than Paramount+.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/hbo-max-launches-ad-supported-subscription-for-9-99-per-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HBO Max unveiled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their own lower-cost, ad-supported subscription tier, priced at $9.99 per month. The WarnerMedia-Discovery merger could also have major implications for the popular streaming service, though how that shakes out in terms of content libraries, or even possibly a combined streaming app, remains to be seen.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, consumers will make their decisions about which services to pay for based on a variety of key factors including content, pricing and user experience. On the content front, Paramount+ plans to announce a slate of big-name titles when the new plan goes live on Monday, in hopes of wooing new subscribers. But the low-cost plan may also appeal to those who donât necessarily care about top movies â they just want an affordable add-on to their current streaming lineup that provides them with access to some of the programs Netflix lacks.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paramount+ owner ViacomCBS said it added </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/viacomcbs-paramount-plus-streaming-q1-6-million-subscribers-wall-street-1234750834/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 million global streaming subscribers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across their Paramount+, Showtime OTT and BET+ services in Q1, to end the quarter with 36 million global users. Most of those come from Paramount+.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The fundraising continues apace in the go-go world of venture capital. Today, it&#8217;s<a href="https://luxcapital.com/"> Lux Capital </a>&#8212; known for its frontier investing &#8212; that has closed a $675 million early-stage venture fund and an $800 million growth-stage fund from its existing LPs, including many of the foundations, endowments and family offices that have backed the firm from its start in 2000.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to appreciate why they would re-up. Over the last 12 months alone, a dozen of Lux&#8217;s portfolio companies have either been acquired, gone public or announced plans to go public, either via a SPAC or the good-old-fashioned way. Among them is Zoox, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amazon-to-acquire-autonomous-driving-startup-zoox/">bought by Amazon</a> last year; Desktop Metal, which <a href="https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/desktop-metal-completes-trine-merger-and-goes-live-on-new-york-stock-exchange-181051/">went public</a> by merging with a blank-check company last December; and Shapeways, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/shapeways-agrees-spac-merger-with-galileo-go-public-2021-04-28/">agreed in April to merge</a> with a blank-check company.</p>
<p>The most recent of Lux&#8217;s portfolio companies to announce a SPAC deal is Bright Machines, a manufacturing software company that two weeks ago <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bright-machines-nears-spac-deal-to-go-public-11621200629">announced a merger</a> with a publicly traded shell company. (Lux also raised its own <a href="https://medium.com/lux-capital/announcing-lux-health-tech-acquisition-corp-2f02fa4b39ba">$345 million blank-check company</a> last fall, one that has yet to identify a target.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, even a firm with Lux&#8217;s track record isn&#8217;t immune to competition in a crowded market. That&#8217;s partly why Lux &#8212; whose last two funds closed with a collective <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/lux-capital-just-closed-on-a-whopping-1-billion-in-capital-doubling-the-amount-of-money-it-manages/">$1 billion</a> in August 2019 &#8212; has incubated more than a dozen companies of its own, says the firm&#8217;s co-founder, Peter Hebert, who talked with us yesterday from Menlo Park about that approach, along with whether and when he sees a correction coming. Some of that conversation is excerpted below, edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What size checks will you be writing from these new funds?</strong></p>
<p>PH: The median investment in this current early-stage fund will be about $25 million over the life of [each] investment, and that could range from $100,000 to something like $50 million. With our opportunity vehicle, that can be up to a $100 million check and also larger, but I would expect there to be at least one investment in that range.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And the opportunity fund can back companies inside of the portfolio or outside it?</strong></p>
<p>PH: That&#8217;s right. I would expect that the majority will be companies where we were an early-stage lead investor, but that there&#8217;s no requirement that it&#8217;s exclusively Lux-seeded or Series A-backed companies that receive investment. There&#8217;ve been a handful of companies we&#8217;ve backed in the past [that weren&#8217;t earlier bets] including (the liquid biopsy company) Thrive Earlier Detection [which was <a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/exact-sciences-to-acquire-thrive-earlier-detection-becoming-a-leader-in-blood-based-multi-cancer-screening/">acquired</a> soon after], (contract management software maker) IronClad [backed<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ironclad-raises-100-million-series-d-funding-round-to-scale-the-new-standard-for-business-contracts-301208177.html"> earlier this year</a>], and (the at-home health testing company) Everly Health [which Lux <a href="https://luxcapital.com/news/at-home-health-testing-company-everlywell-raises-175-million-series-d-round-at-a-1-3-billion-valuation/">first funded</a> in December].</p>
<p><strong>TC: What startup in your portfolio right now has received the most funding from Lux?</strong></p>
<p>PH: I guess that would be Applied Intuition (which makes simulation software and infrastructure tools to test and validate autonomous vehicles at scale).</p>
<p><strong>TC: How much do you look to own?</strong></p>
<p>PH: Generally, where we are coming in as the lead institutional investor in a Series A, it&#8217;s 20% to 25%, and that can be higher or lower. In many cases, we will create companies from scratch and more often those can be as high as 50%.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I didn&#8217;t realize that incubating companies was a big part of Lux&#8217;s business.</strong></p>
<p>PH: Yeah, for us, one of the most successful of our investments was a company called Kurion that was a pioneer in nuclear waste remediation that we created based largely on the vision of my co-founder, Josh Wolfe, and his view on the future of alternative energy. We recruited all these great folks out of MIT&#8217;s material science department and built that and owned north of 30% when it was <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/veolia-acquires-nuclear-waste-specialist-kurion-for-350m">acquired</a> by a French waste water company, Veolia, for $400 million in 2016 &#8212; and that [was part of a] $100 million fund.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How active are you on this front right now? Given how heated pricing is out there, I&#8217;d think it&#8217;s a good time to be starting companies in-house.</strong></p>
<p>PH: In the last two to three years, we&#8217;ve been most active in new [company] formation for exactly [those] reasons. It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re just a factory [looking to] churn things out. Inspiration is the starting point. But whether it&#8217;s a market opportunity that we assess, or whether it&#8217;s interesting science and tech that needs a catalyst to get things off the ground, we&#8217;re happy to play that role.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What do you think of what&#8217;s happening in terms of the feverish pace of fundings and how quickly companies&#8217; valuations are soaring? It seems nuts, but it&#8217;s also hard to imagine it ending anytime soon.</strong></p>
<p>PH: I think we&#8217;re uncomfortably optimistic. Structurally, [I&#8217;m optimistic] because the way that science and technology are funded today is so changed. When I got into business in the late &#8217;90s, the venture industry was small, it was provincial, it was people on Sand Hill Road who wouldn&#8217;t talk with anyone who was beyond 10 miles of their office. People were proud to know nothing about the financial markets because there was little connectivity in terms of their impact on [what VCs were doing].</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s global and while some might say the market is frothy, [all that capital is] allowing companies that are really ambitious and that require capital that otherwise might not have [materialized] to [gain momentum], and from the perspective of scientific advancement and technological progress, this is good.</p>
<p>There will certainly be experimentation, people will lose money, there will be hundreds of companies funded and most of them wash out. But there&#8217;s going to be a lot of lasting transformative change that comes out of all of this.</p>

		Henry Shapiro is the co-founder of <a href="http://www.reclaim.ai/">Reclaim.ai,</a> an intelligent calendar assistant platform used daily by over 4,000 companies. Prior to founding Reclaim, Henry led product and marketing at New Relic. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It was August 2019, and the fundraising process was not going well.</p>
<p>My co-founder and I had left our product management jobs at New Relic several months prior, deciding to finally plunge into building <a href="http://reclaim.ai">Reclaim</a> after nearly a year of late nights and weekends spent prototyping and iterating on ideas. We had bits and pieces of a product, but the majority of it was what we might call âslideware.â</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			When you canât raise big on the vision, you need to raise big on the proof. And the proof comes from building, learning, iterating and getting traction with your first few hundred users.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When we spoke to many other founders, they all told us the same thing: Go raise, raise big, and raise now. So we did that, even though we were puzzled as to why anyone would give us money with little more than a slide deck to our names. We spent nearly three months pitching dozens of VCs, hoping to raise $3 million to $4 million in a seed round to hire our founding team and build the product out.</p>
<p>Initially, we were excited. There was lots of inbound interest, and we were starting to hear a lot of crazy numbers getting thrown around by a lot of Important People. We thought for sure we were maybe a week away from term sheets. We <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG_wClmLUh8">celebrated preemptively</a>. How could it possibly be this easy?</p>
<p>Then in July, almost in an instant, everything started to dry up. The verbal offers for term sheets didnât materialize into real offers. We had term sheets, but they were from investors that didnât seem to care much about what we were building or what problems we wanted to solve. We quickly realized that we hadnât really built momentum around the <em>product </em>or the<em> vision</em>, but were instead caught up in what we later learned to be âdeal flow.â</p>
<p>Basically, investors were interested because <em>other</em> investors were interested. And once enough of them werenât, nobody was.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as I write this today, Reclaim has raised a total of $6.3 million on great terms <a href="http://reclaim.ai/about">across a group of incredible investors and partners</a>. But it wasnât easy, and it required us to embrace our failure and learn three important lessons that I believe every founder should consider before they decide to go out and pitch investors.</p>
<h2>Lesson 1: Build big before you raise big</h2>
<p>In 2019, we were hunting for what some referred to as a â<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/seed-stage-funding-deal-trends-2020-12">mango seed</a>â &#8212; that is, a seed round that was large enough that it was perceptibly closer to a light Series A financing. Being pre-product at the time, we had to lean on our experience and our vision to drive conviction and urgency among investors. Unfortunately, it just wasnât enough. Investors either felt that our experience was a bad fit for the space we were entering (productivity/scheduling) or that our vision wasnât compelling enough to merit investment on the terms we wanted.</p>
<p>When we did get offers, they involved swallowing some pretty bitter pills: We would be forced to take bad terms that were overly dilutive (at least from our perspective), work with an investor who we didnât think had high conviction in our product strategy, or relinquish control in the company from an extremely early stage. None of these seemed like good options.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin, the Ford-owned micromobility operator, has added a new CEO, launched a new strategy to capture market share and announced a plan to get back into bike share, although this time with an electric twist.Â </span></p>
<p>The flurry of moves suggest that Spin is still trying to figure out the best path forward to push past its rivals and become profitable. Under the changes announced Thursday, <span style="font-weight: 400;">co-founder and CEO Derrick Ko is moving to a strategic advisory role, along with the other two co-founders Zaizhuang Cheng and Euwyn Poon. In Koâs place is Ben Bear, who previously served as CBO of Spin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside the change in leadership, Spin is deploying e-bikes for the first time, expanding to multiple cities in the U.S. and Europe, implementing new technologies and coming for Bird as the Number Two e-scooter company in the country (behind Lime, of course).Â </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pressure among micromobility operators to actually turn a profit is increasing, so Spin is flexing its compliance record in order to secure those limited vendor permits. The end game is to angle for more exclusive, and perhaps more lucrative, partnerships with cities. Amid all this activity are </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/ford-is-said-to-weigh-exit-of-electric-scooter-unit-spin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Ford might be divesting Spin into a separate company, including a sale or spinoff of the subsidiary. Which leads us to wonder in which direction the new CEO will be steering this ship.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWeâre full speed ahead on the hiring front, and weâve got ambitious growth plans for this year, heading into 2022 and beyond,â Bear told TechCrunch. âWe really think the market is reaching a tipping point where cities are more and more moving towards limited vendor permits, which is right where weâre focused and have been focused throughout our history.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Spin would not comment on the reports of Ford divesting the e-scooter company.)Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most cities have evolved from an unregulated market to an open one, and many, like Atlanta and Washington, D.C., are operating limited vendor permits. Spin is counting on this trend continuing to exclusive vendor permits, similar to the deal Lyft-owned Citi Bike has made with New York City. This might mean going after mid-tier cities that charge Spin less in fees, or even pay them to operate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âIn Bakersfield, we recently received a $1.1 million state grant to install infrastructure and conduct the program, and then $257,000 from the city as well to make sure that the project was supported, and that we&#8217;re able to offer low-cost rides to residents who need that,â said Bear.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Grand Rapids, Spin is working with nonprofits to deliver scooters as an addition to public transportation, and in Pittsburgh, the company has integrated with the public transit app to make different types of mobility as frictionless as possible.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWe definitely see ourselves as part of that broader ecosystem, which includes public transit,â said Bear.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin claims that its win rate on new markets in the U.S. is 85% and its renewal rate is 93%. However, the company has lost a few big permit awards, including New York City and Paris. Of its nearly 100 markets in the U.S., a large majority are made up of mid-tier cities and college campuses. Spin says it will be in up to 25 additional U.S. markets through the rest of the year, with plans to expand to Portugal and Ireland, as well.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of Spinâs nearly 100 markets in the U.S. and Europe, over 70% are limited vendor exclusive, according to Bear. He says Spinâs reputation of ensuring safety, compliance and equitable service for residents makes it a trusted city partner. But if it wants to monopolize the micromobility of cities, it has to provide a multi-modal fleet. Enter electric bikes.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin also announced plans to roll out up to 5,000 e-bikes on the streets this year, starting with Providence, Rhode Island on June 14. It will also bring e-bikes, as well as e-scooters, to recently won markets like Fort Collins, Colorado; Bakersfield, California; and Penn State University &#8212; all of which are exclusive partnerships.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin was founded as a pedal bike share in 2017, but pivoted to e-scooters the following year. Of the major micromobility companies, Spin is a bit late to the e-bike party. Bear says the company wanted to delay bringing e-bikes to market until the form factor had developed enough to be as compelling as its scooters. This prudence could just as well hurt the success of its e-bike program if Spin isnât bringing something as good as an e-bike thatâs already been through multiple iterations of deployed field use. First-generation hardware is rarely, if ever, perfect out the gate. And since Spin hasnât run a fleet of e-bikes yet, it might not be the smoothest management transition.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, e-bikes arenât the only iron in Spinâs fire. True to its promise of being what cities want a micromobility operator to be, Spin is thinking strategically about technological add-ons. For example, Spin has partnered with computer vision startup Drover AI to launch its </span><a href="https://blog.spin.pm/spin-insight-building-adas-for-micromobility-98a3d88aa976"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin Insight Level 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or a bundle of sensors, cameras and on-board computing power to detect sidewalk and bike lane riding and validate parking. Spin launched this new capability for the first time on Wednesday, deploying 100 Drover-tech equipped e-scooters in Milwaukee with plans to launch in Miami, Seattle and Santa Monica, as well. Last month, </span><a href="https://dot.la/bird-app-santa-monica-ca-2653017433.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird was booted by the Santa Monica City Council </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in favor of Spin, Veo and Lyft and will have to remove all of its scooters from its own hometown by July.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle and Santa Monica, along with Boise, Idaho, will also be seeing some of Spinâs new tech in the form of the S-200, a three-wheeled adaptive sit-down scooter. The vehicle is built in tandem with mobility startup Tortoise, whose repositioning software allows remote operators to move vehicles off sidewalks and into proper parking spots, as well as rebalance them.Â </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has selected 30 startups to receive a share of its $2 million Black Founders Fund in Europe, providing these companies with a spot of cash, some valuable cloud services and a bit of good old-fashioned networking among the Google crew.</p>
<p>The fund was announced last fall as part of a company-wide effort toward &#8220;building a more equitable future for everyone,&#8221; alongside grants and new sponsorships. More than 800 companies applied and Google interviewed 100 of them, ultimately <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/entrepreneurs/funding-europe-black-founders-fund/">winnowing that down to the 30 announced today</a>.</p>
<p>Each company will receive &#8220;up to&#8221; $100,000 in non-dilutive funding, and up to $120,000 in Ads grants and $100,000 in Cloud credits. (I&#8217;ve asked Google for more details on how the fund was divided, and if any company received this full amount. I&#8217;ll update if I hear back.)</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BmyxVnRiVVg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>They&#8217;ll also get access to Google&#8217;s entrepreneurial network, tech support and some other assets that don&#8217;t have hard numbers associated with them.</p>
<p>All the startups are led by Black founders, and 40% by women of color. One of the latter is Nancy de Fays, co-founder of <a href="https://linedock.co/">LINE</a>, which makes these cool <a href="https://linedock.co/products/macbook-16in-docking-station">battery-hub combos</a> for the MacBook &#8220;Pro&#8221; that add a ton of ports and battery life and look sweet to boot. I&#8217;ve learned a lot chatting with her at trade shows, and regret that I do most of my work at a desktop so I don&#8217;t have an excuse to use one of the company&#8217;s gadgets.</p>
<p>In response to being selected for Google funding, de Fays <a href="https://linedock.co/blogs/news/black-founders-fund">penned a blog post</a> exhorting corporations to throw their weight around in favor of social change, and for startups to lead the way in diversity and equity:</p>
<blockquote><p>We buy values and standards more than we buy the product itself. We buy ideals of life more than the actual features. Putting the these two parameters in the equation &#8211; the capability of big corps to shout loud, and consumers&#8217; receptiveness to brands values and messages &#8211; it does make sense to me that to drive such a society change, big companies should voice and convey strong messages.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Founders need to build diverse teams without falling into compassion fatigue. They must show empathy and respect and bring onboard the best talents. Period. They need to be outspoken about their values, convey a strong, global mindset and build their organisation around them. And if they find themselves scoring low on diversity along the way, they should question themselves on the why and act on it without doing charity.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s something of a counterpoint to the idea, also commonly expressed these days, that companies should be mission-focused and objective.</p>
<p>Here are the other 29 companies that Google will be giving a boost to (descriptions taken from the blog post):</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo One, the ride-hailing service that uses driverless vehicles in the suburbs of Phoenix, can now be accessed and booked through Google Maps.</p>
<p>This will be the first fully autonomous ride-hailing option available in the app, which will roll out first to Android users, Waymo said Thursday. The team-up not only brings together two Alphabet companies, it signals Waymo&#8217;s push to become more visible and accessible to the public.</p>
<p>Waymo has abut 600 vehicles in its U.S. fleet. About 300 to 400 of those are in the Phoenix area, but not all of those are used in the driverless Waymo One fleet. The Waymo One service only uses driverless vehicles, which means that a safety operator is not physically behind the wheel. It also means that if it pops up on Google Maps, users can be assured that it will indeed be driverless. Some vehicles in the Phoenix area are used for testing. Waymo doesn&#8217;t share exact numbers of how many driverless vehicles it operates as part of the service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Waymo One is now in <a href="https://twitter.com/googlemaps?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GoogleMaps</a>. Tap the ride-hailing option when youâre in the Metro Phoenix area, then hail a fully autonomous ride powered by the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WaymoDriver?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WaymoDriver</a>! <a href="https://t.co/ZTxv5IXdzS">pic.twitter.com/ZTxv5IXdzS</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The process still requires a bit of app hopping. There isn&#8217;t a direct way to access, book and pay for the Waymo One rides in Google Maps. Instead, the user is brought over to the Waymo app to complete the booking. Users first have to input directions to or from a location in Waymo&#8217;s Metro Phoenix territory, which includes parts of Chandler, Mesa and Tempe, from an Android device. Once the user taps on the ridesharing or transit tab, they will see the estimated price and ETA of their trip with Waymo.</p>
<p>Existing Waymo One riders will be directed to the Waymo app to book the ride, while newcomers will be taken to the PlayStore to download it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceXâs Dragon capsule is once again heading to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The company launched its 22nd Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) mission for NASA on Thursday. This is the fifth capsule SpaceX has sent to ISS in the last 12 months, SpaceX director of Dragon mission management Sarah Walker noted in a media briefing Tuesday. Itâs also the first launch of the year on a new Falcon 9 rocket booster.</p>
<p>The rocket took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 1:29 PM eastern time, right on schedule despite the threat of storm clouds from the south and east. The first stage separated as planned<strong>Â </strong>and touched down onÂ the âOf Course I Still Love Youâ droneship in the Atlantic Ocean eight minutes after launch. The second stage, which takes the capsule to orbit, separated 12 minutes after launch, also right on schedule.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2161051" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/crs-22-landing.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161051" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2161051" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/crs-22-landing.gif" alt="" width="750" height="422" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2161051" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SpaceX</p></div></p>
<p>The Falcon 9 Rocket launch vehicle is sending more than 7,300 pounds of research materials, supplies and hardware, including new solar arrays, to the ISS crew. Itâs the second mission under SpaceXâs new CRS contract with NASA; the first took place <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/06/spacex-launches-new-cargo-dragon-to-space-station-for-100th-successful-falcon-9-flight/">last December</a>.</p>
<p>Dragon is carrying a number of research experiments to be conducted on the ISS, including oral bacteria to test germ growth with Colgate toothpaste; a number of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorer/Investigation.html?#id=7672">tardigrades</a> (also affectionately called water bears), primordial organisms that will attempt to fare and reproduce in space environments; and an investigation that will study the effects of microgravity on the formation of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorer/Investigation.html?#id=8439">kidney stones</a> &#8212; an ailment that many crew members display an increased susceptibility to during spaceflight.</p>
<p>The capsule is also delivering fresh food, including apples, navel oranges, lemons and avocados.</p>

<p>Of the over 7,300 pounds of cargo, around 3,000 pounds will be taken up by a new roll-out, &#8220;flex blanket&#8221; solar array developed by space infrastructure company Redwire. As opposed to more traditional rigid paneled solar arrays, flex blanket technology provides more mass and performance benefits, Redwire technical director Matt LaPointe told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The arrays were placed in the Dragon&#8217;s unpressurized trunk. It&#8217;s the first of three missions to send iROSA solar arrays to the station, with each mission carrying two arrays, LaPointe said. Once installed, the six iROSA arrays will collectively produce over 120KW of power. Redwire, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/acquisition-happy-space-infrastructure-company-redwire-set-to-go-public-via-spac/">announced in March</a> that it would go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, says the new iROSA arrays will improve the ISSâs power generation by 20-30%.</p>
<p>The Dragon capsule is set to arrive at the space station at around 5 AM on June 5, where it will autonomously dock on a port of the Harmony module of the ISS. It will spend more than a month with the station before splashing down in the Atlantic with research and return cargo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Supreme Court has ruled that a police officer who searched a license plate database for an acquaintance in exchange for cash did not violate U.S. hacking laws.</p>
<p>The landmark ruling concludes a long-running case that clarifies the controversial Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or CFAA, by putting limits on what kind of conduct can be prosecuted.</p>
<p>The court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-783_k53l.pdf">ruled 6-3 in favor</a> of Nathan Van Buren, a former Georgia police sergeant who brought the case. Van Buren was prosecuted on two counts, one for accepting a kickback for accessing the database as a serving police officer, and another for violating the CFAA. His first conviction was overturned, but the CFAA conviction was upheld â until today.</p>
<p>Although Van Buren was allowed to access the license plate database, the legal question became whether or not he had exceeded his authorized access.</p>
<p>In the ruling, the Supreme Court said that the CFAA &#8220;covers those who obtain information from particular areas in the computer â such as files, folders, or databases â to which their computer access does not extend,&#8221; and that while Van Buren &#8220;plainly flouted&#8221; the police department&#8217;s rules for law enforcement purposes, he did not violate the CFAA, wrote Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who wrote the majority opinion.</p>
<p>The CFAA was signed into law in 1986 to prosecute hackers who gain &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; access to a computer or network. But courts have been split on what &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; means. Legal experts have argued that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/supreme-court-van-buren-hacking/">a broad reading</a> of the law could criminalize violating a site&#8217;s terms of service, such as lying on a dating profile or sharing a password to a streaming service. The court said that the government&#8217;s interpretation of the law &#8220;would attach criminal penalties to a breathtaking amount of commonplace computer activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not all the justices agreed. &#8220;Without valid law enforcement purposes, he was forbidden to use the computer to obtain that information,&#8221; wrote Justice Thomas, who filed a dissenting opinion along with Justice Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>
<p>Civil liberties experts said Congress should act to amend the CFAA following the court&#8217;s ruling.</p>
<p>âThis is an important and welcome decision that will help protect digital research and journalism that is urgently necessary. But more is needed,&#8221; said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute. &#8220;Congress should amend the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to eliminate any remaining uncertainty about the scope of the statute. It should also create a safe harbor for researchers and journalists who are working to study disinformation and discrimination online. Major technology companies should not have a veto over research and journalism that are manifestly in the public interest.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been a busy week for private equity, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/cloudera-to-go-private-as-kkr-cdr-grab-it-for-5-3b/">Cloudera</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/stack-overflow-acquired-by-prosus-for-a-reported-1-8-billion/">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fireeye-to-sell-products-unit-for-1-2b-to-symphony-led-group/">FireEye</a> coming off the board on Tuesday and Wednesday. Today Blackstone bought media and data company IDG for $1.3 billion. The company had been owned by Oriental Rainbow, LLC, a subsidiary of China Oceanwide Holdings Group, Co. Ltd.</p>
<p>With IDG, Blackstone gets tech analyst firm IDC along with a collection of tech publications that includes CIO, Computerworld, InfoWorld, Macworld, Network World, PCWorld and Tech Hive. The media publishing arm was once a powerhouse in the 1990s tech publishing world, although its shine has faded in recent years as the publishing industry in general has come under intense pressure.</p>
<p>The company has also been making some additions to the platform more recently with a stronger focus on data and analytics. Last year <a href="https://www.demandgenreport.com/features/news-briefs/idg-agrees-to-acquire-triblio-fusing-martech-with-b2b-media/">it bought Triblio</a>, a marketing data platform to help companies deliver more personalized customer experiences. Last month <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47694321">it acquired Metri</a>, an IT pricing service, which can help with IT budgeting and procurement. The latter could dovetail nicely with IDC&#8217;s consulting services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Company CEO Mohamad Ali is hoping that Blackstone can infuse more capital into the company to keep building on its software services with a data focus. &#8220;Additional capital investment from Blackstone will allow us to cultivate our rich history of innovation and accelerate our product roadmaps to bring our customers the deeper insights and data they need to succeed in todayâs rapidly evolving digital economy,&#8221; Ali said in a statement.</p>
<p>That sounds like he wants to increase his data bet. It seems that the data side of the business was particularly attractive to Blackstone as well. &#8220;The high-quality data, analytics and insights IDG delivers to technology leaders are only becoming more critical as the pace of growth and innovation accelerates,&#8221; Peter Wallace, Global Head of Core Private Equity at Blackstone said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company launched in 1964 with the consulting side of the business, but founder Pat McGovern had a broader vision and began the publishing side of the company in 1967 with the launch of Computerworld. The publishing business actually grew to become an integral part of the rise of the PC and the technology shift that occurred at a personal and business level in the 80s and 90s. It&#8217;s unclear what this deal will mean for the publishing side of the house or where that would even fit as it continues the push to focus on data and analytics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Verizon Media, which owns this publication along with Engadget, was also<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/"> recently sold to a private equity firm</a>, Apollo Global, as the private equity push into all parts of the technology ecosystem continues.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hormones are key to solving many health conditions that disproportionately impact women, from diabetes to infertility to mental health challenges.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gaslighting is a form of psychological abuse, but <a href="https://twitter.com/sequinlabcoat">Elizabeth Ruzzo</a> says she experienced it firsthand after telling a doctor that she suffered from suicidal ideation after taking birth control pills.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Hormonal health sits at the center of conversations around personalized medicine and womenâs health: By 2025, womenâs health could be a $50 billion industry, and by 2026, digital health more broadly is estimated to hit $221 billion.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Ruzzoâs doctor told her there was no connection between birth control and self-harm, but she decided to stop taking the pill to see if her mental health improved. When it did, Ruzzo grasped the disconnect between womenâs unique hormonal makeup and blanket-statement practices from medicine today.</p>
<p>Her realization led her to found <a href="https://www.adyn.com/">Adyn Health</a>, a startup that proactively helps women make health decisions that complement their hormonal state and background. The company started with, of course, helping people pick more personalized birth control.</p>
<p>Ruzzo is part of a group of growing entrepreneurs who are betting that hormonal health is the key wedge into the digital health boom. Hormones are fluctuating, ever-evolving and diverse &#8212; but these founders say they&#8217;re also key to solving many health conditions that disproportionately impact women, from diabetes to infertility to mental health challenges.</p>
<p>Many believe itâs that complexity that underscores the opportunity. Hormonal health sits at the center of conversations around personalized medicine and womenâs health: By 2025, <a href="https://ovsecondopinion.substack.com/p/why-were-betting-big-on-womens-health">womenâs health could be a $50 billion industry,</a> and by 2026, digital health more broadly is <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/22/2196996/0/en/Global-Digital-Health-Market-Size-Will-Grow-to-USD-220-94-Billion-by-2026-Facts-Factors.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAccording%20to%20the%20research%20report,%25%20from%202019%20to%202026%E2%80%9D.">estimated to hit $221 billion.</a></p>
<p>Still, as funding for womenâs health startups drops and stigma continues to impact where venture dollars go, it&#8217;s unclear whether the sector will remain in its infancy or hit a true inflection point.</p>
<h2>The future is proactive</h2>
<p>Ruzzo views Adyn as a precision medicine startup. Its main product is an at-home test that tracks hormone levels, assesses genetic risk for specific side effects, and then gives recommendations for which birth control methods best suits the customer with the fewest side effects.</p>
<p>By Ruzzoâs estimates, 98% of sexually active women use birth control for 30 years of their life. That sort of lifetime value proposition made the company look like a sweet deal to founders, and Adyn raised a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/creating-a-safer-birth-control-adyn-raises-2-5m-seed/">$2.5 million seed in April 2021</a>Â in a round co-led by Lux Capital and M13.</p>
<p>The moonshot, though, is using that as a way to become a trusted partner in a womanâs life, helping understand baseline hormone levels throughout those 30 years.</p>
<p>âMy hope is that we can use precision medicine approaches, including looking at genetic markers to identify reliable diagnostic criteria, that can remove that uncertainty and pain and diagnostic odyssey that people have to go through,â Ruzzo said.</p>
<p>If Adyn becomes a trusted partner with teenage women, it could reach a point where it can detect changes in hormone levels over time.</p>
<p>âThe hormone reference ranges that are used [in labs] are too broad to be personalized, let alone prescriptive,â she said. âAnd so what we&#8217;re hoping to do is correct for things that we know affect hormone levels like age, weight, ethnicity and compare you to your own expectations.â</p>
<p>If the first wave of digital health was a company like <a href="https://ro.co/">Ro</a>, which answers consumers when they have a condition such as erectile dysfunction or hair loss, the second wave will look more like Adyn, which helps consumers navigate their health <em>before</em> getting diagnosed with a condition or experiencing issues.</p>
<p>The industry standard is still to wait for consumers to realize they have a condition, and then go to the doctor to manage their symptoms or look for a cure. A new startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/veera-health-wants-to-help-women-in-india-navigate-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/">recently graduated from Y Combinator</a> is finding its way into hormonal health through that angle.</p>
<h2>One-tenth of all women are impacted by a hormonal condition</h2>
<p>Veera Health is a startup that wants to help women in India manage polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS. The hormonal condition can cause irregular periods, infertility or gestational diabetes in women, as well as acne, weight gain and excessive hair growth. Plus, PCOS is far from rare, impacting <a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome">one in 10 women</a>.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Tuesday, September 21</h2>
<p><strong>How to Raise Your First Dollars with Luciana Lixandru (Sequoia) and Rebecca Lynn (Canvas Ventures)</strong></p>
<p>Deciding how to go about getting your initial funding is always a tricky subject, as the wrong move could adversely impact your young company. In this session weâll hear from experts whoâve shepherded multiple companies from the earliest to the latest fundraises.</p>
<p><strong>How to Cultivate a Community for your Company that Actually Lasts with Alex Angel (Commsor), Katelin Holloway (776 Ventures) and Lolita Taub (The Community Fund)</strong></p>
<p>Thereâs no doubt about it: The word of the year in startupland is âcommunity.â In this panel, Community Fundâs Lolita Taub, Commsorâs Alex Angel and 776 Venturesâ Katelin Holloway will extract buzz from reality and help founders understand the growing importance of chief community officers in startup culture, and ultimately financial success, today.</p>
<p><strong>Sponsored: The Inaugural Connection I.T. Superheroes Awards Category Winners, Announced live by Jamal Khan, Chief Innovation &amp; Growth Officer of Connection</strong></p>
<p>Connection and TechCrunch have teamed up to celebrate and recognize those IT people who have gone the extra mile, with the inaugural Connection I.T. Superhero Awards. Winners of the five category awards will be announced live, presented by Connectionâs Chief Innovation &amp; Growth Officer, Jamal Khan. These awards are about people, not products, for the many out there deserving recognition for their daily efforts. We think some well-earned awards are a great place to start.</p>
<p><strong>The Subtle Challenges of Assessing Product-Market Fit with Heather Hartnett (Human Ventures), David Thacker (Greylock) and Victoria Treyger (Felicis Ventures)</strong></p>
<p>Product-market fit is the Holy Grail for founders, and the key to unlocking the next phase of a startup&#8217;s growth. Behind &#8220;product&#8221; and &#8220;market&#8221; though, there are dozens of considerations, from types of users and product offerings to marketing and pricing that determine just how strong a fit a startup has found. Join early-stage investors David Thacker of Greylock, Heather Hartnett of Human Ventures and Victoria Treyger of Felicis as they discuss the subtler challenges in finding and assessing fit.</p>
<p><strong>How to Accelerate Everything with Nik Sharma (Sharma Brands) and speakers to be announced</strong></p>
<p>In the past year, growth marketing exploded as companies doubled down on whatâs worked in the past and found new runway inside an increasingly competitive landscape. We brought together some of the best growth marketing minds across verticals to tell you how they conquered growth in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>How to Ditch Traditional Fundraising with Arun Mathew (Accel), Nicholas Tommarello (Wefunder) and Michele Romanow (Clearco)</strong></p>
<p>In 2021, venture capital has never been more plentiful, but some founders still canât break into networks or have found that traditional fundraising isnât the best route for their business. Fortunately, alternative fundraising techniques are gathering steam as founders find paths to raise cash that diverge from the startup success stories of the past.</p>
<p><strong>The Pros and Cons (but mostly pros) of a Distributed Workforce with Wendy Nice Barnes (GitLab) and speakers to be announced</strong></p>
<p>Coronavirus has changed so much, but perhaps nothing about our everyday lives has changed quite as much as the way we work. Corporations and small businesses the world over have moved to remote work, and as per usual in a time of change, startups have the advantage. Hear from founders who have cultivated fast-moving, highly productive (yet still culture-conscious) distributed workforces and how they&#8217;ve managed to do so.</p>

<h2>Wednesday, September 22</h2>

Virtual meetings, simple onboarding, product-led growth and more have upended the traditional approach to sales for enterprise companies, requiring new tactics for founders to get the kind of skyrocketing growth they desire and lock in those first customers. Join Abi Williams of Udemy and Kate Taylor of Notion as we discuss the best practices for handling sales in a re-energized 2021 economy.</p>
<p><strong>So, You Want to Go Public. Whatâs Next? with Hope Cochran (Madrona Venture Group) and Deena Shakir (Lux Capital)</strong></p>
<p>The path to your startup&#8217;s exit has grown increasingly complex in the last year. Acquisition? SPAC? Traditional IPO. Hear from seasoned tech experts about how to think about your company&#8217;s path to going public and weigh the pros and cons of the various routes.</p>

<h2>Thursday, September 23</h2>
<p><strong>How Do You Select the Right Tech Stack with Jill Wetzler (Pilot) and speakers to be announcedÂ </strong></p>
<p>From day zero, startups have to make dozens of trade-offs when it comes to the infinite variety of tech stacks available to today&#8217;s engineers. Choose the wrong combination or direction and a startup could be left with years of refactoring to fix the legacy damage. What are the best practices for assessing potential stacks, and how can you minimize the risk of a painful mistake? Top technologists will discuss strategies for improving engineering right from the beginning and at every stage of a startup&#8217;s journey.</p>
<p><strong>How to Build Brand Buzz and Generate Influence in the Creator Economy with Rachel Drori (Daily Harvest) and Julia Munslow (Yahoo News)</strong></p>
<p>Brands are the lifeblood of startups. The name, the design, the feel and the emotional connection between customers and company can determine the entire trajectory of a business. It&#8217;s a well-trodden field that&#8217;s been upended in recent years thanks to the skyrocketing growth of the influencer and creator economies. What does it mean to build a brand in today&#8217;s competitive marketplace and how can you assess success? Julia Munslow of Yahoo News and Rachel Drori of Daily Harvest will discuss how they built and reshaped brands for 2021, and what tools founders should consider today in designing a compelling brand.</p>
<p><strong>How to Use Customer Feedback and Data Analysis to Iterate Your Product with Eleanor Morgan (InVision) and Jean-Denis Greze (Plaid)</strong></p>
<p>Everyone has an opinion on product changes. Customers complain, NPS scores are calculated and internal leaders have their own vision on what comes next. Then there are all the people who are silent â including future customers who may not even know a startup exists yet. How do you find signal from all the noise and build a compelling product roadmap that properly calibrates every trade-off? Jean-Denis Greze of Plaid and Eleanor Morgan of InVision offer their perspectives as product leaders on how to keep a bold perspective in product while getting the details right.</p>
<p><strong>Pitch Deck Teardown with Maren Bannon (January Ventures), Melody Koh (NextView Ventures) and Benjamin Ling (Bling Capital)</strong></p>
<p>An articulate, alluring pitch presentation is a big part of successful fundraising, and yet it&#8217;s relatively uncommon for founders to get candid feedback on how they communicated the problem, their solution and their path to success. During the Pitch Deck Teardown, VCs will offer their live feedback on decks submitted by audience members.</p>
<p><strong>How DAOs Could Shake Up VC with David Pakman (Venrock) and speakers to be announced</strong></p>
<p>Investment in blockchain startups and tokens exploded in 2021, and some investors are blowing up the idea of a venture capital firm as they look to back more projects in the crypto world. DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, are starting to pop up more and more, turning traditional VC on its head by building investment organizations on the blockchain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://simplified.co/">Simplified</a>, a marketing-focused design software looking to take on Canva, has raised $2.2 million in seed funding led by Craft Ventures. Superhuman&#8217;s Rahul Vohra and Todd Goldberg, former Uber CPO Manik Gupta, Pelican Ventures&#8217; Ajay Yadav (also Roomie founder), Form Capital, 8Bit Capital, Early Grey Capital, GFR Fund, MyAsia VC and others participated in the round.</p>
<p>Simplified is aimed directly at marketers, who are inevitably responsible for generating an enormous amount of content across a variety of channels. The platform uses machine learning to automate as much of the content creation process as possible, including copy, imagery, format and sizing, and more.</p>
<p>For example, a marketer could be looking to post an inspirational quote on social media. They can designate that the content is meant for social media, run a search for inspirational quotes and ask the system to automatically provide an appropriate background. From there, the user can tweak whatever they&#8217;d like, like typeface or image cropping, and instantly publish.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Simplified also features collaborative tools that let teams share work and assets across the organization, as well as integrations with stock photo and video services.</p>
<p>The general principle here is to take what has already become a simplified process, through products like Canva, to the next level through machine learning and GPT3.</p>
<p>According to founder KD Deshpande, it&#8217;s all about scale. While it may be easier than ever to create a single piece of content, there is still the matter of volume. Simplified looks to speed up the process of content creation using its machine learning automation algorithms.</p>
<p>This comes in the midst of a massive evolution of the design space over the past several years, with players like InVision, Figma and Canva leading the charge in providing fresh, new design tools that meet the demands of a new generation of designers and design-oriented organizations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is updating its app to make its audio chat room feature, <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces">Twitter Spaces</a>, a central part of the user experience. Today, the company will begin to roll out to select users a dedicated tab for Twitter Spaces in the main navigation bar of its mobile app, initially on iOS. The feature will see Twitter Spaces gain the middle spot in this bar, in between the Search magnifying glass icon and the bell icon for Notifications. As Spaces is not replacing any other tab, that means the navigation bar will now have to accommodate five icons instead of only four.</p>
<p>Not everyone will see the update immediately. Instead, only around 500 people from the original Spaces beta test will first see the new Spaces discovery tab, as it&#8217;s called, when it rolls out today.</p>
<p>Twitter says the tab will showcase the Spaces being hosted by people you follow, but these won&#8217;t appear like they do on the Fleet line today at the top of the Timeline. Instead, the discovery tab will present Spaces in a more visual format, similar to the promotion cards that appear when you tweet about upcoming Spaces.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2161002" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161002" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2161002" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_1085.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2161002" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>The company told TechCrunch that, even though Spaces can be fun, it understands the live events have been hard to find and keep track of, given there&#8217;s been no dedicated place where Spaces can be discovered. The new tab aims to change that.</p>
<p>Within the tab, users will be able to see active Spaces with more details, including Space names, hosts and people you know who are participating. The tab will also allow users to manage reminders for scheduled Spaces so you&#8217;ll be notified when they&#8217;re about to begin, and give Twitter feedback about which Spaces you&#8217;d like to see more of.</p>
<p>App researcher Jane Manchun Wong had<a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1372252161363513345">Â uncovered Twitter&#8217;s plans</a> to revamp its app to include Spaces on the nav bar last month.</p>
<p>Currently, only Twitter users with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">at least 600 followers</a> have been granted the ability to host Spaces, and Twitter told us that figure has not changed with the launch of the tab. However, the company still has grand plans for the Spaces product, including not only scheduled Spaces which are now becoming easier to find with this discovery feature, but also things like ticketed events, co-hosted events, accessibility improvements and more.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZVchK9sQHf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/clubhouse-android-worldwide-launch/">Clubhouse to launch Android app worldwide in a week</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clubhouse to launch Android app worldwide in a week&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/clubhouse-android-worldwide-launch/embed/#?secret=ZVchK9sQHf" data-secret="ZVchK9sQHf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Putting Spaces directly in the navigation bar represents a big push for Twitter&#8217;s audio chat rooms, which have otherwise been fairly easy to ignore by those who aren&#8217;t that interested in Twitter&#8217;s Clubhouse competitor. It also arrives at a time when Clubhouse is expanding access to its own social audio app. Following its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/clubhouse-android-worldwide-launch/">Â debut on Android</a>, Clubhouse said 2 million Android users have already joined its platform.</p>
<p>Twitter, meanwhile, hasn&#8217;t yet publicized how many users have tested out Spaces at this point, either as a host or an end user.</p>
<p>Alongside today&#8217;s launch, Twitter will also begin to roll out another Spaces feature that was previously being tested: displaying the purple ring around someone&#8217;s profile pictures from the Home Timeline.</p>
<p>Currently, profile pics can be highlighted with a blue ring that takes you to the user&#8217;s Fleets when tapped, but the new purple ring will indicate they&#8217;re actively using Spaces at that time. You can then tap their profile pic to join them. The feature makes it easier to find Spaces while you&#8217;re just scrolling your Twitter Timeline as usual.</p>
<p>After the new Spaces tab is tried out with the original beta test group, it will begin rolling out more people, Twitter says.</p>
