										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When I needed a new sofa several months ago, I was pleased to find a buy now, pay later (BNPL) option during the checkout process. I had prepared myself to make a major financial outlay, but the service fees were well worth the convenience of deferring the entire payment.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I was siting on said sofa this morning and considering that transaction when Alex Wilhelm submitted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/as-bnpl-startups-raise-a-look-at-klarna-affirm-and-afterpay-earnings/">a column that compared recent earnings for three BNPL providers</a>: Afterpay, Affirm and Klarna.</p>
<p>I asked him why he decided to dig into the sector with such gusto.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<hr />
<p>&#8220;What struck me about the concept was that we had just seen earnings from Affirm,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So we had three BNPL players with known earnings, and I had just covered a startup funding round in the space.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Toss in some obvious audience interest, and it was an easy choice to write the piece. Now the question is whether I did a good job and people find value in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch this week! Have a great weekend.</p>

<p>I avoid running Extra Crunch stories that focus on best practices; you can find those anywhere. Instead, we look for &#8220;here&#8217;s what worked for me&#8221; articles that give readers actionable insights.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a much better use of your time and ours.</p>
<p>With that ethos in mind, Lucas Matney interviewed Pilot CEO Waseem Daher to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/pilot-ceo-waseem-daher-tears-down-his-companys-60m-series-c-pitch-deck/">deconstruct the pitch deck that helped his company land a $60M Series C round</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Series A was about, &#8216;Do you have the right ingredients to make this work?&#8217; then the Series B is about, &#8216;Is this actually working?'&#8221; Daher tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then the Series C is more, &#8216;Well, show me that the core business is really working and that you have unlocked real drivers to allow the business to continue growing.'&#8221;</p>

<p>A global survey of automobile owners found three hurdles to overcome before consumers will widely embrace electric vehicles:</p>
<ul>
<li>30-minute charging time</li>
<li>300-mile range</li>
<li>$36,000 maximum cost</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Theoretically, solid state batteries (SSB) could deliver all three,&#8221; but for now, lithium-ion batteries are the go-to for most EVs (along with laptops and phones).</p>
<p>In our latest market map, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">we&#8217;ve plotted the new and established players in the SSB sector</a> and listed many of the investors who are backing them.</p>
<p>Although SSBs are years away from mass production, &#8220;we are on the cusp of some pretty incredible discoveries using major improvements in computational science and machine learning algorithms to accelerate that process,&#8221; says SSB startup founder Amy Prieto.</p>

<p>Founded in 1996, F5 has repositioned itself in the networking market several times in its history. In the last two years, however, it spent $2.2 billion to acquire Shape Security, Volterra and NGINX.</p>
<p>&#8220;As large organizations age, they often need to pivot to stay relevant, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/why-f5-spent-2-2b-on-3-companies-to-focus-on-cloud-native-applications/">I wanted to explore one of these transformational shifts</a>,&#8221; said enterprise reporter Ron Miller.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spoke to the CEO of F5 to find out the strategy behind his company&#8217;s pivot and how he leveraged three acquisitions to push his organization in a new direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>I asked Alex Wilhelm to dial back the profanity he used to describe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/oscar-healths-initial-ipo-price-is-so-high-it-makes-me-want-to-swear/">Oscar Health&#8217;s proposed valuation</a>, but perhaps I was too conservative.</p>
<p>In March 2018, the insurtech unicorn was valued at around $3.2 billion. Today, with the company aiming to debut at $32 to $34 per share, its fully diluted valuation is closer to $7.7 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;The clear takeaway from the first Oscar Health IPO pricing interval is that public investors have lost their minds,&#8221; says Alex.</p>
<p>His advice for companies considering an IPO? &#8220;Go public now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poring through LinkedIn and reviewing past speaker lists at industry conferences are good places to find decision-makers, for example.</p>
<p>Despite this detective work, GGV Capital investor Oren Yunger says sales teams still need to identify the deal-blockers who can spike a deal with a single email.</p>

<p>The most effective marketing uses good storytelling, not persuasion.</p>
<p>According to Caryn Marooney, general partner at Coatue Management, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/ribs-the-messaging-framework-for-every-company-and-product/">every compelling story is relevant, inevitable, believable and simple</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Behind most successful companies is a story that checks every one of those boxes,&#8221; says Marooney, but &#8220;this is a central challenge for every startup.&#8221;</p>

<p>On a recent episode of Extra Crunch Live, Ironclad founder and CEO Jason Boehmig and Accel partner Steve Loughlin discussed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/ironclads-jason-boehmig-the-objective-of-pricing-is-to-become-less-wrong-over-time/">the pitch that brought them together almost four years ago</a>.</p>
<p>Since that $8 million Series A, Loughlin joined Ironclad&#8217;s board. &#8220;Both agree that the work they put in up front had paid off&#8221; when it comes to how well they work together, says Jordan Crook.</p>
<p>“We’ve always been up front about the fact that we consider the board a part of the company,” said Boehmig.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If Southern California-based <a href="https://www.roadrunnermedia.com">Road Runner Media</a> succeeds, you&#8217;ll start seeing a lot more ads while you&#8217;re driving.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the startup is placing digital screens on the back of technicians&#8217; vans, delivery vehicles, buses and other commercial vehicles. Those screens can show both ads and serve as a brake light — according to founder and chairman Randall Lanham, the brake light functionality is required if you&#8217;re putting a sign on the back of a vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way we look at it, we are a digital brake light,&#8221; Lanham said. Yes, the brake light is showing ads, but &#8220;the driver touching the brakes interrupts the ad.&#8221; (The sign can also indicate turns, reversing and emergency flashers. You can see a mock-up ad in the image above, and real footage in the video below.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To pursue this idea, Lanham (who described himself as a &#8220;recovering attorney&#8221;) enlisted Chris Riley as CEO — Riley&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisrriley/">experience</a> includes several years as CEO of PepsiCo Australia and New Zealand. And the company announced this week that it has secured $62.5 million in debt financing from Baseline Growth Capital.</p>
<p>The idea of putting ads on moving vehicles isn&#8217;t new. There are, of course, ads on the tops of taxis, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/firefly-strong-outdoor/">startups like Firefly</a> are also putting digital signage on top of Ubers and Lyfts. But Riley said Road Runner&#8217;s ruggedized, high-resolution LCD screens are very different, due to their size, quality and placement.</p>

<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDX1hFXCmNE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Riley also said the ads can be targeted based on GPS and time of day, and that the company eventually plans to add sensors to collect data on who&#8217;s actually seeing the ads.</p>
<p>As for concerns that these big, bright screens might distract drivers, Lanham argued they&#8217;re actually attracting driver&#8217;s eyes to exactly where they should be, and creating a brake light that&#8217;s much harder to ignore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your eyes are affixed on the horizon, which is what the [Department of Transportation] wants — as opposed to on the floor or the radio or directly off to the left or right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That’s where your safest driving occurs, when your eyes are up above the dashboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, Lanham said he&#8217;s &#8220;very passionate&#8221; about the company&#8217;s mission, which in his view will make roads safer, and is creating a platform that could also be used to spread public service messages.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have the ability to retrofit any vehicle and make it safer on the highways,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I really, truly believe that we will save lives, if we already haven’t.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says it already has 150 screens live in Atlanta, Boulder, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles, with plans to launch screens in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yelp released <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/2021/02/yelp-launches-trust-safety-site-and-releases-2020-trust-safety-report">its very first trust and safety report</a> this week, with the goal of explaining the work that it does to crack down on fraudulent and otherwise inaccurate or unhelpful content.</p>
<p>With focus on local business reviews and information, you might think Yelp would be relatively free of the types of misinformation that other social media platforms struggle with. But of course, Yelp reviews are high stakes in their own way, since they can have a big impact on a business&#8217; bottom line.</p>
<p>Like other online platforms, Yelp relies on a mix of software and human curation. On the software side, one of the main tasks is sorting reviews into recommended and not recommended. Group Product Manager for Trust and Safety Sudheer Someshwara told me that a review might not be recommended because it appears to be written by someone with a conflict of interest, or it might be solicited by the business, or it might come from a user who hasn&#8217;t posted many reviews before and &#8220;we just don&#8217;t know enough information about the user to recommend those reviews to our community.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We take fairness and integrity very seriously,&#8221; Someshwara said. &#8220;No employee at Yelp has the ability to override decisions the software has made. That even includes the engineers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;We treat every business the same, whether they&#8217;re advertising with us or not.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118565" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118565" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118565" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.13.00-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="Yelp trust and safety report" width="680" height="537" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.13.00-PM.jpg 1090w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.13.00-PM.jpg?resize=150,118 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.13.00-PM.jpg?resize=300,237 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.13.00-PM.jpg?resize=768,606 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.13.00-PM.jpg?resize=680,537 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-3.13.00-PM.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118565" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yelp</p></div></p>
<p>So the company says that last year, users posted more than 18.1 million reviews, of which 4.6 million (about 25%) were not recommended by the software. Someshwara noted that even when a review is not recommended, it&#8217;s not removed entirely — users just have to seek it out in a separate section.</p>
<p>Removals do happen, but that&#8217;s one of the places where the user operations team comes in. As Vice President of Legal, Trust &amp; Safety Aaron Schur explained, &#8220;We do make it easy for businesses as well as consumers to flag reviews. Every piece of content that’s flagged in that way does get reviewed by a live human to decide whether it should should be removed for violating our guidelines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yelp says that last year, about 710,000 reviews (4%) were removed entirely for violating the company&#8217;s policies. Of those, more than 5,200 were removed for violating the platform&#8217;s COVID-19 guidelines (among other things, they prohibit reviewers from claiming they contracted COVID from a business, or from complaining about mask requirements or that a business had to close due to safety regulations). Another 13,300 were removed between May 25 and the end of the year for threats, lewdness, hate speech or other harmful content.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any current event that takes place will find its way onto Yelp,&#8221; acknowledged Vice President of User Operations Noorie Malik. &#8220;People turn to Yelp and other social media platforms to have a voice.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIaOBxcntqw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>But expressing political beliefs can conflict with what Malik said is Yelp&#8217;s &#8220;guiding principle,&#8221; namely &#8220;genuine, first-hand experience.&#8221; So Yelp has built software to detect unusual activity on a page and will also add a Consumer Alert when it believes there are &#8220;egregious attempts to manipulate ratings and reviews.&#8221; For example, it says there was a 206% increase in media-fueled incidents year over year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that you can&#8217;t express political opinions in your reviews, but the review has to come from firsthand experience, rather than being prompted by reading a negative article or an angry tweet about the business. Sometimes, she added, that means the team is &#8220;removing content with a point of view that we agree with.&#8221;</p>
<p>One example that illustrates this distinction: Yelp will take down reviews that seem driven by media coverage suggesting that a business owner or employee behaved in a racist manner, but at the same time, it also labeled two businesses in December 2020 with a &#8220;Business Accused of Racism&#8221; alert reflecting &#8220;resounding evidence of egregious, racist actions from a business owner or employee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond looking at individual reviews and spikes in activity, Someshwara said Yelp will also perform &#8220;sting operations&#8221; to find groups that are posting fraudulent reviews.</p>
<p>In fact, his team apparently shut down 1,200 user accounts associated with review rings and reported nearly 200 groups to other platforms. And it just rolled out <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/2021/02/yelp-updates-recommendation-software-to-better-target-and-mitigate-content-from-online-review-exchange-groups">an updated algorithm</a> designed to better detect and unrecommend reviews coming from those groups.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">What can we learn from the best 40 venture capital investments of all time? Well, we learn to invest exclusively in men, preferably white or Asian.</p>
<p>We reviewed CB Insights’ global list of <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/best-venture-capital-investments/#Cer">“40 of the Best VC Bets of all Time.”</a> All of the 40 companies’ 92 founders were male.</p>
<ul>
<li>Of the 43 U.S.-based founders, 35 were white American; four were white immigrant/first generation, from France, Ukraine, Russia and Iran; and four were Indian immigrant/first generation.</li>
<li>Of the 19 Western Europe/Israel-based founders, all were white.</li>
<li>Of the 30 Asia-based founders, all were natives of the country in which they built their businesses: 23 Chinese, three Japanese, two Korean and two Indian.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, this dataset is incomplete. There are numerous examples of founders from underrepresented backgrounds who have generated extremely impressive returns. For example, Calendly’s Tope Awotona is Nigerian American; Sendgrid’s Isaac Saldana is Latinx; and Bumble’s Whitney Wolfe Herd is the second-youngest woman to take a company public.</p>
<p>That said, the pattern in the dataset is striking.<b> So, why invest in anyone who’s not a white or Asian male? </b></p>
<p>The conventional answer is that diversity pays. Research from BCG, Harvard Business Review, First Round Capital, the Kauffman Foundation and Illuminate Ventures shows that investors in diverse teams get better returns:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bias.html">Paul Graham</a>, co-founder of Y Combinator (2015): “Many suspect that venture capital firms are biased against female founders. This would be easy to detect: among their portfolio companies, do startups with female founders outperform those without? A couple months ago, one VC firm (almost certainly unintentionally) published a study showing bias of this type. First Round Capital <a href="http://10years.firstround.com/#one">found</a> that among its portfolio companies, startups with female founders outperformed those without by 63%.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kauffmanfellows.org/journal_posts/the-pipeline-myth-ethnicity-fund-managers">Kauffman Fellows Report</a> (2020): “Diverse Founding Teams generate higher median realized multiples (RMs) on Acquisitions and IPOs. Diverse Founding Teams returned 3.3x, while White Founding Teams returned 2.5x. The results are even more pronounced when looking at the perceived ethnicity of the executive team. Diverse Executive Teams returned 3.3x, while White Executive Teams only returned 2.0x. As mentioned above, we report realized multiples (RMs) only for successful startups that were acquired or went through the IPO process.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet">BCG</a> (June 2018): “Startups founded and co-founded by women actually performed better over time, generating 10% more in cumulative revenue over a five-year period: $730,000 compared with $662,000.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/how-diverse-leadership-teams-boost-innovation">BCG</a> (January 2018): “Companies that reported above-average diversity on their management teams also reported innovation revenue that was 19 percentage points higher than that of companies with below-average leadership diversity — 45% of total revenue versus just 26%.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.piie.com/system/files/documents/wp16-3.pdf">Peterson Institute for International Economics</a> (2016): “The correlation between women at the C-suite level and firm profitability is demonstrated repeatedly, and the magnitude of the estimated effects is not small. For example, a profitable firm at which 30% of leaders are women could expect to add more than 1 percentage point to its net margin compared with an otherwise similar firm with no female leaders. By way of comparison, the typical profitable firm in our sample had a net profit margin of 6.4%, so a 1 percentage point increase represents a 15% boost to profitability.”</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How do we reconcile these two sets of data? </b>Research going back a decade shows that diverse teams, companies and founders pay, so why are all of the VC home runs from white men, or Asian men in Asia, plus a few Asian men in the U.S.?</p>
<p>First Round did not include their investment in Uber in their analysis we reference above on the grounds that it was an outlier. Of course, one could rebut that by saying traditional VC is all about investing in outliers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seth Levine analyzed data from Correlation Ventures (21,000 financings from 2004-2013) and <a href="https://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2014/08/venture-outcomes-are-even-more-skewed-than-you-think.html">writes</a> that “a full 65% of financings fail to return 1x capital. And perhaps more interestingly, only 4% produce a return of 10x or more, and only 10% produce a return of 5x or more.” In Levine’s extrapolated model, he found that in a “hypothetical $100 million fund with 20 investments, the total number of financings producing a return above 5x was 0.8 — producing almost $100 million of proceeds. My theoretical fund actually didn’t find their purple unicorn, they found four-fifths of that company. If they had missed it, they would have failed to return capital after fees.”</li>
<li>Benedict Evans <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/4/28/winning-and-losing">observes</a> that the best investors don’t seem to be better at avoiding startups that fail. “For funds with an overall return of 3x-5x, which is what VC funds aim for, the overall return was 4.6x but the return of the deals that did better than 10x was actually 26.7x. For &gt;5x funds, it was 64.3x. The best VC funds don’t just have more failures and more big wins — they have bigger big wins.”</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The first problem with the outlier model of investing in VC is that it results in, on average, poor returns and is a risker proposition compared to alternative models. </b><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/kloeckner/kauffman-foundationventurecapital">The Kauffman Foundation</a> analyzed their own investments in venture capital (100 funds) over a 20-year period and found “only 20 of the hundred venture funds generated returns that beat a public-market equivalent by more than 3% annually,” while 62 “failed to exceed returns available from the public markets, after fees and carry were paid.”</p>
<p><b>The outlier model of investing in VC also typically results in a bias toward investing in homogeneous teams. </b>We suggest that the extremely homogeneous profiles of the big wealth creators above reflect the fact that these are people who took the biggest risks: financial, reputational and career risk. The people who can afford to take the biggest risks are also the people with the most privilege; they’re not as concerned about providing for food, shelter and healthcare as economically stressed people are. According to the <a href="https://www.kauffman.org/entrepreneurship/reports/the-anatomy-of-an-entrepreneur/">Kauffman Foundation</a>, a study of “549 company founders of successful businesses in high-growth industries, including aerospace, defense, computing, electronics and healthcare” showed that “more than 90% of the entrepreneurs came from middle-class or upper-lower-class backgrounds and were well-educated: 95.1% of those surveyed had earned bachelor’s degrees, and 47% had more advanced degrees.&#8221; But when you analyze the next tier down of VC success, the companies that don’t make Top 40 lists but land on Top 500 lists, you see a lot more diversity.</p>
<p>In VC, 100x investment opportunities only come along once every few years. If you bet your VC fund on opportunities like that, you’re relying on luck. Hope is not a strategy. There are many 3x-20x return opportunities, and if you’re incredibly lucky (or Chris Sacca), you might get one 100x in your career.</p>
<p>We prefer to invest based on statistics, not luck. That’s why <a href="http://versatilevc.com">Versatile VC</a> provides companies with the option of an “alternative VC” model, using a nontraditional term sheet designed to better align incentives between investors and founders. We also proactively seek to invest in diverse teams. Given the choice of running a fund with one 100x investment, or a fund with two 10x investments, we’ll take the latter. The former implies that we came perilously close to missing our one home run, and therefore we’re not doing such a great job investing.</p>
<p>“While we all want to have invested in those exciting home runs/unicorns, most investors are seeking the data points to construct reliable portfolios,” Shelly Porges, co-founder and managing partner of <a href="https://beyondthebillion.com/">Beyond the Billion</a>, observed. “That&#8217;s not about aiming for the bleachers but leveraging experience to reliably deliver on the singles and doubles it takes to get to home base. A number of the institutional investors we&#8217;ve spoken to have gone so far as to say that they can no longer meet their targets without alternatives, including venture investments. “</p>
<p>Lastly, the data above reflects companies that typically took a decade to build. As the culture changes, we anticipate that the 2030 “Top 40” wealth creators list will include many more people with diverse backgrounds. Just in 2018, 15 unicorns were <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/more-female-founded-unicorns-were-born-in-2019-that-before-data-shows/">born</a> with at least one woman founder; in 2019, 21 startups founded or co-founded by a woman became unicorns. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>“All else being equal, a larger pool of female-founded companies to select from</b> for VC investing should increase the odds of a higher number of female-founded VC home runs,” said Michael Chow, research director for the National Venture Capital Association and Venture Forward. According to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vc-funding-female-founders-drops-low">PitchBook</a>, investments in women-led companies grew approximately 54% from 2015 to 2019, from 459 to 709. In the first three quarters of 2020, there have been 468 fundings of women-led companies; this figure beats 2015, 2016 and nearly 2017 total annual fundings. <a href="https://www.projectdiane.com/">ProjectDiane</a> highlights that from 2018 to 2020, the number of Black women who have raised $1 million in venture funding nearly tripled, and the number of Latinx women doubled. Their average two-year fail rate is also 13 percentage points lower than the overall average.</li>
<li><b>“Millennials value a diverse workforce,”</b> Chow added, according to Gallup and Deloitte Millennial surveys. “In the battle for talent, diverse founders may have the edge in attracting the best and brightest, and talent is what is required for going from zero to one.”</li>
<li><b>The rise in popularity of alternative VC models</b>, which are disproportionately <a href="https://teten.com/blog/2019/08/20/why-are-revenue-based-vcs-investing-in-so-many-women-underrepresented-founders/">attractive</a> to women and underrepresented founders. We are in the very early days of this wave; according to research by <a href="https://bootstrapp.co">Bootstrapp</a>, 32 U.S. firms have launched an inaugural Revenue-Based Finance fund. <a href="http://clearbanc.com">Clearbanc</a> notes on their site they have “invested in thousands of companies using data science to identify high-growth funding opportunities. This data-driven approach takes the bias out of decision-making. Clearbanc has funded 8x more female founders than traditional VCs and has invested in 43 states in the U.S. in 2019.”</li>
<li><b>More VCs are working proactively to market to underrepresented founders. </b>“<a href="http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-implicit-bias.pdf">Implicit biases are robust and pervasive</a>; it takes a proactive and intentional approach to shift the current status quo of funding,” <a href="https://www.dreamersdoers.com/">Dreamers &amp; Doers</a> Founder Gesche Haas said. Holly Jacobus, an investment partner at <a href="https://www.joyancepartners.com/team-1/2018/10/20/holly-jacobus">Joyance Partners and Social Starts</a>, noted that “we&#8217;re proud to boast a portfolio <a href="https://www.joyancepartners.com/blog/2020/5/25/why-we-are-strong-in-the-mighty-middle">featuring ~30% female founders</a> in core roles — well above the industry average — without specific targeting of any sort. However, there is still work to be done. That&#8217;s why we lean heavily on our software and CEOs to find the best tech and teams in the best segments, and we are always <a href="https://www.joyancepartners.com/blog/2020/7/15/inception-with-venture-partner-charles-smith">actively working</a> on improving the process with new systems that remove bias from the dealflow and diligence process.&#8221;</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s internal R&amp;D group, NPE Team, is today launching its next experimental app, called <a href="http://bars.app/">BARS</a>. The app makes it possible for rappers to create and share their raps using professionally created beats, and is the NPE Team&#8217;s second launch in the music space following its recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/facebook-publicly-launches-its-collaborative-music-video-app-collab/">public debut of music video app Collab</a>.</p>
<p>While Collab focuses on making music with others online, BARS is instead aimed at would-be rappers looking to create and share their own videos. In the app, users will select from any of the hundreds of professionally created beats, then write their own lyrics and record a video. BARS can also automatically suggest rhymes as you&#8217;re writing out lyrics, and offers different audio and visual filters to accompany videos as well as an autotune feature.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a &#8220;Challenge mode&#8221; available, where you can freestyle with auto-suggested word cues, which has more of a game-like element to it. The experience is designed to be accommodating to people who just want to have fun with rap, similar to something like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smule.autorap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Smule&#8217;s AutoRap</a>, perhaps, which also offers beats for users&#8217; own recordings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The videos themselves can be up to 60 seconds in length and can then be saved to your Camera Roll or shared out on other social media platforms.</p>
<p>Like NPE&#8217;s Collab, the pandemic played a role in BARS&#8217; creation. The pandemic shut down access to live music and places where rappers could experiment, explains NPE Team member DJ Iyler, who also ghostwrites hip-hop songs under the alias &#8220;D-Lucks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know access to high-priced recording studios and production equipment can be limited for aspiring rappers. On top of that, the global pandemic shut down live performances where we often create and share our work,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>BARS was built with a team of aspiring rappers, and today launched into a closed beta.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118131" style="width: 556px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118131" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118131" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg?w=546" alt="" width="546" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg 1520w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg?resize=121,150 121w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg?resize=241,300 241w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg?resize=768,956 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg?resize=546,680 546w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg?resize=1234,1536 1234w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.29.54-PM.jpg?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118131" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Despite the focus on music, and rap in particular, the new app in a way can be seen as yet another attempt by Facebook to develop a TikTok competitor &#8212; at least in this content category.</p>
<p>TikTok has already become a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rappers-sharing-music-on-tiktok-2019-7">launchpad for up-and-coming musicians</a>, including rappers; it has helped <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/tiktok-championxiii-freestyles-1097255/">rappers test their verses</a>, is favored by many <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504619/ricky-desktop-tiktok-beat-creator-interview-musician-viral-hits">beatmakers</a> and is even <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/tiktok-baby-rap">influencing</a> what sort of music is being made. <a href="https://www.intheknow.com/post/tiktok-diss-tracks/">Diss tracks</a> have also become a hugely popular format on TikTok, mainly as a way for influencers to stir up drama and chase views. In other words, there&#8217;s already a large social community around rap on TikTok, and Facebook wants to shift some of that attention back its way.</p>
<p>The app also resembles TikTok in terms of its user interface. It&#8217;s a two-tabbed vertical video interface &#8212; in its case, it has  &#8220;Featured&#8221; and &#8220;New&#8221; feeds instead of TikTok&#8217;s &#8220;Following&#8221; and &#8220;For You.&#8221; And BARS places the engagement buttons on the lower-right corner of the screen with the creator name on the lower-left, just like TikTok.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YMeI9HehBk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/facebook-publicly-launches-its-collaborative-music-video-app-collab/">Facebook publicly launches its collaborative music video app, Collab</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook publicly launches its collaborative music video app, Collab&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/facebook-publicly-launches-its-collaborative-music-video-app-collab/embed/#?secret=YMeI9HehBk" data-secret="YMeI9HehBk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However, in place of hearts for favoriting videos, your taps on a video give it &#8220;Fire&#8221; &#8212; a fire emoji keeps track. You can tap &#8220;Fire&#8221; as many times as you want, too. But because there&#8217;s (annoyingly) no tap-to-pause feature, you may accidentally &#8220;fire&#8221; a video when you were looking for a way to stop its playback. To advance in BARS, you swipe vertically, but the interface is lacking an obvious &#8220;Follow&#8221; button to track your favorite creators. It&#8217;s hidden under the top-right three-dot menu.</p>
<p>The app is seeded with content from NPE Team members, which includes other aspiring rappers, former music producers and publishers.</p>
<p>Currently, the BARS beta is live on the iOS App Store in the U.S., and is opening its waitlist. Facebook says it will open access to BARS invites in batches, starting in the U.S. Updates and news about invites, meanwhile, will be announced on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/getbarsapp/">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s recent launches from its experimental apps division include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/facebook-launches-collab-a-mix-and-match-app-for-making-collaborative-music-videos/">Collab</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/facebook-launches-e-gg-an-experimental-collage-making-app/">collage maker E.gg,</a> among others. Not all apps stick around. If they fail to gain traction, Facebook shuts them down &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/facebook-shuts-down-hobbi-its-experimental-app-for-documenting-personal-projects/">as it did last year</a> with the Pinterest-like video app Hobbi.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The freemium marketing approach has become commonplace among B2C and B2B software providers alike. Considering that most see fewer </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2014/05/making-freemium-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">than 5%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of free users move to paid plans, even a slight improvement in conversion can translate to significant revenue gains. The (multi) million-dollar question is, how do they do it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer lies in product analytics, which offer teams the ability to ask and answer any number of questions about the customer journey on an ad-hoc basis. Combined with a commitment to testing, measurement and iteration, this puts data in the driver’s seat and helps teams make better decisions about what’s in the free tier and what’s behind the paywall. Successful enterprises make this evaluation an ongoing exercise.</span></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Often, the truth of product analytics is that actionable insights come from just a fraction of the data and it can take time to understand what’s happening.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Sweat the small stuff</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A freemium business model is simply a set of interconnected funnels. From leads all the way through to engagement, conversion and retention, understanding each step and making even small optimizations at any stage will have down-funnel implications. Start by using product analytics to understand the nuances of what’s working and what isn’t, and then double down on the former.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, identify specific personas that perform well and perform poorly. While your overall conversion average may be 5%, there can be segments converting at 10% or 1%. Understanding the difference can shine a light on where to focus. That’s where the right analytics can lead to significant results. But if you don’t understand </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">why</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve, you’re left with guesswork. And that’s not a modern way of operating.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a misconception that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">volume </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of data equals </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">value </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of data. Let’s say you want to jump-start your funnel by buying pay-per-click traffic. You see a high volume of activity, with numbers going up at the beginning of your funnel and a sales team busy with calls. However, you come to learn the increased traffic, which looked so promising at the outset, results in very few users converting to paid plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, this is a story as old as PPC, but in the small percentage that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">convert, there’s a lot to learn about where to focus your efforts — which product features keep users hooked and which ones go unused. Often, the truth of product analytics is that actionable insights come from just a fraction of the data and it can take time to understand what’s happening. Getting users on board the free plan is just the first step in conversion. The testing and iteration continue from there.</span></p>
<h2>The dropped and the languished</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the free tier, users may languish — satisfied with whatever features they can access. If your funnel is full of languishing users, you’ve at least solved the adoption problem, so why are they stuck? Without a testing and tracking approach, you’ll struggle to understand your users and how they respond, by segment, to changes.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lightspeed Venture Partners, the well-known Silicon Valley venture capital firm that has backed the likes of DoubleClick and Snapchat, is in the midst of hiring a second London-based investment partner as it looks to put down further roots in Europe, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>According to multiple sources, Paul Murphy, whose investments include Tier, Hopin, Klang and Bunch, is being hired away from Northzone, the European VC firm that’s probably best known for being an early backer of Spotify. The signing is still in progress but could be announced in the next few weeks. Murphy has been at Northzone for three years and was promoted to general partner in late 2019 when the firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/17/northzone-raises-new-500m-fund/">raised a new $500 million fund</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve reached out to Murphy and Lightspeed for comment and will update this article if or when I hear back.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;VCs are chasing Hopin upwards of $5-6B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/vcs-are-chasing-hopin-upwards-of-5-6b-valuation/embed/#?secret=VI6Vaiwfa3" data-secret="VI6Vaiwfa3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Prior to VC, Murphy co-founded Dots, the mobile games company in New York. He also built and invested in various companies at startup studio Betaworks. (Notably, Murphy helped launch Giphy in the U.S., which Lightspeed ended up backing and later sold to Facebook for $400 million). Before that, he held several roles at Microsoft in the U.S., U.K. and India. He also holds a BS in Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech and an MBA from The IE Business School in Spain, according to the Northzone website.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the fact that Lightspeed is formally putting more people on the ground in Europe should come as no surprise to close watchers of the ecosystem here. TechCrunch first heard rumors that the Menlo Park-based VC was recruiting a partner in London as far back as August in 2019. That saw Rytis Vitkauskas join the U.S. firm as its first partner in London the following September, according to LinkedIn. Should Murphy&#8217;s recruitment be confirmed it would signal a significant expansion of a Lightspeed London &#8220;office,&#8221; and confirmation that the VC is doubling down in the region.</p>
<p>Those rumors in late last 2019 coincided with news spreading that another Silicon Valley VC heavyweight, Sequoia, was also doing the same &#8212; along with talk of other U.S. VC firms &#8212; as European tech companies continue to create more value than ever before. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/7-things-we-just-learned-about-sequoias-european-expansion-plans/">Sequoia&#8217;s own plans</a> were finally announced in November, including that it had poached Luciana Lixandru away from rival Accel Partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lisa Wu, a partner at Norwest with investments like Calm, Plaid, Opendoor and Grove Collaborative, has a message for founders: Think like a VC during your pitch presentation. After all, accepting capital isn&#8217;t simply adding more money to your balance sheet. It is about picking a venture partner who will be there with you through the highs and lows. Some even liken it to a marriage that you can&#8217;t divorce from.</p>
<p>No pressure, of course.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, we won’t leave you hanging: Wu is joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=dawnbeltpost&amp;display=true">TechCrunch Early Stage</a>, our annual event with content specifically tailored to first-time founders and investors, to talk about exactly this.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before Norwest, Wu worked in Amazon’s corporate development team, Bessemer Venture Partners and founded BANZAI, which brought food focused on quality and nutrition to schools.</p>
<p>With experience on both sides of the investing table, Wu is going to talk about how founders can make the most out of each minute within a one-hour pitch presentation. She’ll discuss ways that founders can read the virtual room, how to take advice and how to talk big-picture ideas to convey market size and competition.</p>
<p>Wu joins a fantastic cast of top experts, discussing topics such as fundraising, operations and marketing. Her workshop is part of the two days of events that explore seed and Series A fundraising, recruiting and more for early-stage startups at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=dawnbeltpost&amp;display=true">TC Early Stage – Operations and Fundraising</a> on April 1 &amp; 2. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=dawnbeltpost&amp;display=true">Grab your ticket now</a> before prices increase tonight!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aurora, the autonomous vehicle company that recently closed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">acquisition</a> of Uber’s self-driving subsidiary, has snapped up another startup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, Aurora is buying OURS Technology, the second lidar startup it has acquired in less than two years. Aurora <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/fresh-off-a-530m-round-aurora-acquires-lidar-startup-blackmore/">acquired Blackmore</a>, a Montana-based lidar startup, in May 2019. Aurora declined to disclose the acquisition price or other financial terms of the deal. OURS Technology, which was founded in 2017 by a team of University of California-Berkeley researchers and PhDs, employs 12 people. The entire team is heading to Aurora, according to the company.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are always on the lookout for how we can make progress as quickly as possible and <span class="il">OURS</span>’s expertise in developing <span class="il">lidar</span> chips adds to the expertise we already have and accelerates our work,” an Aurora spokesperson said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidar, or </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/12/wtf-is-lidar/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">light detection and ranging radar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is considered by most companies developing autonomous driving systems </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a critical and necessary sensor to safely deploy self-driving vehicles at scale. A future where millions of self-driving vehicles coursing through cities is still years — even decades some argue — away. But that hasn&#8217;t prevented dozens of lidar companies from launching, each one aiming to cash in on that eventual demand. </span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1TAaWLBLTr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/fresh-off-a-530m-round-aurora-acquires-lidar-startup-blackmore/">Fresh off a $530M round, Aurora acquires lidar startup Blackmore</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fresh off a $530M round, Aurora acquires lidar startup Blackmore&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/fresh-off-a-530m-round-aurora-acquires-lidar-startup-blackmore/embed/#?secret=1TAaWLBLTr" data-secret="1TAaWLBLTr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority of the 70-odd companies that exist in the industry today are developing and trying to sell time-of-flight lidar sensors, which send out pulses of light outside the visible spectrum and then measure how long it takes for each of those pulses to return. As they come back, the direction of, and distance to, whatever those pulses hit are recorded as a point and eventually forms a 3D map. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lidar companies, including Blackmore and OURS Technology, are pursuing Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) lidar, which emits a low-power and continuous wave, or stream, of light. FMCW lidar developers tout two primary benefits of this technology. It can measure distance with a higher dynamic range and instant velocity, meaning it can gauge the speed of the objects coming to or moving away from them. It also doesn&#8217;t struggle with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interference from the sun or other other sensors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But FMCW is also complex. FMCW starts as a range finder on a chip. To make it a 3D lidar, many FMCW developers use big mirrors and other components to provide the field of view, which pushes up the size of the sensors. OURS Technology claims to be a lidar-on-a-chip company, which suggests that this four-year-old company has developed a way to combine everything into a solid-state scanning mechanism. This would allow the sensor to shrink in size, solving one of FMCW&#8217;s primary issues.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Aurora unveiled last summer its so-called <a href="https://medium.com/aurora-blog/aurora-debuts-firstlight-lidar-c8d850f0cbe7">FirstLight Lidar</a>, a sensor based on Blackmore&#8217;s technology that was developed for its fleet of self-driving vehicles, namely long-haul trucks. Aurora is clearly interested in OURS&#8217;s speed of development, <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/the-power-of-fmcw-lidar-and-scale-acquiring">noting in its announcement</a> that the startup been able to produce four generations of <span class="il">lidar</span> in just three years and developed a solid-state scanning mechanism compatible with its technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company plans to use the startup&#8217;s expertise and development know-how to make its sensor scalable. In short: Aurora hopes to use OURS&#8217;s team and their blueprint for key elements such as the solid-state scanning mechanism and development process to accelerate development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By now you probably know that we’re hosting two <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=lastdayebpost">TC Early Stage</a> events this year — one on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=lastdayebpost">April 1-2</a> and another on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=lastdayebpost">July 8-9</a> — each with its own set of topics, speakers and content — both designed to help nascent startup founders build a better, more successful business.</p>
<p>What you may not know is that you have only a few hours left to take advantage of early-bird pricing on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=lastdayebpost&amp;display=true">single event or dual-event pass</a>. Beat the deadline — <strong>11:59 p.m. (PST) tonight</strong> — score the lowest possible price and save $100.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=lastdayebpost">TC Early Stage</a> functions like a minibootcamp for entrepreneurs. You’ll hear from top experts, founders and investors from across the startup ecosystem. They’ll share valuable tips, advice and hard-won lessons they learned in the trenches. We’re talking issues that every startup founder needs to master or understand well enough to delegate wisely.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/#6db46596-2ca9-43aa-bbb6-9a7aab71bf62">slate of experts</a> will present workshops on subjects like operations, fundraising, pitch deck pointers, term sheet tips, product-market fit, brand building, growth marketing, recruiting, taming your tech stack and a lot more.</p>
<p>Here are just two examples to whet your entrepreneurial appetite. Marlon Nichols, founding managing partner of MaC Venture Capital, will discuss how to get noticed by investors, how to grow your business and how to survive in the crowded, competitive space of tech startups. He’ll offer insights on how to network, craft a great pitch and target the best investors for your success.</p>
<p>You’re just beginning to build your startup — what could go wrong? Plenty according to Fuel Capital’s Leah Solivan. Currently an early-stage investor, Solivan founded TaskRabbit, a startup she led to a successful exit in 2017 (acquired by IKEA). She’ll share ways to avoid making big mistakes early in your founding journey.</p>
<p>We reserved day two of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=lastdayebpost">TC Early Stage</a> for something truly exciting — the TC Early Stage Pitch Off. We sent out a call for competitors and the response was overwhelming. Narrowing the field wasn&#8217;t easy, but we chose 10 early-stage startup founders. They’ll each get five minutes to deliver their best pitch to a panel of prominent VC judges — followed by a five-minute Q&amp;A. Those judges will pick three founders to move to the finals for a second pitch-and-Q&amp;A to a new set of judges. The winner receives a feature article on TechCrunch.com, a free, one-year subscription to ExtraCrunch and a free Founder Pass to TechCrunch Disrupt 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month, African e-commerce giant Jumia <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/jumia-narrows-losses-as-its-payment-service-grows-financial-results/">released its second full-year financials</a> for Q4 and its fiscal year 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were mixed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; active customers and gross profit increased, while orders and gross merchandise volume (GMV) fell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A particular feature that has troubled the company since its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2012 was also present, namely persistent adjusted EBITDA and operating losses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, those metrics fell year over year, and the company, in a statement, said that it had demonstrated &#8220;meaningful progress on our path to profitability</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unevenness of Jumia&#8217;s business is also reflected in how its <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JMIA/">share price</a> performed in the past year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n March 2020, the company hit rock bottom and traded at an all-time low of $2.15 after facing fraud allegations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it hit an all-time high of $69.89 almost a year later this February. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the release of its financials, two things were top of TechCrunch&#8217;s mind: What made Jumia&#8217;s value swell by more than 3,000% in the last year, and will the e-commerce player&#8217;s unending losses end anytime soon?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke with Jumia co-CEO <a href="https://ae.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-hodara-8183854">Jeremy Hodara</a> to get his insights on these two questions and on issues that have faced the company in the past</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Talking profitability with Jumia</h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview has edited for length and clarity.</span></i></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: This time last year, Jumia was trading between $2 and $4. Now it&#8217;s within $40 to $50. What do you think has been the driving factor behind this?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Jeremy Hodara:</strong> What </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> important about the stock rise is two things. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, in general, the world realized that there was a big paradigm shift in e-commerce and that e-commerce was the way to go for the future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is something you can look at for every e-commerce company in the past 12 to 18 months. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second thing that happened is that we at Jumia have been very clear about the opportunities e-commerce represents in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce is a real problem of access to consumption and has a strong value proposition to those who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don&#8217;t fancy brick-and-mortar stores in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we never </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have proven is that you can build a profitable e-commerce business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will change soon because what we&#8217;ve done quarter after quarter is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be disciplined</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to bring clarity that we&#8217;re going after a profitable business model and profitable growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as people understood and saw what we were doing, it also gave them more confidence about how exciting this opportunity is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my opinion, what happened in the last 12 months was the combination of people understanding how important e-commerce is worldwide. Secondly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Jumia brought proof points that it was building a sustainable and profitable business model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Would you say Andrew Left&#8217;s reversal in October and his decision to take long positions at Jumia also affected the share price?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like I said earlier, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it had to do with the story of e-commerce change for the future. That didn&#8217;t start in October; it started months before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being disciplined</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quarter after quarter to build what&#8217;s right started months before, so I can&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comment if his decision affected our share price or if an investor&#8217;s negative or positive comments would change market sentiment toward our stock</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jumia narrows losses, as its payment service grows in financial results&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/jumia-narrows-losses-as-its-payment-service-grows-financial-results/embed/#?secret=5CHjeT2wyb" data-secret="5CHjeT2wyb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve talked about how Jumia is trying to build a profitable business. But how&#8217;s it going to do that if the company reports losses quarter after quarter and year after year?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we&#8217;re on the right path, considering that our EBITDA losses reduced by 47% last quarter, and we&#8217;ll be trying to do so every quarter</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We want to go about it by improving the efficiency of the business and opening new avenues for growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most exciting thing about e-commerce is that first, you build large assets for your own use, but it becomes relevant for other stakeholders over time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For us, we have an application and website with very engaged visitors, and we&#8217;re exploring having third-party advertisers who place ads on the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our logistics service is also another way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re building tools and technology to equip our logistics partners and help them become more productive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This drives our costs per delivery down and is the type of benefit that comes with scaling. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there&#8217;s a path to profitability by opening the assets we&#8217;ve built for ourselves to benefit our ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><strong>Jumia&#8217;s expenses dropped last year, but revenue also dropped despite a little increase in customer base. Aren&#8217;t those worrying signs?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the revenue side, here&#8217;s how we should look at it. When you&#8217;re a marketplace, your revenue is the commission that you make from a transaction. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you&#8217;re a seller on Jumia and sell something that costs $100 and your commission is 10%, your revenue inside the P&amp;L of Jumia will be $10</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If I buy a product from you at $90 and sell it to my consumer for $100, I&#8217;ll record $100 as the revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s the insurance from the financial pinpoint between what you call the third-party and the first-party model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the first-party model, you record as the revenue the value of the product. At the marketplace, you only record the commission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Jumia has, give or take, 10% of its business as the first-party model and 90% as the marketplace model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that percentage changed over time, and when it did, you can see how the revenue went down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we don&#8217;t base our profitability on revenue. What is the right KPI for us is the gross profit as it shows the monetization of Jumia. It has been growing quarter after quarter, this time by 12%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our active consumers growing 12% from 6.1 million in Q4 2019 to 6.8 million in Q4 2020 shows a disciplined growth toward profitability</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>If there&#8217;s indeed a path to profitability, why did Jumia investors &#8212; Rocket Internet and MTN &#8212; exit the company? And does that put pressure on the company?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, not at all. The fact that Jumia was able to gain support from the companies was a blessing, and they&#8217;ve come a long way with us. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But like any investor after six to nine years, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it was time for them to decide to leave the company, and I&#8217;ll say the company was lucky to have had them along our side from the beginning</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I can&#8217;t say for them, but for myself, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one can say that their leaving after so many years is a sign of distrust in our ability to become profitable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>One of the positives of your financials was JumiaPay. Does it tie into Jumia&#8217;s journey to being profitable?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JumiaPay is an amazing opportunity for us. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a great commerce platform, you have a fantastic opportunity to build a great payments solution for your consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see that consumers are adopting it very fast, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is because the platform also gives them access to other digital services where they top up their phone, pay bills and get loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, it is a great payment method for consumers who want to prepay for services. And when you prepay for products, you make logistics more efficient and have more sales.</span></p>

<p><strong>Sales remind me of the fraud issues in 2019 when some J-Force team members engaged in improper sales practices. What is Jumia doing to avoid situations like that?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a lesson we&#8217;ve learnt, and we have put in the right compliance, the right internal control team to resolve such situations. I&#8217;ll say one of the reasons why we&#8217;re becoming one of the most professional organizations in Africa is because we now have these systems in place</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>As an African company, how is Jumia addressing concerns around diversity, especially at top positions?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> African with Jumia is who we are serving, our African sellers, our African consumers and our African team</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Nigeria, Juliet Anammah, who was the CEO of Jumia Nigeria, is now the chairperson of Jumia Group. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t know what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an African or a non-African company, but what I can tell you is that our team is African, our consumers are African, and we&#8217;re selling on the continent every day</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s what should make sense to our ecosystem.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jamaica&#8217;s JamCOVID app and website were taken offline late on Thursday following a third security lapse, which exposed quarantine orders on more than half a million travelers to the island.</p>
<p>JamCOVID was set up last year to help the government process travelers arriving on the island. Quarantine orders are issued by the Jamaican Ministry of Health and instruct travelers to stay in their accommodation for two weeks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>These orders contain the traveler&#8217;s name and the address of where they are ordered to stay.</p>
<p>But a security researcher told TechCrunch that the quarantine orders were publicly accessible from the JamCOVID website but were not protected with a password. Although the files were accessible from anyone&#8217;s web browser, the researcher asked not to be named for fear of legal repercussions from the Jamaican government.</p>
<p>More than 500,000 quarantine orders were exposed, some dating back to March 2020.</p>
<p>TechCrunch shared these details with the Jamaica Gleaner, which was <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/20210226/another-jamcovid-lapse">first to report on the security lapse</a> after the news outlet verified the data spillage with local cybersecurity experts.</p>
<p>Amber Group, which was contracted to build and maintain the JamCOVID coronavirus dashboard and immigration service, pulled the service offline a short time after TechCrunch and the Jamaica Gleaner contacted the company on Thursday evening. JamCOVID&#8217;s website was replaced with a holding page that said the site was &#8220;under maintenance.&#8221; At the time of publication, the site had returned.</p>
<p>Amber Group&#8217;s chief executive Dushyant Savadia did not return a request for comment.</p>
<p>Matthew Samuda, a minister in Jamaica’s Ministry of National Security, also did not respond to a request for comment or our questions — including if the Jamaican government plans to continue its contract or relationship with Amber Group.</p>
<p>This is the third security lapse involving JamCOVID in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>Last week, Amber Group secured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/">an exposed cloud storage server</a> hosted on Amazon Web Services that was left open and public, despite containing more than 70,000 negative COVID-19 lab results and over 425,000 immigration documents authorizing travel to the island. Savadia <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20210221/amber-group-breaks-silence-personal-data-exposure">said in response</a> that there were &#8220;no further vulnerabilities&#8221; with the app. Days later, the company fixed a second security lapse after leaving <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/jamaica-amber-group-jamcovid-security-lapse/">a file containing private keys and passwords</a> for the service on the JamCOVID server.</p>
<p>The Jamaican government has repeatedly defended Amber Group, which says it provided the JamCOVID technology <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20201030/amber-enters-four-more-markets-pandemic-tech">to the government &#8220;for free.&#8221;</a> Amber Group&#8217;s Savadia has previously been quoted as saying that the company built the service in &#8220;three days.&#8221;</p>
<p>In <a href="https://jis.gov.jm/pm-holness-and-national-security-council-get-comprehensive-update-on-the-countrys-cybersecurity-apparatus/">a statement</a> on Thursday, Jamaica&#8217;s prime minister Andrew Holness said JamCOVID &#8220;continues to be a critical element&#8221; of the country&#8217;s immigration process and that the government was &#8220;accelerating&#8221; to migrate the JamCOVID database — though specifics were not given.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="http://atlassian.com">Atlassian</a> platform is chock full of data about how a company operates and communicates. Atlassian launched a machine learning layer, which relies on data on the platform with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/atlassian-smarts-adds-machine-learning-layer-across-the-companys-platform-of-services/"> the addition of Atlassian Smarts</a> last fall. Today the company announced it was acquiring <a href="http://www.chartio.com/">Chartio</a> to add a new data analysis and visualization component to the Atlassian family of products. The companies did not share a purchase price.</p>
<p>The company plans to incorporate Chartio technology across the platform, starting with Jira. Before being acquired, Chartio has generated its share of data, reporting that 280,000 users have created 10.5 million charts for 540,000 dashboards pulled from over 100,000 data sources.</p>
<p>Atlassian sees Chartio as way to bring that data visualization component to the platform and really take advantage of the data locked inside its products. &#8220;Atlassian products are home to a treasure trove of data, and our goal is to unleash the power of this data so our customers can go beyond out-of-the-box reports and truly customize analytics to meet the needs of their organization,&#8221; Zoe Ghani, head of product experience at platform at Atlassian <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/atlassian-acquires-chartio">wrote in a blog post</a> announcing the deal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mEgKvjoilK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/atlassians-two-year-cloud-journey/">Atlassian&#8217;s two-year cloud journey</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Chartio co-founder and CEO Dave Fowler <a href="https://chartio.com/blog/atlassian/">wrote in a blog post </a>on his company website that the two companies started discussing a deal late last year, which culminated in today&#8217;s announcement. As is often the case in these deals, he is arguing that his company will be better off as part of large organization like Atlassian with its vast resources than it would have been by remaining stand-alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we’ve been proudly independent for years, the opportunity to team up our technology with Atlassian’s platform and massive reach was incredibly compelling. Their product-led go to market, customer focus and educational marketing have always been aspirational for us,&#8221; Fowler wrote.</p>
<p>As for Chartio customers unfortunately, according to a notice on the company website, the product is going to be going away next year, but customers will have plenty of time to export the data to another tool. The notice includes <a href="https://chartio.com/docs/migration-guide/">a link to instructions</a> on how to do this.</p>
<p>Chartio was founded in 2010, and participated in the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/176">Y Combinator Summer 2010</a> cohort. It raised a modest $8.03 million along the way, according to Pitchbook data.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[To better understand what's going on with the companies hoping to help you finance your next mistaken purchase, let's check out earnings results from Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the e-commerce market grows, startups are racing to help online retailers sell larger items to consumers with so-called &#8220;buy-now-pay-later&#8221; options. Via BNPL, consumers turn a one-time purchase into a limited string of regular payments.</p>
<p>Terms vary, but the space is very active. TechCrunch covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/scalapay-raises-48m-to-scale-its-buy-now-pay-later-service-in-europe/">Scalapay&#8217;s January $48 million round</a>, what the Italian BNPL described as a <em>seed</em> round. Also this year, we&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/alma-raises-59-4-million-for-its-klarna-like-payment-option/">France&#8217;s Alma raise a $59.4 million Series B for its BNPL efforts</a>. And I recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/wisetack-raises-19m-as-its-buy-now-pay-later-service-for-irl-services-scales/">covered Wisetack&#8217;s aggregate $19 million fundraise</a> as it looks to make more noise about its service that focuses on real-world transactions like home improvement.</p>
<p>But unlike some burgeoning startup niches where we lack visible results from leading players to use as a lens for vetting the market, we do have a number for the BNPL space. This morning, to better understand what&#8217;s going on with the younger companies hoping to help you finance your next mistaken purchase, let&#8217;s check out earnings results from Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm.</p>

<p>Klarna, based in Sweden, is said to be considering a direct listing.

<h2>BNPL results</h2>
<p>The BNPL cohort of startups is showing signs of pursuing verticalization to find veins of market demand that remain untapped by the largest players in their market. So, while Affirm wants to check you out everywhere online, providing you with repayment options wherever you travel digitally, Wisetack wants to integrate with a particular set of merchants. The latter model could provide startups pursuing similar, narrower market targets the ability to better understand their economics and perhaps generate more total margin on their loans.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a long way to say that even with the information at our disposal, we&#8217;re thinking <em>directionally</em>. But doing so is both good fun and illustrative, so let&#8217;s get into it. First, Klarna.</p>
<h3>Klarna</h3>
<p>This morning we&#8217;ll look at Klarna&#8217;s <a href="https://www.klarna.com/assets/sites/15/2020/11/26063938/Klarna-publishes-financial-update-for-January-September-2020-press-release.pdf">Q3 2020 report</a> and its<a href="https://www.klarna.com/assets/2021/02/25063416/Press-release-Klarna-Q1-Q4-2020-Financial-Report.pdf"> Q4 report</a> from the same year.</p>
<p>The gist is that Klarna had a super-solid 2020. In its Q3 update, Klarna wrote that it saw 43 percent growth in gross merchandise volume during the first nine months of the year. In its Q4 report, it noted a full-year number of 46 percent GMV growth. From that, we can intuit that Klarna had a great fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Turning to the U.S. market, Klarna first reported &#8220;10 million total consumers by [the Q3] period end, and 11 million by the end of October.&#8221; And for the full year, it wrote that it had seen &#8220;15 million consumers choosing to shop with Klarna by January 2021&#8221; in the United States. Again, those look pretty great.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Relativity Space has just revealed what comes after Terran 1, the small launch vehicle it hopes to begin flying later this year. It&#8217;s next rocket will be Terran R, a much larger orbital rocket with around 20x the cargo capacity of Terran 1, that will also be distinguished from its smaller, disposable sibling by being fully reusable — across both first and second stages, unlike SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9.</p>
<p>I spoke to Relativity Space CEO and founder Tim Ellis about Terran R, and how long it&#8217;s been in the works for the space startup. Ellis said that in fact, the vision ever since Relativity&#8217;s time at Y Combinator has included larger lift rockets — and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I founded Relativity five years ago, it always was inspired by seeing SpaceX launching and landing rockets, docking with the International Space Station, and this idea that going to Mars was critically important for humanity&#8217;s future, and really expanding the possibilities for human experience, on Earth and beyond,&#8221; Ellis told me. &#8220;But all of the animations faded to black right when people walked out [of spaceship landing on Mars], and I believed that 3D printing had to be this inevitable technology that was going to build humanity&#8217;s industrial base on Mars, and that we needed to really inspire dozens, or even hundreds of companies to work on making this future happen.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Relativity Space&#8217;s focus on 3D printing and cloud-based software helps it weather the COVID-19 storm&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/relativity-spaces-focus-on-3d-printing-and-cloud-based-software-helps-it-weather-the-covid-19-storm/embed/#?secret=Q0WmBtGY2I" data-secret="Q0WmBtGY2I" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The long-term goal for Relativity Space, Ellis said, has always been to become an &#8220;end-product 3D-printing company,&#8221; with its original Terran 1 light payload rocket simply representing the first of those products it&#8217;s bringing to market.</p>
<p>&#8220;3D printing is our new tech stack for aerospace, and really is rewriting something that we don&#8217;t feel has fundamentally changed over the last 60 years,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really bringing automation that replaces the factory fixed tooling, supply chains, hundreds of thousands of parts, manual labor and slow iteration speed, with something that I believe is needed for the future on Earth, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Terran R, which will have a payload capacity of over 20,000 kg (more than 44,000 lbs.) to low-Earth orbit, is simply &#8220;the next logical step&#8221; for Relativity in that long-term vision of producing a wide range of products, including aerospace equipment for use right here on Earth. Ellis says that a larger launch vehicle makes sense given current strong customer demand for Terran 1, which has a max payload capacity of 1,250 kg (around 2,755 lbs.) to low-Earth orbit, combined with the average size of satellites being launched today. Despite the boon in so-called &#8220;small&#8221; satellites, many of the constellations being built today have individual satellites that weigh in excess of 500 kg (1,100 lbs.), Ellis points out, which means that Terran R will be able to delivery many more at once for these growing on-orbit spacecraft networks.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really the same rocket architecture, it&#8217;s the same propellant, same factory, it&#8217;s the same printers, the same avionics and the same team that developed Terran 1,&#8221; Ellis said about the forthcoming rocket. That means that it&#8217;s actually relatively easy for the company to spin up its new production line, despite Terran R actually being quite functionally different than the current, smaller rocket — particularly when it comes to its full reusability.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Terran R will have both a reusable first and second stage. SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9&#8217;s first stage (a liquid fuel rocket booster) is reusable and detaches from the second stage before quickly reorienting itself and reentering Earth&#8217;s atmosphere for a propulsive landing just after entering space. The Falcon 9 second stage is expendable, which is the space term for essentially just junk that&#8217;s discarded and eventually de-orbits and burns up on reentry.</p>
<p>SpaceX had planned to try to make the Falcon 9 second stage reusable, but it would&#8217;ve required too much additional mass via heat shielding for it to make sense with the economics it was targeting. Ellis was light on details about Terran R&#8217;s specifics, but he did hint that some unique use of fairly unusual materials made possible though 3D printing, along with some sparing use of generative design, will be at work in helping the Relativity rocket&#8217;s second stage reusable in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s still entirely 3D-printed, we&#8217;re actually going to use more exotic materials and design geometries that wouldn&#8217;t be possible at all, traditionally, to manufacture,&#8221; Ellis said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just too complicated looking; it would be way too difficult to manufacture traditionally in the ways that Terran R is designed. And that will actually make it a much more reusable rocket, and really helped build the best reusable rocket possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Terran R will also use a new upper-stage engine that Relativity Space is designing, which is also unique compared to the existing engines used on Terran 1. It&#8217;s 3D-printed as well, but uses a copper thrust chamber that will allow it to have higher overall power and thrust capabilities, according to Ellis. When I spoke to Ellis on Thursday evening, Relativity had just completed its first full successful duration test of the new engine, a key step toward full production.</p>
<p>Ellis said that the company will share more about Terran R over the course of this year, but did note that the existing large 3D printers in its production facilities are already sized correctly to start building the new rocket — &#8220;The only change is software,&#8221; he said. He also added that some of the test sites Relativity has contracted to use at NASA&#8217;s Stennis Space Center are able to support testing of a rocket at Terran R&#8217;s scale, too, so it sounds like he&#8217;s planning for rapid progress on this new launch vehicle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://newness.com/">Newness</a>, a startup co-founded by former Twitch employees, has raised $3.5 million in a Sequoia-led seed round for its live-streaming platform aimed at beauty creators and their fan communities. Though today&#8217;s creators are not without options when it comes to livestreaming &#8212; Twitch, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook are all popular choices &#8212; Newness is focused on building differentiated tools and features that work well for the beauty streamer market in particular. This includes offering options for both public and private streams, engagement mechanisms that reward positive contributions, moderation features and the ability for fans to earn access to free beauty products by community participation.</p>
<p>In the new round, Jess Lee invested on behalf of Sequoia Capital. Other investors in <a href="https://newness.com/">Newness</a> include Cowboy Ventures (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/aileen-lee">Aileen Lee)</a>, Upside Partnership (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/kent-goldman">Kent Goldman)</a>, Dream Machine (former TechCrunch editor <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/alexia-tsotsis">Alexia Bonatsos</a>), Index Ventures (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/nina-achadjian">Nina Achadjian</a>), Twitch co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlin3/">Kevin Lin</a>, former Twitch execs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jshipman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jshipman/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614378233472000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFm84exhRM_tMimQ5UzW5bWNhj-Dg">Jonathan Shipman</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-sutton-b986611/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-sutton-b986611/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614378233472000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAVm0w-lsAvnzZLdzxEnutTIugGg">John Sutton</a>, Eventbrite founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hartz/">Kevin</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliahartz/">Julia Hartz</a>, Incredible Health co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/imanabuzeid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/imanabuzeid/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614378233472000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE-IkRj2ZLpeD3W5-QeVIqjFMXNxw">Iman Abuzeid</a> and other angel investors from Twitch.</p>
<p>The idea for Newness comes from CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennyqian">Jenny Qian</a>, an early Twitch employee who held a number of roles at the game-streaming site over the years, most recently as the senior director of Business Strategy for Twitch&#8217;s video platform. She&#8217;s joined by CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/youripark/">Youri Park</a>, who also previously worked at Twitch, as well as Blizzard and Facebook Gaming.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though always an avid gamer herself, Qian says she began getting into skincare after she turned 30. She then soon realized the potential in the livestreaming beauty space.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so used to the format from Twitch. And, in some ways, I feel like I was spoiled with livestreaming,&#8221; she explains. Being able to hang out with streamers, ask questions and learn from them was something that made the live format so compelling, she believes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118284" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118284" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118284" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="343" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg 3286w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?resize=1536,775 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1033 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118284" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Newness</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It made me scratch my head and think: Why didn&#8217;t something like this exist for the beauty community? It&#8217;s a community that is just as passionate, if not more so … and it&#8217;s a content category that is so incredibly popular. How come there isn&#8217;t a live medium available?&#8221; she wondered.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Qian admits she didn&#8217;t feel comfortable going live on Twitch.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to be made fun of for my gameplay. But I think it&#8217;s another if I take my makeup off and people are making fun of me for how I look. It just cuts to a whole new level,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>With Newness, the goal is to create a sort of anti-Twitch, in a way. It aspires to be a wholesome, positive community for beauty creators and fans, where moderation is a key focus and fans get rewarded for quality participation, not trolling.</p>
<p>When creators go live, Newness will pair them with an in-house moderator to help them feel more comfortable and to keep the content flowing. Once they&#8217;re a more established streamer, Newness will work with the creator to locate and elevate a moderator from their own fan community to help out with future streams.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fans are awarded virtual items called crystals for positive participation and good behavior &#8212; for example, for watching your favorite stream and engaging in chat. In Newness, every chat message also has a little heart next to it. And the more hearts you earn over time for higher-quality comments, the more crystals you also earn.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118291" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118291" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118291" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="587" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg 1712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg?resize=150,129 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg?resize=300,259 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg?resize=768,663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg?resize=680,587 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1326 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118291" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Newness</p></div></p>
<p>These crystals can be redeemed for full-size beauty products, which Newness will source through brand deals. Because moderators spend more time on the platform, they&#8217;ll also earn more crystals &#8212; and that means more opportunities for products.</p>
<p>The positive reward system has so far proven successful during beta tests, as around 66% of Newness viewers, on average, end up chatting during live streams, Qian says.</p>
<p>Another differentiating feature for Newness is the ability for creators to host both public and private streams. The latter is not meant to be some sort of OnlyFans equivalent, but is instead focused on allowing creators to host more professional and exclusive live events. With private streams, creators can sell both general admission and even pricier VIP tickets that could come with some sort of reward &#8212; like a goodie bag of beauty supplies.</p>
<p>In addition to events, Newness supports an in-app tipping mechanism called &#8220;gifting&#8221; on everyday streams.</p>
<p>Eventually, the startup plans to take a share of the revenue these transactions generate, but it hasn&#8217;t yet rolled that out as it&#8217;s still beta testing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118469" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118469" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118469" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118469" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Newness</p></div></p>
<p>At present, the Newness community is small. And it still chooses which creators are allowed to livestream.</p>
<p>&#8220;We handpick the creators that we let on to our platform and keep it invite-only because we want to make sure that our earliest creators are helping to set the tone and building the culture of the community,&#8221; she says. The startup wants to ensure there are enough community members to sustain itself, while also not allowing the community to become toxic as it scales.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really care about cultivating an incredibly wholesome community. So for us, safety, moderation &#8212; all that is really important to us,&#8221; Qian notes.</p>
<p>The creators produce a range of content, including more expert advice and product reviews to more casual &#8220;get ready with me&#8221; videos and vlogs.</p>
<p>Newness, of course, will face steep competition from larger, existing platforms for streamers, like YouTube and Instagram, as well as from newcomers more focused on beauty videos, like <a href="https://supergreat.com/">Supergreat</a>.</p>
<p>The startup has been in beta testing since last year and is only available on the web for the time being. With the seed funding, Newness expects to build out its iOS consumer app in 2021, to complement its dedicated streaming app for creators. (Creators can also opt to stream from their DSLRs, if they prefer.)</p>
<p>It also aims to hire engineering talent and build out its 14-person team that&#8217;s now spread out across San Francisco, New York (thanks to some ex-Glossier hires), and L.A.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The murder of George Floyd last May ignited many things in the United States last year &#8212; one of which that was perhaps unexpected: a rise in the number of digital banks targeting the Black community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some members of the Black community took their belief that big banks are not meeting their needs and turned them into startup concepts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those startups, First Boulevard (formerly called Tenth), has just raised $5 million in seed funding from Barclays, Anthemis and a group of angel investors such as actress Gabrielle Union, Union Square Ventures&#8217; John Buttrick and AutoZone CFO Jamere Jackson.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For co-founder and CEO </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-j-hawkins/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Hawkins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the genesis for the Overland, Kansas-bank came after Floyd’s murder, when he and friend </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asyabradley/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asya Bradley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were talking about what Black America “really needed to get out of a vicious cycle” of dealing with the same issues with no real solutions in sight.</span></p>

Image Credits: <span style="font-weight: 400;">First Boulevard</span></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After viewing yet another tragedy engulf the Black community, and the all-too-familiar protests against persisting issues,” Hawkins said, “it was beyond clear to me that the solutions Black America needs must be financially focused and developed within our community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair both had fintech experience. Hawkins had founded Griffin Technologies, a company focused on providing real-time, contextual intelligence to community banks and credit unions. And Bradley most recently was a founding team member and head of revenue at Synapse, a platform that built banking-as-a-service APIs to help bank the unbanked of America by connecting fintech platforms to banking institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They discovered there were only about 19 Black banks in the U.S., collectively holding about $5 billion in assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And their technology was really behind the times,” Hawkins said. “We also took a hard look at some of the existing digital banks to really see who was really going about it in the same way that we felt like America needed, and it was pretty clear at that point, that no one was really attacking the issue of helping Black America build some level of financial stability through the form of a wealth-building play.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair formed First Boulevard last August under the premise that Black Americans are “massively underserved consumers” of financial products and services despite having a collective spending power of </span><a href="https://www.catalyst.org/research/buying-power/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.4 trillion annually</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The startup’s mission is to empower Black Americans “to take control of their finances, build wealth and reinvest in the Black economy” via a digitally native platform. First Boulevard has 100,000 people on its waitlist currently with an expected launch in the third quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Part of its goal with the new capital involves building out a Black business marketplace, which will give its members Cash Back for Buying Black<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. It also plans to use the money to expand its team, increase its customer base and grow its platform to offer fee-free debit cards, financial education and on developing technology to help members automate their saving and wealth-building goals.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;For more equitable startup funding, the &#8216;money behind the money&#8217; needs to be accountable, too&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/for-more-equitable-startup-funding-the-money-behind-the-money-needs-to-be-accountable-too/embed/#?secret=4MJd2aT7do" data-secret="4MJd2aT7do" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">History has proven that oppressed communities can succeed when their finances are centralized, and when it comes to financial services for the Black community, a centralizing force is long overdue,” Hawkins said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bank’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash Back for Buying Black<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> program helps members earn up to 15% cash back when they spend money at Black-owned businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe the most recent stat was that 41% of Black-owned businesses have closed since COVID-19 started,” Hawkins said. “We want to support them as much as we can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Boulevard also is focused on passively building wealth for its communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Black America as a whole has been blocked from learning how money works. We want to connect our members to wealth-building assets such as micro investments like money market accounts, high-yield savings and cryptocurrency &#8212; things that Black America has largely been blocked from,&#8221; Hawkins said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bradley, who serves as First Boulevard’s COO, believes the current financial industry was not built to serve the needs of melanated people. Its goal is to take their understanding of the unique needs of the Black community to provide things such as early access to wages, round-up savings features, targeted financial education and budgeting tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair aims to have a “fully inclusive” team that represents the community it’s trying to serve. Currently, its 20-person staff is 60% Black and 85% BIPOC. Two-thirds of its leadership team are women and 100% is BIPOC. The company plans to boost its headcount to 50 by year&#8217;s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are very proud of that considering that in the fintech space, those are not normal numbers from a leadership perspective,” Bradley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katie Palencsar, an investor at the Female Innovators Lab by Barclays and Anthemis, said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that her firm has always recognized “that access to financial services has long remained a challenge despite the digital evolution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is especially true for Black Americans who often reside in financial deserts and struggle to find platforms that truly look to serve them,” she said. “First Boulevard deeply understands the challenge.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palencsar believes that First Boulevard’s mission of helping Black Americans not just bank, but actually build wealth, is unique in the market.</span></p>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Boulevard sees the wealth gap that continues to grow within the U.S. and wants to build a digital banking platform that addresses the systemic and structural challenges that face this population while enabling Black Americans and allies to invest in the community,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also recently announced a partnership with Visa, under which First Boulevard will be first to pilot Visa’s new suite of crypto APIs. First Boulevard will also launch a First Boulevard Visa Debit card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Boulevard is one of several digital banks geared toward Black Americans that have emerged in recent months. <a href="http://www.paybby.com">Paybby</a>, a digital bank for the Black and brown communities, recently acquired Wicket, a neobank that uses AI and biometric technology to create a personalized experience for users. Hassan Miah, the CEO and founder of Paybby, said the bank’s goal is to be “the leading smart, digital bank for the Black and brown communities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paybby, which started by offering a bank account and a way to expedite PPP loans, will soon be adding a cryptocurrency savings account for the Black and brown communities.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Black buying power is projected to grow to $1.8 trillion by 2024,” Miah said. “Brown buying power is over $2 trillion. Paybby wants to take a good portion of this multitrillion-dollar market and give it back to these communities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last October,</span> Greenwood <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/greenwood-closes-3-million-seed-round-to-build-online-banking-solution-for-blacks-and-latinx-301147915.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $3 million in seed funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from private investors to build what it describes as “the first digital banking platform for Black and Latinx people and business owners.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, co-founder Ryan Glover, founder of Bounce TV network, said it was “no secret that traditional banks have failed the Black and Latinx community.”</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> were all here to chat through the week’s biggest tech happenings. Before we get into this week&#8217;s show, make sure to check out all the news <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/the-equity-podcast-is-getting-bigger-and-better/">here</a> about how Equity is expanding, and becoming even more of a thing in 2021! We are beyond hyped about it.</p>
<p>Coming on the back of such a wild news week, we had to cut and cut from the notes doc to get the show to size. So, here&#8217;s what made the cut:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coinbase filed to go public. Alex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">wrote about its S-1 filing here</a>, and Danny <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/usv-has-been-aggressively-selling-off-shares-in-coinbase-in-run-up-to-ipo/">riffed on a fascinating nuance regarding its cap table here</a>.</li>
<li>Hopin is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/vcs-are-chasing-hopin-upwards-of-5-6b-valuation/">raising more money, at an even larger valuation</a>. Every time we cover the latest version of this story, we think it must be the last time. And then it happens again. So, check back here in October for when Hopin raises again.</li>
<li>Reddit also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/reddit-series-e-more-capital/">picked up more money</a>. Again. Our take is that the capital must mean that Reddit is a better business than we anticipated.</li>
<li>Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian backed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/chief-community-officer-is-the-new-cmo/?tpcc=ECTW2020">new community tool</a> proving the monetary value of the community. That led us into a conversation about a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/contra-series-a/">professional network for independent workers</a> that is competing with LinkedIn, and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/the-landing-is-bringing-shoppable-social-and-collaboration-to-interior-design/">collaborative workspace for interior design fans. </a></li>
<li>Toast is said to be on the road to an IPO, so we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/understanding-toasts-expected-ipo-through-the-lens-of-olos-2020-results/?tpcc=ECTW2020">riffed on what Olo&#8217;s IPO can tell us</a> about the Boston-based unicorn.</li>
<li>Shippo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/shippo-raises-45m-more-at-495m-valuation-as-ecommerce-booms/">raised more money after a big 2020</a>; can the company double again in 2021?</li>
<li>Finix raised $3 million through an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/fintech-startup-finix-closes-on-3m-in-black-and-latinx-investor-led-spv/">SPV filled with more than 80 Black and LatinX investors. </a></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wondering how to nail that virtual pitch meeting and raise VC funding? Or how to build a high-octane sales team? What about recruiting early team members that will fuel future growth? Managing the finances of a new company while also wondering about your own personal finances as a founder? Legal? Marketing? PR?
