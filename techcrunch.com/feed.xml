										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">British artificial intelligence (AI) company, Faculty has raised £30 million ($42.5M) in growth funding from the Apax Digital Fund (ADF). The startup has now raised a total of £40m ($56.6M) to date.</p>
<p>In April this year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/ai-startup-faculty-wins-contract-to-predict-future-requirements-for-the-uks-nhs/">announced</a> it had won a contract to work with the UK&#8217;s NHS to better predict its future needs. It has also picked up at least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/vote-leave-ai-firm-wins-seven-government-contracts-in-18-months">seven other</a> UK government contracts. Its customers include the UK’s National Crime Agency, Red Bull, Virgin Media, and Moonpig.</p>
<p>The company says it now expects to create over 400 new jobs across its engineering, product and delivery teams. The investment will also be put toward the rollout of Faculty’s new learning and development programme. Founded in 2014 by Dr Marc Warner, Dr Angie Ma and Andrew Brookes, the company is noted for its fondness for hiring swathes of maths and data science PhDs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Far from being an aloof R&amp;D AI operation, Faculty pitches more as an “AI as a Service”, applying its platform to real-world data for the purposes of real-world outcomes, such as optimizing a company’s marketing spend or forecasting demand for consumer goods. That said, Faculty became briefly notorious after applying its platform to the cause of Vote Leave during the UK referendum.</p>
<p>After helping the campaign win that fight, it’s ironically now been <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/faculty-ai-brexit-fishing">awarded</a> a public contract to help the British government apply machine learning to Britain’s post-Brexit fishing waters, even as the fishing industry <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1427654/brexit-news-uk-eu-fishing-british-boats-crew-boris-johnson-trade-deal">comes under considerable strain</a>&#8230; because of Brexit.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call Marc Warner, CEO, and co-founder of Faculty told me the company has no plans to work in the political sphere again: “Never again. It&#8217;s very controversial. I don&#8217;t want to make out that I think politics is unethical. Trying to make the world better, in whatever dimension you can, is a good thing… But from our perspective, it was, you know, ‘noisy’, and our goal as an organization is, despite current appearances to the contrary, is not to spend tonnes of time talking about this stuff. We do believe this is an important technology that should be out there and should be in a broader set of hands than just the tech giants, who are already very good at it.”</p>
<p>Of the investment, he said: &#8220;This is about doubling down on the UK first and then international expansion. We have learned what it takes to do important, impactful AI at scale. And we just don&#8217;t think that there&#8217;s actually much of it out there. Customers are rightly sometimes a bit skeptical. There&#8217;s been hype around this stuff for years and years. We figured out a bunch of real-world applications that actually deliver value. And so, ultimately, the money [we’ve raised] is really just about being able to build out all of the pieces to do that incredibly well for our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that Faculty plans to continue to take advantage of the UK&#8217;s talent pool: &#8220;The UK is a wonderful place to do AI. It has brilliant universities and a very dynamic startup scene. It&#8217;s actually more diverse than San Francisco. There&#8217;s government, there&#8217;s finance, there&#8217;s corporates, there&#8217;s less competition from the tech giants, so there&#8217;s a bit more of a heterogeneous ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Mark Beith, partner at Apax Digital, who joins Faculty’s board of directors, said: “Faculty is a world-leading AI company with cutting-edge technology, inspiring people and culture, and with phenomenal customer feedback. They enable customers to realize the tremendous value of AI quickly but responsibly, providing robust, fair, and explainable AI, with advanced data privacy. We have seen the power and impact of their solutions first-hand, as a client, and are thrilled to partner with Marc, Angie, Andy, and the team to support their global expansion.”</p>
<p>The Apax Digital Fund joins Faculty’s existing investors, including Guardian Media Group Ventures, LocalGlobe, and Jaan Tallinn, one of Skype’s founding engineers.</p>
<p>The Estonian investor <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/11/13/jaan-tallinn-ai-safety-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-elon-musk/">gave</a> Faculty 350 units of Ether in January 2018, worth about $434,000 at the time, and 50 Bitcoins in March 2020, worth about $316,000, according to Faculty’s financial filings at the U.K. business registry Companies House.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">These days, the path of least resistance in laptop design is straight-up knocking off the MacBook. We’ve certainly seen our share of egregious cases over the years. Microsoft, however, has defiantly forged its own path with industrial design across the board. Its products are largely interesting and innovative &#8212; something not every hardware manufacturer can say these days.</p>
<p>The company doesn’t always get it right. It swung for the fences with the Surface Duo, for example. While certainly innovative, the product came up short in enough categories that made it extremely hard to recommend. The Surface Laptop, on the other hand, while not the most groundbreaking product in the line, has pretty consistently been one of the best, marrying a Windows-ready touchscreen with a more standardized notebook design.</p>

<p>The last few models have been solid, and this year’s &#8212; perhaps predictably &#8212; doesn’t present a big change. The big upgrades after about a year and a half are new chips (your choice of AMD Ryzen or an Intel Core i5 or i7) and enhanced battery life that offers a beefy additional 8.5 hours. Essentially, it&#8217;s the sort of thing you&#8217;d expect &#8212; or hope for &#8212; from a regular system refresh.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156064" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156064" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2156064" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9264.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9264.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9264.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9264.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9264.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9264.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9264.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9264.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9264.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2156064" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The design language remains largely unchanged. The Surface Laptop is nothing if not unique on that front, with its tapered sides and felt-covered palm rests. The material has a nice feel to it &#8212; one that bests just straight-up metal on a cold day, though I’ve already noticed a bit of wear after some light use.</p>
<p>The keyboard remains on the soft side, with a surprising amount of give to it. Not the best keyboard I’ve seen on a laptop, but certainly not the worst (who can forget that rough run for Apple?), and like anything else, it takes a bit of getting used to.</p>
<p>You’d think I’d have learned my lesson by now. Maybe it’s the fact that Microsoft’s Surface Laptops keep coming out when the weather is nice that I always feel inclined to take them outside. But jeez is that display reflective. Almost distractingly so. Plenty of laptop screens are glossy, of course, but Microsoft’s really leaned in here, to the point I wouldn’t recommend using it in any sort of sunshine &#8212; even at full brightness, the screen can’t counteract that reflection.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156069" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156069" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2156069" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2156069" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>When you can see it, the display looks great. Microsoft sent along the smaller of the two. At 13.5-inches, the screen clocks in at 2256 x 1504 at 201 ppi (you get the same pixel density on the 15-inch version, as well). Ours was the new Ice Blue color. It’s subtle, though. Honestly, I read it more as a silver/gray. The speakers sound great, and the webcam is just fine, but it’s safe to say it’s probably time to upgrade to 1080p across the board as teleconferencing remains front of mind.</p>
<p>The 13.5-inch system starts at $1,000, which gets you 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, along with the AMD Ryzen 5 4680U process. As configured, our system runs $1,700, which doubles the RAM and storage and swaps the AMD in for an Intel Core i7. Another $600 will double the RAM and storage yet again (same processor). Geekbench scored the processor at a solid 1378 on single-core and 4876 on multi-core. Performance was solid throughout &#8212; though after spending a fair amount of time using Apple’s M1, it’s clear that Intel has its work cut out for it.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2156063,2156069,2156068,2156067,2156066,2156064,2156062,2156061,2156060"]</p>
<p>Microsoft is still hanging onto its magnetic proprietary charging port here. I know it still has its diehard fans, but I’d much prefer to see the company go with something more universal, like adding another USB-C port &#8212; though that impacts the system’s compatibility with a slew of different Surface accessories. Around the other side you get USB-A, USB-C and a headphone jack. It’s a nice mix, but more ports would certainly be a step up.</p>
<p>I was fairly disappointed with the various corners the company cut on the Surface Laptop Go last year. Of course, the entry-level 13.5-inch Laptop is $300 more than the 12-inch Laptop Go. But if you’re looking to do more than just the basics, this is probably is a wise investment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three months after air transport data giant SITA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/sita-airline-passenger-breach/">reported a data breach</a>, we are still learning about the damage.</p>
<p>Air India said this week that personal data of about 4.5 million passengers had been compromised following the incident at SITA, Indian flag carrier airline’s data processor. The stolen information included  passengers’ name, credit card details, date of birth, contact information, passport information, ticket information, Star Alliance and Air India frequent flyer data, Air India <a href="http://www.airindia.in/images/pdf/Data-Breach-Notification.pdf">said in a statement</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>CVV/CVC data of credit cards were not held by SITA, said Air India as it urged passengers to change passwords “wherever applicable to ensure safety of their personal data.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The attack compromised data of passengers who had registered with the Indian airline over the past decade, between August 26, 2011 and February 3, 2021, Air India said in a statement.</p>
<p>The revelation comes months after SITA said it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/sita-airline-passenger-breach/">suffered a data breach</a> that involved passenger data. At the time, SITA said it had notified several airlines &#8212; Malaysia Airlines, Finnair, Singapore Airlines, Jeju Air, Cathay Pacific, Air New Zealand, and Lufthansa &#8212; of the breach.</p>
<p>The Geneva, Switzerland-headquartered firm &#8212; which is said to serve 90% of the world’s airlines &#8212; had declined to reveal the specific data that had been compromised at the time of disclosure in early March, citing an investigation &#8212; which is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Air India said that it was first notified about the cyber attack by SITA on February 25, but the nature of the data was only provided to it on March 25 and April 5.</p>
<p>The struggling Indian airline, which has been surviving on taxpayer’s money, claimed that it had investigated the security incident, secured the compromised servers, engaged with unnamed external specialists, notified the credit card issuers, and had reset passwords of its frequent flyer program.</p>
<p>Air India is the latest Indian firm to disclose a data breach in recent quarters. Payments giant MobiKwik said in late March that it was investigating claims of a data breach that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/mobikwik-investigating-data-breach-after-100m-user-records-found-online/">allegedly exposed private information of nearly 100 million users</a>.</p>
<p>Alleged records of nearly 20 million BigBasket (a top grocery delivery startup in India that is now owned by local conglomerate Tata) customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/hacker-publishes-alleged-records-of-20-million-bigbasket-users/">leaked on the dark web</a> for anyone to download in late April. A security lapse at Indian telecom giant Jio Platforms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/02/jio-coronavirus-security-lapse/">exposed results of some users</a> who had used its tool to check their coronavirus symptoms. Indian state <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/india-west-bengal-health-covid-security/">West Bengal</a> and giant blood test firm Dr Lal PathLabs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/dr-lal-pathlabs-exposed-patient-lab-data/">suffered similar breaches</a>. Air India&#8217;s peer, Spicejet, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/spicejet-breach-millions-passengers/">confirmed a data breach last year</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups used to be obsessed with billboards. It was the first thing I noticed when I moved to San Francisco: venture-backed companies including Eaze, Airbnb, and notoriously, Brex, would post large billboard advertisements all over the city to grab attention and eyeballs. When I dug into it more, I learned this type of old school, outdoor advertising was a response to the increasingly crowded online channels, such as Facebook and Instagram advertisements.</p>
<p>Well, folks, years later, we have a new response to crowded marketing channels: Ditch the billboards and just buy a media company instead. There has been a recent push for startups and venture capital firms to acquire or create media companies, which I’d argue is them finding a creative way to position content marketing. This past week, Axios discovered that <a href="https://www.axios.com/coinbase-media-editor-crypto-682b8dca-11dd-4efc-93ef-ecb50ecdda35.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;utm_source=twitter">Coinbase is launching a media operation</a> about cryptocurrency. At the same time, Clubhouse wants to <a href="https://twitter.com/lexinisita/status/1395091872578686980">hire freelance writers</a>, while its biggest lead investor to-date, Andreessen Horowitz, has ambitions to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-looks-to-launch-opinion-publication-as-its-media-ambition-grows">open up an opinion desk.</a> Other news bits like The Skimm exploring a potential sale and Hubspot acquiring the Hustle also add to the narrative of broader media ambitions across tech.</p>
<p>We got into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/linkedin-is-the-reason-apple-made-the-m1-chip/?tpcc=ECTW2020">the impact of a venture-backed media push</a> on Equity, our award-winning (!) podcast, this week. My take, as you can tell by this introduction, is that it’s not a rush to compete with journalism. It’s a rush to compete with a noisy world, and rebrand advertisements to media operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I could talk about journalism and tech and media forever, but that is all on that topic today. In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll get into new IPOs, startups providing upfront revenue to other startups and tactical advice on building versus buying a tech stack. As always, you can find me podcasting <a href="https://twitter.com/EquityPod">@Equitypod</a> and tweeting at <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a>.</p>
<h2>IP(Oats)</h2>
<p>Oatly went public this week, and there entirely weren’t enough jokes or puns about it. (<a href="https://twitter.com/sarthakgh/status/1395514832154243072">Although I did appreciate this one</a>). My complaint aside, <strong>i</strong>t’s been a busy week for the public markets.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Marqueta, which is focused on card issuing and payments tech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/inside-marqetas-fascinating-fintech-ipo/">has a fascinating S-1 filing</a> — including what I’d say it’s a Peloton-Affirm relationship with Square. Alex dug into the numbers and told you what to think about its filing in The Exchange.</p>

<h2>Build or buy?</h2>
<p>Telemedicine needs to prepare for a post-pandemic world, which comes with its own upfront costs, risks, and, as Marcela points out, opportunities. Around $3.1 billion in funding flowed into the sector in 2020 — about three times what we saw in 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/telemedicine-startups-are-positioning-themselves-for-a-post-pandemic-world/">according to her latest story.</a> In order to get money and impact out, startups have some work to do.</p>

<h2>Pipe’s get burst</h2>
<p>Everyone is paying attention to Pipe, which just raised $250 million at a $2 billion valuation. As Mary Ann puts it, the company is claiming to be the Nasdaq for revenue, and it gives SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront by “pairing them with investors on a marketplace who will pay a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts.”</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> That wasn’t the only check that went into startups providing other startups with upfront revenue this week. Uncapped, which is the European equivalent of Pipe, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/uncapped-which-provides-upfront-revenue-to-digital-companies-raises-80m-in-funding/">raised $80 million in funding</a>. Put differently, in less than 24 hours, TechCrunch reported that nearly $330 million went into backing the concept of startups providing other startups with upfront revenue.</p>
<p><em>Other dollar signs to pay attention to:</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p>The huge sale of Utah-based startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/brex-ramp-tout-their-view-of-the-future-as-divvy-is-said-to-consider-a-sale-to-bill-com/">Divvy to Bill.com</a> is still bouncing around my head this week, not only because the $2.5 billion exit was huge for both the company and its local scene, but also because its target market is exciting to watch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Divvy competes in what we call the corporate spend market with a few other unicorns, including Ramp and Brex. Now with Divvy taken off the table, the pair of competitors are differentiating in a few ways that matter.</p>
<p>And Brex is getting back on its billboard game.</p>
<p>This week Brex <a href="https://www.brex.com/posts/integrated-marketing/">announced</a> that it is rolling out IRL advertising in a few American cities. Residents of San Francisco back when Brex was a baby will recall how the startup plastered its brand all over the city. Essentially, it was a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/brex-corporate-card-for-startups-covers-san-francisco-with-billboards-2018-8">cheap way</a> to get a lot of impressions.</p>
<p>Now the startup is taking the strategy to Houston and Miami and D.C. Why? The Exchange caught up with Brex CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/hdubugras">Henrique Dubugras</a> this week to chat about the matter. Per the executive, his company has two goals for its renewed meatspace marketing push. First, Brex wants to talk up its software game over its initial branding as a corporate card for startups. And, second, it wants business owners to know that it works with all types of companies now, not merely those with Sand Hill Road on speed dial.</p>
<p>The push to get the Brex name out in markets less known for their startup activity than overall business climate makes sense, if the unicorn wants to attract more nonstartup customers. But it’s the software element of its efforts that unsurprisingly caught our attention.</p>
<p>That’s because Brex recently rolled out Brex Premium, a package of software services that it charges around $600 per year for. Brex and rivals like Ramp and Divvy have spent lots of energy and money in recent quarters building out increasingly sophisticated software around their traditional corporate card products. The result thus far are codebases more and more able to supplant other pieces of enterprise software, like expense software.</p>
<p>But as Brex looks to double down via an advertising push on its decision to charge for Brex Premium &#8212; which Dubugras says is performing better than his company had initially anticipated &#8212; competitor Ramp is pushing its free software as an edge.</p>
<p>Ramp CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/eglyman">Eric Glyman</a> pointed The Exchange to his company’s refreshed pricing page, which <a href="https://ramp.com/pricing">highlights</a> its zero-cost software. And, he said in an email, the new page was “powering the fastest growth month we’ve ever had.”</p>
<p>Broadly, what we’re seeing with Ramp and Brex and Divvy &#8212; along with Airbase and others that also compete in the space &#8212; is a cohort of startups attacking an aged corporate issue with more nimble, lower-cost products. And proving while doing so that there was huge untapped demand for something different and better. The various players competing for the startup crown in the corporate spend world wouldn’t all be growing as rapidly as they are if that weren’t the case.</p>
<p>If you want more, here’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/why-did-bill-com-pay-2-5b-for-divvy/"> our dig into the Divvy-Bill.com deal</a>.</p>
<h2>More from startup-land</h2>
<p>The Exchange was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/as-zynga-impresses-rival-mobile-gaming-shop-jam-city-looks-to-list-via-spac/">lathered up</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/industrial-automation-startup-bright-machines-hauls-in-435m-by-going-public-via-spac/">SPACs this week</a>, which means that we missed a host of interesting news that we otherwise would have loved to poke into. For example, here are some very neat venture rounds that it would have been fun to dig into more deeply:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ProducePay raised a $43M Series C:</strong> LA-based <a href="https://producepay.com/">ProducePay</a> helps <em>food growers</em> access capital, software and market data, linking them to <em>food demanders (importers, etc.)</em>. Per its website, ProducePay funded a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Bajio">Bajío, Mexico</a>-based asparagus growing operation to the tune of a half million dollars to hire labor and invest in its growing operation. Repayment, again per the company, starts when product ships.</li>
<li>Farming is hard, fickle, expensive and not always aligned with traditional banking requirements. Throw in an increasingly global production/consumption food network, and you can see why G2VP and IFC co-led the round.</li>
<li>Oh, and The Exchange learned that ProducePay’s reported 2020 doubling was measured in GAAP revenue terms. The startup’s gross margins “grew by over 75% from 2019 to 2020, thanks to improved underwriting policies and a more attractive cost of funds as volume scaled,” per its PR team. That’s super cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another neat company that raised this week was <a href="https://www.panther.co/">Panther</a>, which put together a $2.5 million round. Panther wants to help companies hire in 160 different countries. Our read of the company and its round is that, as more companies go remote-first, this sort of service is going to become a must-have. Gusto also competes in the market, so it should be an active one to watch from both VC <em>and</em> M&amp;A perspectives.</p>
<p>Panther is based in Florida, and raised funds from, per its release, “Tribe Capital, Eric Ries, Naval Ravikant and Carta Ventures.”</p>
<p>One more round: <a href="https://www.lancebank.co/">Lance</a>, a freelancer-focused neobank, raised $2.8 million this week. The round was led by, per the company, “Barclays, BDMI, Great Oaks Capital, Imagination Capital, Techstars, DFJ Frontier, New York Venture Partners” along with some angels.</p>
<p>Now that the fintech world has created Chime and other broad-remit neobanks, it’s not surprising to see more targeted efforts get put together. And Lance CEO Oona Rokyta is betting that the freelance world is set to grow further. Given how the labor market has evolved in the last few years, I’d hazard she’s making an intelligent bet.</p>
<p>To close out today, a quick note on <a href="https://alpaca.markets/">Alpaca</a>. It’s a startup that TechCrunch has dug into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/alpaca-raises-10m-series-a-for-its-api-powered-equities-trading-service/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/08/alpaca-stock-trading-api/">there</a>, as it fits into both our general focus on API-delivered services (on-demand pricing is hot), and it exists in the consumer fintech world (powering other companies’ equities trading services). We caught up with CEO Yoshi Yokokawa this week to chat about what’s been going on at his company since we last tracked its growth rates.</p>
<p>After all, whatever we can learn about the world of consumer investing &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/robinhoods-epic-q1-growth-explains-its-fundraising-boom/">and Robinhood told us quite a lot this week</a> &#8212; is useful given the somewhat global savings/investing boom that we’ve seen in the last year or so.</p>
<p>Per Yokokawa, Alpaca has global plans, including rolling out with new partners on a few continents in the coming months. The company is handling 1,000 new accounts daily outside the United States, which Yokokawa expects to rise sharply in the coming months. And the company recently built out a broker API to make onboarding users simpler for its partners.</p>
<p>Sounds like growth to us. More when we can milk it out of, er, the alpaca.</p>

<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week we&#8217;re reviewing Google&#8217;s I/O developer event, rounding up the latest from Snap&#8217;s partner summit and taking a look at how Parler got back on the App Store, among other things.</p>

<h3>Google I/O was kinda boring this year</h3>

<p><em>Sorry, sorry</em>. But it&#8217;s true. Without any new hardware announcements, the software-only event just didn&#8217;t feel as big and buzzy as it has in the past &#8212; which is kind of a bummer, since I/O was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/20/google-cancels-i-o-developer-conference-in-light-of-covid-19-crisis/">canceled entirely</a> last year due to COVID-19. There was no announcement of an <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/pixel-5a-pixel-buds-a-were-no-shows-at-google-io-so-when-will-they-launch">affordable Pixel 5a</a> or 6 smartphone, no <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/google-pixel-watch">rumored Pixel Watch</a>, no news <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-readies-its-own-chip-for-future-pixels-chromebooks-e5f8479e-4a38-485c-a264-9ef9cf68908c.html">on Pixel chips</a>, no new smart home devices, <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/google-stadia-io-2021/">no update on Google Stadia,</a> and not even the Pixel Buds A-Series, which <em>Google<a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/04/google-pixel-buds-a-series-tweet/"> accidentally tweeted</a> about</em> ahead of schedule. What gives? Instead, Google I/O was filled with a lot of product news that could have been announced as blog posts &#8212; like <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/google-stadia-io-2021/">Google Workspace improvements</a> or neat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/google-maps-to-add-more-detailed-maps-crowd-indicators-better-routing-and-more/">Google Maps</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-photos-update-adds-new-memories-and-a-locked-folder-previews-cinematic-moments/">Photos</a> features. I mean, sure, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-is-making-a-3d-life-size-video-calling-booth/">a life-size 3D video calling booth</a> is cool, but it&#8217;s not exactly going to be in your living room next year.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not to downplay Google&#8217;s technical advancements, but if you&#8217;re sitting through a long live-ish (??) event, you don&#8217;t only want to hear about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-is-making-a-3d-life-size-video-calling-booth/">more conversational AI</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442515/google-camera-app-inclusive-image-equity-skintones">less racist cameras</a> (much less from the company that just fired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/prominent-ai-ethics-researcher-says-google-fired-her/">multiple</a> AI ethics <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22292011/google-second-ethical-ai-researcher-fired">researchers</a>). You want to get excited about Google&#8217;s next new&#8230;<em>thing</em>.</p>
<p>When all was said and done, what stood out was Android 12.</p>
<p>The updated version of Google&#8217;s mobile OS with its new personalization features targets a current iPhone weakness: customization.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155999" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155999" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2155999" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-19-image-12.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="394" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-19-image-12.jpg 1726w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-19-image-12.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-19-image-12.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-19-image-12.jpg?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-19-image-12.jpg?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-19-image-12.jpg?resize=1536,890 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-19-image-12.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155999" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Image Credits:</strong> </em><a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/89736-android-12-preview-shows-off-google-new-material.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Google, compilation via Techspot</em> </a><span class="screen-reader-text"><a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/89736-android-12-preview-shows-off-google-new-material.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(opens in a new window)</a></span></p></div></p>
<p>While iOS finally added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-unveils-ios-14-with-home-screen-widgets/">support for widgets with iOS 14</a> and an App Library to clean up home screen clutter, Apple seemed almost caught off guard by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/how-to-make-the-most-of-ios-14-widgets-and-iphone-home-screen-customization/">personalization madness</a> that ensued after widgets went live. It had to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-unveils-ios-14-with-home-screen-widgets/"> quickly fix how app shortcuts worked</a> &#8212; a workaround people had been using to tediously customize their home screen icons to match their wallpaper and widgets.</p>
<p>Android 12 addresses this demand for its own users and takes things a step further. Now, when Android 12 users set a new wallpaper the system can automatically create a custom palette of colors as the Android theme, including both the dominant and complementary colors. This is applied across the OS, including in the Quick Settings under the Notification Shade, in buttons on the lock screen, widgets and more. Google calls this &#8220;Material You,&#8221; which is a bit silly but gets the point across. The phone can really start to feel like yours.</p>
<p>Material You also introduces refreshed widgets with interactive controls and easier personalization options, smoother transitions, more animations and a <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/android-security-and-privacy-recap.html">privacy dashboard</a>, where you can check in on which apps are accessing your location, mic and camera, for instance. But what sells it is how all those parts come together to present a new version of Android that actually feels fresh.</p>

<h3>Snap&#8217;s Partner Summit: AR and e-commerce and more</h3>
<p>Snap, an app with now with 500 million MAUs, this week hosted an event for its partners, where the company unleashed a host of news about what&#8217;s next for its platform, including developer tools, AR updates, shopping features and more.</p>
<p>Among the highlights was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-emphasizes-commerce-in-updates-to-its-camera-and-ar-platforms/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Snap&#8217;s computer vision-enabled Scan product,</a> which will analyze content in the camera feed to pull up matching products, similar to efforts by Pinterest and Google. Meanwhile, AR updates and partnerships with brands like Farfetch and Prada will make possible virtual try-on of clothes using AR. (Honestly, sometimes it feels like Snap&#8217;s tech is being lost in an app that&#8217;s mainly used by teenagers and young adults for socializing. Are they really Prada shoppers?)</p>

Creators can then publish to Snapchat Spotlight, which is now available on the web, as well as other platforms.</p>

Parler however, would rather the option to view hate speech be a toggle, not hidden entry, saying it would prefer to put tools in the hands of it users.

<p>AAPI, female-founded <a href="https://www.silkandsonder.com/">Silk + Sonder</a> was created by Meha Agrawal, a software engineer and PM for companies including Goldman Sachs, Stitch Fix, The Muse, and others to take an analog-first approach to mental wellness. Now, the company is launching its first mobile app after growing its me business to tens of thousands of subscribers and<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/silk-and-sonder-seed-funding/"> raising $4+ million</a> in seed funding.</p>
<p>The new app offers curated self-care experiences, daily affirmations, a community club, a private memories feature and others meant to complement the company&#8217;s analog journal/planners that are shipped to member&#8217;s doorstep monthly. In calming shades of pinks and whites, the app guides users through their wellness journey and helps them stay accountable to their goals.</p>
<p>Since the app&#8217;s soft launch this month, it&#8217;s added thousands of users, more than 50% of whom engage regularly.</p>
<p>The new app is initially available only to active subscribers, but other users will be able to join a waitlist.</p>

<p>Female-founded <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/link/v2?aid=1988&amp;lang=en&amp;scene=bio_url&amp;target=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fherd-social%2Fid1564603157">Herd</a> has been building demand for its non-toxic Instagram alternative <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@herd.social?lang=en">via TikTok</a>. Now the app is live on iOS as a beta.</p>
<p>The goal of Herd is to give users a safer, social space focused on community, not influence, clout-chasing or data collection.</p>
<p>Users can customize their home feed by interest and use sliders to control what they want to see more of less of, while also posting their own photos, saving favorites, and staying private, if they choose. At present, Herd offers a basic photo-sharing experience. There are no Stories or photo filters or videos or much of anything that could lure users away from more advanced, feature-rich social apps. But what it does have is a mission that users feel connected with &#8212; and that pushed the app to No. 18 in the Social category on the App Store on launch day, May 18. It&#8217;s now still sitting in the top 50 a few days later.</p>
<p>But ultimately, all the marketing and social buzz can&#8217;t prop up an app forever. Herd needs to capitalize on the goodwill it&#8217;s built by leaning into quickly upgrading the UI/UX so the app itself feels as fresh as the ideas it espouses.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Full disclosure: the second time I worked at a startup founded by Mark Pincus, his dog Zinga slept behind my desk and I was one of her favorite dog-sitters.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For this morning&#8217;s edition of The Exchange, Alex Wilhelm studied <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/as-zynga-impresses-rival-mobile-gaming-shop-jam-city-looks-to-list-via-spac/">information recently released by mobile gaming studio Jam City</a> as it prepares to go public in a $1.2 billion blank-check deal with DPCM Capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jam City is a bit like Zynga, but unless you are a mobile-gaming aficionado, you might not have heard of it,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Jam City has raised upwards of $300 million, including a $145 million round in 2019. At the time, the company was riding high after signing a deal with Disney to adapt some of the media giant&#8217;s intellectual property, which includes brands like Marvel, Fox and Pixar.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Almost half of all Americans play mobile games, so Alex reviewed Jam City&#8217;s investor deck, a transcript of the investor presentation call and a press release to see how it stacks up against Zynga, which &#8220;has done great in recent quarters, including posting record revenue and bookings in the first three months of 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Full disclosure: the second time I worked at a startup founded by Mark Pincus, Zinga slept behind my desk and I was one of her <em>favorite</em> dog-sitters.)</p>
<p>Thanks for reading Extra Crunch; I hope you have an excellent weekend!</p>

<p>The ability to effectively communicate can make or break your launch. It will play a role in determining who wins a new space — you or a competitor.</p>
<p>So how do you make a splash? How do you stay relevant?</p>
<p>For one, you have to stop thinking that what you are up to is interesting.</p>

<p>Whether you’re building a company or thinking about investing, it’s important to understand your strategic advantage.</p>
<p>In order to determine one, you should ask fundamental questions: What’s the long-term, sustainable reason that the company will stay in business?</p>

<p>The global pandemic has changed the way we work, including how and where we work. For those involved in the mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) industry, a notoriously relationship-driven business, this has meant in-person boardroom handshakes have been replaced by video conference calls, remote collaboration and potentially less travel in the future.</p>
<p>The pandemic has also accelerated digital transformation, and deal-makers have embraced digital tools to help them execute effectively.</p>
<p>The quickening pace of digital transformation is no longer about ensuring a competitive edge. Today, it’s also about business resilience. But what’s on the horizon, and how else will technology evolve to meet the needs of companies and deal-makers?</p>
<p>There are still many inefficiencies in managing M&amp;A, but technologies such as artificial intelligence, especially machine learning, are helping to make the process faster and easier.</p>

<p>Lew Cirne, New Relic’s founder and CEO, is stepping into the executive chairman role. He will be replaced by Bill Staples on July 1.</p>
<p>Cirne spent the last several years rebuilding the company’s platform and changing its revenue model, aiming for what he hopes is long-term success.</p>
<p>TechCrunch decided to dig into the company’s financials to see just what challenges Staples may face as he moves into the corner office. The resulting picture is one that shows a company doing hard work for a more future-aligned product map and business model, albeit one that may not generate the sort of near-term growth that gives Staples ample breathing room with public investors.</p>

<p>At long last, the Monday.com crew dropped an F-1 filing to go public in the United States. TechCrunch has long known that the company, which sells corporate productivity and communications software, has scaled north of $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).</p>
<p>The countdown to its IPO filing — an F-1, because the company is based in Israel, rather than the S-1s filed by domestic companies — has been ticking for several quarters.</p>
<p>The Exchange has been riffling through the document since it came out, and we’ve picked up on a few things to explore.</p>

<p>Until recently, integrating affordable voice-recognition software into an automobile was something from science fiction.</p>
<p>But last year, the percentage of vehicles offering in-car connected services reached 45%. By 2024, analysts predict cars with voice recognition will comprise 60% of the market.</p>

<p>Bright Machines is going public via a SPAC-led combination that will see the 3-year-old company merge with SCVX, raising gross cash proceeds of $435 million in the process.</p>
<p>After the transaction is consummated, the startup will sport an anticipated equity valuation of $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>The Bright Machines news indicates that the great SPAC chill was not a deep freeze. And the transaction itself, in conjunction with the previously announced Desktop Metal blank-check deal, implies that there is space in the market for hardware startup liquidity via SPACs. Perhaps that will unlock more late-stage capital for hardware-focused upstarts.</p>
<p>We took a look at what Bright Machines does, and then the financial details that it shared as part of its news.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, it takes 7-8 years for a successful startup to achieve an exit. But there’s a simple way to speed up the clock: Bring in one or more founders who have previous executive experience.</p>
<p>According to data gathered by Rob Olson, partner and head of data strategy at venture engine M13, startups that have two or more experienced founders tend to exit 33% faster and raise 34% less capital.</p>
<p>“Combined, these two improvements can nearly double an investor’s rate of return,” says Olson.</p>

<p>Digital health in the U.S. got a huge boost from COVID-19 as more people started consulting physicians and urgent care providers remotely in the midst of lockdowns. So much so that McKinsey estimates that up to $250 billion of the current healthcare expenditure in the U.S. has the potential to be spent virtually.</p>
<p>The prominence of digital health is undoubtedly here to stay, but how it looks and feels from provider to provider is still a debate among sector startups.</p>
<p>But for providers who want to deliver care virtually across the country, it’s not as simple as adding a Zoom invite to an annual check-up. The process requires intention every step of the way — right from the clinicians delivering remote care to the choice of payment processor.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">The influence of a founder on their company’s culture cannot be overstated. Everything from their views on the product and business to how they think about people affects how their company’s employees will behave, and since behavior, in turn, informs culture, the consequences of a founder’s early decisions can be far-reaching.</p>
<p>So it’s not surprising that Expensify has its own take on almost everything it does when you consider what its founder and CEO David Barrett learned early in his life: “Basically everyone is wrong about basically everything.”</p>
<p>As we saw in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">part 1 of this EC-1</a>, this led him to the revelation that it’s easier to figure things out for yourself than finding advice that applies to you. Eventually, these insights would inform how he would go about shaping Expensify.</p>

<p>Marqeta, long a darling of the fintech market though less well known than some companies in its sector due to its infrastructure nature, filed to go public late last week</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with Marqeta, it powers the payment card tech behind products that you use, like Square, a key customer and driver of the unicorn’s growth. Marqeta exhibits a number of fascinating fintech characteristics (majority revenue from interchange, a rabidly competitive market) that make it very interesting to unspool.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">When a founder has a work history that includes the name of the parent company of one of their key investors, you probably assume that was one of the first deals to come together. Not so with May Mobility and Toyota AI Ventures, which connected for the company’s second seed round after May went out and raised its original seed purely on the strength of its own ideas and proposed solutions.</p>
<p>That’s one of the many interesting things we learned from speaking to May Mobility co-founder and CEO Edwin Olson, as well as Chief Product Officer Nina Grooms Lee and Toyota AI Ventures founding partner Jim Adler on an episode of Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> goes down every Wednesday at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT. Our next episode is with <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-sequoia-and-vise">Sequoia’s Shaun Maguire and Vise’s Samir Vasavada</a>, and you can check out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/check-out-the-tech-leaders-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-may/">upcoming schedule right here</a>.</p>

<p>WalkMe is the second Israel-based technology company to file to go public this week: No-code startup Monday.com is also pursuing an American IPO.</p>
<p>WalkMe’s software provides visual overlays on websites that help users navigate the product in question. Per the company’s F-1 filing, other elements of its service that matter include its onboarding system, Workstation, or its “single interface to the applications within an enterprise and simplifies task completion through a natural language conversational interface and automation.” We’re including that last feature because it says “automation,” which, in the wake of the UiPath IPO, is a word worth watching. Investors are.</p>
<p>At a high level, WalkMe is a SaaS business, which means that when we digest its results we are digging into a modern software company. Let’s do just that.</p>

<p>Squarespace&#8217;s reference price has been set at $50 per share.</p>
<p>We went over Squarespace’s recently disclosed Q2 and full-2021 guidance and asked how its expectations compare to its reference-price-defined pre-trading valuation. Then, we set some stakes in the ground regarding historical direct-listing results and what we might expect from the company as it adds a third set of data to our quiver.</p>

<p>Mumbai-based Emeritus, an edtech company that works with universities to create online upskilling courses for employed folks, just spent a big chunk of cash to break into K-12.</p>
<p>Emeritus, which is part of the Eruditus group, announced this week that it plans to acquire iD Tech, a STEM education service for children. The acquisition, which has not yet closed, is estimated to be around $200 million and leaves iD Tech operating as an independent brand for now.</p>
<p>ID Tech brings a whole different set of customers to its umbrella: The startup offers courses for elementary through high-school students across the globe taught by college students in the U.S.</p>

<p>Electric vehicle company Arrival wants to break the current auto manufacturing model. Instead of one giant factory and an assembly line, Arrival’s commercial electric vans, buses and cars are robotically built in small, regional microfactories, of which the company wants to open 31 by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>If you want to achieve something radically more efficient, you have to go deeper, into complex, high-level computational algorithms that are not normally used in consumer-facing products.</p>
<p>The London-based company, founded in 2015, joined the ranks of EV companies going public via SPAC, merging with blank-check company CIIG Merger Corp. in March. UPS has already ordered 10,000 of Arrival’s robotically engineered vans, and the company recently signed a deal with Uber to create purpose-built EVs for ride-hail drivers.</p>
<p>Arrival founder Denis Sverdlov has been at the intersection of technological advancement and societal change before.</p>

<p>The fear of missing out (FOMO) spreads faster than wildfire and often overwhelms rational decision-making.</p>
<p>In the VC community, investors look for lessons from disruptive startups they can use to identify other potential winners. But hype leads to bad decision-making, rushed due diligence and wishful thinking.</p>
<p>When and if those startups actually do well, “irrational FOMO takes over” because the initial assessment was based on bad information, says Victor Echevarria, a partner at Jackson Square Ventures. &#8220;Trends are addictive; to remain disciplined and avoid hype is to deny our innate instincts.&#8221;</p>
<p>It’s natural for investors to follow the crowd, but in the race to the bottom, FOMO can be high-octane fuel.</p>

<p>The Exchange explores Robinhood&#8217;s financial results using the lens of payment for order flow (PFOF) income, which the company said during a congressional hearing constitutes the majority of its revenues.</p>
<p>This particular revenue growth — or the lack thereof — is a good way to understand not only Robinhood’s own results but also its larger market. If Robinhood is seeing rapid growth and strong trading volumes, we can infer with some confidence that others in its space are enjoying a related, if not similar, level of interest.</p>
<p>For Public.com, eToro and others like Freetrade (as well as our own understanding), how Robinhood performed recently is key. So, let’s explore the data.</p>

<p>A little over a decade has passed since The Economist warned us that we would soon be drowning in data. The modern data stack has emerged as a proposed life-jacket for this data flood — spearheaded by Silicon Valley startups such as Snowflake, Databricks and Confluent.</p>
<p>Today, any entrepreneur can sign up for BigQuery or Snowflake and have a data solution that can scale with their business in a matter of hours. The emergence of cheap, flexible and scalable data storage solutions was largely a response to changing needs spurred by the massive explosion of data.</p>
<p>Currently, the world produces 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily (there are 18 zeros in a quintillion). The explosion of data continues in the roaring ‘20s, both in terms of generation and storage — the amount of stored data is expected to continue to double at least every four years. However, one integral part of modern data infrastructure still lacks solutions suitable for the Big Data era and its challenges: Monitoring of data quality and data validation.</p>

<h2>Investors help Procore build a decacorn valuation in public debut</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2155624" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155624" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2155624" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1201812085.jpg" alt="Cranes of a construction site against blue sky" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1201812085.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1201812085.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1201812085.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1201812085.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1201812085.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1201812085.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155624" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=the_burtons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the_burtons <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Watching construction tech software company Procore go public Thursday after pricing above its range makes the IPO slowdown look like the deceleration that wasn’t.</p>
<p>Investors quickly bid up the company’s value in trading, giving Procore a higher valuation than it might have anticipated, along with a boost of confidence for the IPO market in general.</p>
<p>Construction tech may not be as glamorous as space travel, but it’s a massive industry that’s fraught with inefficiencies.</p>
<p>Procore initially set an IPO range of $60 to $65 per share before pricing at $67 per share Wednesday night. Its debut was worth gross proceeds north of $600 million and a fully diluted valuation of $9.6 billion. As of early afternoon Thursday, shares were trading at a solid $85.25.</p>
<p>In light of Procore’s debut, TechCrunch is digging quickly into the company’s new valuation and its resulting revenue multiples.</p>

<p>It’s impossible to predict how healthcare institutions will operate post-pandemic, but with so many people now accustomed to telemedicine, startups that provide services around virtual care continue to be poised for success.</p>
<p>Telemedicine has faced an uphill battle to become more relevant in the U.S., with challenges such as meeting HIPAA compliance requirements and insurance companies unwilling to pay for virtual visits. But when COVID-19 began raging across the globe and people had to stay home, both the insurance and healthcare industries were forced to adapt.</p>
<p>Now that people see the benefits and conveniences of “dialing a doc” from the kitchen table, healthcare has changed forever.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Welcome to Daily Crunch for May 21, 2021. Closing out the week, bitcoin dropped sharply today on (more?) news from China about possible restrictions on cryptocurrencies more broadly. Depending on your priors, the most recent news is purely FUD, or it’s indication that Bitcoin and friends are terrible inflation hedges. Pick your poison! Regardless, we have a grip of startup news to get to, so off we go! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Snap spends a half billion on AR: </strong>Yesterday’s news from consumer photo giant Snap didn’t stop with the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/snap-acquires-ar-startup-waveoptics-which-provides-tech-for-spectacles-for-over-500m/">plunking down $500 million for WaveOptics</a>, which we reported “makes the waveguides and projectors used in AR glasses.” That sure sounds like Snap gearing up for eventual mass production? Right?</li>
<li><strong>Startups heart farming:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/indonesian-agritech-platform-tanihub-group-harvests-a-65-5m-series-b-round/">TechCrunch covered a huge $65.5 million Series B</a> for Indonesian startup TaniHub Group today. Part of what it does is loan capital to farmers ahead of their harvests. In related news, ProducePay raised $43 million earlier this week to do something similar in Latin America. There’s notable startup activity, then, at the intersection of agtech and fintech.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile gaming is bigger than you thought:</strong> Did you know that former gaming darling Zynga is in the midst of a comeback? Mobile gaming, its core focus, had a huge 2020, leading to the company posting record Q1 results. Riding the same way is Jam City, another mobile gaming shop is going public. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/as-zynga-impresses-rival-mobile-gaming-shop-jam-city-looks-to-list-via-spac/">More here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>To round out the week, how about a few smaller venture capital rounds? We have a number from today that are well worth our time:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/rakuten-and-beyond-next-invest-1m-seed-funding-in-farm-to-table-startup-secai-marche/"><strong>Secai Marche raises $1.4M for farm-to-table food distribution</strong></a><strong>:</strong> We don’t cover enough Japanese startups, frankly, but here’s to doing better. Tokyo-based Secai Marche is building a B2B “logistics platform for farmers that sell to restaurants, hotels and other” food and beverage companies, and we think it’s neat. Rakuten and Beyond Next supplied the capital.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/mio-a-social-commerce-startup-focused-on-smaller-cities-and-rural-areas-in-vietnam-raises-1m-seed/"><strong>Mio raises $1M to bring social commerce to rural Vietnam</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Quickly growing e-commerce market Vietnam is seeing rising penetration in major cities. Mio wants to bring e-commerce to smaller cities and rural areas. Per our reporting, it is “building a reseller network and logistics infrastructure that can offer next-day delivery to Tier 2 and 3 cities.” Our present may be someone else’s future, so it’s swell to see startups bring the latest to more folks.</p>
<p>To round out our round coverage today, a slightly larger deal for a mental-health focused service:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/mental-health-app-wysa-raises-5-5m-for-emotionally-intelligent-ai/"><strong>Wysa raises $5.5M for AI-powered mental health</strong></a><strong>: </strong>This is at a minimum cool on paper. We’ll have to get some time with the service as it evolves through time, but TechCrunch reports that “Jo Aggarwal, the founder and CEO of Wysa, is hoping you’ll find it easier to confide in a robot. Or, put more specifically, &#8220;‘emotionally intelligent’ artificial intelligence.” I, for one, welcome our robot mental-health overlords. Jokes aside, there is a therapist shortage in the world, and if Wysa can help more folks handle their mental health better, we’re all for it.</p>
<h2>5 predictions for the future of e-commerce</h2>
<p>The United States is one of the world&#8217;s most advanced economies, but until quite recently, South Korea and China had much higher e-commerce penetration.</p>
<p>American consumers and companies are closing that gap. In 2016, the percentage of total retail spend where the goods were bought and sold online in the U.S. was about 8%. Today, that figure is closer to 17%.</p>
<p>Despite the last two decades of disruption, we&#8217;re still in the early days of e-commerce. But as more merchants of every size start making their goods and services available online, we&#8217;ve reached an inflection point.</p>
<p>In an exclusive report for Extra Crunch, Ethan Choi, a partner at Accel, offers five well-researched predictions about where e-commerce is heading in terms of D2C and the overall enablement landscape.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re entering what we at Accel believe is &#8216;the golden age of D2C e-commerce,'&#8221; says Choi.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today we have to stretch the Big Tech portion of this newsletter to include entities even larger than the largest technology companies, namely governments.</p>
<p>The Indian government is mad at tech companies yet again. This time it’s Twitter’s turn. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/">Per TechCrunch</a>, New Delhi “has expressed strong objection to Twitter for classifying tweets by Indian politicians as ‘manipulated media,’ and separately asked social media firms to remove posts that refer to an ‘Indian variant’ of the coronavirus.”</p>
<p>A few thoughts here: One, Twitter is going to have to navigate an increasingly complicated global climate for free speech in general. And figure out how to handle governments&#8217; reactions to its decisions on labeling content. That’s going to be hard. And asking a social service to blanket-ban a particular phrase is going to be essentially impossible. After all, even in China, where banned phrases on social media are common, individuals have found <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-07-20/want-circumvent-chinas-great-firewall-learn-these-9-phrases-first">myriad ways around the restrictions</a>. So, good luck, Indian government.</p>
<p>On a related note, if you are interested in privacy more generally, what’s going on in the European Union regarding data protection <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/european-parliament-amps-up-pressure-on-eu-us-data-flows-and-gdpr-enforcement/">is fascinating</a>.</p>
<p>Moving back to the world of corporate news, Spotify is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/spotify-brings-offline-listening-to-the-apple-watch-at-last/">finally bringing offline listening to the Apple Watch</a>. For runners, this is big news. Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/bheater">Brian Heater</a> is hype about the update.</p>
<p>To close us out today, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/linkedin-is-the-reason-apple-made-the-m1-chip/">Equity podcast team has thoughts</a> on the growth in corporate “media” and what it means for unicorns and other large technology companies.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every company wants to be innovative, but innovation comes with its share of difficulties. One key challenge for early-stage companies that are disrupting a particular space or creating a new category is figuring out how to sell a unique product to customers who have never bought such a solution.</p>
<p>This is especially the case when a solution doesn’t have many reference points and its significance may not be obvious.</p>
<p>My view is simple — some buyers could use a walkthrough of the buying process. If you are building a singular product in a nascent market that necessitates forward-looking customers and want to drastically shorten sales cycles, I have a proposal: Create a buyer’s guide.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			A buyer’s guide is essentially a prescriptive summary that provides an understandable overview of how a customer may buy your solution.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>A buyer’s guide is essentially a prescriptive summary that provides an understandable overview of how a customer may buy your solution. What does your product actually do? Is it secure? How would you implement the technology? What does it replace, if anything? It should be short, simple and speak the customer’s language. It also acts as a sales-enabling tool. Sales teams, especially at smaller startups, can review the guide quarterly and analyze what is and isn’t working as the company goes to market.</p>
<p>Here is how to put together a buyer’s guide, including what to sort out before you type a single word.</p>
<h2>Know your audience</h2>
<p>From the start, it&#8217;s important to think about who the stakeholders are for your product’s buying cycle. One typical issue with early-stage startups is they meet with an enthusiastic buyer — a CIO, CTO or VP of product — but neglect to include the other stakeholders who should be part of the conversation. More importantly, a lot of companies don’t realize the impact of their product on a group or team that they would not typically sell to.</p>
<p>For example, target the security team as an early stakeholder, because they&#8217;re probably going to review your product. If the solution is focused toward, say, integration, then hone in on who would be owning the integration process on the buyer&#8217;s team.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re selling a martech solution, on a business level, you have to consider a finance business partner for marketing. Think about the problems your customers face and also how others in their company relate to them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With vaccination rates slowing in the U.S., the White House is getting creative about getting shots in arms. Beyond protecting yourself and others from a deadly disease, the latest incentive to get vaccinated could help you find love (or get laid).</p>
<p>The White House COVID-19 response team announced Friday that a number of popular dating apps would offer new perks for users who get vaccinated, with Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Match, OkCupid, BLK, Chispa, Plenty of Fish and Badoo all participating in the promotional push. The White House hopes to make inroads with the 50 million users across those dating apps where they&#8217;re already spending time.</p>
<p>On Tinder, anyone who adds a sticker to their profile promoting their vaccination status between June 2 and July 4 will be <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-05-21-For-everyone-who-supports-getting-their-shot,-The-White-House-and-Tinder-will-help-you-shoot-your-shot">gifted a free Super Like</a>. (Proof of vaccination isn&#8217;t necessary, but really, you should get vaccinated if it&#8217;s available where you live.) Tinder and other apps will also add vaccination site resources from Vaccine.gov to help people figure out where they can get the shot nearby.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2156125" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/covid-tinder.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="441" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/covid-tinder.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/covid-tinder.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/covid-tinder.png?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/covid-tinder.png?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/covid-tinder.png?resize=680,441 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/covid-tinder.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing like fireworks to signal a new spark and a new start for those looking to meet new people IRL this summer,&#8221; Tinder CEO Jim Lanzone said.</p>
<p>According to OkCupid, getting vaccinated might help with that. The company found that people who displayed their vaccination status were 14% more likely to find a match. On OkCupid, vaccinated users <a href="https://theblog.okcupid.com/vaccinated-is-the-new-tall-dark-and-handsome-921494016895">will get a free boost</a>, a perk that promotes their profile to potential matches. The other apps participating in the White House initiative are handing out their own premium perks to give users a competitive edge.</p>

<p>The effort is part of a push by the White House to get 70% of adults vaccinated by the Fourth of July. To reach more Americans, the Biden administration has also coordinated with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/12/white-house-using-nascar-country-music-tv-to-reach-vaccine-hesitant-americans.html">popular entertainment companies like NASCAR and country music channel CMT</a> to promote vaccination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Social distancing and dating were always a bit of a challenging combination,&#8221; White House Senior COVID Advisor Andy Slavitt said during a press event Friday. He characterized the vaccine push through dating apps as those companies &#8220;responding to the president&#8217;s call to action&#8221; rather than calling it an official partnership.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have finally found the one thing that makes us all more attractive,&#8221; Slavitt said. &#8220;A vaccination.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fisker Inc., the EV startup-turned publicly traded company, is working on a modified version of its all-electric Ocean SUV for Pope Francis.</p>
<p>The company said Friday that it plans to deliver to the Vatican late next year a Popemobile based on its upcoming Fisker Ocean SUV. An initial agreement was reached during a private meeting Thursday between Pope Francis and Fisker co-founders Henrik Fisker and Dr. Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Henrik Fisker showed a number of sketches, including one that Pope Francis signed. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">There aren&#8217;t many details about this new Popemobile, although a </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">rendering of the modified Fisker Ocean SUV shows an all-glass cupola. </span></p>
<p>The agreement marks more than 50 years of automakers working with the Vatican to develop and deliver vehicles to shuttle the Holy See. Ford, which created a version of a 1964 Lehmann-Peterson, was used by Pope Paul VI in his 1965 New York City visit. The term Popemobile was popularized until Pope John Paul II&#8217;s tenure. Automakers including Dacia, Stellantis&#8217; Fiat and Jeep brands, Mercedes-Benz and Renault have all supplied vehicles to various pontiffs. Pope Francis has been known to use a Ford Focus for drives in Vatican City.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I got inspired reading that Pope Francis is very considerate about the environment and the impact of climate change for future generations,&#8221; says Henrik Fisker. &#8220;The interior of the Fisker Ocean papal transport will contain a variety of sustainable materials, including carpets made from recycled plastic bottles from the ocean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fisker is aiming to start production of its Ocean SUV, which will have a base price of $37,499, on November 17, 2022. The Popemobile version is expected around the same time, although a specific date was not shared.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese robotaxi startup Pony.ai has been given permission by California regulators to pilot its autonomous vehicles without a human safety driver behind the wheel in three cities.</p>
<p>While dozens of companies &#8212; 55 in all &#8212; have active permits to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver, it&#8217;s far less common to receive permission for driverless vehicles. Pony is the eighth company to be issued a driverless testing permit in the state, a list that includes Chinese companies AutoX, Baidu and WeRide as well as U.S. businesses Cruise, Nuro, Waymo and Zoox. Only Nuro has been granted a so-called deployment permit, which allows it to operate commercially.</p>
<p>The permit issued by the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates automated vehicle testing, expands upon Pony&#8217;s existing activity in the state. Pony.ai has been allowed to test autonomous vehicles with safety drivers since 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Under the permit, Pony.ai will be able to test six autonomous vehicles without a driver behind the wheel on specified streets within Fremont, Milpitas and Irvine. There are constraints to the permit. The vehicles are designed to operate on roads with posted speed limits not exceeding 45 miles per hour in clear weather and light precipitation. Testing will initially occur in Fremont and Milpitas weekdays between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Companies that receive these driverless permits have to provide evidence of insurance or a bond equal to $5 million and follow several other rules, such as training remote operators on the technology. Driverless testing permit holders must also report to the DMV within 10 days any collisions involving a driverless test vehicle and submit an annual report of disengagements, according to the DMV.</p>

<p>Pony.ai, which was founded in 2016 by former Baidu developers James Peng and Lou Tiancheng, has landed a number of partners and investors in its relatively short existence. Last November, the company said its valuation had reached $5.3 billion following a fresh injection of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-pony-ai-hits-5-3-billion-valuation/">$267 million in funding</a>. The company, which operates in China and California, has raised more than $1 billion since its founding, including $400 million from Toyota. Pony has several partnerships or collaborations with automakers and suppliers, including Bosch, Hyundai and Toyota.</p>
<p>Pony is building what it describes as an agnostic virtual driver for all sizes of vehicles, from small cars to large trucks, and to operate on both ridesharing and logistics (delivery) service networks. The company said back in 2019 that it was working with OEMs and suppliers to apply its automated technology to the long-haul trucking market. But it&#8217;s perhaps best known for its effort around robotaxis.</p>
<p>Pony has tested ridesharing in Fremont and Irvine, California and Guangzhou, China. In 2019, a fleet of electric, autonomous Hyundai Kona crossovers equipped with a self-driving system from Pony.ai and Via&#8217;s ride-hailing platform began shuttling customers on public roads. The robotaxi service, called BotRide, wasn&#8217;t a driverless service, as there was a human safety driver behind the wheel at all times. The BotRide pilot concluded in January 2020.</p>
<p>The company then started operating a public robotaxi service called PonyPilot in the Irvine area. Pony shifted that robotaxi service from shuttling people to packages as the COVID-19 pandemic swept through the world. In April, Pony.ai announced it had partnered with e-commerce platform Yamibuy to provide autonomous last-mile delivery service to customers in Irvine. The new delivery service was launched to provide additional capacity to address the surge of online orders triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, Pony.ai said at the time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple CEO Tim Cook took his first turn in the witness chair this morning in what is probably the most anticipated testimony of the Epic v. Apple antitrust case. But rather than a fiery condemnation of Epic&#8217;s shenanigans and allegations, Cook offered a mild, carefully tended ignorance that left many of the lawsuit&#8217;s key questions unanswered, or unanswerable.</p>
<p>This anticlimax may not make for exciting reporting, but it could serve to defang the dangerous, if somewhat dubious, argument that Apple&#8217;s App Store <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/epic-games-launches-a-campaign-and-lawsuit-against-apples-app-store/">amounts to a monopoly</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Epic cries monopoly as Apple details secret &#8216;Project Liberty&#8217; effort to provoke &#8216;Fortnite&#8217; ban&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/epic-cries-monopoly-as-apple-details-secret-project-liberty-effort-to-provoke-fortnite-ban/embed/#?secret=bqaPwIrd43" data-secret="bqaPwIrd43" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After being called by Apple&#8217;s own attorneys, Cook took the stand, Law360&#8217;s Dorothy Atkins, one of two media members allowed in the court, reported in her <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1395748658436444163">comprehensive live tweeting of the testimony</a>. The quotes from Cook are as reported and not to be considered verbatim; the court transcript will follow when the document is compiled and public. Incidentally, Atkins&#8217; stage-setting descriptions are appealing and humanizing, though Epic CEO Tim Sweeney comes off as a bit weird:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sweeney is sitting at Epic&#39;s counsel table looking down at his pen. His lawyer Gary Bornstein sporadically whispers in his ear. Cook seems relaxed, legs crossed. Just turned to someone sitting next took him, said something and then laughed.</p>
<p>&mdash; these trying times. (@doratki) <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1395755380693557248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The questioning of Cook by his own company&#8217;s counsel was gentle and directed at reiterating the reasons why Apple&#8217;s App Store is superior and sufficient for iOS users, while also asserting the presence of stiff competition. He admitted to a handful of conflicts with developers, such as differing priorities or needing to improve discovery, but said the company works constantly to retain developers and users.</p>
<p>The façade of innocent ignorance began when he was asked about Apple&#8217;s R&amp;D numbers — $15-20 billion annually for the last three years. Specifically, he said that Apple couldn&#8217;t estimate how much of that money was directed toward the App Store, because &#8220;we don&#8217;t allocate like that,&#8221; i.e. research budgets for individual products aren&#8217;t broken out from the rest.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&#8217;t sound right, does it? A company like Apple knows down to the penny how much it spends on its products and research. Even if it can&#8217;t be perfectly broken down — an advance in MacOS code may play into a feature on the App Store — the company must know to some extent how its resources are being deployed and to what effect. The differences between a conservative and liberal estimation of the App Store&#8217;s R&amp;D allocation might be large, in the hundreds of millions perhaps, but make no mistake, those estimations are almost certainly being made internally. To do otherwise would be folly.</p>
<p>But because the numbers are not publicly declared and broken down, and because they are likely to be somewhat fuzzy, Cook can say truthfully that there&#8217;s no single number like (to invent an amount) &#8220;App Store R&amp;D was $500 million in 2019.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not having a hard number removes a potential foothold for Epic, which could use it either way: If it&#8217;s big, they&#8217;re protecting their golden goose (enforcing market power). If it&#8217;s small, they&#8217;re just collecting the eggs (collecting rent via market power). Apple&#8217;s only winning move is not to play, so Cook plays dumb and consequently Epic&#8217;s argument looks like speculation (and, as Apple would argue, fabulation).</p>
<p>He then deployed a similar strategy of starving the competition with a preemptive shrug about profits. He only addressed total net sales, which were about $275 billion at a 21% profit margin, saying Apple does not evaluate the App Store&#8217;s income as a standalone business.</p>
<p>Certainly it is arguable that the App Store is very much a tightly integrated component of a larger business structure. But the idea that it cannot be assessed as a standalone business is ludicrous. It is again nearly certain that it, like all of Apple&#8217;s divisions and product lines, is dissected and reported internally in excruciating detail. But again it is just plausible that for legal purposes it is not straightforward enough to say &#8220;the income and profits of the App Store are such and such,&#8221; thus denying Epic its datum.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple App Store customers spent $1.8B over the week of Christmas, set a spending record on New Year&#8217;s Day&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/apple-app-store-customers-spent-1-8b-over-the-week-of-christmas-set-a-spending-record-on-new-years-day/embed/#?secret=3Um55RqSgP" data-secret="3Um55RqSgP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However, the point is important enough that Epic thought it warranted independent investigation. And among the first things Epic&#8217;s attorney brought up, when the witness was turned over to him, was the testimony from earlier in the trial by an expert witness that Apple&#8217;s App Store operating margins were around 79%.</p>
<p>It was not in Apple&#8217;s interest to confirm or deny these numbers, and Cook again pleaded ignorance. The mask slipped a tiny bit, however, when Epic&#8217;s attorney asked Cook to break down the confidential income numbers that combined the Mac and iOS App Stores. While Apple objected to this, saying it was privileged information and could only be divulged in a closed court, Cook offered that the iOS numbers are &#8220;a lot larger&#8221; than the Mac numbers.</p>
<p>What we see here is another piece of financial sleight-of-hand. By mixing the iOS and Mac income Apple gets to muddy the waters of how much money is made and spent in and on them. Epic&#8217;s attempt to unmix them was not successful, but the judge is no fool — she sees the same things Epic does, but just as dimly. Apple is attempting to deny Epic a legal victory even at the cost of looking rather shadowy and manipulative.</p>
<p>This was further demonstrated when Cook was asked about Apple&#8217;s deal with Google that keeps the search engine as the default on iOS. Cook said he didn&#8217;t remember the specific numbers.</p>
<p>If the CEO of one of the biggest tech companies in the world told you they forgot the specifics of a multibillion-dollar, decade-long deal with one of the other biggest tech companies in the world, would you believe them?</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u5p0QyLkTn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/onering/">Apple search crawler activity could signal a Google competitor, or a bid to make Siri a one-stop shop</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple search crawler activity could signal a Google competitor, or a bid to make Siri a one-stop shop&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/onering/embed/#?secret=u5p0QyLkTn" data-secret="u5p0QyLkTn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Little of the remaining testimony shed light on anything. Cook discussed the complexities of operating in places like China where local laws have technical and policy repercussions, and minimized the assertion that Apple had expanded the scope of in-app purchases and from which transactions the company gets a 30% cut. A bit more testimony will take place in a closed court, but we likely won&#8217;t hear about it as it will concern confidential information.</p>
<p>The trial, which is winding down, has held few surprises; both sides laid out their arguments at the start, and much of this will come down to the judge&#8217;s interpretation of the facts. There were no dramatic surprise witnesses or smoking guns — it&#8217;s simply a novel argument about what constitutes monopolistic behavior. Apple is adamant that competition is present and fierce in Android, and that in the gaming world it competes with Windows and consoles as well.</p>
<p>It seems almost inevitable that whatever the judgment is, the case will be appealed and brought to a higher court, but that judgment will also be a strong indicator of how well Epic&#8217;s arguments (and Apple&#8217;s obfuscations) have been received. That said, Epic and other critics of Apple&#8217;s App Store fees, which are immensely profitable however the company chooses to obscure it, have arguably already accomplished their goals. Apple&#8217;s lowered 15% fee for the first million dollars is plainly a response to developer unrest and bad press, and now it is put in the position of defending how the sausage gets made.</p>
<p>Tarnishing Apple&#8217;s anodized aluminum tower was always at least partly the intent, and win or lose Epic may feel it has gotten its money&#8217;s worth. Besides, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/epic-games-takes-its-apple-app-store-fight-to-europe/">the rematch in Europe</a> is yet to come.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">We have a monthly company book club at our company. It’s in the evening and our whole team attends (yes, we’re really into book clubs), so it made sense that a few minutes before our book club on the evening of April 20, a team member let us all know that he’d be missing it.</p>
<p>He lives in Minnesota, the verdict for the trial of Derek Chauvin was about to be announced, and the atmosphere was tense. He wasn’t able to focus and was giving the rest of the team a heads up on Slack that he’d be absent. There were a few thumbs up emojis and then we started the book club.</p>
<p>A few days later, I was talking with our executive team and several of them mentioned that people on their teams had brought up the book club situation. Something felt off about it. Should we have canceled it? Reminded everyone that they were free to take personal time for whatever reason? No one had the right answer, but it felt like an opportunity to reflect and arrive at a more thoughtful approach, which is especially important as our team rapidly grows and we continue to be remote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This past year, we’ve had so many moments when a massively important event is happening as we work, entering our collective conscience and forcing us to acknowledge that the boundary between work and life is thin and porous. Companies are grappling with how, or whether, to talk about these events with their teams.</p>
<p>Most companies have taken the view that to develop an inclusive company, there has to be space for what’s happening in the world. A few have gone in the opposite direction, saying companies should exist separate and apart from “politics,” which is an admittedly fuzzy term.</p>
<p>I’m familiar with the “shut up do your job” mentality because I spent years in the Army. About a political issue, for example, salty soldiers would say things like, “If the Army wanted you to have an opinion, they would have issued one to you.” (Side note: There were still plenty of opinions.)</p>
<p>But that’s not how I think about company-building. I believe that our “work selves” and what’s going on in the world are inextricably connected. And while I don’t know exactly how to navigate the choppy waters, this recent experience helped my team crystallize a few lessons.</p>
<h2>Make space for when &#8220;politics&#8221; impacts your team</h2>
<p>Months ago, I was listening to “The Daily” while getting ready for work. The episode was about the murder of Vanessa Guillen, an Army soldier who had been the victim of sexual harassment while in uniform. It was heartbreaking to hear her mother talk about how the Army had failed Vanessa. I cried. My own experiences in uniform came flooding back and I needed to take time that morning to think and write. I moved around some things on my schedule and didn’t start the workday until I was ready.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			I do not think it’s the role of a company to dictate acceptable reasons to need personal time. Instead, a company should hire smart, motivated people and give them a framework to help them make the right decisions.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I needed time that morning. I do not think it’s the role of a company to dictate what is and is not an acceptable reason to need personal time. Instead, a company should hire smart, motivated people and give them a framework to help them make the right decisions.</p>
<p>Our working framework (and I say “working” because culture building, for us, is a work in progress) is borrowed heavily from Netflix: It&#8217;s the dual concepts of freedom and responsibility. Ethena employees have the freedom to take time off for whatever reason and they don’t need to give a justification to managers. They also have the responsibility to do their jobs well. If they’ll be missing a meeting, they need to ensure there is coverage, for example.</p>
<h2>Listen when colleagues tell you something’s wrong</h2>
<p>While the founder mythology is strong, CTO Anne Solmssen and I don’t subscribe to it. We believe that two things can be true: We are smart, driven and resourceful founders and we are better with our team. We hire the smartest people we can find precisely because we want them to make our company better.</p>
<p>We have weekly feedback meetings between direct reports and the feedback is always bilateral, meaning managers get feedback from their direct reports. Feedback Fridays are where issues tend to surface first. I’m so glad there are pressure release valves for feedback, especially with a remote team, because otherwise I sit in a bubble thinking everything is fine, when it isn&#8217;t. I’m also glad we built feedback early into our culture because it’s incredibly hard to bolt it on later.</p>
<p>An important but often neglected part of listening to employee feedback is being honest about how decisions get made. For example, my co-founder and I want to hear dissent and criticism because it makes us better. But listening intently is different than being a direct democracy. As the CEO, I make decisions; I just want them to be as informed and inclusive as possible.</p>
<h2>Invest early in people ops</h2>
<p>We didn’t have a proactive approach to attendance at our recent company book club in part because we don’t yet have a people operations leader. Our team is about 20 employees and rapidly growing. We’ve prioritized a people ops hire because it’s a crucial function and if we don’t invest in it early, we’ll continue to have issues fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>Yes, co-founders should be personally invested in company culture, but people ops is a craft and requires expertise. Experienced people ops leaders have lots of practice navigating complex issues. (Side note: We’re <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/ethena">hiring</a> for many roles, including people ops. If you’d like to be part of a company that intentionally invests in company culture, come work with us.)</p>
<p>I want to build a highly functional team where everyone can bring themselves to work and excuse themselves when they need a minute. I’m undeniably making mistakes along the way, but the best way to learn about where we stumble is to let our smart and capable team tell us, listen when they do and be intentional in building our company culture.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In 2016, more than 20 years after Amazon’s founding and 10 years since Shopify launched, it would have been easy to assume e-commerce penetration (the percentage of total retail spend where the goods were bought and sold online) would be over 50%.</p>
<p>But what we found was shocking: The U.S. was only approximately 8% penetrated &#8212; only 8% for arguably the most advanced economy in the world!</p>
<p>We’ve had a close eye on the rate of e-commerce penetration globally ever since. Despite e-commerce growth skyrocketing over the past year, the reality is the U.S. has still only reached an e-commerce penetration rate of around 17%. During the last 18 months, we’ve closed the gap to South Korea and China’s e-commerce penetration of more than 25%, but there is still much progress to be made.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155862" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155862" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2155862 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="897" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png?resize=1536,861 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ecommerce-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155862" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Accel</p></div></p>
<p>It’s clear that we are still in the early days of this megatrend and it is our strong conviction that it is inevitable that we will get to a point where at least half of every retail dollar is spent online over the next decade.</p>
<p>Below are five key predictions for what this road to further penetration will hold.</p>
<h2>D2C retail will accelerate as merchants seek independence</h2>
<p>Marketplaces have forged the path for e-commerce adoption among merchants of all sizes. They have raised significant capital and made the necessary investments in payments and logistics infrastructure, often subsidizing the consumer experience with free shipping or discounts to get them comfortable buying online.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The balance of power has shifted toward merchants, who previously didn’t have the picks and shovels to build their own e-commerce capabilities.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In recent years, merchants have pursued options aside from these marketplace aggregators. They have sought independence, opting to pay 5%-10% of their gross merchandise value (GMV) on their own technology infrastructure rather than paying the <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200336920">6% to 45% (average of about 15%) in marketplace fees</a>. Most importantly, they have prioritized owning the relationship with their end customers, given that customer loyalty and lifetime value is becoming ever more important in a hypercompetitive online market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard enough to talk about your feelings to a person; Jo Aggarwal, the founder and CEO of Wysa, is hoping you’ll find it easier to confide in a robot. Or, put more specifically, “emotionally intelligent” artificial intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wysa is an AI-powered mental health app designed by Touchkin eServices, Aggarwal’s company that currently maintains headquarters in Bangalore, Boston and London. Wysa is something like a chatbot that can respond with words of affirmation, or guide a user through one of 150 different therapeutic techniques.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wysa is Aggarwal’s second venture. The first was an elder care company that failed to find market fit, she says. Aggarwal found herself falling into a deep depression, from which, she says, the idea of Wysa was born in 2016. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, Wysa became one of 17 apps in the </span><a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/assistant-investments"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Assistant Investment Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and in May, closed a </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wysas-ai-guided-mental-health-140000132.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Series A</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funding round of $5.5 million led by Boston’s W Health Ventures, the Google Assistant Investment Program, pi Ventures and Kae Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wysa has raised a total of $9 million in funding, says Aggarwal, and the company has 60 full-time employees and about three million users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ultimate goal, she says, is not to diagnose mental health conditions. Wysa is largely aimed at people who just want to vent. Most Wysa users are there to improve their sleep, anxiety or relationships, she says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Out of the 3 million people that use Wysa, we find that only about 10% actually need a medical diagnosis,” says Aggarwal. If a user’s conversations with Wysa equate with high scores on traditional depression questionnaires like the </span><a href="https://patient.info/doctor/patient-health-questionnaire-phq-9#:~:text=Depression%20Severity%3A%200%2D4%20none,of%2088%25%20for%20major%20depression."><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHQ-9</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or the anxiety disorder questionnaire </span><a href="https://adaa.org/sites/default/files/GAD-7_Anxiety-updated_0.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GAD-7</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wysa will suggest talking to a human therapist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, you don’t need to have a clinical mental health diagnosis to benefit from therapy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wysa isn’t intended to be a replacement, says Aggarwal (whether users view it as a replacement remains to be seen), but an additional tool that a user can interact with on a daily basis. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sixty percent of the people who come and talk to Wysa need to feel heard and validated, but if they’re given techniques of self help, they can actually work on it themselves and feel better,” Aggarwal continues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wysa’s approach has been refined through conversations with users and through input from therapists, says Aggarwal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, while having a conversation with a user, Wysa will first categorize their statements and then assign a type of therapy, like cognitive behavioral therapy or acceptance and commitment therapy, based on those responses. It would then select a line of questioning or therapeutic technique written ahead of time by a therapist and begin to converse with the user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wysa, says Aggarwal, has been gleaning its own insights from more than 100 million conversations that have unfolded this way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take for instance a situation where you&#8217;re angry at somebody else. Originally our therapists would come up with a technique called the empty chair technique where you’re trying to look at it from the other person’s perspective. We found that when a person felt powerless or there were trust issues, like teens and parents, the techniques the therapists were giving weren’t actually working,” she says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are 10,000 people facing trust issues who are actually refusing to do the empty chair exercise. So we have to find another way of helping them. These insights have built Wysa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Wysa has been refined in the field, research institutions have played a role in Wysa’s ongoing development. Pediatricians at the University of Cincinnati helped </span><a href="https://www.uc.edu/news/articles/n20935374/uc-cincinnati-childrens-team-up-to-create-app-to-combat-covid-19-anxiety.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop a module</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically targeted toward COVID-19 anxiety. There are also ongoing studies of Wysa’s ability to help people cope with mental health consequences from chronic pain, arthritis and diabetes at The Washington University in St. Louis and The University of New Brunswick. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Wysa has had several tests in the real world. In 2020, the </span><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/community/new-emotionally-intelligent-chatbot-to-help-singaporeans-stressed-by-pandemic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">government of Singapore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> licensed Wysa, and provided the service for free to help cope with the emotional fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Wysa is also offered through the health insurance company Aetna </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a <a href="https://blogs.wysa.io/blog/b2b-partnerships/aetna-international-announces-mental-health-partnership-with-wysa">supplement</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Aetna’s Employee Assistance Program. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 strategies for building a digital health unicorn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/4-strategies-for-building-a-digital-health-unicorn/embed/#?secret=BYz25rqler" data-secret="BYz25rqler" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest concern about mental health apps, naturally, is that they might accidentally trigger an incident, or mistake signs of self harm. To address this, the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS) offers specific compliance standards. Wysa is compliant with the NHS’ </span><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb0129-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-manufacture-of-health-it-systems"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DCB0129 standard for clinical safety,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the </span><a href="https://demoday.hartfordinsurtechhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Wysa-HIH-2020-One-Pager.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first AI-based mental health app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to earn the distinction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet those guidelines, Wysa appointed a clinical safety officer, and was required to create “escalation paths” for people who show signs of self harm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wysa, says Aggarwal, is also designed to flag responses to self-harm, abuse, suicidal thoughts or trauma. If a user’s responses fall into those categories Wysa will prompt the user to call a crisis line. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S., the Wysa app that anyone can download, says Aggarwal, fits the </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/136939/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FDA’s definition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a general wellness app or a “low risk device.” That’s relevant because, during the pandemic, the FDA has </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/136939/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">created guidance to accelerate distribution of</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these apps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Wysa may not perfectly categorize each person’s response. A </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46507900"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BBC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for instance, noted that the app didn’t appear to appreciate the severity of a proposed underage sexual encounter. Wysa responded by updating the app to handle more instances of coercive sex. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aggarwal also notes that Wysa contains a manual list of sentences, often containing slang, that they know the AI won’t catch or accurately categorize as harmful on its own. Those are manually updated to ensure that Wysa responds appropriately. “Our rule is that [the response] can be 80%, appropriate, but 0% triggering,” she says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the immediate future, Aggarwal says the goal is to become a full-stack service. Rather than having to refer patients who do receive a diagnosis to Employee Assistant Programs (as the Aetna partnership might) or outside therapists, Wysa aims to build out its own network of mental health suppliers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the tech side they’re planning expansion into Spanish, and will start investigating a voice-based system based on guidance from the Google Assistant Investment Fund. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The relationship between Spotify and Apple has been…understandably contentious at times. After all, Apple runs the streaming service’s biggest competitor. At the end of the day though, the Apple Watch and Spotify maintain the No. 1 spot in their respective categories by a wide margin. And playing nice ultimately benefits a wide swath of users in that overlapping Venn diagram.</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-05-21/enjoy-more-ways-than-ever-to-use-spotify-on-your-apple-watch-now-with-downloads/">Spotify announced</a> that it’s finally bringing to the smartwatch what’s no doubt been one of its most requested features. Starting today, Premium subscribers can download music and podcasts to the wearable for offline listening. That means users will be able to leave their phone at home when they go for a jog.</p>
<p>The new feature works more or less like standard downloading and sharing. Users click the three ellipses next to an album, playlist or podcast and click “Download to Apple Watch.” Once downloaded, green arrows will populate next to the title. With headphones paired, you’ll be able to stream directly from the watch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Samsung has already offered the feature on some of the competition, including Samsung’s Galaxy Watch line. The service is also coming to Google Wear OS watches soon, per an announcement at I/O. Apple Music, of course, has offered offline listening on the Watch for a while, as has Pandora. Deezer also beat Spotify to the popular wearable by a matter of days.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This morning, we're looking at the Jam City deal to merge with DPCM Capital. Jam City is a bit like Zynga, but unless you are a mobile-gaming aficionado, you might not have heard of it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While it would be nice to write about something other than yet another tech company looking to list via a SPAC, the deals keep dropping, so our more traditional fare of covering startup trends will remain on hold for at least one day more.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re looking at the <a href="https://assets.jamcity.com/20210520025438/JAM-CITY-SPAC-RELEASE_FINAL_APPROVED.pdf">Jam City deal to merge with DPCM Capital</a>. Jam City is a bit like Zynga, but unless you are a mobile-gaming aficionado, you might not have heard of it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>You likely have not heard of DPCM Capital, either, but you know more about it than you&#8217;d think.</p>
<p>As Jam City notes in a release, the SPAC is &#8220;led by Emil Michael.&#8221; Michael is most famous for his time at Uber, where he served as chief business officer. He left the firm, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/technology/uber-travis-kalanick-emil-michael.html">The New York Times wrote in 2014</a>, after a board-called &#8220;investigation into [the company&#8217;s] culture and business practices&#8221; led to a &#8220;recommendation for Mr. Michael to exit Uber.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s the gentleman who floated the idea of <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/bensmith/uber-executive-suggests-digging-up-dirt-on-journalists#.pyxybkpAy">funding a team to &#8220;dig up dirt&#8221; on Uber&#8217;s &#8220;critics in the media,&#8221;</a> as BuzzFeed News reported in late 2014.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995213" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Regardless, we&#8217;re not here to go back through Uber and its various cultural messes. We&#8217;re here to dig into the <a href="https://jamcity.com/wp-content/uploads/Jam-City-Investor-Presentation-210519.pdf">Jam City SPAC deck</a> to see if the company is similar to Zynga. Why do we want to know that? Because Zynga has done great in recent quarters, including posting<a href="https://investor.zynga.com/static-files/7003004d-9d35-4aba-af6e-ce812cb84d5d"> record revenue and bookings</a> in the first three months of 2021.</p>
<p>With lots of folks stuck at home in the last year, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/videogames-are-a-bigger-industry-than-sports-and-movies-combined-thanks-to-the-pandemic-11608654990#:~:text=Global%20videogame%20revenue%20is%20expected,North%20American%20sports%20industries%20combined.">gaming has done well in aggregate</a>. And mobile gaming is a huge chunk of the larger gaming world.</p>
<p>More broadly, why do we care about Jam City&#8217;s SPAC transaction? Because the mobile gaming concern has raised more than $300 million, including a $145 million round in 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/consolidation-is-coming-to-gaming-and-jam-city-raises-145-million-to-capitalize-on-it/">that TechCrunch covered here</a>.</p>
<p>The company attracted capital from Austin Ventures, Netmarble, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan Chase while private, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jam-city/company_financials">per Crunchbase</a>, so we&#8217;re very curious if Jam City has enjoyed a Zynga-like last few years and how it&#8217;s being valued as part of the SPAC deal. Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>Jam City&#8217;s SPAC transaction</h2>
<p>When Jam City raised that huge 2019 round, co-founder and CEO Chris DeWolfe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/consolidation-is-coming-to-gaming-and-jam-city-raises-145-million-to-capitalize-on-it/">said that the</a> &#8220;global mobile games market [is] consolidating.&#8221; At the time, the company intended to use some of its new funding to acquire other mobile gaming companies.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers are facing further pressure to step in and do something about lackadaisical enforcement of the bloc&#8217;s flagship data protection regime after the European Parliament voted yesterday to back a call urging the Commission to start an infringement proceeding against Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) for not &#8220;properly enforcing&#8221; the regulation.</p>
<p>The Commission and the DPC have been contacted for comment on the parliament&#8217;s call.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">Last summer</a> the Commission&#8217;s own two-year review of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) highlighted a lack of uniformly vigorous enforcement &#8212; but commissioners were keener to point out the positives, lauding the regulation as a &#8220;global reference point&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But it&#8217;s now nearly three years since the regulation begun being applied and criticism over weak enforcement is getting harder for the EU&#8217;s executive to ignore.</p>
<p>The parliament&#8217;s <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0256_EN.pdf">resolution</a> &#8212; which, while non-legally binding, fires a strong political message across the Commission&#8217;s bow &#8212; singles out the DPC for specific criticism given its outsized role in enforcement of the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It&#8217;s the lead supervisory authority for complaints brought against the many big tech companies which choose to site their regional headquarters in the country (on account of its corporate-friendly tax system).</span></p>
<p>The text of the resolution expresses &#8220;deep concern&#8221; over the DPC&#8217;s failure to reach a decision on a number of complaints against breaches of the GDPR filed the day it came into application, on May 25, 2018 &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">against Facebook and Google</a> &#8212; and criticises the Irish data watchdog for interpreting &#8220;without delay&#8221; in Article 60(3) of the GDPR &#8220;contrary to the legislators’ intention – as longer than a matter of months&#8221;, as they put it.</p>
<p>To date the DPC has only reached a final decision on one cross-border GDPR case &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">against Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>The parliament also says it&#8217;s &#8220;concerned about the lack of tech specialists working for the DPC and their use of outdated systems&#8221; (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/brave-accuses-european-governments-of-gdpr-resourcing-failure/">Brave also flagged last year</a>) &#8212; as well as criticizing the watchdog&#8217;s handling of a complaint originally brought by privacy campaigner Max Schrems years before the GDPR came into application, which relates to the clash between EU privacy rights and U.S. surveillance laws, and which still hasn&#8217;t resulted in a decision.</p>
<p>The DPC&#8217;s approach to handling Schrems&#8217; 2013 complaint led to a 2018 referral to the CJEU &#8212; which in turn led to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">landmark Schrems II judgement last summer</a> invalidating the flagship EU-U.S. data transfer arrangement, Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>That ruling did not outlaw alternative data transfer mechanisms but made it clear that EU DPAs have an obligation to step in and suspend data transfers if Europeans&#8217; information is being taken to a third country that does not have essentially equivalent protections to those they have under EU law &#8212; thereby putting the ball back in the DPC&#8217;s court on the Schrems complaint.</p>
<p>The Irish regulator then sent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">a preliminary order to Facebook to suspend its data transfers</a> and the tech giant responded by filing for a judicial review of the DPC&#8217;s processes. However, the Irish High Court rejected Facebook&#8217;s petition <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/facebook-loses-last-ditch-attempt-to-derail-dpc-decision-on-its-eu-us-data-flows/">last week</a>. And a stay on the DPC&#8217;s investigation was lifted yesterday &#8212; so the DPC&#8217;s process of reaching a decision on the Facebook data flows complaint has started moving again.</p>
<p>A final decision could still take several months more, though &#8212; as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">we&#8217;ve reported before</a> &#8212; as the DPC&#8217;s draft decision will also need to be put to the other EU DPAs for review and the chance to object.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>The DPC said today that it&#8217;s now written to Facebook following the lifting of the stay &#8212; giving the company six weeks to provide submissions on the preliminary order.</p>

<p>The parliament&#8217;s resolution states that it &#8220;is worried that supervisory authorities have not taken proactive steps under Article 61 and 66 of the GDPR to force the DPC to comply with its obligations under the GDPR&#8221;, and &#8212; in more general remarks on the enforcement of GDPR around international data transfers &#8212; it states that it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is concerned about the insufficient level of enforcement of the GDPR, particularly in the area of international transfers; expresses concerns at the lack of prioritisation and overall scrutiny by national supervisory authorities with regard to personal data transfers to third countries, despite the significant CJEU case law developments over the past five years; deplores the absence of meaningful decisions and corrective measures in this regard, and urges the EDPB [European Data Protection Board] and national supervisory authorities to include personal data transfers as part of their audit, compliance and enforcement strategies; points out that harmonised binding administrative procedures on the representation of data subjects and admissibility are needed to provide legal certainty and deal with crossborder complaints;</p></blockquote>
<p>The knotty, multi-year saga of Schrems&#8217; Facebook data-flows complaint, as played out via the procedural twists of the DPC and Facebook&#8217;s lawyers&#8217; delaying tactics, illustrates the multi-layered legal, political and commercial complexities bound up with data flows out of the EU (post-Snowden&#8217;s 2013 revelations of U.S. mass surveillance programs) &#8212; not to mention the staggering challenge for EU data subjects to actually exercise the rights they have on paper. But these intersecting issues around international data flows do seem to be finally coming to a head, in the wake of the Schrems II CJEU ruling.</p>
<p>The clock is now ticking for the issuing of major data suspension orders by EU data protection agencies, with Facebook&#8217;s business first in the firing line.</p>
<p>Other U.S.-based services that are &#8212; similarly &#8212; subject to the U.S.&#8217; FISA regime (and also move EU users data over the pond for processing; and whose businesses are such they cannot shield user data via &#8220;zero access&#8221; encryption architecture) are equally at risk of receiving an order to shut down their EU-U.S. data-pipes. Or else having to shift data processing for these users inside the EU.</p>
<p>U.S.-based services aren&#8217;t the only ones facing increasing legal uncertainty, either.</p>
<p>The U.K., post-Brexit, is also classed as a third country (in EU law terms). And in a separate <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0262_EN.html">resolution</a> today the parliament adopted a text on the U.K. adequacy agreement, granted earlier this year by the Commission, which raises objections to the arrangement &#8212; including by flagging a lack of GDPR enforcement in the U.K. as problematic.</p>
<p>On that front the parliament highlights how adtech complaints filed with the ICO have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">failed to yield a decision</a>. (It writes that it&#8217;s concerned &#8220;non-enforcement is a structural problem&#8221; in the U.K. &#8212; which it suggests has left &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a large number of data protection law breaches&#8230; [un]remedied&#8221;.)</span></p>
<p>It also calls out the U.K.&#8217;s surveillance regime, questioning its compatibility with the CJEU&#8217;s requirements for essential equivalence &#8212; while also raising concerns about the risk that the U.K. could undermine protections on EU citizens data via onward transfers to jurisdictions the EU does not have an adequacy agreement with, among other objections.</p>
<p>The Commission put a four-year lifespan on the U.K.&#8217;s adequacy deal &#8212; meaning there will be another major review ahead of any continuation of the arrangement in 2025.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a far cry from the &#8220;hands-off&#8221; 15 years the EU-U.S. &#8220;Safe Harbor&#8221; agreement stood for, before a Schrems challenge finally led to the CJEU striking it down <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">back in 2015</a>. So the takeaway here is that data deals that allow for people&#8217;s information to leave Europe aren&#8217;t going to be allowed to stand unchecked for years; close scrutiny and legal accountability are now firmly up front &#8212; and will remain in the frame going forward.</p>
<p>The global nature of the internet and the ease with which data can digitally flow across borders of course brings huge benefits for businesses &#8212; but the resulting interplay between different legal regimes is leading to increasing levels of legal uncertainty for companies seeking to take people&#8217;s data across borders.</p>

<p>In the EU&#8217;s case, the issue is that data protection is regulated within the bloc and these laws require that protection stays with people&#8217;s information, no matter where it goes. So if the data flows to countries that do not offer the same safeguards &#8212; be that the U.S. or indeed China or India (or even the U.K.) &#8212; then that risk is that it can&#8217;t, legally, be taken there.</p>
<p>How to resolve this clash, between data protection laws based on individual privacy rights and data access mandates driven by national security priorities, has no easy answers.</p>
<p>For the U.S., and for the transatlantic data flows between the EU and the U.S., the Commission has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/no-quick-fix-for-transatlantic-data-transfers-says-ec/">warned there will be no quick fix</a> this time &#8212; as happened when it slapped a sticking plaster atop the invalidated Safe Harbor, hailing a new &#8220;Privacy Shield&#8221; regime; only for the CJEU to blast that out of the water for much the same reasons a few years later. (The parliament resolution is particularly withering in its assessment of the Commission&#8217;s historic missteps there.)</p>
<p>For a fix to stick, major reform of U.S. surveillance law is going to be needed. And the Commission appears to have accepted that&#8217;s not going to come overnight, so it seems to be trying to brace businesses for turbulence&#8230;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The parliament&#8217;s resolution on Schrems II also makes it clear that it expects DPAs to step in and cut off risky data flows &#8212; with MEPs writing that &#8220;if no arrangement with the U.S. is swiftly found which guarantees an essentially equivalent and therefore adequate level of protection to that provided by the GDPR and the Charter, that these transfers will be suspended until the situation is resolved&#8221;.</p>
<p>So if DPAs fail to do this &#8212; and if Ireland keeps dragging its feet on closing out the Schrems complaint &#8212; they should expect more resolutions to be blasted at them from the parliament.</p>
<p>MEPs emphasize the need for any future EU-U.S. data transfer agreement &#8220;to address the problems identified by the Court ruling in a sustainable manner&#8221; &#8212; pointing out that &#8220;no contract between companies can provide protection from indiscriminate access by intelligence authorities to the content of electronic communications, nor can any contract between companies provide sufficient legal remedies against mass surveillance&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This requires a reform of US surveillance laws and practices with a view to ensuring that access of US security authorities to data transferred from the EU is limited to what is necessary and proportionate, and that European data subjects have access to effective judicial redress before US courts,&#8221; the parliament adds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still true that businesses may be able to legally move EU personal data out of the bloc. Even, potentially, to the U.S. &#8212; depending on the type of business; the data itself; and additional safeguards that could be applied.</p>
<p>However, for data-mining companies like Facebook &#8212; which are subject to FISA and whose businesses rely on accessing people&#8217;s data &#8212; then achieving essential equivalence with EU privacy protections looks, well, essentially impossible.</p>
<p>And while the parliament hasn&#8217;t made an explicit call in the resolution for Facebook&#8217;s EU data flows to be cut off that is the clear implication of it urging infringement proceedings against the DPC (and deploring &#8220;the absence of meaningful decisions and corrective measures&#8221; in the area of international transfers).</p>
<p>The parliament also states in the resolution that it wants to see &#8220;solid mechanisms compliant with the CJEU judgement&#8221; set out &#8212; for the benefit of businesses with the chance to legally move data out of the EU &#8212; saying, for example, that the<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Commission&#8217;s proposal for a template for Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) should &#8220;duly take into account all the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">relevant recommendations of the EDPB</a>&#8220;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It also says it supports the </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">creation of a tool box of supplementary measures for such businesses to choose from &#8212; in areas like security and data protection certification; encryption safeguards; and pseudonymisation &#8212; so long as the measures included are accepted by regulators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It also wants to see publicly available resources on the relevant legislation of the EU’s main trading partners to help businesses that have the possibility of being able to legally move data out of the bloc get guidance to help them do so with compliance.</span></p>
<p>The overarching message here is that businesses should buckle up for disruption of cross-border data flows &#8212; and tool up for compliance, where possible.</p>
<p>In another segment of the resolution, for example, the parliament calls on the Commission to &#8220;analyse the situation of cloud providers falling under section 702 of the FISA who transfers data using SCCs&#8221; &#8212; going on to suggest that support for European alternatives to U.S. cloud providers may be needed to plug &#8220;gaps in the protection of data of European citizens transferred to the United States&#8221; and &#8212; in a more blatant push for digital sovereignty &#8212; &#8220;reduce the dependence of the Union in storage capacities vis-à-vis third countries and to strengthen the Union’s strategic autonomy in terms of data management and protection&#8221;.</p>
