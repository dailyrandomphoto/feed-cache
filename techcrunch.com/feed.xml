										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backbone One, the killer iPhone game pad I </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/with-backing-from-mr-beast-and-nadeshot-backbone-one-could-finally-crack-competitive-mobile-gaming/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">profiled here late last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has just scored the mother of all tie-ups for a gaming accessory. It’s getting bundled with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate as it launches on iOS today alongside the xCloud game streaming service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a part of the deal, Backbone is being bundled with Xbox Game Pass in a new retail packaging that gets the Designed for Xbox stamp, making a Backbone + iPhone combo the closest thing we’ve ever seen to a portable Xbox. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my last piece I noted how Backbone cleverly used the accessory APIs built into iOS to offer super slick functionality for its cross-game dashboard. It’s been updating that dashboard to get better about showing you games, exposing you to new games and letting you use its clipping features to share killer plays with your friends. It’s one of the best gaming apps I’ve seen on iOS in years, and it has big potential to create a cross-universe place to play for the biggest gaming audience in the world. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2171070" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png" alt="" width="1024" height="473" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png 3248w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png?resize=768,355 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png?resize=680,314 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png?resize=1536,709 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png?resize=2048,946 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Highlights-Editor.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Capture Button on Backbone One works with Xbox Cloud Gaming and lets you share it as a link. There’s also a new Xbox Game Pass feed and a way to move between Xbox and iOS games in the same interface. There’s  also a big callout for Xbox Remote Play, a feature that’s still super-under-utilized and actually quite good on current gen consoles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the package even makes use of an AppClip to display an AR version of Backbone running xCloud for people happening on the retail packaging at a store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Backbone team continues to impress with its slick and clever integrations and solid instincts. The game controller pedigree of the team shows (some original Xbox 360 controller team members worked on Backbone) but the software aspects are the most impressive. The way that Backbone unifies gaming experiences across AAA iOS ports like Warzone or Minecraft, Xbox and Playstation Remote Play and now native xCloud games feels like the way of the future for mobile gaming in a way that none of the individual players, including Apple, has managed to get right. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2171068" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backbone_SeaofThievesdark.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though xCloud games are web based they are treated and presented as native apps inside Backbone’s really well done dashboard. I’ve personally played a lot of Destiny 2 over Stadia on Backbone and it feels fantastic, I can’t wait for it to be more directly integrated into the dash with clipping and social like the Xbox cloud titles are today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience of discovering, downloading and playing a game is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">better</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a Backbone installed than even Apple Arcade now that the team is getting more into curation. They’ve also got a really slick linking mechanism that allows you to download apps right from the App Store if you see a clip of them being shared on your feed. This is how internet native players want to find and play new games &#8212; a continuously hyperlinked world of games and streams that makes it possible to see, follow and play without having to stop to manually search for anything.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also making me yearn for a time when discovering games goes beyond ‘downloading’ them and into a world where I can see a clip shared by a friend, tap on it and be playing a single level or match that gets me hooked before having to go buy the game. It would be a killer acquisition onramp for new players. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Microsoft tie up means that someone who purchases the Backbone for $99 </span><a href="https://playbackbone.com/products/backbone-one/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from its website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or at Microsoft Stores today gets 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate, making this the absolute best deal for new customers considering GPU is $45 alone. That’s bound to be a huge boost for Backbone as a young gaming startup. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">antitrust suit against Facebook</a> by the FTC and several states had the wind taken out of its sails today by a federal judge, who ruled that the plaintiffs don&#8217;t provide enough evidence that the company exerts monopoly control over social media. The court was more receptive, however, to revisiting the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, and the case was left open for regulators to take another shot at it.</p>
<p>The court decision was in response to a Facebook motion to dismiss the suit. Judge James Boesberg of the D.C. circuit explained that the provided evidence of monopoly and antitrust violations was &#8220;too speculative and conclusory to go forward.&#8221; In a more ordinary industry, it might have sufficed, he admits, but &#8220;this case involves no ordinary or intuitive market.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was incumbent on the plaintiffs to back up their allegation of Facebook controlling 60 percent of the market with clear and voluminous data and a convincing delineation of what exactly that market comprises — and it failed to do so, wrote Boesberg. Therefore he dismissed the complaints in accordance with Facebook&#8217;s legal argument. (I&#8217;ve asked the FTC and Facebook for comment and will update this post if I hear back.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, Boesberg is sensible that lack of evidence in the record does not mean that the evidence does not exist. So he his giving the FTC and states 30 days to amend their filing, after which the complaints will be reevaluated.</p>

<p>He also found that Facebook&#8217;s logic for dismissing the suit&#8217;s allegations regarding its controversial acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp was lacking.</p>
<p>Facebook argued that even supposing that these acquisitions were somehow problematic, the FTC is not authorized to prosecute such &#8220;long-past conduct&#8221; and is limited to more recent or imminent problems. Boesberg was not convinced, finding precedent that essentially says such mergers are legally considered current as long as they exist, and the government can revisit them any time it thinks it has cause.</p>
<p>That may very well be the plan of the FTC&#8217;s new Chair, Lina Khan, who has taken a hawkish regulatory position regarding antitrust in general and past acquisitions specifically. At her confirmation hearing she commented that the approvals of the mergers may have been made without complete information and as such represented a &#8220;missed opportunity&#8221; to understand and build rules around.</p>
<p>The 30 day punt in fact may be a great opportunity for Khan to put her ideas into practice, as the judge practically literally invites them to rewrite the complaint with more information. Whether she and the FTC have enough material to put together a compelling case remains to be seen, but one thing is for certain: Facebook should put the champagne back in the fridge, for now at least. Khan may not stop at a slap on the wrist.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After raising tens of millions from investors and executing a pretty substantial pivot earlier this year, augmented reality startup Ubiquity6 and its team have been acquired by gaming chat app giant Discord.</p>
<p>The ambitious AR startup had raised $37.5 million from a series of top investors including Benchmark, First Round, Kleiner Perkins and Google&#8217;s Gradient Ventures who were betting on its vision of building a consumer-facing platform for hosting augmented reality content. Its most recent publicly disclosed financing was a $27 million Series B in October of 2018.</p>
<p>Terms of the Discord acquisition weren&#8217;t disclosed, though in recent months the startup seemed to abandon most of the products it had spent its first several years building, suggesting that Ubiquity6 had been having some issues finding wide audiences for its products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ubiquity6 nabs $10.5 million from top investors to build a deeper augmented reality&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/ubiquity6-nabs-10-5-million-from-top-investors-to-build-a-deeper-augmented-reality/embed/#?secret=oY7rUFofWC" data-secret="oY7rUFofWC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Launching back in 2017, Ubiquity6 hoped to build an app that would be the central way mobile phone users would browse augmented reality content. In late 2019, the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/ubiquity6s-display-land-is-part-3d-scanner-part-social-network/">launched a product called Displayland</a>, which aimed to gamify the process of 3D scanning physical environments with a smartphone&#8217;s camera.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s efforts to find mass adoption were hampered by a mobile AR market which has largely failed to gain any momentum in recent years despite hefty investment from tech giants including Apple and Google.</p>
<p>In early 2020, CEO Anjney Midha told TechCrunch that the startup had some 65 employees.</p>
<p>In recent months, Ubiquity6 had executed a pretty drastic pivot, leaving augmented reality completely behind in favor of building out a desktop platform that allowed users to play simple online party games together remotely. The beta platform, called <a href="https://backyard.co/sunset">Backyard</a>, was designed for pandemic era habits that seem to be on the decline as the US springs back into action. Backyard was discontinued this week as part of the acquisition announcement.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://medium.com/@ubiquity_6/ubiquity6-discord-3b54cd715943">Medium post</a> announcing the acquisition, Midha seems to downplay any expectations that Ubiquity6&#8217;s augmented reality technology will be living on inside Discord.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission at Ubiquity6 has always been to unlock new ways for people to connect through shared experiences,&#8221; Midha wrote. &#8220;Joining Discord today allows us to accelerate that mission — Ubiquity6’s team, Backyard product and multiplayer technology will be integrated into Discord.&#8221;</p>

<p>Compounding this issue is the reluctance many founders have to disclose how they’re feeling to those closest to them for fear that they will be perceived as a “failure” or ill-equipped to perform their job. Imagine for a moment that a founder is struggling with addiction or substance abuse because of the demands and pressures of running their company. Now imagine compounding the worry and anxiety by having to reveal something like this to investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Michael Freeman, a psychiatrist and former CEO who serves on the faculty of the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, investigated the prevalence and characteristics of mental health conditions among entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Founders are twice as likely to suffer from depression, six times more likely to suffer from ADHD, three times more likely to suffer from substance abuse and twice as likely to have suicidal thoughts than a demographically matched comparison.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>He concluded founders are twice as likely to suffer from depression, six times more likely to suffer from ADHD, three times more likely to suffer from substance abuse and twice as likely to have suicidal thoughts than a demographically matched comparison. Freeman found that entrepreneurs are 50% more likely to report having a mental health condition, with some specific conditions being incredibly prevalent among founders.</p>
<p>The statistics are eye-opening, but the real, tangible impact can be truly devastating.</p>
<p>I say all the time that if I have a sore arm or a sore shoulder, I&#8217;ll come into work and I&#8217;ll whine about it. But if I couldn&#8217;t sleep last night or I&#8217;m paranoid about going outside or I&#8217;ve been taking too many sleeping pills or drinking too much wine, I won&#8217;t talk about it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll say that I&#8217;m going to my doctor to get my shoulder fixed, but I won&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m going to talk to my therapist.</p>
<p>At QED Investors, we experienced the terrible results of this silence firsthand. In 2018, we lost our partner Greg Mazanec after a long battle with substance abuse. Since then, we’ve been working with Greg’s family to determine how we can do our part to prevent others in the VC and startup worlds from suffering the same fate.</p>
<p>I can’t speak highly enough of Greg, both as a personal friend and a colleague. He was the definition of an amazing human being — an orthogonal thinker, tenacious, brilliant, quirky. We lost him far too soon. Today, we carry him around on our shoulders.</p>
<p>We had a team of 15 people at the time, so you can imagine how close everyone was. I swore to myself and to his family that I would talk about him wherever I had the chance. So, whenever I get in front of LPs or my portfolio companies, I bring this issue out into the open to tackle this corrosive stigma head-on.</p>

<p>Taking mental health discussions out of the shadows can massively change the trajectory of outcomes. Our world of venture capital is replete with people who are going through these kinds of difficulties, even before the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated people’s fears and worries. People have felt increasingly isolated, depressed, anxious and helpless. Some may have turned to opioids or another form of addiction or substance misuse.</p>
<p>The research is clear &#8212; support from friends, peers and colleagues is pivotal in conquering mental illness. As companies start returning to the office or adopting a home-office hybrid, organizations have a real chance to refocus their company cultures, destigmatize addiction and make mental wellness a priority. This is a unique window to focus on this disease.</p>
<p>The Mazanec family created <a href="https://theoperationlighthouse.org/">Operation Lighthouse</a> to address substance abuse and addiction in the ecosystem most dear to Greg &#8212; the founder and entrepreneur community. It was the easiest of decisions for QED to lean in heavily to support this wonderful initiative.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, QED piloted a program called Just Five with three of our portfolio companies. Created by national mental health nonprofit <a href="https://www.shatterproof.org/">Shatterproof</a>, <a href="https://justfive.org/">Just Five</a> delivers, in 5 minutes per lesson, the most important concepts and facts regarding addiction.</p>
<p>Today, we are excited to roll out that same self-paced and anonymous educational program free of charge to more than 16,000 employees across all 50 of QED’s U.S.-based portfolio companies.</p>
<p>This program’s intent is to provide mental health education and catalyze informed discussion to ultimately reduce stigma.</p>
<p>Over the course of the year, we intend to expand the reach of this program to our international portfolio companies, as well as to other VCs who might wish to support their founders. A Spanish-language version is already planned.</p>
<p>Each of the six lessons has a specific theme. The first two lessons touch on the science of addiction and how certain factors such as age of first use, genetics and environment can explain why some people become addicted and others do not.</p>
<p>The middle lessons explain the dangers of opioids and the signs, symptoms and treatment options for substance abuse, while the final topics touch on ways people can help. The majority of the overwhelmingly positive feedback we have received so far has been centered around those final two lessons. We learned something that we anecdotally already knew &#8212; people want to help, but those who need help the most don’t always know how to ask for it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken every opportunity I’ve had to discuss mental health over the past few years. I truly believe that if you destigmatize it, people can deal with it. It’s a solvable problem. Just like your sore shoulder, it can be fixed. We just have to do a better job at creating a culture where people can take the first step and speak openly about it.</p>
<p>We can — we <em>must</em> — make a difference. Have your voice join mine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last fall, Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/opening-an-office-in-lagos-nigeria/">announced</a> it was opening an office in Lagos, Nigeria, which would provide the company with a hub in the region and the first office on the continent staffed with a team of engineers. We&#8217;ve now spotted one of the first products to emerge from this office: an education-focused mobile app called Sabee, which means &#8220;to know&#8221; in Nigerian Pidgin. The app aims to connect learners and educators in online communities to make educational opportunities more accessible.</p>
<p>The app was briefly published to Google Play by &#8220;NPE Team,&#8221; the internal R&amp;D group at Facebook, which has typically focused on new social experiences in areas like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/facebook-tests-video-speed-dating-events-with-sparked/">dating</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/facebook-tests-hotline-a-qa-product-thats-a-mashup-of-clubhouse-and-instagram-live/">audio</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/facebook-launches-bars-a-tiktok-like-app-for-creating-and-sharing-raps/">music</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/facebook-publicly-launches-its-collaborative-music-video-app-collab/">video</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/facebook-launches-an-experimental-app-for-messaging-close-friends-over-apple-watch/">messaging </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/facebook-launches-e-gg-an-experimental-collage-making-app/">more</a>.</p>
<p>While the learnings from the NPE Team&#8217;s apps sometimes inform broader Facebook efforts, the group hasn&#8217;t yet produced an app that has graduated to become a standalone Facebook product. Many of its earlier apps have also shut down, including (<a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/egg-is-facebooks-one-good-product-it-doesnt-deserve-to-die">somewhat sadly</a>), the online zine creator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/facebook-launches-e-gg-an-experimental-collage-making-app/">Eg.g</a>, video app<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/facebook-shuts-down-hobbi-its-experimental-app-for-documenting-personal-projects/"> Hobbi</a>, calling app CatchUp, friend-finder Bump, podcast community app Venue, and several others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sabee, however, represents a new direction for the NPE Team, as it&#8217;s not about building yet another social experiment.</p>
<p>Instead, Sabee is tied to Facebook&#8217;s larger strategy of focusing more on serving the African continent, starting with Nigeria. This is a strategic move, informed by <a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/urban-population-to-become-the-new-majority-worldwide/">data</a> that indicates a larger majority of the world&#8217;s population will be in urban centers by 2030, and much of that will be on the African continent and throughout the Middle East. By 2100, Africa&#8217;s population is <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1905838/facebook-to-open-africa-office-in-lagos-nigeria-in-2021/">expected to have tripled</a>, with Nigeria becoming the second-most populated country in the world, behind China.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171015" style="width: 259px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171015" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2171015" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-1.png?w=249" alt="" width="249" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-1.png 249w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-1.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-1.png?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-1.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171015" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook NPE Team</p></div></p>
<p>To address the need to connect these regions to the internet, Facebook teamed with telcos on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/2africa-africa-middle-east-facebook-subsea-cable/">2Africa, a subsea cable project</a> that aims to serve the over 1 billion people still offline in Africa and the Middle East. These aren&#8217;t altruistic investments, of course &#8212; Facebook knows its future growth will come from these demographics.</p>
<p>Facebook confirmed its plans for Sabee to TechCrunch after we discovered it, noting it was still a small test for the time being.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are 50 million learners, but only 2 million educators in Nigeria,&#8221; said Facebook Product Lead, Emeka Okafor. &#8220;With this small, early test, we’re hoping to understand how we can help educators build communities that make education available to everyone. We look forward to learning with our early testers, and deciding what to do from there.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171010" style="width: 259px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171010" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2171010" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-4.png?w=249" alt="" width="249" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-4.png 249w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-4.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-4.png?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sabee-4.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171010" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook NPE Team</p></div></p>
<p>The disparity between learners and educators in Nigeria greatly impacts women and girls, which is another key focus for Sabee &#8212; and the NPE Team&#8217;s efforts in the region as a whole. The company also wants to explore how to better serve groups who are often left behind by technology. On this front, Sabee is working to create an experience that works with low connectivity, like 2G.</p>
<p>We understand the app is currently in early alpha testing with fewer than 100 testers who are under NDA agreements with Facebook. It&#8217;s not available for anyone else beyond that group at present, but the company hopes to scale Sabee to the next stage before the end of the year.</p>
<p>There is no way to sign up for a Sabee waitlist, and the app is no longer public on Google Play. It was available so briefly that it was never ranked on any charts, app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower confirmed to us.</p>
<p>We should note that &#8220;sabee&#8221; and &#8220;sabi/sabis&#8221; have other, less-polite meanings in different languages, per Urban Dictionary. But the team has no plans to change the name for now as it makes sense in the Nigerian market where the app is targeted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On this week&#8217;s episode of <a href="http://pod.link/found">Found</a>, we speak to Rob Schutz, co-founder and Chief Growth Officer at Ro. Ro recently raised $500 million, bringing its total raised to date to near $1 billion. The digital healthcare startup now does everything from telehealth primary care, to operating physical pharmacies, but it originally began life as Roman, a startup addressing men&#8217;s health and, specifically, erectile dysfunction.</p>
<p>Rob told us how a windy path from founding a daily deals site in the heady times of Groupon, to teaching at General Assembly, and being an early employee at Bark Box (now just &#8216;Bark&#8217;) led him to meeting up with co-founders Zachariah Reitano and Saman Rahmanian and setting up Roman in the first place. He also detailed how the company evolved, first to address women&#8217;s health, as well, and eventually to providing much more broad-reaching remote primary care.</p>
<p>We talked about everything from managing the dynamics in a founder triumvirate (including declarations of love), to dealing with the ongoing complications of a rebrand, to operating a business in an industry with dense regulatory requirements that vary considerably state to state.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We loved our time chatting with Rob, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode. And of course, we’d love if you can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Yes, developers are a tough crowd. They hate being sold to, and it’s pretty easy for traditional marketing campaigns to fall flat with them because they’d much rather get a recommendation from a colleague. Failed campaign after failed campaign has led many software company executives to throw up their hands and declare all sales and marketing to be pointless.</p>
<p>And that’s just wrong. Selling to developers isn’t impossible — it’s just difficult. I cover <em>why</em> it’s difficult and offer examples of exceptional developer-focused marketing in <a href="http://offers.openviewpartners.com/developerfocusedgtmplaybook">my new playbook</a>. Part of selling to developers involves balancing two things: building out a strong organic marketing function and targeting your audience with the right message at the right time throughout their buyer journey.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Selling to developers isn’t impossible — it’s just difficult.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Easier said than done, right?</p>
<p>Yep. I see it all the time. Part of what’s blocking marketers from widening the top of the funnel (driving more developers to sign up for their free tools) for their developer-focused businesses is ensuring they have the right data and measurement capabilities in place to understand how much impact their activities have on the business.</p>
<p>That’s mostly because these marketers, community managers and developer relations experts have the most luck with organic marketing. In this industry, organic marketing is one of the most challenging to measure.</p>
<p>Organic marketing means investing in channels like referrals, organic search, organic social (community) and direct traffic to your website (brand). New users from paid marketing, banner ads, events or sales reps (the most measurable channels) don’t count as organic. We measure the fruits of these efforts with a new metric called <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/new-saas-metric/">Natural Rate of Growth</a>.</p>
<p>In a digital, multi-touch-point world, it’s getting more challenging to measure which users hear about your brand from which channels. That’s why tools like <a href="https://orbit.love/">Orbit</a>, <a href="https://tribe.so/">Tribe</a> and <a href="https://www.mightynetworks.com/">Mighty</a> have gained traction so quickly.</p>
<p>That’s all good, and it’ll be a huge boon for community managers in time, but these tools still don’t solve some of the core data strategy issues I see developer-focused software companies fighting. These quick tips should help your team align around what needs to be done and what&#8217;s just a “nice to have” so that selling to developers feels less like a battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Treat data like a product where a core end user is the go-to-market side of the team.</li>
<li>Map your customer’s journey from discovery to expansion and track it religiously.</li>
<li>Don’t overthink it.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LocoNav, an India-based startup that is helping drivers and fleet owners in over two-dozen nations run their vehicles more efficiently and save money, said on Monday it has raised $37 million in a new financing round.</p>
<p>Five-year-old LocoNav&#8217;s new financing round, a Series B, was funded by Quiet Capital, Anthemis Group, Foundamental, Sequoia Capital India, RIT Capital Partners, Uncorrelated Ventures, Village Global and others. The new financing round brings the to-date raise of LocoNav, which has offices in San Francisco and Gurgaon, to $47 million.</p>
<p>Scores of high-profile tech executives, including Anjali Joshi (ex-VP of Product at Google), Anand Chandrasekaran (ex-CPO at SnapDeal and ex-Director Facebook), Manik Gupta (ex-CPO at Uber), Jai Shekhawat, Mark Licht, Akhil Paul, Vas Bhandarkar, Ajay Agarwal (Partner at Bain Capital Ventures), Abhi Ingle (COO at Qualtrics), Aadil Mamujee, also participated in the new round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over half a million vehicle and fleet owners in 25 nations use LocoNav’s platform today, which uses AI to help them manage their fleet operations, keep a watch on performance, and improve efficiency, the startup’s founders Shridhar Gupta and Vidit Jain told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>The startup’s platform delivers assistance and recommendations to drivers to make better choices. <a href="https://loconav.com">LocoNav</a> also enables customers to track fuel usage, and any potential theft. Its platform supports over a thousand devices and sensors, enabling it to onboard new customers very quickly.</p>
<p>The founders said that the market in which they operate has become very large over the past decade as many drivers and fleet owners begin to engage with tech platforms. Some of the players operating in this space include unicorns and decacorns Fleetcor, Trimble and a16z-backed Samsara.</p>
<p>But these players are largely operating in developed markets, which has allowed LocoNav to win customers in emerging nations, the founders said. “In global developing markets, no one has ambitiously built a large player and we see ourselves as the first mover there,” said Gupta. The founders added that the biggest roadblock in the industry remains drivers and fleet owners who are not using any tech.</p>
<p>“LocoNav has built an end-to-end product that becomes deeply embedded in how fleet owners and operators run their business. As a result, LocoNav has been able to scale rapidly through word of mouth, allowing the company to become a hyper growth market leader while also being very capital efficient,” said David Greenbaum, Partner at Quiet Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>By having such deep visibility into a vehicle, LocoNav has also become very attractive to a range of firms &#8212; from app-based cab aggregators, car vendors to fintech startups and sensor manufacturers, said Jain. The startup is also using its data insights to develop customer-relevant services and bringing them to a single platform, he added.</p>
<p>LocoNav plans to deploy the fresh capital to hire data science teams across San Francisco, Gurgaon and Bangalore. In the next two years, the startup aims to broaden its product offerings to help fleet owners cut their costs by up to 50%, the founders said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shridhar and Vidit have found the ideal playbook for delivering world-class value-added services and products to fleet owners across the globe through the use of AI and software solutions. We are thrilled at how rapidly the firm has been able to expand its global footprint by replicating its own model and suite of offerings for fleet owners,&#8221; said Shubhankar Bhattacharya, General Partner at Foundamental, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung’s Mobile World Congress presser was, once again, all about wearables. The big news at this evening’s (or afternoon’s, timezone dependent) event was <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/mwc-2021-samsung-new-one-ui-watch-experience/&amp;reserved=0">our best look yet at a redesigned interface</a> for the company’s line of Galaxy Watches.</p>
<p>One UI Watch – which takes its name from the Galaxy mobile interface &#8212; will share a design language with the one found on the company’s line of Galaxy phones. The upcoming One UI Watch will debut at an upcoming Unpacked event later this summer, sporting the new UI, as well as the forthcoming joint Samsung/Google platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170930" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170930" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170930" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/New-Unified-Platform-One-UI-Watch-Seamless-Experience.2021-06-28-11_56_37.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170930" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung/Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-and-samsung-are-teaming-up-to-take-on-apples-watchos/"> first teased at I/O last month</a> that the two technology powerhouses would be teaming up on a wearables project. We still have little in the way of information about it, however, – including what it will actually be called.</p>
<p>The partnership was initially announced as a “unified platform” that would allow developers to create a single app for both Google’s Wear OS and Tizen, the open-source operating system Samsung has long relied on for its own smartwatches. As we noted at the time, third-party app development has proven a considerable hurdle for both companies as they look to take on Apple’s dominance of the space.</p>
<p>Among the benefits of the partnerships is that once a watch-compatible app has been downloaded on a connected smartphone, it will also be downloaded to the watch. Along with first-party Google apps like Maps and YouTube Music, the list includes Spotify (naturally), Calm, Strava, Adidas Running and Sleep Cycle.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170931" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170931" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170931" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/New-Unified-Platform-One-UI-Watch-App-Ecosystem.2021-06-28-11_55_13.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170931" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung/Google</p></div></p>
<p>“Samsung and Google have a long history of collaboration, and whenever we’ve worked together, the experience for our consumers has been dramatically better for everyone,” Google SVP Sameer Samat said in a release tied to the news. “That certainly holds true for this new, unified platform, which will be rolling out for the first time on Samsung’s new Galaxy Watch. In collaboration with Samsung, we’re thrilled to bring longer battery life, faster performance, and a wide range of apps, including many from Google to a whole new wearable experience.”</p>
<p>Such a partnership seems odd at first blush – Samsung long ago eschewed Google’s wearable operating system in favor of its own heavily customized version of Tizen. Ultimately, however, it seems the two are united against the monolith that is Apple – which currently enjoys somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% of the global market. Samsung is in second, but even with Fitbit under its wing, Google’s still got a ways to go.</p>
<p>Samsung will also be showing off improved development tools that make it easier to create things like watch faces for the platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft today released the first preview build of Windows 11 to those in the Dev Channel of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/">Windows Insider</a> program. If you have joined the Insider program and meet Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/24/preparing-for-insider-preview-builds-of-windows-11/">new &#8212; and somewhat complicated &#8212; system requirements</a> for the new operating system, you should see the update soon.</p>
<p>This first preview includes most of the new features Microsoft has promised for Windows 11, including the new look and feel, themes, widgets, the new snap layouts and the updated File Explorer. But there are also some features that didn&#8217;t yet make the cut for this first release. Support for Android apps and the new built-in Teams integration, for example, are coming in a later release, but a preview of the new Windows Store is already available today.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/g7y1S3wIysg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Otherwise, though, you&#8217;ll get to try out the new Start menu for example (and fret not, you will be able to move the start button to the bottom-left if you don&#8217;t like the centered look &#8212; but you won&#8217;t be able to move the entire taskbar to another side of the screen). And while the Start menu is an iconic part of the Windows experience, most power users probably never use it and instead use their keyboard or the taskbar to start 99% of their applications. Still, Microsoft is trying to do something different here with its new &#8220;recommended&#8221; section that highlights newly installed apps and recently used files.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170667" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170667" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170667" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg" alt="windows 11 file explorer" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170667" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Another new feature you&#8217;ll likely spot right away is the new File Explorer, which now does away with the ribbon-style menu in favor of a flatter look (Microsoft calls it a &#8216;command bar&#8217;) and new, more modern icons across the board. It looks good, but we&#8217;ll have to give it a try to see if it hasn&#8217;t lost a lot of functionality in the process.</p>
<p>The File Explorer, just like every other app in WIndows 11, will also feature support for Microsoft&#8217;s new Snap layouts, which take the existing &#8216;snapping&#8217; gesture or keyboard shortcuts in Windows that let you snap windows to any side of the screen and brings it to the maximize button. While the overall functionality isn&#8217;t new here, I&#8217;m pretty sure that a lot of Windows users never knew it existed, so this new feature will introduce window snapping to a lot more users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170668" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170668" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170668" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg" alt="Windows 11 widgets" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg 1531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170668" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>The new widgets, too, are now prominently highlighted in the taskbar. Right now, there are calendar, weather, local traffic, Microsoft To Do and stocks widgets, as well widgets that show you recent photos from OneDrive and sports and esports news if that&#8217;s your thing. There&#8217;s also a personalized news feed.</p>
<p>The last new feature worth mentioning here is the new Settings menu. Ever since the ill-fated Windows 8, Windows essentially had two settings menus (the Control Panel and Settings). It looks like those confusing days aren&#8217;t over just yet, but the new Settings menu at least looks a lot cleaner than the existing one in Windows 10.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2170669" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg" alt="windows 11 settings" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=768,510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>There are, of course, plenty of other changes in Windows 11. This is definitely more than just another bi-annual Windows 10 update with a few minor UI changes. Now we&#8217;ll just have to see how all of this works in the real world &#8212; though keep in mind that this is still an early release. The preview is now rolling out to Insiders, so we&#8217;ll likely hear more about how it performs soon. We&#8217;ll also put it through its paces in the coming days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The math is simple: Great research universities beget great startups. Pittsburgh certainly has little want for the former, with two world-class research schools &#8212; Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh – located in the city.</p>
<p>The latter historically presented a challenge for Pittsburgh, as local startups often left for the greener (in the sense of dollars) pastures of vibrant ecosystems like New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/pittsburghs-mayor-on-the-citys-startup-community-and-the-difficulty-of-attracting-venture-capital/">speaking to current mayor Bill Peduto</a> about how Pittsburgh is working to build its own startup community, I hopped on a call with Dave Mawhinney, the executive director of CMU’s Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship. The Center – named for Accel founder Jim Swartz – is tasked with helping grow the student body’s entrepreneurial ambitions.</p>

<p><strong>TechCrunch: Can you give me a bit of a brief history on how CMU has developed startups over the years?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dave Mawhinney</strong>: First of all, I’m a CMU alum – and I’m not your typical academic. I had a 30-year entrepreneurial and venture capital career before I came back to Carnegie Mellon a decade ago to make it on-par with Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, Harvard and other great entrepreneurial universities[…] When I came back to CMU in 2011, 2012, there were several different activities across campus that were rather siloed.</p>
<p>There was an effort in the computer science department, there was an effort in the engineering department, there was an effort in the business school and they were all doing their own things and not necessarily getting the economies of scale of working together. When the university asked me to come back and run the Don Jones Center at the business school, I said I would only do so if you give me the agency to try to pull together all of our entrepreneurial activities under one rough.</p>
<p><strong>You can create a really breakthrough technology, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve got the ability to market it yourself to create an effective business plan. How much is that built into the curriculum at CMU? And how much cross pollination is there between the various departments?</strong></p>
<p>We have a sign at our front door that says, “the ideal startup team is hacker, hustler, designer.” The hackers are the technical people, the hustlers are the people that are willing to do business, to talk to partners. And I think designers are absolutely key because they are the glue that holds everything together. They make the products and services useable. It’s truly in our DNA and as we do our education in the four-credit classes, or as we do our workshops that are outside the classroom, that concept of design thinking, really getting to know your customer and solving real world problems that they’re willing to pay for now, is critical to getting the company off to the right start.</p>
<p>We also very much believe in the model of mentorship, so all of our startups get assigned mentors that are from the generalized background of the business that they’re going into. And then we have a roster of several hundred experts, from legal experts, accounting experts, marketing experts, manufacturing experts &#8212; any type of expertise that you can imagine that our teams can reach out to and tap into, to get questions answered and to get set on the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of vetting happens on the university side? Does a startup have to pass a certain threshold to gain access to all of these opportunities?</strong></p>
<p>Everybody’s welcome. Our doors are open to everybody, but there are some steps. When you come and sign up to work at the Swartz Center, you get to go to a first come, first serve table. There’s typically 20 of these tables available at any given time. The teams that show dedication, they participate in our programs, they’re showing up on a daily and weekly basis and they’re making progress, they’ll get a dedicated table, where they get to put their branding on the table and keep their equipment there. And the, ultimately, the teams that are making the most progress have customers and perhaps have raised a pre-seed or seed round, they get their own office. We have ten of those called “Startup Garages.” We do have that bit of meritocracy built in, as you go forward, but it is open to everybody. The truth is the founding teams, the entrepreneurs, they have to make it happen. We’re not going to spoon feed you.</p>
<p><strong>Like a lot of other schools located outside of major metropolitan areas, I assume there’s a lot of bleed when it comes to leaving for different markets.</strong></p>
<p>That has been true historically, but it’s changed. Really, the seminal event was when Google put an office in Pittsburgh in 2006. They have over 1,000 employees. Every major tech company &#8212; Amazon, Facebook, Apple &#8212; have all embedded hundreds of engineers in our community, so we’re growing really, really rapidly. Artificial intelligence was invented at Carnegie Mellon – and that sort of set off the robot revolution […] Now we’re the center of the automated vehicle community. Aurora is co-located here, Argo is here, Aptiv is here. We have a very vibrant community and we do want to continue to grow it.</p>
<p>But one of the challenges is getting that capital to come into the community. If you look at how much Uber ATG brought in, how much Argo AI and Aurora – collectively, those three companies, which have all licensed CMU technologies, they’ve all got over $7 billion in collective capital. Not all of it will be spent here, but a lot of it will be spent here. But that doesn’t necessarily trickle down to the next AI startup raising their first $3 million. So we do need to keep that connectivity to the money centers in the Bay Area and New York to ensure that our startups will get funded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer spending in mobile apps hit a record $64.9 billion during the first half of 2021, according to <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-1h-2021">preliminary data</a> from app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower. This figure represents a 24.8% increase in spending seen across both the App Store and Google Play, compared with the year-ago period. But while industry experts believe the accelerated shift to mobile fueled by the pandemic is a trend that will continue, it&#8217;s worth noting that &#8212; despite the new record &#8212; the growth rate for consumer spending has slightly slowed, and the download growth slowed more dramatically.</p>
<p>From the first half of 2019 to the first half of 2020, consumer spending on mobile apps grew 28.4% from $40.5 billion to $52 billion, for comparison &#8212; slower than the 24.8% seen in the current period.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170935" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170935" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170935" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png 1750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=1536,962 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170935" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple&#8217;s App Store accounted for $41.5 billion in global consumer spending during the first half of 2021, or 1.8x the $23.4 billion seen by Google Play.</p>
<p>However, Google Play continues to outpace on growth, having jumped 30% from the $18 billion in the first half of 2020 compared with the 22.1% growth from the $34 billion the App Store had seen. This is due, in part, to demand from markets like the Philippines, where the Covid-19 pandemic has forced business closures and quarantines, Sensor Tower noted.</p>
<p>Consumer spend outside of games was driven by sports, finance, business, book and entertainment apps. Subscription-based apps in the top 100 apps (excluding games) were a large part of this spend, too, contributing $8.3 billion during the period. TikTok remained a top grossing app during the first half of 2021, followed by YouTube and regular top earner Tinder.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170936" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170936" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170936" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="405" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?resize=768,458 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?resize=680,405 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170936" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, mobile game spending continues to contribute to the largest part of the overall consumer spend, reaching $44.7 billion during the first half of the year. The App Store accounted for $26 billion of that figure, but growth slowed from 26.5% in the year-ago period to 13.5% from the first half of 2020 to the first half of 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170954" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170954" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170954" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png 1750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=1536,962 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-game-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170954" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>Top grossing games in the first half of 2021 were, in order, Tencent&#8217;s Honor of Kings ($15B+), PUBG Mobile (including its localized version for China, reached nearly $1.5B), Genshin Impact ($848M+), Roblox and Coin Master.</p>
<p>Mobile app download growth also significantly slowed in the first half of this year, the firm found.</p>
<p>Last year, the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to a surge of new mobile app installs around the world, as consumer looked to apps for work, school, shopping, heath, grocery, and more. During the first half of 2020, app installs had jumped 25.7% year-over-year to reach 71.3 billion downloads. But in the first half of 2021, downloads only grew 1.7% to reach 72.5 billion installs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2170940" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png 1750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=1536,962 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The App Store even saw a year-over-year decline in non-game installs in the first half of 2021, dropping 10.9% to 16.3 billion from 18.3 billion in the first half of 2020. Sensor Tower believes this is reflective of the increased competition for consumer attention in markets with a high number of iOS users, like the U.S., where businesses have been reopening and in-person activities are resuming.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Google Play (non-game) installs climbed 6% in the first half of this year to 56.2 billion from the 53 billion in the first half of 2020. This could be tied to the demand for apps in markets where Android is dominant, like India, which has continued to be impacted by the pandemic. As a result, app adoption on Google Play was 3.5 times higher than on the App Store during the first half of 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170941" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170941" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170941" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-download-chart.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="405" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-download-chart.png 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-download-chart.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-download-chart.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-download-chart.png?resize=768,458 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-download-chart.png?resize=680,405 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-download-chart.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170941" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>The (non-game) app with the most downloads was TikTok, which gained 384.6 million new installs during the first half of this year. But this is down by around 38% from the 619 million installs it saw during the year-ago period &#8212; a change that can be attributed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">its ban from the Indian market</a> last year. The rest of the top 5 most-downloaded app chart was dominated by Facebook, which scored the No. 2, No. 3, and No 4 positions, with Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, respectively. Telegram was No. 5 followed by Messenger, Zoom, Snapchat, CapCut and Google Meet.</p>
<p>Mobile game downloads, meanwhile, fell 22.8% to 4.4 billion on the App Store but grew 3.9% on Google Play to 23.7 billion in the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>The app data presented is a preliminary analysis that may become more precise over time. It&#8217;s also worth comparing it to related reports from other firms for a fuller picture.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["What we need is more capital — angel funds, venture funds so that entrepreneurs have a variety of funding sources to go to locally."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ahead of our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-city-spotlight/">TechCrunch City Spotlight: Pittsburgh</a> event tomorrow, I spoke <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/pittsburghs-mayor-on-the-citys-startup-community-and-the-difficulty-of-attracting-venture-capital/">to current Mayor Bill Peduto</a> and Dave Mawhinney, the executive director of Carnegie Mellon University’s Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship. Like many in the Steel City startup community, both share a focus on the historically difficult task of keeping startups in town.</p>
<p>For more on investing in Pittsburgh, be sure to tune in to our City Spotlight on Tuesday, June 29, where we will be joined by Peduto, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">Duolingo</a> director of engineering Karin Tsai and Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">Register for the free event here.</a></p>
<p>I asked Peduto and Mawhinney what the single biggest obstacle has been in building out Pittsburgh’s startup ecosystem. Both responded the same way: venture capital. Raising funding is, of course, a hurdle regardless of location, but many VCs have been reluctant to invest in startups outside of traditional hubs like San Francisco and New York.</p>

<p>“But one of the challenges is getting that capital to come into the community,” said Mawhinney, who leads CMU’s startup efforts. “If you look at how much Uber ATG brought in, how much Argo AI and Aurora &#8212; collectively, those three companies, which have all licensed CMU technologies, they’ve all got over $7 billion in collective capital. Not all of it will be spent here, but a lot of it will be spent here. But that doesn’t necessarily trickle down to the next AI startup raising their first $3 million.”</p>

<p>Peduto said growing the VC pipeline has been a focus during his time as mayor.</p>
<p>“I think we’ve been able to convince investors from the coast that the companies don’t need to leave Pittsburgh in order to be highly successful and see their investment pay off,” he told TechCrunch. “However, I believe if we had more venture capital arriving here to help take early-stage companies into that critical next stage of expansion, it would build off itself and it would excel growth in all of the industry cluster, significantly.”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.sideinc.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a real estate technology company that works to turn agents and independent brokerages into boutique brands and businesses, has raised “$50 million-plus” in a funding round that more than doubles its valuation to $2.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest financing comes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/side-raises-150m-at-1b-valuation-to-help-real-estate-agents-go-it-alone/">just three months after the San Francisco-based startup raised $150 million in a Series D funding round</a> led by Coatue Management at a $1 billion valuation. Tiger Global Management led the latest investment, which also included participation from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ICONIQ Capital and D1 Capital Partners. With the latest capital infusion, Side’s total raised since its 2017 inception now totals over $250 million. Matrix Partners, Sapphire Ventures, Trinity Ventures and 8VC led its earlier rounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side says that it is now “backed by the three top technology initial public offering (IPO) underwriters” and that the latest funding “sets the stage for a future IPO.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup pulled in between &#8220;$30 million and $50 million in revenue&#8221; in 2020 (a wide range, we know), and expects to double revenue this year. In 2019, Side represented over $5 billion in annual home sales across all of its partners. Today, the company’s community of agent partners represents over $15 billion in annual production volum</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">e.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s predicting that by the end of 2021, it will have closed over $20 billion in home sales, positioning the company “as a top 10 national brokerage by volume.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Side supports more than 1,800 partner agents across California, Texas and Florida. It says it’s seen a 200% year-over-year increase in agent-represented home sales across its three operating markets of California, Texas and Florida. The company plans to enter 15 new states by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guy Gal, Edward Wu and Hilary Saunders founded Side on the premise that most real estate agents are “underserved and under-appreciated” by traditional brokerage models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Gal said existing brokerages are designed to support “average” agents and, as such, the top-producing agents end up having to do “all of the heavy lifting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side’s white label model works with agents and teams by exclusively marketing their boutique brand, while also providing the required technology and support needed on the back end. The goal is to help partner agents “predictably grow” their businesses and improve their productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way to think about Side is the way you think about what Shopify does for e-commerce […] When partnering with Side, top-producing agents, teams and independent brokerages, for the first time in history, gain full ownership of their own brand and business without having to operate a brokerage,” Gal told me at the time of the company’s last raise. “When you spend years solving the problems of this very specific community of agents, you are able to use software to drive enormous efficiency for them in a way that has never been done before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing brokerages, he argues, actively discourage agents from becoming top producers and teams, because agents who serve fewer clients can be forced into paying much higher commission fees on every transaction, which means the incentives between brokerages and top agents and teams are misaligned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Top producers want to grow and differentiate, and brokerages want them to do less business at higher fees and be one more of the same under the same brand,” Gal said. “Side, rather than discouraging and competing with top-producing agents and teams, enables them to grow and scale their own business and brand.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With less than a month to go before the Olympics kick off in Tokyo, cord-cutting services like YouTube TV are attempting to woo new subscribers who are looking for a way to watch summer sports. But whether or not you&#8217;re eager to watch Simone Biles defy gravity, YouTube TV&#8217;s latest upgrades enhance the product with audio and video improvements.</p>
<p>Today, YouTube TV announced a 4K Plus add-on package with offline downloads, 5.1 Dolby audio, and features that make it easier to watch live sports. The company previously <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/neal-innovation-series/">teased these features</a> in February.</p>
<p>YouTube TV is already one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/youtube-tv-hikes-price-to-64-99-per-month-following-new-channel-additions/">the pricier streaming services</a> out there &#8212; at $64.99 per month, you might not save much money by choosing YouTube in lieu of your cable service. Hulu + Live TV is priced the same, but offers a Disney+ and ESPN+ add-on for a total of $72.99 per month. But if you want to kick your video quality (and your monthly bill) up a notch, you can now enable 4K streaming for an extra $19.99 per month, bringing your grand total to $84.98 monthly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The 4K Plus add-on package will also allow subscribers to download shows from DVR to watch offline &#8212; currently, that&#8217;s not possible on the standard $64.99 per month package. Subscribers will be able to try out the package for free for a month, then pay $9.99 per month for a year before the price increases to $19.99. This is pretty consistent with YouTube TV&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/youtube-tv-gets-some-new-channels-and-a-hefty-price-hike/">continual price hikes</a> over the years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 5.1 Dolby audio capabilities will be a free addition for all YouTube TV members &#8212; in a blog post, the company says this has been one of users&#8217; &#8220;biggest requests.&#8221; Over the coming weeks, these surround-sound audio capabilities will begin rolling out to select devices.</p>
<p>The sports upgrades also come at no additional cost &#8212; one new feature will let viewers jump to key plays and specific highlight moments when watching a DVR recording or trying to catch up live. So, if you&#8217;re tuning in an hour late, you can view key moments from the game, then jump right in live. YouTube TV will also let users search for specific sports to add to their DVR, which has no storage space limit. So, again, if you&#8217;re determined not to miss a single Simone Biles floor routine, it will be easier to make sure you&#8217;re in the loop. There will also be a Medal count view during the Olympics within the app.</p>
<p>As the Olympics draw nearer, we can expect other cord-cutting services to up the ante on their live sports offerings &#8212; the $9.99 monthly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/paramount-will-launch-a-4-99-monthly-ad-supported-subscription/">Paramount+ Premium plan</a> includes a wide range of international soccer matches, but no word on the Olympics yet. Still, the service is far less expensive than YouTube TV and already offers 4K, HDR, and Dolby Vision. YouTube TV had<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/youtube-roku-face-off-youtube-tv-added-to-main-app-free-streaming-devices/"> 3 million subscribers</a> as of October 2020, but did not offer an update for Q1 of 2021. As of March, Hulu had <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/hulu-statistics/">4.1 million subscribers</a> to its Live TV service, which will also air the Olympics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> co-founder Dennis Crowley has <a href="https://dens.medium.com/after-12-years-im-stepping-back-from-foursquare-10c75372123d">announced</a> that he is stepping back from his full-time role at the company. During the first seven years of the company, he was the startup’s Chief Executive Officer. In 2016, Crowley moved to an executive chairman position. He’s also been running the <a href="https://foursquare.com/labs/">Foursquare Labs</a> R&amp;D group since then.</p>
<p>Going forward, Crowley won’t be working full-time at the company. He’ll remain on the board of directors as co-chair <a href="https://foursquare.com/article/foursquares-dennis-crowley-and-gil-elbaz-shifting-to-board-of-directors-full/">with Factual founder Gil Elbaz</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Foursquare merges with Factual&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/foursquare-merges-with-factual/embed/#?secret=Vmq9xN72It" data-secret="Vmq9xN72It" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In 2009, Foursquare was better known for its location-based social network. People would check in to locations to share what they’ve been up to with their friends. Users would earn badges and mayorships.</p>
<p>Over the years, the most active users had amassed thousands of checkins. Foursquare became a great app to keep track of places you like. You could also use it to discover your friends’ favorite places.</p>
<p>That’s why the company decided to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/01/foursquare-splits-into-two-apps-but-will-either-be-strong-enough-to-survive/">split</a> its main app into two separate apps — the Foursquare City Guide and Swarm. At the same time, the company started working on developer APIs and SDKs so that other companies could take advantage of Foursquare’s location data.</p>
<p>That business in particular has been quite lucrative. With the company’s <a href="https://foursquare.com/products/pilgrim-sdk/">Pilgrim SDK</a>, developers can build location-aware apps. For instance, an advertiser can send a personalized notification based on where you are. Foursquare tries to be as accurate as possible and can sometimes even figure out when you enter or exit a venue.</p>
<p>That SDK enables many different possibilities. It’s easy to track the impact of an advertising campaign on online sales, but what about offline interest?</p>
<p>Foursquare’s SDK can help advertisers and brands see whether an advertising campaign has an impact on foot traffic. Of course, you can also combine that data with other customer data.</p>
<p>The company has become an important advertising and marketing platform focused on location. Overall, the company has generated more than $100 million in revenue in 2020. And it plans to grow in 2021 and beat that number.</p>
<p>Crowley mentions two reasons why he’s leaving now. According to him, the company is doing well, and he’s been working on the same thing for 12 years already.</p>
<p>“Foursquare hasn’t just found its way … it leads the way. I used to say that my goal was to make the name ‘Foursquare’ synonymous with ‘innovation in contextual aware computing’ … And, here in 2021, we’ve built the tools and frameworks that can make that so,” Crowley writes in a <a href="https://dens.medium.com/after-12-years-im-stepping-back-from-foursquare-10c75372123d">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>“Also, 12 years is a lot of time. I have lots of things I still want to build — many of which don’t fit neatly into the Foursquare of 2021 (and, hey fellow founder, it’s fine to feel this way!),” he adds. He&#8217;s also going to spend some well-deserved time with his family.</p>
<p>Crowley has been an iconic startup founder during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> era. He managed to attract tens of millions of users. It’s clear that he’s been a great product CEO during the early years of the company. And now, the company is <em>also</em> generating revenue. So it’s going to be interesting to see what he builds next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brian Armstrong, the founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, is coming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt this September 21-23</a>, and given how much there is to discuss, we couldn&#8217;t be more excited to host him.</p>
<p>As some industry observers will know, Armstrong, a native of San Jose, Calif., whose parents were both engineers, nabbed two degrees from Rice University in Texas before joining Airbnb as a software engineer in 2011 as a technical product manager focused on fraud prevention.</p>
<p>The role gave him the opportunity to learn about payment systems &#8212; and payment problems &#8212; across the world. It relatedly fueled a then-burgeoning interest in cryptocoins, which he began to buy and store and, more important, he began to believe would ultimately replace fiat money. In fact, after just 14 months with Airbnb, Armstrong left the company to join Y Combinator and found Coinbase.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He wasn&#8217;t focused on making money, by his telling. Instead, as he told Forbes last year, &#8220;I wanted the world to have a global, open financial system that drove innovation and freedom.” Either way, along the way, Armstrong became very wealthy, as have many Coinbase employees and investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, which built the biggest stake in Coinbase over the years and whose position was valued at a reported $11 billion at the time of Coinbase&#8217;s direct listing this past April.</p>
<p>Still, the success of Coinbase &#8212; which has established itself as <em>the</em> clean, well-lit place to invest in cryptocurrencies &#8212; has also invariably led to greater scrutiny. The company has been widely accused by its customers of focusing on security at the expense of adequate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/coinbase-commits-to-a-better-customer-experience-following-complaints/">customer service</a>. Several of Armstrong&#8217;s managerial decisions, including to clamp down on <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804">political speech</a> inside of Coinbase, has cost the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/brian-armstrongs-new-problem-60-plus/">valued employees</a>, while others have said they were treated unfairly because of their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/coinbase-pay-employees.html">race or gender</a>.</p>
<p>More, following a very long run, enthusiasm over cryptocurrencies has abruptly slowed over the last month or so. While Armstrong has seen enthusiasm for crypto grow and wane before, Coinbase is now a publicly traded company, and as questions bubble up about Bitcoin, Coinbase&#8217;s shares are down, too. (As of this writing, they are trading at around $217, almost half of where they were valued at their peak price in April of about $429.)</p>
<p>Little wonder Armstrong has been laser-focused on not only strengthening what Coinbase has already built but setting it up to become an even larger enterprise, including by <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-to-acquire-leading-blockchain-infrastructure-platform-bison-trails-f879654421d6">acquiring a company</a> early this year that positions Coinbase to operate as a kind of AWS, enabling companies that, say, want to connect their wallet app to a blockchain to click a few buttons rather than hire a team of engineers to spin up the necessary nodes.</p>
<p>How else is Armstrong, 38, dealing with the market&#8217;s ups and downs as he builds a completely new financial institution? Where does he want to take Coinbase over the next 12 months? How does he respond to criticisms about some of his very public decisions concerning Coinbase employees? These are among the many things we&#8217;ll talk with him about at this year&#8217;s Disrupt for an appearance that we know attendees won&#8217;t want to miss. We&#8217;re certainly excited to sit down with him.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The cybersecurity unicorn raised its IPO price range today. As a heat check on the larger IPO market, it's a thermometer about to explode. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the second quarter races to a close, we&#8217;re down to the wire for IPOs looking to get out before June ends. One such company is SentinelOne, a cybersecurity startup backed by Insight Venture Partners, Redpoint, Tiger Global Management, Data Collective and Anchorage Capital, among others.</p>
<p>SentinelOne raised an ocean of capital while private, including <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sentinel/company_financials">nearly $500 million across two rounds in 2020</a>. Its debut is therefore a huge liquidity event for a host of investing groups. And today, the cybersecurity unicorn had good news in the form of an upgrade to its IPO price range.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/investors-thirst-for-growth-could-bode-well-for-sentinelones-ipo/">The Exchange wrote that</a> the company&#8217;s IPO would be a &#8220;good heat check for the IPO market&#8221; given its rapid growth and pace of losses. How investors valued it would help explain the public market&#8217;s current appetite for loss-making startups. Today&#8217;s news implies healthy appetites.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1995211 size-medium alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>SentinelOne raised its IPO price range this morning from $26 to $29 per share to $31 to $32 per share, a sizable lift to its valuation and IPO raise.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re unpacking the company&#8217;s new valuation range, thinking about SentinelOne&#8217;s growth and revenue results compared to similar public companies, and working to understand if the company is inexpensive, neutrally priced or expensive compared to current comps. Sound fun? It will be!</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s SentinelOne worth?</h2>
<p>Recall that when SentinelOne last raised capital it was valued at $2.7 billion on a pre-money basis. The company was therefore worth just under $3 billion after the $267 million round. The unicorn is going to yeet that figure into space in its IPO, barring something catastrophic.</p>
<p>Its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210628005452/en/SentinelOne-Announces-Increase-in-IPO-Price-Range">new IPO price range</a> of $31 to $32 per share values the company on a much richer basis. With an anticipated simple share count of 253,530,006 after its IPO, inclusive of a private placement, the company would be worth $7.86 billion to $8.11 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shopify changed the e-commerce landscape by making it easier for merchants to set up their websites both quickly and affordably. A startup called <a href="https://tapcart.com/">Tapcart</a> is now doing the same for mobile commerce.</p>
<p>The company, which has referred to itself as the &#8220;Shopify for mobile apps,&#8221; today powers the shopping apps for top <a href="https://tapcart.com/resources/studies">brands</a>, including Fashion Nova, Pier One Imports, The Hundreds, Patta, Culture Kings, and thousands more. Following a year of 3x revenue growth, in part driven by the pandemic, Tapcart is today announcing the close of a $50 million round of Series B funding, led by Left Lane Capital. Having clearly taken notice of Tapcart&#8217;s traction with its own merchant base, Shopify is among the round&#8217;s participants.</p>
<p>Other investors in the round include SignalFire, Greycroft, Act One Ventures and Amplify LA.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tapcart&#8217;s co-founders, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mobass/">Sina Mobasser</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericnetsch/">Eric Netsch</a>, have worked in the mobile app industry for years. Mobasser&#8217;s previous company, TestMax, offered one of the first test prep courses on iOS, while Netsch had more recently worked on the agency side to create mobile and digital experiences for brands. Together, the two realized the potential in helping online merchants bring their businesses to mobile, as easily as they were able to go online with Shopify.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170857" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170857" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170857" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="402" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg 5341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=768,454 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=1536,908 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=2048,1210 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170857" class="wp-caption-text">Tapcart’s founders Sina Mobasser and Eric Netsch at their Santa Monica HQ. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tapcart</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you can launch an app on our platform in a matter of weeks, where historically it would take up to a year if you wanted to custom build an app,&#8221; explains Mobasser. &#8220;And you can do it for a low monthly fee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tapcart&#8217;s platform itself offers a simple drag-and-drop builder that allows anyone to create a mobile app for their existing Shopify store using tools to design their layout, customize the product detail pages, integrate checkout options, include product reviews, and even optionally add other branded content, like blogs, lookbooks, videos (including live video) and more. Everything is synced directly from Shopify to the app in real-time, so the merchant&#8217;s inventory, products and collections are all kept up-to-date. That&#8217;s a big differentiator from some rivals, which require duplicate sets of data and data transformation.</p>
<p>Tapcart, meanwhile, leverages all of Shopify&#8217;s APIs and SDKs to create a native application that works with Shopify&#8217;s existing data structures.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170864" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170864" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170864" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="664" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=150,146 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=300,293 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=768,750 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=680,664 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=50,50 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170864" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tapcart</p></div></p>
<p>This tight integration with Shopify helps Tapcart because it doesn&#8217;t have to focus on the e-commerce infrastructure, as the way things are structured around inventory and collections are roughly 90% the same across brands. Instead, Tapcart focuses on the 10% that makes brands stand out from one another, which includes things like branding, content and design. Its CMS allows merchants to create exclusive content, change the colors and fonts, add videos and more to make the app look and feel fully customized.</p>
<p>Beyond the mobile app creation aspect to its business, Tapcart also helps merchants automate their marketing. Through the Tapcart platform, merchants can communicate with their customers in real-time using push notifications that can alert them to new sales, to encourage them to return to abandoned carts, or any other promotions. The marketing campaigns can be automated, as well, which helps merchants schedule their upcoming launches and product drops ahead of time. The company claims these push notifications deliver click-through rates that are 72% higher than a traditional email or SMS text because of their interactivity and branding.</p>

<p>The platform has quickly found traction with SMB to mid-market enterprise customers who have reached the stage of their business where it makes sense for them to double down on customer retention and conversion and optimize their mobile workflow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our sweet spot is when you have maybe a couple hundred customers in your database,&#8221; notes Netsch. &#8220;That&#8217;s a perfect time to now focus less on the paid acquisition portion of your business and more on how to retain and engage those existing customers, [so they&#8217;ll] shop more and have a better experience,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>During the past 12 months, over $1.2 billion in merchant sales have flowed through Tapcart&#8217;s platform. And in 2020, Tapcart&#8217;s recurring revenue increased by 3x, as mobile apps grew even faster during the pandemic, which had increased consumer mobile screen time by 20% year-over-year from 2019. Mobile commerce spending also grew 55% year-over-year, topping $53 billion globally during the holiday shopping season, the company says. Tapcart&#8217;s own merchants saw mobile app orders at a rate of more than once-per-second during this time, and it believes these trends will continue even as the pandemic comes to an end.</p>
<p>Today, Tapcart generates revenue by charging a flat SaaS (software-as-a-service) fee, which differentiates it from a number of competitors who charge a percent of the merchant&#8217;s total sales.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170858" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170858" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170858" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2_AppClips_SMS.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170858" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tapcart</p></div></p>
<p>With the additional funding, Tapcart plans to focus on its goal of becoming a vertically integrated mobile commerce suite of tools, which more recently includes support for iOS App Clips. It will also soon release an upgraded version of its insights analytics platform and will offer scripts that merchants can install on their mobile websites to compare what works on the site versus what works in the app.</p>
<p>Later this year, Tapcart plans to launch a full marketing automation product that will allow brands to automate and personalize their notifications even further. And it plans to invest in market expansions to make its product better designed for mobile, global commerce.</p>
<p>The funding will allow Santa Monica-based Tapcart to hire another 200 people over the next 24 months, up from the 70 it has currently. These will include new additions across time zones and even in markets like Australia and Europe as it moves toward global expansion.</p>
<p>Shopify&#8217;s investment will open up a number of new opportunities as well, including on product, engineering, business strategy and partnerships. It will also help to get Tapcart in front of Shopify&#8217;s 1.7 million global merchants.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s still quite a lot of merchants that need better mobile experiences, but have yet to really double down on the mobile effort and get something like a native app,&#8221; notes Netsch. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of different ways and methods that merchants are experimenting with mobile growth, and we&#8217;re trying to offer all of the best parts of that in a single platform. So there&#8217;s tons of expansion for Tapcart to do just that with the existing target addressable market,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe brands must be where their customers are, and today that means being on their phones,&#8221; said Satish Kanwar, VP of product acceleration at Shopify, in a statement. &#8220;Tapcart helps merchants create mobile-first shopping experiences that customers love, reinforcing Shopify&#8217;s mission to make commerce better for everyone. We look forward to seeing Tapcart expand its success on Shopify with the more than 1.7 million merchants on our platform today.&#8221;</p>
