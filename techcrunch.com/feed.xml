										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.blockpartyapp.com/">Block Party</a>, an anti-harassment startup that aims to help folks feel safer on social media founded by Tracy Chou, launched today. Currently only available for Twitter, Block Party helps people filter out the content they don&#8217;t want to see and into what Block Party calls the Lockout Folder. That&#8217;s where all of the filtered-out content lives in the event you want to review it later.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think it&#8217;s important to still acknowledge that these people exist,&#8221; Chou told me.</p>
<p>If you pretend like it doesn&#8217;t exist, you might miss out on useful information or genuine connections.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There’s a lot of good stuff that would get lost there,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There is a reason we use public platforms like Twitter.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>On the more negative side, she said, you still may need to check periodically to see if there&#8217;s someone threatening your physical safety.</p>
<p>Helpers play a big part of the Block Party experience. You can grant a trusted helper access to your Lockout Folder to let you know if there&#8217;s anything useful in there, or to simply block the trolls.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot easier for someone else to help you process it and flag something that is a concern,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s nice to be able to share that burden. The current design of most of these platforms is to put the burden of dealing with it solely on the person who’s being abused.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The Lockout Folder also serves as a record-keeping tool in the event you need to present evidence of your harassment to a company, a lawyer or someone else.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2097150" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097150" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2097150" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="294" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png 985w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=768,332 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=680,294 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2097150" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot/Block Party</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really about trying to make peoples lives easier,&#8221; Chou said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just so painful to have to see the abuse again when you&#8217;re filing the report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Block Party emerged from Chou&#8217;s own experiences working at platform companies like Facebook and Quora, as well as her experience as an outspoken advocate for diversity and inclusion in tech. At Quora, the block button was one of the first things she built after being harassed on the platform, Chou told me.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s that perspective of having been on the inside and seeing how product and engineering teams work,&#8221; Chou said. &#8220;But also being a DEI activist and seeing how lack of representation on teams has impacted product decisions for the worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Block Party is only available for Twitter users, the goal is to add other platforms and help folks address harassers that target them across multiple platforms. Block Party is currently free but plans to introduce subscription tiers. Still, Chou said she envisions the free version always existing.</p>
<p>To date, Block Party has raised a little less than $1.5 million in funding. Its lead pre-seed round was led by Charles Hudson of Precursor Ventures. Other investors include Alexia Bonatsos, Ellen Pao, Alex Stamos and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the day a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, a worried GitHub employee warned his co-workers in the D.C. area to be safe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making a comment in Slack saying, “stay safe homies, Nazis are about,” a fellow employee took offense, saying that type of rhetoric wasn’t good for work, the former employee told me. Two days later, he was fired, with a human relations representative citing a “pattern of behavior that is not conducive to company policy” as the rationale for his termination, he told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with TechCrunch, the now-former employee said he was genuinely concerned about his co-workers in the area, in addition to his Jewish family members. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch agreed to keep the identity of the terminated employee confidential due to fears of his and his family’s safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-backlash-jewish-employee-termination-2021-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Insider first reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, his firing led to employees circulating an internal letter asking GitHub to denounce white supremacy and Nazis. The employees also wanted answers about his firing. That led to GitHub CEO Nat Friedman telling employees the company would investigate the termination of the employee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the terminated employee says he is currently seeking counsel to ensure his family is protected, as well as figure out if he can receive damages or some other form of reconciliation. The fired employee said GitHub has reached out to him for help in the internal investigation, but is waiting to engage with the company until he has legal representation in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, he said he is not optimistic about the investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am 90% sure it’s not genuine,” the terminated employee said of Friedman’s response. “This type of stuff had been said before. It happened with the ICE stuff where the company said let’s have discussions but then if you mention ICE, you get fired. I used to believe in this company, but now I don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to what some employees are asking, the terminated employee sees this as an opportunity for GitHub to take a stance on white supremacy.</span></p>
<p>He said, “I feel like this could be an opportunity for GitHub to really do a purge and say ‘Do we want white supremacists at this company and how do we get Black leaders into executive management?’</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter is something he said he’s been asking for since he joined GitHUb. But as he kept talking about the lack of diversity at the leadership level, he said he found his job at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I kept talking about it, I got threatened being fired in October,” he said. “Both my managers had to come completely to my defense and beg them not to fire me when I pointed out how the sales team maybe has just two people of color.”</span></p>
<p>In a blanket statement to TechCrunch about the contents of this article, a GitHub spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We take all complaints of this nature very seriously. We are actively investigating the situation.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon his termination, the former employee said the company gave him two paychecks and sent him on his way. He said he would be open to some form of reconciliation, whether in the form of damages, healthcare coverage or something else. While he’s not looking for his job back, he says he would like to see more worker power at GitHub. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I had a magic wand, I’d love for the employees at GitHub to be able to have a union and represent people from marginalized communities,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The United States’ GPS system, which is operated by the Defense Department, offers every one of us critical infrastructure around what is known as positioning, navigation and timing (PNT). Positioning and navigation is obvious every time we open up a maps app, but timing is also a critical function of GPS — offering our smartphones and devices precision timing to ensure that compute processes are accurately synced.</p>
<p>As more of the economy relies on these systems, they have increasingly <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/11/15/131940/ghost-ships-crop-circles-and-soft-gold-a-gps-mystery-in-shanghai/">become a target of hackers through GPS spoofing</a>. The government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/trump-administration-aims-to-protect-gps-with-new-exec-order/">wants to create additional redundancy and resiliency in the sector</a>, and has explored using commercial alternatives to augment or backup parts of the GPS system.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TBo0kr4pSJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/trump-administration-aims-to-protect-gps-with-new-exec-order/">Trump administration aims to protect GPS with new exec order</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Trump administration aims to protect GPS with new exec order&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/trump-administration-aims-to-protect-gps-with-new-exec-order/embed/#?secret=TBo0kr4pSJ" data-secret="TBo0kr4pSJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Department of Transportation, under a Congressional mandate added to the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2018, ran a comprehensive evaluation of commercial alternatives to government-owned and operated GPS that could serve as a backup to our existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>Among the 11 companies considered in the study were a number of prominent positioning startups, including Satelles, which raised a $26 million round of capital in 2019; NextNav, which has raised a total of nearly $300 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/nextnav-raises-120m-to-deploy-its-indoor-positioning-tech-to-find-people-in-skyscrapers/">including $120 million from Fortress a year ago</a>; and Hellen Systems, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hellen-systems/company_financials">which according to Crunchbase</a> raised a small seed round last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2021-01/NTRSA%20Report%20to%20Congress_Final_January%202021.pdf">You can read the full report from the DOT</a>, which runs to 457 pages long and covers all 14 measures the researchers explored in evaluating these different PNT platforms.</p>
<p>The summary though is that there are a number of companies that offer decent backup capabilities for GPS, although the performance and cost vary widely. NextNav came out furthest ahead according to the researchers, who stated that “All [Technology Readiness Level]-qualified vendors demonstrated at least some PNT performance of value, but only one vendor, NextNav, demonstrated in all applicable use case scenarios.”</p>
<p>Beyond that, the DOT researchers said that “… none of the systems can universally backup the positioning and navigation capabilities provided by GPS and its augmentations.” Given the range of needs that GPS fulfills, they recommended that “a diverse universe of positioning and navigation technologies” be used to add resiliency in this infrastructure.</p>
<p>Finally, costs remain quite complicated to determine. Given the way that different positioning systems operate, the fixed and variable costs for each system are highly dependent on desired coverage area and necessary transmitter density. The researchers weren’t able to devise a clear opinion on the cost effectiveness of different systems, although they do offer some initial data that can provide early insight.</p>
<p>Given the importance of GPS and the desire for companies and the government to have reliable alternatives, VCs have dumped money on the PNT sector in recent years. Now, we have some hard data on which vendors are potentially picking up steam in terms of functionality and utility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The dating and networking service <a href="https://bumble.com/">Bumble</a> has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1830043/000119312521009745/d20761ds1.htm">filed</a> to go public.</p>
<p>The company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/13/whitney-wolfe-herd-bumbles-founder-doesnt-care-what-shes-supposed-to-do/">launched by a former co-founder of the IAC-owned Tinder</a>, plans to list its share on the Nasdaq stock exchange, using the ticker symbol &#8220;BMBL.&#8221; Bumble&#8217;s planned IPO was first reported<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/bumble-reportedly-filed-confidentially-for-an-ipo/"> in December</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd was on the founding team at Tinder before starting Bumble. She <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/08/tinder-and-iac-settle-sexual-harassment-suit-with-early-employee-whitney-wolfe/">filed suit against Tinder</a> for sexual harassment and discrimination, which was at least somewhat inspirational in her quest to build a dating app that put women in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>In 2019, Wolfe Herd took the helm of MagicLab, renamed to Bumble Group, in a $3 billion deal with Blackstone, replacing Badoo founder and CEO Andrey Andreev following a harassment scandal at the firm.</p>
<p>The company is targeting the public markets at a particularly heady time for new offerings, with <a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; border-bottom-color: #00a562;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/a-theory-about-the-current-ipo-market/">investors embracing </a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">venture-backed IPOs throughout late 2020 and the start of 2021</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. Previously privately held companies like Airbnb, Affirm, and others have seen their fortunes soar on the back of prices that public investors are willing to pay, perhaps inducing more IPO filings than the market might have otherwise seen.</span></p>
<p>You can read its IPO filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1830043/000119312521009745/d20761ds1.htm">here</a>. TechCrunch will have its usual tear-down of the document later today, but we have pulled some top-line numbers for you to kick off your own research.</p>
<p>But before we do, the company&#8217;s board makeup, namely that it is over 70% women is <a href="https://twitter.com/lesliepicker/status/1350119329606606849?s=21">already drawing plaudits</a>. Now, into its numbers.</p>
<h2>Inside Bumble&#8217;s IPO filing</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider Bumble from three perspectives: Usage, financial results, and ownership.</p>
<p>On the usage front, Bumble is popular, as you would imagine a dating would have to be to reach the scale required to go public. The company claims 42 million monthly active users (MAUs) as of Q3 2020 &#8212; many companies will try to get public on the strength of their third-quarter results from 2020, as it takes time to close Q4 and the full calendar year.</p>
<p>Those 42 million MAUs translated into 2.4 million total paying users through the first nine months of 2020; the percent, then, of paying users to MAUs is not 2.4 million divided by 42, but a smaller fraction.</p>
<p>Turning to the numbers, recall that Bumble sold a majority of itself a few years back. We bring that up as Bumble&#8217;s financial results are complicated thanks to its ownership structure.</p>
<p>After the IPO, Bumble Inc. will &#8220;be a holding company, and its sole material asset will be a controlling equity interest in Bumble Holdings,&#8221; per the S-1 filing. So, how is Bumble Holdings doing?</p>
<p>Medium? Doing the sums ourselves as the company&#8217;s S- 1 is fraught with accounting nuances, in the first nine months of 2019, Bumble managed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenues of $362.6 million</li>
<li>Net income of $68.6 million</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, combining two columns to provide a similar set of results for the same period of 2020, Bumble recorded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenues of $416.6 million</li>
<li>Net income of -$116.7 million</li>
</ul>
<p>For those following along, we&#8217;re using the &#8220;Net (loss) earnings&#8221; line, for profitability, and not the &#8220;Net (loss) earnings attributable to owners / shareholders&#8221; as that would require even more explanation and we&#8217;re keeping it simple in this first look.</p>
<p>While Bumble saw modest growth in 2020 through Q3 and a sharp swing to losses on a GAAP basis, the company&#8217;s adjusted profitability grew over the same time period. The company&#8217;s adjusted EBITDA, a very non-GAAP metric, expanded from $80.0 million in the first three quarters of 2019 to $108.3 million in the same period of 2020.</p>
<p>While we are generally willing to allow quickly-growing companies some leniency when it comes to adjusted metrics, the gap between Bumble&#8217;s GAAP losses and its EBITDA results is a stress-test of our compassion. Bumble also swung from free cash flow positivity during the first nine months of 2019 to the first quarters of 2020.</p>
<p>If you extrapolate Bumble&#8217;s Q1, Q2, and Q3 revenue to a full-year number, the company could manage $555.5 million in 2020 revenues. Even at a modest software-ish multiple, the company would be worth more than the $3 billion figure that we discussed before.</p>
<p>However, its sharp unprofitability in 2020 could damper its eventual valuation. More as we dig more deeply into the filing.</p>
<p>Finally, on the ownership question the company&#8217;s filing is surprisingly denuded of data. Its principal shareholder section looks like this:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German startup <a href="https://www.getmoss.com/en">Moss</a> has raised a $25.5 million (€21 million) funding round led by Valar Ventures. Existing investors Cherry Ventures and Global Founders Capital are also participating. Moss provides credit cards and a spending platform to small and medium businesses in Germany.</p>
<p>The company has developed its own risk engine to come up with a credit card limit for your company. Like <a href="https://www.brex.com">Brex</a> in the U.S., Moss promises higher credit card limits compared to credit cards offered by traditional financial institutions.</p>
<p>Again, Moss doesn’t offer prepaid or debit cards — it focuses on credit cards. You can spend within your limit and pay at the end of the month. You don’t need to top up your Moss account to start using it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Credit cards work on the Mastercard network. Admins can issue a physical card for each employee or each team. You can also issue virtual cards for online payments and subscriptions. You can set different limits for each card.</p>
<p>From the administration panel, you can track expenses, search for specific expenses and see your ongoing subscriptions — it helps you identify duplicates. Users can attach receipts and information to each transaction for accounting purposes.</p>
<p>The company has issued 1,000 credit cards and has processes 10,000 transactions so far. Right now, its clients include startups and tech companies. But Moss expects to expand to other industries soon thanks to today’s funding round.</p>
<p>Moss competes with <a href="https://www.spendesk.com/en-eu/">Spendesk</a>, <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business/">Revolut Business</a> and others. These corporate card products focus on debit cards. Let’s see if offering credit cards turns out to be an important differentiating feature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Medical Agency (EMA) has warned that information on COVID-19-related medicines and vaccines, which was stolen in a cyberattack last December and leaked online <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/cyberattack-ema-update-4">earlier this week</a>, includes correspondence that&#8217;s been manipulated prior to publication &#8220;in a way which could undermine trust in vaccines&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear exactly how the information &#8212; which includes schematics of drug structures and correspondence relating to evaluation processes for COVID-19 vaccines &#8212; has been doctored.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the agency with questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One security researcher, Lukasz Olejnik, who has raised concerns about the leak <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1350091322988888065">via Twitter</a>, suggested the doctored data will be &#8220;perfect for sowing distrust&#8221; because the biotechnical language involved in the leaked correspondence will not be widely accessible.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now I understand why this data is perfect for sowing distrust. (disinformation). The documents are extremely hermetic, using niche biotech-technical language. No layperson is able to understand this. Perfect for conspiracy thinking, because it does have the numbers-percents. <a href="https://t.co/e0qfYoV3R0">https://t.co/e0qfYoV3R0</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lukasz Olejnik (@lukOlejnik) <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1350091322988888065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Equally, it also seems possible that the high bar of expertise required to properly parse the data could limit how much damage the manipulated versions can do by limiting their viral appeal.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s notable the EMA has raised concerns over the risk to trust in coronavirus vaccines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two EU <a id="glossary-term-43236" class="ecl-link glossary-term" title="The approval to market a medicine in one, several or all European Union Member States." href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing authorisations</a> for COVID-19 vaccines have been granted at the end of December/beginning of January following an independent scientific assessment,&#8221; the EMA writes in the <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/cyberattack-ema-update-5">latest update</a> on the hack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amid the high infection rate in the EU, there is an urgent public health need to make vaccines available to EU citizens as soon as possible. Despite this urgency, there has always been consensus across the EU not to compromise the high-quality standards and to base any recommendation on the strength of the scientific evidence on a vaccine’s safety, quality and <a id="glossary-term-43193" class="ecl-link glossary-term" title="The measurement of a medicine's desired effect under ideal conditions, such as in a clinical trial." href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/glossary/efficacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">efficacy</a>, and nothing else.</p>
<p>&#8220;EMA is in constant dialogue with the EC, and other regulators across the network and internationally. Authorisations are granted when the evidence shows convincingly that the benefits of vaccination are greater than any risks of the vaccine. Full details of the scientific assessments are publicly available in the European Public Assessment Reports on EMA’s website,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, a criminal investigation into the cyberattack remains ongoing.</p>
<p>The attack has not been attributed to a specific hacking group or state actor and there&#8217;s no confirmation of who is responsible for trying to sew coronavirus-related disinformation by seeding doctored medical documents online.</p>
<p>However, last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/microsoft-russia-north-korea-hackers-coronavirus-vaccine/">November</a> Microsoft warned that hackers backed by Russia and North Korea had targeted pharmaceutical companies involved in the COVID-19 vaccine development efforts.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/tech-giants-must-open-up-about-the-coronavirus-infodemic-say-eu-lawmakers/">June</a>, the European Commission also raised concerns about the risks of coronavirus vaccine disinformation spreading in the coming months &#8212; simultaneously name-checking China and Russia as foreign entities it said it had confirmed as being behind state-backed disinformation campaigns targeting the region.</p>
<p>So suspicion seems likely to fall on the usual &#8220;hostile suspect&#8221; states.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve seen similar &#8220;doctored leak&#8221; tactics attributed to Russia before &#8212; typically related to attempts to interfere with elections by smearing candidates for high political office.</p>
<p>Researchers have <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/05/26/russian-dnc-hackers-planted-leaks-with-fake-data/">suggested</a> that the hackers responsible for the 2015-16 breaches of the Democratic National Committee&#8217;s network snuck doctored data into the leaked emails &#8212; an attack that was subsequently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/26/russia-dnc-hack/">attributed to Russia</a>.</p>
<p>While, more recently, there was the infamous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/suspect-provenance-of-hunter-biden-data-cache-prompts-skepticism-and-social-media-bans/">&#8220;Hunter Biden&#8221; laptop incident</a> &#8212; which supporters of president Trump sought to leverage against his challenger for the White House (now president-elect) in last year&#8217;s presidential race.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="79W6DMFXJn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/suspect-provenance-of-hunter-biden-data-cache-prompts-skepticism-and-social-media-bans/">Suspect provenance of Hunter Biden data cache prompts skepticism and social media bans</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In that case, any disinformation punch <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/10/31/the-story-of-hunter-biden-and-the-diminishing-returns-to-disinformation">fizzled out</a> amid a raft of dubious claims around the finding and timing of the claimed data cache (along with much greater general awareness about the risk of digital fake smear tactics in political campaigns in the wake of revelations about the scale of Russia&#8217;s social media influence disops in the 2016 U.S. presidential election).</p>
<p>In an earlier incident, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/05/french-presidential-frontrunner-macrons-emails-leaked-after-alleged-hack/">2017</a>, emails linked to the French president Emmanuel Macron&#8217;s election campaign also leaked online shortly before the vote &#8212; coinciding with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-39845105">a document dump on an internet forum</a> that suggested the presidential frontrunner had a secret bank account in the Cayman Islands. A claim Macron&#8217;s political movement said was fake.</p>
<p>While in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/07/reddit-links-uk-us-trade-talk-leak-to-russian-influence-campaign/">2019</a> Reddit also linked to a suspected Russian political influence operation account activity involving the leak and amplification of sensitive U.K.-U.S. trade talks on its platform during the U.K. election campaign.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether that leaked trade dossier had been doctored or not (it was heavily redacted). And it certainly did not deliver a landslide election win to Jeremy Corbyn&#8217;s Labour Party &#8212; which used the leaked data in its campaign. But a similar, earlier operation which was also attributed to Russia had involved the leak of fake documents on multiple online platforms. (That disinformation operation was identified and taken down by Facebook in <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/05/more-cib-from-russia/">May 2019</a>.)</p>
<p>The emergence of leaks of doctored medical data linked to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments looks like a troubling evolution of hostile cyber disops which seek to weaponize false data to generate unhelpful outcomes for others &#8212; as there&#8217;s a direct risk to public health if trust in vaccine programs are undermined.</p>
<p>There have been state-level hacks targeting medical data before too &#8212; albeit without the pandemic-related backdrop of an ongoing public health emergency.</p>
<p>Back in 2016, for example, the <a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2016-09/wada-statement-regarding-additional-data-leak-via-russian-cyber-hacker-fancy-bear">World Anti-Doping Agency</a> confirmed that confidential medical data related to the Olympic drug tests of a number of athletes had been leaked by the Russia-linked cyber hacking group, &#8216;Fancy Bear&#8221;. In that case there were no reports of the data being doctored.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another Uber spinout is in the works.</p>
<p>Postmates X, the robotics division of the on-demand delivery startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/">Uber acquired last year for $2.65 billion</a>, is seeking investors in its bid to become a separate company, according to several people familiar with the plans.</p>
<p>The startup is being referred to as Serve Robotics, a nod to the yellow and black-emblazoned autonomous sidewalk delivery bot that was developed and piloted by Postmates X. The Serve robot, which recently partnered with Pink Dot Stores for deliveries in West Hollywood, will likely be the centerpiece of the new startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DepAnhOxQu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/">Uber officially completes Postmates acquisition</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber officially completes Postmates acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/embed/#?secret=DepAnhOxQu" data-secret="DepAnhOxQu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Uber declined to comment.</p>
<p>Under the deal, which is being shopped to investors, the company would be run by Ali Kashani, who heads up Postmates X and leads the Serve program. Anthony Armenta would lead the startup&#8217;s software efforts and Aaron Leiba would be in charge of hardware &#8212; keeping the same positions they hold at Postmates X.</p>
<p>Uber would retain an ownership stake in Serve Robotics and maintain a commercial agreement with the startup. Serve would get the IP and assets in exchange. Uber is in discussions to retain about a 25% stake in the new startup, according to one source familiar with the deal.</p>
<p>There is not a legal entity — as of yet — named Serve Robotics. However, a website domain serverobotics.com was registered January 6.</p>
<h2>Uber&#8217;s path to profits</h2>
<p>The spinoff would be in line with Uber&#8217;s streamlined business strategy that began to take shape after its public market debut in May 2019 and accelerated last year as the COVID-19 pandemic put pressure on the ride-hailing company. Two years ago, Uber had enterprises across the transportation landscape, from ride-hailing and micromobility to logistics, public transit, food delivery and futuristic bets like autonomous vehicles and air taxis. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has dismantled the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach as he pushes the company toward profitability.</p>
<p>In 2020, Uber offloaded shared scooter and bike unit Jump in a complex deal with Lime, sold a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/uber-sells-500m-stake-in-its-freight-business-as-the-ride-hailing-giant-works-to-conserve-cash/">stake worth $500 million</a> in its logistics spinoff Uber Freight and rid itself of its autonomous vehicle unit Uber ATG and its air taxi play Uber Elevate.</p>
<p>Aurora <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">acquired Uber ATG</a> in a deal that had a similar structure to the Jump-Lime transaction. Aurora didn&#8217;t pay cash for Uber ATG. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora, which gave it a 26% stake in the combined company.</p>
<p>In a similarly crafted deal, Uber Elevate was sold to Joby Aviation in December.</p>

<p>Delivery remained the one area in which Uber has invested. The company, seeing an opportunity as demand skyrocketed for its Uber Eats delivery service, started looking for an acquisition to strengthen its position. Uber tried and failed to buy Grubhub, losing out to European heavyweight Just Eat Takeaway.</p>
<p>Uber landed on Postmates and in July 2020 agreed to buy the delivery startup in an all-stock deal valued at $2.65 billion. The deal closed in December.</p>
<h2>Serve, the friendly robot</h2>
<p>Postmates&#8217; exploration into sidewalk delivery bots began in earnest in 2017 after the company quietly acquired Kashani&#8217;s startup Lox Inc. As head of Postmates X, the company&#8217;s R&amp;D arm, Kashani set out to answer the question: why move two-pound burritos with two-ton cars?</p>
<p>Postmates revealed its first Serve autonomous delivery bot in December 2018. A second generation &#8212; with an identical design but different lidar sensors and few other upgrades &#8212; emerged in summer 2019 ahead of its planned commercial launch in Los Angeles.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1866098 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg" alt="merchant loading serve" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /></a></p>
<p>Instead of working with a partner, Postmates used its own delivery data to form the foundation of how it would design and deploy a sidewalk bot, according to comments Kashani made during a TC Sessions: Mobility 2020 event in October.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at the data and see that over half of deliveries are within a short distance it becomes a no brainer &#8212; these robots can actually complete them,&#8221; Kashani said at the time, in reference to the application of autonomous delivery bots for delivery.</p>
<p>The Postmates X used historical delivery data from the company to develop a simulation, which was then used in the design of the Serve bot. It helped the team determine what battery life would be needed and the size of the cargo hold, among other features.</p>
<p>The bot only represented a sliver of Postmates&#8217; delivery business. However, the company has seen an increased interest in the bot in Los Angeles and San Francisco &#8212; the two cities where it commercially operates &#8212; as COVID-19 fueled demand for contactless delivery.</p>
<p>Kashani noted back in October that the bots had completed thousands of deliveries in Los Angeles and was preparing to expand into the city&#8217;s West Hollywood enclave. That expansion launched late last year with a twist. The Serve robots were changed to a bright pink to match the signature color of the Pink Dot stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I suspect it will be a while before I get excited over wireless earbuds. It’s not for a lack of trying on the part of manufacturers. In fact, quite the contrary. The category actually matured quite quickly, compared to various other verticals in the consumer electronics space. The truth is, most major hardware makers have gotten pretty decent at making a pair of wireless buds &#8212; many for pretty cheap.</p>
<p>Samsung’s been in that category for a while now. I’ve liked the last several models I’ve tried from the company. The sound quality has been good, they’re generally pretty comfortable &#8212; a good experience, all around. In fact, one of the issues I’ve raised the last couple of times is the fact that Samsung didn’t offer its own equivalent to products like the AirPods Pro and Sony WF-1000XM3 (though that latter reference is starting to become a bit dated).</p>
<p>It’s a hole in the lineup now filled by the Galaxy Buds Pro, which slot in the high end, above the Galaxy Buds Live and Galaxy Buds+. The naming conventions could be streamlined a bit, but it’s a small complaint in the grand scheme. At $199, the Pros are $30 more than the Live and $50 more than the Pluses. More importantly, it puts them at $50 less than the AirPods Pro – their clearest analogue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>And like Apple’s Pro buds, the Galaxy Buds are very specifically designed to operate with Samsung’s devices. You can still pair them with other Android handsets, but you’re going to lose key parts of the software integration. This honestly seems to be the way things are headed, with practically every smartphone company also manufacturing their own headphones. And certainly Samsung’s got enough market share that such a play makes sense.</p>
<p>If you do want to use them on another Android device, you can pair them by downloading the Galaxy Wearables app. You can pair them manually without the app, but you&#8217;ll lose a bunch more features in the process. Like past Galaxy Buds models, there’s no physical button on the case for pairing.</p>
<p>After several generations of devices, Samsung’s certainly got the foundation in place. And its purchase of Harman/AKG in 2017 has clearly played a key role in its ability to create some quality audio accessories. All of that comes into play here. Samsung’s made some solid choices on the design front. The charging case is remarkably compact. I was actually a bit surprised when I opened the package. It’s not nearly as long as the AirPods case, though it is a bit thicker. In any case, it’s certainly compact enough to carry around, unlike, say the Powerbeats Pro.</p>
<p>The battery claims are pretty impressive, given the size. The company rates the buds at five hours each and 28 hours with the case. Turn off active noise canceling and Bixby (I&#8217;ll let you guess which of those two I won’t miss) and the numbers bump up to eight and 20 hours, respectively. I will say that I was able to confidently bring the headphones with me on one of my lengthy morning sabbaticals without worrying about packing the case. That’s not something I can say about every wireless earbud.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096816" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096816" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2096816" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2096816" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The headphones sport an 11-millimeter woofer and 6.5-millimeter tweeter. I found the sound to be an overall good mix, whether listening to music or a podcast. If you’re so included, you can also fiddle with the equalizer in the wearable app. It features six presets, rather than sliders, so it’s an imperfect science. But I didn’t really feel the need to mess around in there much.</p>
<p>The active noise canceling is solid, as well (okay, I admit it, Bixby is the one I’d drop in a heartbeat). I wasn’t really aware at how good a job it was doing drowning out street noise until I switched it off &#8212; this can be accomplished with a long press on the side touch panel or through the app. By default the former switches between ANC and transparent mode, skipping the off mode in the middle. Like the equalizer, you an adjust the level of ANC here &#8212; either high or low.</p>
<p>If you’re a Samsung true believer, Seamless Switch can be enabled, allowing you to, say, switch between a tablet and a phone when a call comes in. Other neat Samsung-specific features include the ability to use the buds as a kind of makeshift lavalier mic while recording video on the Galaxy S21. The SmartThings app can also be used to find misplaced buds. All in all, Samsung is clearly building up its ecosystem here.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096821" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096821" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2096821" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2096821" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The design of the buds themselves has been streamlined since the extremely bean-like Buds Live. The company says they were designed to minimize contact with the ear, to help relieve pressure. It’s a shame that everyone isn’t able to try every earbud on before buying &#8212; how they fit in your own ears is obviously an extremely personal thing.</p>
<p>I found, however, that one of my ears tends to ache when wearing them for a prolonged period &#8212; not an issue I’ve had with either the AirPods Pro or Pixel Buds (the Powerbeats Pro are also great in this respect). I found myself fiddling with them semi-regularly and triggering the touch mechanism in the process (this can be turned off by default in the app).</p>
<p>Most of my issues with the Buds Pro are pretty minor. They’re a worthy update to the line and a great pair of headphones if you’re a Samsung user.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’ve been following the gaming space &#8212; or just the state of the world, generally &#8212; over the past 12 months, this shouldn’t come as a major surprise. Spending saw big increases pretty much across the board in 2020 as a homebound populace sought comfort and distraction in gaming. This comes in stark contrast to much of the rest of the consumer electronics space, in which economic uncertainty curtailed purchasing on non-essentials.</p>
<p>According to the latest figures from NPD, spending on gaming hardware, software and accessories was up 25% in December and 27% for the full year. Hardware specifically increased 38% year-over-year for December to $1.35 billion, with the arrival of next-gen consoles from Sony and Microsoft.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dec 2020 US NPD THREAD &#8211; December 2020 consumer spending across video game hardware, content and accessories reached a December record $7.7B, 25% higher when compared to a year ago. Full year spending also set a new record, totaling $56.9B, 27% higher than 2019. <a href="https://t.co/JFTL7eOEat">pic.twitter.com/JFTL7eOEat</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>That’s the highest figure since the $1.37 billion hit in December 2013, the year the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 arrived. In spite of this year&#8217;s new arrivals (which were hampered by limited availability), Nintendo’s Switch once again dominated sales for the month, with the PS5 grabbing the No. 2 spot. The Switch’s 2020 was the second-highest annual performance for a console, after the Wii in 2008.</p>
<p>The Switch &#8212; which turns three this March &#8212; got off to a slow start, courtesy of its own limited availability. But the arrival of a new Animal Crossing title helped rocket it to the top, as isolated consumers looked for new venues for social gaming. That title took the number three spot for the year, finishing behind Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (the former also topping the list for December).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic might have wiped out whole swaths of the economy, but one area that is pulsating with activity is home sales. Driven by remote work and changing commute patterns, home sales skyrocketed last year, with the National Association of Realtors predicting that the total volume when fully calculated will <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/22/existing-home-sales-fell-for-the-first-time-in-5-months-in-november.html">be the highest in 14 years</a>.</p>
<p>That’s been great news for <a href="https://better.com">Better Mortgage</a> (which generally brands itself as <a href="http://Better.com">Better.com</a> for presumably that SEO love). According to the company, it is now underwriting $3 billion per month in mortgage loans, and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bettermortgage/company_financials">that’s led to huge VC interest</a>, including <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=bettter.com+series+d&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">most recently a $200 million round a few weeks ago led by L Catterton</a> at a $4 billion valuation. The company has also hired more than 4,000 employees since the start of the pandemic last March.</p>
<p>One of those new hires is Diane Yu, who is joining the company as CTO to lead engineering and technical strategy. She has extensive experience in advertising networks, having led engineering as CTO at Comcast for its Advanced Advertising Group. She came to Comcast via the cable and media conglomerate’s acquisition of the startup she co-founded called FreeWheel, which designed tools for ad management and optimization. Prior to that, she worked for nearly a decade in engineering leadership at DoubleClick.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Her addition to the C-suite follows the hiring of Kevin Ryan as CFO, who joined in October of last year. Ryan is a former long-time Morgan Stanley investment banker who led the IPO for Rocket Mortgage, one of the many neo-mortgage lenders that have risen up in recent years.</p>
<p>All of these hires are presumably in preparation for an IPO, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-12/better-com-is-said-to-work-with-morgan-stanley-bofa-on-2021-ipo?sref=j5SuHr0s">which has been rumored for the past few months</a> and intensified after Ryan’s hiring. With home sales at a peak, underwriting growing rapidly and a fleshed-out management team, Better hopes its turn to shine in the public markets has finally arrived.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today, let's peek at new and historical growth numbers from Gthmhub, Perdoo, WorkBoard, Ally.io, Koan and WeekDone.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, a number of startups building OKR-focused software raised lots of venture capital, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/why-is-everyone-making-okr-software/">drawing TechCrunch&#8217;s attention</a>.</p>
<p><em>Why is everyone making software that measures objectives and key results?</em> we wondered with tongue in cheek. After all, how big could the OKR software market really be?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a subniche of corporate planning tools! In a world where every company already pays for Google or Microsoft&#8217;s productivity suite, and some big software companies offer similar planning support, how substantial could demand prove for pure-play OKR startups?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Pretty substantial, we&#8217;re finding out. After OKR-focused Gtmhub <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/okr-focused-gtmhub-raises-30m-series-b-after-growing-3x-in-2020/">announced its $30 million Series B the other day</a>, The Exchange reached out to a number of OKR-focused startups we&#8217;ve previously covered and asked about their 2020 growth.</p>

So let&#8217;s peek at new and historical numbers from <a href="https://gtmhub.com/">Gthmhub</a>, <a href="https://www.perdoo.com/">Perdoo</a>, <a href="https://www.workboard.com/">WorkBoard</a>, <a href="https://www.ally.io/">Ally.io</a>, <a href="https://www.koan.co/">Koan</a> and <a href="https://weekdone.com/">WeekDone</a>.</p>
<h2>Growth (and some caveats)</h2>
<p>A startup growing 400% in a year from a $50,000 ARR base is not<em> </em>impressive. It would be much more impressive to grow 200% from $1 million ARR, or 150% from $5 million.</p>
<p>So, <em>percentage</em> growth is only so good, as metrics go. But it&#8217;s also one that private companies are more likely to share than hard numbers, as the market has taught startups that sharing real data is akin to drowning themselves. Alas.</p>
<p>As we view the following, bear in mind that a simply higher percentage growth number does not indicate that a company added more net ARR than another; it could be growing faster from a smaller base. And some companies in the mix did not share ARR growth, but instead disclosed other bits of data. We got what we could.</p>
<h3><strong>Gtmhub:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>400% ARR growth, 2019.</li>
<li>300% ARR growth, 2020.</li>
<li>More: The company has seen strong ACV growth and its reportedly strong gross margins from 2019 held up in 2020, it said.</li>

<h3><strong>Perdoo:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>240% paid customer growth, 2020.</li>
<li>340% user base growth, 2020.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At-home health testing kit startup Everlywell has raised $75 million, following the close of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/everlywell-raises-175-million-to-expand-virtual-care-options-and-scale-its-at-home-health-testing/">$175 million Series D</a> it announced in December. The new funding comes from HealthQuest Capital, and sees the fund&#8217;s founder and managing partner Dr. Garheng Kong join the company&#8217;s board of directors. Everlywell will use proceeds of this financing to provide liquidity to existing investors, so the startup’s $1.3 billion valuation from December still holds.</p>
<p>HealthQuest Capital&#8217;s investment portfolio has a heavy focus on commercialization of diagnostics businesses, and the company&#8217;s parent obviously has a board network of partners including hospitals and healthcare payers, both of which are going to be very strategically useful to Everlywell as it looks to scale its business on the enterprise side.</p>
<p>Austin-based Everlywell develops at-home testing kits for a range of health concerns, including thyroid issues, allergies and food sensitivity. The company also added a COVID-19 home collection test kit in 2020, and that has resulted in a lot of growth &#8212; both from the COVID test itself, and for its other range of products, according to Everlywell CEO and founder Julia Cheek, who I spoke to in December for the Series D raise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Having HealthQuest&#8217;s venture arm on board as a partner could help its direct-to-consumer business and further develop a complementary enterprise operation. The company already works with employers and health plans, but this should definitely help accelerate that aspect of its business as it looks toward more growth in 2021 and beyond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While many venture capitalists might hope to fund the next Amazon or Shopify, <a href="https://crossbeam.vc">Crossbeam</a> is a new firm focused on backing the startups built on top of these platforms. And it recently closed its $25 million first fund.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve written about well-funded startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/">SellerX</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/">Perch</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/">Heroes</a> that acquire and grow Amazon businesses, and Crossbeam General Partner Ali Hamed similarly pointed to Amazon to illustrate the scale of the opportunity. Noting that third-party sales on Amazon <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2021/01/11/amazon-third-party-sellers-are-being-bought-up-rapidly-but-there-are-risks/?sh=4a0d15d84b4e">reached $200 billion in 2019</a>, Hamed said, &#8220;There&#8217;s going to be 100 winners in this space.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that the firm isn&#8217;t just focused on Amazon — he also cited Thumbtack, Spotify and Shopify as &#8220;platform economies&#8221; where Crossbeam could invest, and he elaborated on this point in <a href="https://alibhamed.medium.com/platform-economies-65d6714ca768">a Medium post published last fall</a>:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Rather than own FB shares, we’d rather own Instagram accounts. Rather than owning Amazon stock, we’d rather own a bunch of third-party selling merchants. And rather than owning Google stock, we’d rather own YouTube libraries.</p>
<p>Why? Because all the tailwinds that make those stocks interesting to own are, in part, shared by the commercial actors on their platforms. And yet capital markets largely haven’t flowed into those spaces yet. Many traditional funds are not set up to finance these platform constituents. On top of that, many of the economic ecosystems on these platforms are newly mature, and so there are not pre-existing models to figure out how to value each asset.</p></blockquote>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ClszDICgor"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/18/coventure-funding/">CoVenture Raises $3M To Build Software For Startups</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;CoVenture Raises $3M To Build Software For Startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/18/coventure-funding/embed/#?secret=ClszDICgor" data-secret="ClszDICgor" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Hamed and General Partner Savneet Singh are also partners at CoVenture, a firm that originally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/18/coventure-funding/">took equity in exchange for technical services</a>, but is now more focused on providing debt to startups. He described Crossbeam as a joint venture between CoVenture, Moelis Asset Management and Fenway Summer, with CoVenture offering additional debt funding to Crossbeam&#8217;s equity investments when it makes sense.</p>
<p>When asked about the risk to startups of trying to build businesses on a single platform, Hamed said that in some cases, it may make sense to build an audience on one platform and then expand and diversify — but it will depend on the platform. The key question, he argued, is, &#8220;Does the platform make money for you, on your behalf?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you expand into other platforms, some &#8216;help you earn money&#8217; and some don&#8217;t,&#8221; Hamed added via email. &#8220;YouTube does, because it seeks ad revenue on your behalf, and splits the ad revenue with you. On Instagram, they don&#8217;t (Insta doesn&#8217;t share ad rev with creators except in very rare cases) &#8230; so the &#8216;awesomeness&#8217; of each platform very much depends on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even before closing its first fund, Crossbeam has made six investments, including digital media company <a href="http://wave.tv">Wave.tv</a>, litigation financing company <a href="https://www.litty.ai">Litty</a>, on-demand poof-of-service startup <a href="https://www.proofserve.com">Proof</a> and <a href="https://www.acqu.co">Acquco</a>, which acquires third-party Amazon sellers.</p>

[&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has planned new upgraded MacBook Pros for launch &#8220;later this year&#8221; according to a<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-macbook-pros-with-magsafe-return-in-the-works?sref=gni836kR"> new report from Bloomberg</a>. These new models would come in both 14-inch and 16-inch sizes, with new and improved Apple Silicon processors like those that Apple debuted on the new MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro model late last year. They would also see the return of Apple&#8217;s MagSafe charger, a magnetic dedicated charging port that would replace USB-C for power, and they could potentially do away with the Touch Bar, the small strip of OLED display built in to the keyboard on modern MacBook Pros.</p>
<p>Bloomberg&#8217;s report suggests that these MacBook Pro models will have processors with more cores and better graphics capabilities than the existing M1 chips that power Apple&#8217;s current notebooks with in-house silicon, and that they&#8217;ll also have displays with brighter panels that offer higher contrast. Physically, they&#8217;ll resemble existing notebooks, according to the report&#8217;s sources, but they&#8217;ll see the return of MagSafe, the dedicated magnetic charging interface that Apple used prior to switching power delivery over to USB-C on its laptops.</p>
<p>MagSafe had the advantage of easily disconnecting in case of anyone accidentally tripping across the power cord while plugged in, without yanking the computer with it. It also meant that it kept all data ports free for accessories. Bloomberg says that the revitalized MagSafe for new notebooks will also offer faster charging versus USB-C, in addition to those other benefits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for the Touch Bar, it has been a topic of debate since its introduction. Pro users in particular seem to dislike the interface option, especially because it replaces a row of dedicated physical keys that could be useful in professional workflows. The report claims that Apple has &#8220;tested versions that remove the Touch Bar,&#8221; so it seems less clear that Apple will finally unring that particular bell, but I personally know a lot of people who would be excited if that does come to pass.</p>
<p>Finally, Bloomberg says Apple is also planning a new redesigned MacBook Air. That was updated most recently just a couple of months ago, and the report says it&#8217;ll only follow &#8220;long after&#8221; these new MacBook Pros, so it seems unlikely to arrive in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Most people don&#8217;t even know that a job in tech sales is even a possibility,&#8221; says Shaan Hathiramani, the founder and chief executive of <a href="https://flockjay.com/">Flockjay</a>, a company offering a tech sales training curriculum to the masses.</p>
<p>Hathiramani sees his startup as an on-ramp to the tech industry for legions of workers who have the skillsets to work in tech, but lack the network to see themselves in the business. Just like coding bootcamps have enabled thousands to get jobs as programmers in the tech business, Flockjay can get into the industry talented people who had never considered a job in tech.</p>
<p>The company &#8212; which had previously raised $3 million from investors, including Serena Williams and Will Smith, along with tech industry luminaries like Microsoft chairman John Thompson, Airtable head of sales Liat Bycel, Gmail inventor Paul Buchheit, and former Netflix CPO Tom Willerer &#8212; has just raised new capital to expand its business in a time when accelerated on-ramps to new jobs have never been more important.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A former financier with the multibillion-dollar investment firm Citadel, Hathiramani sees Flockjay, and the business of tech sales, as a way for a number of people to transform their lives.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We provide a premier sales academy,&#8221; Hathiramani said. &#8220;It costs zero dollars if you take the course and don’t get a job and costs 10% of your income for the first year if you do get a job. That nets out to 6 or 7K.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>A few hundred students have gone through the program so far, Hathiramani said, and the goal is to train 1,000 people over the course of 2021. The average income of a student before they go through Flockjay&#8217;s training program is $30,000 to $35,000 typically, Hathiramani said.</p>
<p>Upon graduation, those students can expect to make between $75,000 and $85,000, he said.</p>
<p>Increasing access among those students who have not necessarily been exposed to the tech world is critical for what Hathiramani wants to do with his sales bootcamp.</p>

Image Credit: Flockjay</p></div></p>
<p>The entrepreneur said roughly 40% of students don&#8217;t have a four-year college degree; half of the students identify as female or non-binary, and half of the company&#8217;s students identify as Black or<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/08/17/latinx-not-preferred-term-among-hispanics-survey-says/"> Hispanic</a>. About 80% of the company&#8217;s students find a job within the first six months of graduation.</p>
<p>These are students like Elise Cox, a former Bojangles&#8217; manager and Flockjay graduate, who moved from Georgia to Denver to be a sales tech representative for Gusto. She tripled her salary from $13 an hour in the food service industry to a salaried position with wages and benefits.</p>
<p>“I enjoy being able to generate revenue for the company,” Cox, a 41-year-old grandmother, whose five-year plans include a sales leadership role, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90410678/fockjay-serena-williams-backed-tech-academy-raises-3m">told Fast Company two years ago</a>. “The revenue is the lifeblood of the company and being part of the team gives me sense of fulfillment.”</p>
<p>Partnerships with <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/">Opportunity@Work</a>, <a href="https://www.hiddengeniusproject.org/">Hidden Genius Project</a>, <a href="https://www.peninsulabridge.org/">Peninsula Bridge</a> and TechHire Oakland help to ensure a diverse pool of applicants and a more diverse workforce for the tech industry &#8212; <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/six-years-into-diversity-reports-big-tech-has-made-little-progress.html">where diversity is still a huge problem</a>.</p>
<p>As Hathiramani looks to take his company from training a couple of hundred students to over a thousand, the founder has raised new cash from previous investors, including Lightspeed, Coatue and Y Combinator, and new investors like eVentures, Salesforce Ventures, the Impact America Fund, Cleo Capital and Gabrielle Union.</p>
<p>For the New Jersey-born entrepreneur, Flockjay was a way to give back to a community that he knew intimately. After his family settled in New Jersey after immigrating to the United States, Hathiramani went first to Horace Mann on a scholarship and then attended Harvard before getting his job at Citadel.</p>
<p>Even while he was working at the pinnacle of the financial services world he started nonprofits like the Big Shoulders Fund and taught financial literacy.</p>
<p>After a while, he moved to the Bay Area to begin plotting a way to merge his twin interests in education and financial inclusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;That led to me spending a year helping startups for free and trying to understand their problems with hiring and training&#8221; said Hathiramani. &#8220;It helped me surface this economic waste in plain sight. There were all these people talking to customers and they were spending three months on the job learning the job and they didn&#8217;t want to do the job or they weren&#8217;t very good at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tech salesforces were a point of entry in the system that almost anyone could access, if they could get in through the door, Hathiramani said. Flockjay wants to be the key to opening the door.</p>
<p>So, the company now has $11 million in new funding to bring its sales training bootcamp to a larger audience. Hathiramani also wants to make the bootcamp model more of a community with continuous development after a student completes the program. &#8220;I view education as a membership and not a transaction,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We focus on continuous learning and continuous up-skilling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of that is the flywheel of building up networks in a manner similar to Y Combinator, the accelerator program from which Flockjay graduated in 2019.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We went through YC to learn&#8230; how they manufacture the privilege in the world that they have afforded,&#8221; said Hathiramani. &#8220;How do you take some of that and provide it to someone who is starting their careers in tech. You get better at your job the more connections you have. As we accelerate the alumni piece… they can draw on other alums that they’re selling into.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is selling access to the underlying technology stack of Alexa to let companies — starting with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles — build their own intelligent assistants with unique voices, skills and wake words.</p>
<p>The new Alexa Custom Assistant product, which was announced Friday, can coexist and cooperate with the Alexa assistant. Theoretically, this means an automaker could choose to use the custom assistant to interact with drivers on specific products and services tied to the vehicle as well as integrate the Alexa voice assistant for other needs. For instance, if a driver asks Alexa to roll down a car window, the request will be routed to the brand&#8217;s assistant, Amazon explained. If a customer asks the brand&#8217;s assistant to play an audio book, the request will be routed to Alexa.</p>
<p>Yes, that means your next car could have two Alexas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s a video showing how it works.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tmuGQjZcn2w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Fiat Chrysler Automobiles will be the first Alexa Custom Assistant customer. An FCA-branded intelligent assistant is being built for integration in select vehicle models, according to Amazon.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s pitch isn&#8217;t just to automakers, however. The e-commerce giant said it can be used to build intelligent assistants into mobile applications, smart properties, video games and consumer electronics. The Alexa Custom Assistant is based on the Alexa technology stack. The custom wake words are created with the same process used for developing the Alexa wake word. Amazon will give companies access to Alexa&#8217;s voice science experts to help guide them through the recording process and develop the voice using advanced machine learning algorithms. Developers also have access to Alexa&#8217;s pre-built capabilities such as communications, local search, traffic and navigation to further accelerate time to market.</p>
<p>The aim of this new product, Amazon says, is to give companies an efficient and cost-effective way of delivering an intelligent assistant to its customers. The path of building an intelligent AI-based assistant is complex, typically involves long development cycles and requires resources to build it from scratch and maintain over time, Amazon argues.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s also another way to ensure Alexa is in more devices, even if it goes by another name.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In mid-October, a little-known but critically important domain name for one country&#8217;s internet space began to expire.</p>
<p>The domain — <code>scpt-network.com</code> — was one of two nameservers for the <code>.cd</code> country code top-level domain, assigned to the Democratic Republic of Congo. If it fell into the wrong hands, an attacker could redirect millions of unknowing internet users to rogue websites of their choosing.</p>
<p>Clearly, a domain of such importance wasn&#8217;t supposed to expire; someone in the Congolese government probably forgot to pay for its renewal. Luckily, expired domains don&#8217;t disappear immediately. Instead, the clock started on a grace period for its government owners to buy back the domain before it was sold to someone else.</p>
<p>By chance, Fredrik Almroth, a security researcher and co-founder of cybersecurity startup Detectify, was already looking at nameservers of country code top-level domains (or ccTLDs), the two-letter suffixes at the end of regional web addresses, like <code>.fr</code> for France or <code>.uk</code> for the United Kingdom. When he found this critical domain name was about to expire, Almroth began to monitor it, assuming someone in the Congolese government would pay to reclaim the domain.</p>
<p>But nobody ever did.</p>
<p>By the end of December, the clock was almost up and the domain was about to fall off the internet. Within minutes of the domain becoming available, Almroth quickly snapped it up to prevent anyone else from taking it over — because, as he told TechCrunch, &#8220;the implications are kind of huge.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s rare but not unheard of for a top-level domain to expire.</p>
<p>In 2017, security researcher Matthew Bryant <a href="https://thehackerblog.com/the-io-error-taking-control-of-all-io-domains-with-a-targeted-registration/index.html">took over</a> the nameservers of the <code>.io</code> top-level domain, assigned to the British Indian Ocean Territory. But malicious hackers have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/sea-turtle-talos-dns-hijack/">also shown interest</a> in targeting top-level domain hacks into companies and governments that use the same country-based domain suffix.</p>

<p>Taking over a nameserver is not supposed to be an easy task because they are a vital part of how the internet works.</p>
<p>Every time you visit a website your device relies on a nameserver to convert a web address in your browser to the machine-readable address that tells your device where on the internet to find the site you&#8217;re looking for. Some liken nameservers to the phone directory of the internet. Sometimes your browser looks no further than its own cache for the answer, and sometimes it has to ask the nearest nameserver for the answer. But the nameservers that control top-level domains are considered authoritative and know where to look without having to ask another nameserver.</p>
<p>With control of an authoritative nameserver, malicious hackers could run man-in-the-middle attacks to silently intercept and redirect to malicious webpages internet users going to legitimate sites.</p>
<p>These kinds of attacks have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/sea-turtle-talos-dns-hijack/">used in sophisticated espionage campaigns</a> aimed at cloning websites to trick victims into handing over their passwords, which hackers use to get access to company networks to steal information.</p>
<p>Worse, Almroth said with control of the nameserver it was possible to obtain valid SSL (HTTPS) certificates, allowing for an attacker to intercept encrypted web traffic or any email mailbox for any <code>.cd</code> domain, he said. To the untrained eye, a successful attacker could redirect victims to a spoofed website, and they would be none the wiser.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can abuse the validation schemes used to issue certificates, you can undermine the SSL of any domain under <code>.cd</code> as well,&#8221; Almroth said. &#8220;The capabilities of being in such a privileged position is scary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almroth ended up sitting on the domain for about a week as he tried to figure out a way to hand it back. By this point the domain had been inactive for two months already and nothing had catastrophically broken. At most, websites with a <code>.cd</code> domain might have taken slightly longer to load.</p>
<p>Since the remaining nameserver was running normally, Almroth kept the domain offline so that whenever an internet user tried to access a domain that relied on the nameserver under his control, it would automatically timeout and pass the request to the remaining nameserver.</p>
<p>In the end, the Congolese government didn&#8217;t bother asking for the domain back. It spun up an entirely new but similarly named domain — <code>scpt-network.net</code> — to replace the one now in Almroth&#8217;s possession.</p>
<p>We reached out to the Congolese authorities for comment but did not hear back.</p>
<p>ICANN, the international nonprofit organization responsible for internet address allocation, said country code top-level domains are operated by their respective countries and its role is &#8220;very limited,&#8221; a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>For its part, ICANN encouraged countries to follow best practices and <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/dnssec-what-is-it-why-important-2019-03-05-en">to use DNSSEC</a>, a cryptographically more secure technology that makes it nearly impossible to serve up spoofed websites. One network security engineer who asked not to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media questioned whether DNSSEC would be effective at all against a top-level domain hijack.</p>
<p>At least in this case, it&#8217;s nothing a calendar reminder can&#8217;t solve.</p>

<p>&#8220;This year, multiple challenging circumstances will require that most people experience this historic ceremony virtually,&#8221; the social media firm writes in a <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/inauguration-2021.html">blog post</a> detailing how it will handle the transition of power on its platform as the Trump administration departs office.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Twitter will serve as both a venue for people to watch and talk about this political event, and play a key role in facilitating the transfer of official government communication channels, we want to be transparent and clear about what people should expect to see on the platform.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The inauguration will of course be livestreamed via Twitter by multiple accounts (such as news outlets), as well as the official inauguration accounts, <a class="has-hover-card" href="https://twitter.com/jccic">@JCCIC</a> and <a class="has-hover-card" href="https://twitter.com/BidenInaugural">@BidenInaugural</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter will also be streaming the ceremony via its <a href="https://twitter.com/explore/tabs/us-elections-2020">US Elections Hub</a>, where it says it will share curated Moments, Lists and accounts to follow as well.</p>
<p>Once sworn into office, Biden and Harris will gain control of the @POTUS and @VP Twitter accounts. Other accounts that will transition to the new administration on the day include @WhiteHouse, @FLOTUS and @PressSec.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Twitter has also confirmed that Harris&#8217; husband, Douglas Emhoff, will use a new official account &#8212; called <a href="https://twitter.com/SecondGentleman">@SecondGentleman</a>. (It&#8217;s not clear why not &#8216;SGOTUS&#8217;; aside from, well, the unloveliness of the acronym. <strong>Update:</strong> A Twitter spokesman told us the &#8216;@SecondGentleman&#8217; account &#8220;was the preference&#8221;.) </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter permanently bans President Trump&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/embed/#?secret=gJfr14LhX6" data-secret="gJfr14LhX6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As it did when president Obama left office, Twitter will transfer the current institutional accounts of the Trump administration to the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/">National Archives and Records Administration </a>(Nara) &#8212; meaning the outgoing administration&#8217;s tweets and account history will remain publicly available (with account usernames updated to reflect their archived status, e.g. @POTUS will be archived as @POTUS45).</p>
<p>However Trump&#8217;s personal account, which he frequently used as a political cudgel, yelling in ALL CAPS and/or spewing his customary self-pitying tweets, has already been wiped from public view after Twitter took the decision to permanently ban him <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">last week</a> for repeat violations of its rules of conduct. So there&#8217;s likely to be a major gap in Nara&#8217;s Trump archive.</p>
<p>&#8220;This archiving and transfer process only occurs for official government Twitter accounts,&#8221; Twitter confirmed.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-will-face-different-twitter-rules-when-he-leaves-office-11608642198">late last year</a> we&#8217;ve known the transitioning @POTUS and institutional accounts will not automatically retain followers from the prior administration. But Twitter still hasn&#8217;t confirmed why.</p>
<p>Today it just reiterated that the current (33.3M) followers of @POTUS and the other official accounts will receive a notification about the archival process which will include the &#8220;option&#8221; to follow the new holders of the accounts.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s another notable change from 2017 when Trump inherited the ~14M followers of president Obama&#8217;s @POTUS. Biden will instead have to start his presidential tweeting from scratch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re not commenting on follower transfer beyond what’s in this blog,&#8221; Twitter&#8217;s spokesperson added when we asked about this.</p>
<p>Given the chaotic events in the US capital last week, when supporters of the outgoing president broke through police lines to cause mayhem on the hill and in the House, there&#8217;s every reason for tech platforms to approach the 2021 transition with trepidation, lest their tools get used to livestream another historic insurrection (or worse).</p>
<p>Since then Trump has also continued to maintain his false claim that the election was stolen through voter fraud.</p>
<p>Although he avoided any new direct reference to this big lie when he circumvented <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">Twitter&#8217;s ban</a> on his personal account earlier this week, by <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1349492130578919425">posting a new video of himself speaking</a> on the official @WhiteHouse account.</p>
<p>In the video he decried the &#8220;incursion at the US capital&#8221;, as he put it; claimed that he &#8220;unequivocally condemns the violence that we saw last week&#8221;; and called for unity. But Twitter has put tight limits on what Trump can say on its platform without having his posts removed (as well limiting him to the official @POTUS channel). So he remains on a very tight speech leash.</p>

<p>In the video Trump limits his verbal attacks to a few remarks &#8212; about what he describes as &#8220;the unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent days&#8221; &#8212; dubbing tech platforms&#8217; censorship &#8220;wrong&#8221; and &#8220;dangerous&#8221;, and adding that &#8220;what is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence one another&#8221;.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot going on here but it should not escape notice that Trump&#8217;s seeming contrition and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/is-trump-back-on-twitter/">quasi-concession</a> and his <em>very-last-minute</em> calls for unity have only come when he actively feels power draining away from him.</p>
<p>Most notably, his call for unity has only come after<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> powerful tech platforms acted to shut off his hate-megaphone &#8212; ending the years of special dispensation they granted Trump to ride roughshod over democratic convention and tear up the civic rulebook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It&#8217;s very interesting to speculate how different the 2021 US inauguration might look and feel if platforms like Twitter had consistently enforced their rules against Trump from the get-go. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Instead we&#8217;re stuck in all sorts of lockdown, counting the days til Biden takes office &#8212; and above all hoping for a smooth transition of power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is quite right when he <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510771928010753">said</a> this week that Twitter has failed in its mission to &#8220;promote healthy conversation&#8221;. His company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/18/gamergate-tactics/">ignored warnings about online toxicity for years</a>. Trump is, in no small part, the divisive product of that. </span></p>

<p>These measures include permanently suspending ~70,000 accounts it said were primarily dedicated to sharing content related to the QAnon conspiracy theory; aggressively beefing up its civic integrity policy; and applying interaction limits on labeled tweets plus blocking violative keywords from appearing in Trends and search.</p>
<p>&#8220;These efforts, including our open lines of communication with law enforcement, will continue through the inauguration and will adapt as needed if circumstances change in real-time,&#8221; it adds, preparing for the possibility of more unrest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a troubled year that saw broadband satellite operator <a href="https://www.oneweb.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OneWeb</a> file for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/27/oneweb-to-file-for-bankruptcy-as-effort-to-securing-funding-including-from-investor-softbank-falls-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> bankruptcy</a>, get rescue finance from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/the-uk-government-to-acquire-satellite-company-oneweb-in-deal-funded-in-part-by-indias-bharti-global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.K. government</a> and Bharti, and then emerge out of that with a launch of part of its fleet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/oneweb-launches-36-satellites-to-join-its-global-broadband-constellation-on-orbit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last month</a>, the London-based company today announced that it&#8217;s closed $1.4 billion in funding &#8212; money that it says will be enough to (finally) get the rest of its first-generation fleet of 648 satellites off the ground.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The 36 new satellites OneWeb launched in December brought the total number in orbit to 110 satellites. This means there are still more than 500 left to launch in the first generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The company is continuing to whittle down its ambitions. Earlier this week, OneWeb <a href="https://www.oneweb.world/media-center/oneweb-streamlines-constellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> that it had &#8220;streamlined its constellation&#8221; and as a result was reducing the request it was making to the U.S. regulators for licenses. Originally OneWeb had applied to the FCC for market access for </span>47,884 satellites; now the figure is down to 6,372.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SoftBank Group Corp. and Hughes Network Systems are providing the financing, the company said. The news comes about a month after OneWeb launched 36 satellites, its third launch to put more of its fleet into orbit. At the time, its executive chairman <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/98e57ccc-8ecf-4a6a-afa9-1c8366043b56" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunil Bharti Mittal said</a> that it was on track to raise $400 million<del> &#8212; so this represents a more-than threefold increase on that amount.</del> This appears to confirm that.</p>
<p>“OneWeb’s mission is to connect everyone, everywhere. We have made rapid progress to re-start the business since emerging from Chapter 11 in November,&#8221; said Neil Masterson, CEO of OneWeb, in a statement. &#8220;We welcome the investments by SoftBank and Hughes as further proof of progress towards delivering our goal.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the company has confirmed to me that the company is not disclosing its valuation. Adding in this round, it looks like the company has raised around $4.5 billion to date, although the bankruptcy meant a significant recapitalization and revaluation of the business and that figure includes funding from before it was restructured.</p>
<p>SoftBank and Hughes are both past backers and partners in OneWeb, so this is something of an insurance policy to make sure that its previous investment doesn&#8217;t go completely to waste. (At least some of it has already been written down: SoftBank years ago <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/softbank-expects-24-billion-in-losses-from-vision-fund-wework-and-oneweb-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted an eye-watering loss of $24 billion</a> due in part to that OneWeb bet.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SoftBank expects $24 billion in losses from Vision Fund, WeWork and OneWeb investments&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/softbank-expects-24-billion-in-losses-from-vision-fund-wework-and-oneweb-investments/embed/#?secret=OnwteeOltt" data-secret="OnwteeOltt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Hughes, meanwhile, invests via its parent company EchoStar and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/07/oneweb-is-a-step-closer-to-bringing-its-global-satellite-based-internet-services-to-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inked a deal with the company way back in 2017</a> to build the terrestrial infrastructure that would work with OneWeb&#8217;s satellites. Deals, building and rollouts in the world of satellite technology play out over a number of years, and often face delays, so being three years out &#8212; or even more &#8212; on seeing any fruits from that deal is not hugely surprising.</p>
<p>OneWeb acknowledged the long-time connection between the investors and confirmed that the ground network is still being built by Hughes.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to welcome the investment from SoftBank and Hughes. Both are deeply familiar with our business, share our vision for the future, and their commitment allows us to capitalise on the significant growth opportunity ahead for OneWeb,&#8221; said Mittal in a statement. &#8220;We gain from their experience and capabilities, as we deliver a unique LEO network for the world.”</p>
<p>Originally, Hughes had planned for the first services to start running in 2019 &#8212; although that was when OneWeb and its fleet of LEO (low Earth orbit) satellites was still a very shiny idea, backed by $1.7 billion in venture funding.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s original idea was always great but (no pun intended) also something of a moonshot: LEO satellites have already been proven to be a strong and useful complement to terrestrial networks for providing broadband connectivity to more remote areas that couldn&#8217;t be reached in other ways. The idea with OneWeb was to make that service something useful and used by a much bigger group of on-the-ground users, with <a href="https://www.oneweb.world/technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the promise</a> being 400Mbps for everyone.</p>
<p>While broadband usage has certainly exploded in the interim, what OneWeb perhaps didn&#8217;t bank on was that those building non-satellite systems for providing connectivity would also be progressing in their network advances; nor how long it might take, or the financing needed, to get its fleet off the ground on the timelines it was promising.</p>
<p>These days, OneWeb says that growing ubiquity of 5G, Internet of Things and connectivity needs overall still present a strong use case for its approach &#8212; which it says &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">includes a network of global gateway stations and a range of user terminals for different customer markets capable of delivering affordable, fast, high-bandwidth and low-latency communications services.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Secretary of State, BEIS, The Rt. Hon. Kwasi Kwarteng, said in a statement: “Our investment in OneWeb is part of our continued commitment to the UK’s space sector, putting Britain at the forefront of the latest technological advances. Today’s investment brings the company one step closer to delivering its mission to provide global broadband connectivity for people, businesses and governments, while potentially unlocking new research, development and manufacturing opportunities in the UK.”</p>

<p>SoftBank is getting a seat on OneWeb&#8217;s board with this deal.</p>
<p>“We are excited to support OneWeb as it increases capacity and accelerates towards commercialisation,&#8221; said Masayoshi Son, representative director, corporate officer, chairman &amp; CEO of SoftBank, in a statement. &#8220;We are thrilled to continue our partnership with Bharti, the UK Government and Hughes to help OneWeb deliver on its mission to transform internet access around the world.”</p>
<p>Pradman Kaul, president of Hughes, added: “OneWeb continues to inspire the industry and attract the best players in the business to come together to bring its LEO constellation to fruition. The investments made today by Hughes and SoftBank will help realise the full potential of OneWeb in connecting enterprise, government and mobility customers, especially with multi-transport services that complement our own geostationary offerings in meeting and accelerating demand for broadband around the world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is the latest to be added to the Trump administration&#8217;s military blacklist. On Thursday, the Department of Defense <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2472464/dod-releases-list-of-additional-companies-in-accordance-with-section-1237-of-fy/">added</a> nine companies to its list of alleged Chinese military companies, including Xiaomi.</p>
<p>Xiaomi was the world&#8217;s third-largest smartphone maker as of Q3 last year, coming ahead of Apple and trailing behind Samsung and Huawei, according to market researcher <a href="https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor">IDC</a>.</p>
<p>In November, President Donald Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/the-trump-administration-will-add-smic-chinas-largest-chipmaker-to-its-defense-blacklist-report/">signed an executive order</a>, which was set to take effect in January, to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-securities-investments-finance-communist-chinese-military-companies/">bar investment</a> in companies designated as supporting efforts of China&#8217;s military, intelligence and security apparatuses. Huawei, China&#8217;s major chipmaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/the-trump-administration-will-add-smic-chinas-largest-chipmaker-to-its-defense-blacklist-report/">SMIC</a> and the country&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/nyse-reverses-plans-to-delist-chinas-three-big-telcos/">three largest telecoms operators</a> are among the targets of the list.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The military blacklist is different from the Commerce Department&#8217;s entity list, which famously cuts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/us-commerce-department-adds-46-huawei-affiliates-to-entity-list/">Huawei</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/dji-added-to-commerce-department-entity-list/">DJI</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/eight-chinese-tech-firms-placed-on-u-s-entity-list-for-their-role-in-human-rights-violations-against-muslim-minority-groups/">SenseTime</a> and other Chinese tech firms off their U.S. suppliers over national security concerns.</p>
<p>Xiaomi &#8220;confirms that it is not owned, controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military, and is not a &#8216;Communist Chinese Military Company&#8217; defined under the NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act]. The company will take appropriate course of actions to protect the interests of the company and its shareholders,&#8221; a Xiaomi spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<p>Like the entity list, the U.S. government&#8217;s military blacklist has caused confusion around compliance. In response to the sanctions on China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, the New York Stock Exchange made three moves.
