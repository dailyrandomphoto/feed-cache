										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Redwood Materials, the battery recycling startup founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, has purchased 100 acres of land near the Gigafactory that Panasonic operates with Tesla in Sparks, Nevada as part of an expansion plan that aligns with the Biden Administration&#8217;s drive to increase adoption of electric vehicles and boost domestic battery recycling and supply chain efforts.</p>
<p>The company said Monday that its existing 150,000-square-foot facility in Carson City, Nevada will also nearly triple in size. Redwood is adding another 400,000 square feet onto the Carson City recycling facility. As part of its growth plans, Redwood is also hiring hundreds of workers. The company, which is backed by Amazon, employs 130 people today and expects to add more than 500 jobs over the next two years.</p>
<p>Redwood&#8217;s expansion announcement follows the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/08/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-supply-chain-disruptions-task-force-to-address-short-term-supply-chain-discontinuities/">Biden Administration&#8217;s 100-day review</a> of the U.S. supply chain and the release of a<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/FCAB%20National%20Blueprint%20Lithium%20Batteries%200621_0.pdf?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosgenerate&amp;stream=top"> Department of Energy&#8217; document</a> that lays out a plan to improve the domestic supply chain for lithium-based batteries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;America has a clear opportunity to build back our domestic supply chain and manufacturing sectors, so we can capture the full benefits of an emerging $23 trillion global clean energy economy,&#8221; Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm said Monday in a statement. &#8220;Private sector investment like this is a sign that we can&#8217;t slow down. The American Jobs Plan will unlock massive opportunities for US businesses as it spurs innovation and demand for technologies&#8211;like vehicle batteries and battery storage&#8211;creating clean energy jobs for all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redwood Materials, which was founded in 2017, is trying to create a circular supply chain. The company has a business-to-business strategy, recycling the scrap from battery cell production as well as consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. Redwood collects the scrap from consumer electronics companies and battery cell manufacturers like Panasonic. It then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and then supplies those back to Panasonic and other customers. The aim is to create a closed loop system that will ultimately help reduce the cost of batteries and offset the need for mining.</p>
<p>Redwood Materials has a number of customers, and has only publicly disclosed that it is working with Panasonic, Amazon and AESC Envision in Tennessee</p>
<p>Redwood Materials says it recovers about 95% to 98% of the elements from the batteries such as nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper. Today, it receives 3 gigawatt-hours annually, a figure that the company says is equivalent to about 45,000 cars.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In December 1991, about 20 days before the Soviet Union formally disintegrated, my family landed in San Francisco as religious refugees fleeing persecution. I was a 9-year-old kid who had just experienced his first airplane trip and was utterly mesmerized by the skyscrapers of the city’s skyline as we drove past. It felt like arriving into the future.</p>
<p>My parents had almost nothing to their names. No degrees or specialized skills. Not a word of English. Only a few hundred dollars in cash from selling most of our possessions in Russia. They had just learned that half of our “luggage” &#8212; makeshift bags that were hand-sewn by my mother out of used floor rugs — was lost in transit.</p>
<p>Our journey wasn’t made possible by some employer seeking specialized labor, nor by a merit assessment that deemed our family as economically valuable immigrants. Instead, it was made possible by many Americans seeing inherent value in human beings seeking a better life. From people who wrote letters to Congress to increase refugee quotas, to sponsoring families who shared their homes and paychecks and lives to support arriving families, to organizations like<a href="https://worldrelief.org/"> World Relief</a>, which funded unsecured loans to pay for airline tickets for those who couldn’t afford them &#8212; all did their part with no expectation of economic gain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			I worry that outlier success stories &#8212; especially those that are filled with considerable luck and privilege like mine &#8212; can send the wrong message.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Integration into life in the United States wasn’t easy. Our family had to rely on welfare for several years as our parents learned English in night classes and attempted many different ways to make a living for our family of eight. Not being able to find a full-time job, my father tried every mail-order contract gig he could learn about &#8212; from cutting out thousands of leather pieces for shoes to soldering electronic boards to order to translation of documents from English to Russian. Eventually, he started his own business repairing and maintaining computers.</p>
<p>In every moment, I saw my parents seeking to pay back what others had selflessly done for us. They taught me there’s dignity to doing good work, even if it’s work that others don’t find glamorous. Even a decade later, our family was still barely scraping by financially. As I was applying to colleges as a senior in high school, our entire family would pack up our minivan on most evenings after dinner to clean dental clinics to make ends meet.</p>
<p>This is the point in my tale where it might make the most sense to insert my own story of living out a wildly unbelievable version of the American dream — especially for a refugee.</p>
<p>I could tell you how after college I co-founded Webflow, a <a href="https://webflow.com/no-code">no-code software development</a> company that employs nearly 300 people and is now valued at over $2 billion. And how stories like mine are the reason why we should open our doors to more refugees to come to the United States.</p>
<p>However, I worry that outlier success stories &#8212; especially those that are filled with considerable luck and privilege like mine &#8212; can send the wrong message. These tales can imply that the value and worth of immigrants and refugees are primarily economic. I worry that especially now, at a time when immigration has become a politically polarizing issue in this country, the conversation about the value of immigrants will continue shifting toward being purely merit-based.</p>
<p>Too often, if “merit” is the criterion, human beings are seen as worthy of joining our country if and only if they’re the “best of the best” or the “cream of the crop” in some skill or industry. In such cases, people are judged solely by how much economic value they can create in the short term.</p>
<p>Yes, merit-based immigration has an important place in our economy to solve shorter-term skill gaps in various industries. But if we <em>only</em> focus on that, I believe that our nation will have lost an important part of its character and heritage. We shouldn’t reduce our efforts to offer a safe haven to people whose lives are threatened back home. Turning our backs on the most vulnerable only to focus on the most economically advantageous would betray the spirit of what I believe makes the United States a beacon of hope and opportunity for so many people.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can get outsized economic benefits in the longer term by accepting more refugees. I know this because for every startup founder story like mine, there are hundreds of thousands of hard-working refugees who needed some help at first but are now contributing massively to our tax base as nurses, doctors, lawyers, firefighters and business owners. In fact, refugees<a href="https://immigrationforum.org/article/immigrants-as-economic-contributors-immigrant-entrepreneurs/#:~:text=Refugees%20have%20a%20higher%20rate,percent%20of%20non%2Drefugee%20immigrants."> have the highest rate of entrepreneurship</a>.</p>
<p>After experiencing hardship and oppression in their originating countries, refugees have unparalleled drive to make a better living for themselves, their families and their communities &#8212; which helps lift our entire economy.</p>
<p>My hope is that more people are given this kind of opportunity and that more industry leaders will start to advocate for immigration on humanitarian terms &#8212; not just economic ones. It will make our economy stronger in the end.</p>
<p>When given the chance to live freely without fearing for our lives, my family and so many others like us will work harder than most to contribute to society. Why? Because we feel a deep sense of gratitude to a nation that welcomed and accepted us because of, first and foremost, who we are as human beings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This weekend, all of your friends morphed one by one into animated, Pixar-inspired characters. This isn’t a fever dream, and you’re not alone.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Snapchat released a <a href="https://lens.snapchat.com/bad1396b0f8d494d845b1d6438c115f2">Cartoon 3D Style Lens</a>, which uses AR to make you look like a background character from “Frozen.” Naturally, even though TikTok’s own AR cartoon effects aren’t quite as convincing as Snapchat’s, people are turning to TikTok to share videos of themselves as Disney princesses, because of course they are.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that a Disney-esque AR trend has gone viral. In August 2020, Snapchat had 28.5 million new installs, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/snapchat-had-a-big-august-amid-tiktok-uncertainty/">its biggest month</a> since May 2019, when it got 41.2 million new installs. It might not be a coincidence that in early August 2020, Snapchat released the <a href="https://lens.snapchat.com/0ad185e6dd5e418a9659fa96dce788e0">Cartoon Face lens</a>, which users realized could be used to “Disneyfy” their pets – the tag #<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@djangosmiles/video/6860585253157752070?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">disneydog</a> got 40.9 million views across platforms on TikTok. Then, Snapchat struck viral gold again in December, when they released the <a href="https://lens.snapchat.com/449d01c9513c40288d74397352cb304e">Cartoon lens</a>, which rendered more realistic results for human faces than the previous iteration.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to Sensor Tower, Snapchat&#8217;s global installs continued to climb month-over-month throughout the rest of 2020, though installs slightly declined in December. Still, Snapchat got 36 million downloads that month. Now, after the newest Cartoon Style 3D lens went viral again, Snapchat hit number 6 on the App Store’s free apps charts, compared to TikTok’s number 2 slot. Still, Snapchat downloads in May were 32 million, down from 34 million in April, while TikTok saw 80.3 million installs in May, up from 59.3 million in April.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165716" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165716" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2165716" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cartoonsnapchat.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="243" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cartoonsnapchat.png 1900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cartoonsnapchat.png?resize=150,54 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cartoonsnapchat.png?resize=300,107 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cartoonsnapchat.png?resize=768,274 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cartoonsnapchat.png?resize=680,243 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cartoonsnapchat.png?resize=1536,549 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cartoonsnapchat.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165716" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snapchat, screenshots by TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>But there’s a new app in the number 1 slot that also made an impact on this weekend’s cartoon explosion. Released in March, Voilà AI Artist is yet another platform that turns us into cartoon versions of ourselves. Unlike the AR-powered effects on Snapchat or TikTok, Voilà is a photo editor. Users upload a selfie, and after watching an ad (the ad-free version costs $3 per week), it reveals what you would look like as a cartoon.</p>
<p>Voilà AI Artist was only downloaded 400 times globally in March 2021. By May, the app surpassed 1 million downloads, and during the first two weeks of this month alone, the app has been downloaded over 10.5 million times.</p>
<p>Again, like the repetitive iterations on the “Disneyfy” trend, apps like Voilà aren’t new. FaceApp went viral in 2019, showing people what they’ll look like when they’re old, graying, and wrinkled. The app became the center of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/faceapp-responds-to-privacy-concerns/">privacy controversy</a>, since it uploaded users’ photos to the cloud to edit their selfies with AI. FaceApp made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/faceapp-responds-to-privacy-concerns/">a statement</a> that it “might store updated photos in the cloud” for “performance and traffic reasons,” but that “most images” are deleted “within 48 hours.” Still, this ambiguous language set off the warning bells, urging us to think about the potentially nefarious implications of seeing what we’ll look like in sixty years. Two years earlier, FaceApp put out a “hotness” filter, which made users’ skin lighter – FaceApp apologized for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/25/faceapp-apologises-for-building-a-racist-ai/">racist AI</a>. Voilà, which is owned by Wemagine.AI LLP in Canada, has also been criticized for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@a_ali_flores/video/6972879431211715845?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">its AI’s eurocentrism</a>. As these apps grow in popularity, they can also uphold some of our culture’s most harmful biases.</p>

<p>Like FaceApp, Voilà requires an internet connection to use the app. Additionally, its <a href="https://www.wemagine.ai/terms">terms</a> outline that users grant the company “a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use in any way, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute Uploaded and Generated content.” Basically, that means that if you upload an image to the platform, Voilà has the right to use it, but they don’t own it. This isn’t abnormal for these apps – when we <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/termsofuse">upload photos to Instagram</a>, for example, we also grant the platform the right to use our images.</p>
<p>Still, it’s a good thing that apps like Voilà force us to consider what we give up in exchange for the knowledge that we’d make a good Disney princess. Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">TikTok updated its U.S. privacy policy</a> to dictate that the app “may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information” from users’ content. This includes “faceprints and voiceprints,” terms that TikTok left undefined. When TechCrunch reached Tiktok for comment, they couldn’t confirm why the terms now changed to allow for the automatic collection of biometric data, which refers to any features, measurements, or characteristics of our body that distinguish us, even fingerprints.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that as Voilà climbed to the number one slot on the App Store, Snapchat re-upped their Pixar-inspired AR lens. Facebook’s own Spark AR platform is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebooks-spark-ar-platform-expands-to-video-calling-with-multipeer-api/">rolling out new features</a>, and last week at WWDC, Apple announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apples-realitykit-2-allows-developers-to-create-3d-models-for-ar-using-iphone-photos/">major update to RealityKit</a>, its AR software. But these trends reveal more about our growing comfort with face-altering AR than they do about our nostalgia for Disney.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fraud protection startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nsure-ai-payment-assurance">nSure AI</a> has raised $6.8 million in seed funding, led by DisruptiveAI, Phoenix Insurance, AXA-backed venture builder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/kamet-ventures/">Kamet</a>, Moneta Seeds and private investors.</p>
<p>The round will help the company bolster the predictive AI and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/machine-learning/">machine learning</a> algorithms that power nSure AI&#8217;s &#8220;first of its kind&#8221; fraud protection platform. Prior to this round, the company received $550,000 in pre-seed funding from Kamet in March 2019.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv-headquartered startup, which currently has 16 employees, provides fraud detection for high-risk digital goods, such as electronic gift cards, airline tickets, software and games. While most fraud detection tools analyze each online transaction in an attempt to decide which purchases to approve and decline, nSure AI&#8217;s risk engine leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify fraudulent transactions.</p>
<p>NSure AI, which is backed by insurance company AXA, <a href="https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/88074/nsureai-raises-68-million">said</a> it has a 98% approval rating on average for purchases, compared to an industry average of 80%, allowing retailers to recapture nearly $100 billion a year in revenue lost by declining legitimate customers. The company is so confident in its technology that it will accept liability for any fraudulent transaction allowed by the platform.</p>
<p>Founders Alex Zeltcer and Ziv Isaiah started the company after experiencing the unique challenges faced by retailers of digital assets. The first week of their online gift card business found that 40% of sales were fraudulent, resulting in chargebacks. The founders began to develop their own platform for supporting the sale of high-risk digital goods after no other fraud detection service met their needs.</p>
<p>Zeltcer, co-founder and chief executive, said the investment &#8220;enables us to register thousands of new merchants, who can feel confident selling higher-risk digital goods, without accepting fraud as a part of business.”</p>
<p>NSure AI, which currently monitors and manages millions of transactions every month, has approved close to $1 billion in volume since going live in 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mac-reddin-7a275716b">Mac Reddin</a>, the co-founder and CEO of<a href="https://www.commsor.com/"> Commsor</a>, met the first professional investor for his company’s $16 million Series A on Lunch Club, a marketplace for 1:1 video introductions. Commsor, which sees itself as an operating system for community managers, then experienced firsthand the benefit of matching people within similar industries in an engaging, online setting.</p>
<p>It’s thus quite fitting that, months later, Commsor is adding a company to its tech stack that is focused on private networking within communities. Commsor has scooped up <a href="https://www.meetsy.io/">Meetsy</a>, a startup that helps people within communities facilitate creative and spontaneous conversations with each other. Meetsy, a fully bootstrapped business, was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/btramer/">Bradley Tramer</a> and sold for an undisclosed price.</p>
<p>Commsor launched months ago to be the solution that helps community managers prove that they’re not wasting the budget and their work is tied to real, valuable outcomes. Commsor could pull an insight like, “Here are three Google engineers that are using your [insert community platform name here]. so maybe it’s time to approach Google and ask if they want an enterprise contract.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pvDhJ1Ljay"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/chief-community-officer-is-the-new-cmo/">Chief community officer is the new CMO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chief community officer is the new CMO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/chief-community-officer-is-the-new-cmo/embed/#?secret=pvDhJ1Ljay" data-secret="pvDhJ1Ljay" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With the acquisition, Commsor’s ambition appears to be broadening a bit. In order for a community to be outwardly valuable to a business, it has to be inwardly healthy. The members have to connect, riff and have a chance to debate that shared interest that placed them there in the first place. Meetsy works within companies, matching employees to employees, alumni programs, and with venture capitalists that want their portfolio companies to connect with one another as well.</p>
<p>“If Commsor helps you prove the business value of community, and Meetsy helps you build a better community, those two together compound into an even bigger impact.”</p>
<p>Even as growing vaccination rates in the United States may turn on the faucet for in-person interactions, many think there will continue to be a virtual component to interactions, especially with distributed teams. Surely enough, the wave of super-connector apps has grown larger as remote work gets deeper roots. The aforementioned Lunch Club <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/01/lunchclub-tops-100-million-valuation-amid-quarantine-usage-spike.html">was last valued at $100 million,</a> Workvivo raised $16 million in financing and Gatheround landed a $3.5 million seed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/gatheround-raises-millions-from-homebrew-bloomberg-and-stripes-coo-to-help-remote-workers-connect/">round last month</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every virtual event tool I&#8217;ve seen how some sort of networking built into it, but it&#8217;s usually what I&#8217;d consider &#8216;dumb networking&#8217;,&#8221; Reddin said. He&#8217;s alluding to the common &#8220;speed dating&#8221; strategy of placing random people with each other for a few minutes, and then shuffling to repeat.</p>
<p>Meetsy, he said, has refined a robust matching system so a community manager can come in and define people by their self-chosen attributes. It can then fill out match rules based on guidelines for how they want matches to happen. For example, Meetsy could make sure that fintech VCs only meet fintech startups to spark a future investment, or that employees only can meet without employees outside of their current team to promote cross-collaboration.</p>
<p>“That way it&#8217;s not just smashing two rocks together and hoping sparks fly,” Reddin said.</p>
<p>The two companies will continue to exist underneath existing branding, but Meetsy users might be able to get a discount on Commsor or benefit from future bundling features. Meetsy has always been free to use but will experiment with new paid features in the future such as white-labeling capabilities, or a tier-system that requires companies to pay once they hit a certain scale of community members.</p>
<p>Tramer, the founder of Meetsy, said that combining tools with Commsor will help community managers “foster meaningful connection at scale and measure the impact of those connections.”</p>
<p>“In five years, I see &#8216;curated introductions&#8217; as a core pillar of community engagement alongside events and forums,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Cory Siskind finished school, she was dropped into a high-stakes job helping large multinational corporations manage their operational security in Mexico City, with almost no relevant lived experience. Eventually, she realized that this was more or less par for the course in the corporate security field, which lagged behind other mission-critical enterprise services, like information security.</p>
<p>The industry still relied on recent grads doing manual work like combing through blogs and local news reports, and on security industry veterans with contacts on the ground to build a sort of &#8220;whisper network&#8221; of ground truth. Those things are obviously still valuable, but advancements in technology mean that there are many, many more sources of information that can provide valuable insight into the security situation in any particular country, region or even neighborhood, and machine learning has progressed to the point where it can do a lot of the legwork involved in helping analysts parse the data.</p>
<p>Cory tells us all about how she came to the conclusion that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/base-operations-raises-2-2-million-to-modernize-physical-enterprise-security/"> Base Operations needed to be built</a> to bring modern tech to bear on the capabilities gap she saw in how companies manage their global security footprint, and how she set out getting the skills needed to build her startup as a sole founder. We talk about the challenges of fundraising in an area where most traditional VCs likely feel out of their depth, and building a sales operation that can handle big clients even very early on in her startup&#8217;s life.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

And of course, we’d love if you can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’re like me, you spent the weekend longing for the mixed bag that is downtown Los Angeles during E3. I’ve got fond memories of fish tacos, The Last Bookstore, watching playoff basketball in garishly lit hotel lobbies and, of course, video game press conference after video game press conference.</p>
<p>For a second year in a row, the show’s gone all virtual, owing to…well, you know, that pesky virus that has defined the past year and a half of our lives. Last year’s show was canceled altogether (though a handful of companies still kept to the schedule). Show organizers simply didn’t think they would be able to pull together a digital event &#8212; and frankly, it’s probably for the best that they understood those limitations.</p>
<p>The 2021 event, which kicked off on Saturday, marks the first all-virtual version of the event. For the time being, it’s also the last. Mayor Eric Garcetti kicked off the show by announcing that E3 would return to the LA Convention Center in 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gaming had a banner 2020, and while growth has slowed, as parts of the world look forward to a post-pandemic life, things are still growing. Some well-timed <a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/industry-expertise/video-games/">numbers from NPD</a> this morning point to a 3% year-over-year growth for May 2021, as spending on gaming rose to $4.5 billion. Year-to-date, things are up 17%.</p>
<p>The timing of last year’s canceled event was certainly unfortunate from a hardware standpoint. Console refreshes are massive events at E3. 2020 gave us the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Announcements were relegated to Sony and Microsoft’s own events. That meant the companies were able to draw things out &#8212; revealing small details, piece by piece, rather than saving everything for the big show. It’s a strategy that lends itself much better to virtual presentations and blog posts than it does big conventions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congrats to <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@XboxP3</a> and the whole team on a great showcase. Great time to be a gamer</p>
<p>&mdash; Hermen Hulst (@hermenhulst) <a href="https://twitter.com/hermenhulst/status/1404168837872951306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Sony is sitting this one out, too. While it’s entirely possible the company will be holding a big, virtual State of Play event at some point this summer, it won’t be tied to E3. Still, some Sony execs like PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst used the opportunity congratulate Microsoft on “a great showcase” on Twitter. So that’s a nice thing.</p>
<p>Thus far, Microsoft is the only one of the big three to present at the event. Nintendo will be holding a Treehouse event tomorrow. The Switch Pro could be on tap for the event, with an upgraded OLED display and internals. That would likely also mean a bunch of upgraded content for the new version of the four-year-old console.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1YnVzOA2wNs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Microsoft, meanwhile, went big on games. Understandable, given the recent launch of the Series X. And, let’s face it, these virtual events are perfectly suited for playing a whole bunch of trailers. The company showcased 30 games (and a fridge) in all. Of those, 27 will be part of the Xbox Game Pass, in case you had any doubt about what the future of gaming on the Xbox will look like. The event was framed as a combination Xbox and Bethesda showcase, having acquired the publisher earlier this year.</p>
<p>“Our growing family of 23 studios is devoted to advancing the medium we all love,” the company writes, “so we were happy to share that now through the end of the year, you can look forward to back-to-back monthly releases coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one, led by a record five new titles from Xbox Game Studios this holiday, including Halo Infinite.”</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>

<p>It wouldn’t be a Square Enix event without a Final Fantasy spinoff, right? The perennial favorite RPG is birthing Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin, which arrives on a slew of different platforms next year.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Axmg1E4HrVE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>

<p>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six: Extraction is due out on September 16. Originally titled Rainbow Six: Quarantine, the name was changed for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Capcom and Take-Two will showcase tonight, followed by Nintendo Direct and Bandai Namco tomorrow. On Thursday, EA is set to hold its own Play Live event. Meanwhile, here&#8217;s some video of that new Xbox fridge. Who said there wasn&#8217;t any new hardware?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Welp, the mobility event is over and we had loads of interesting interviews &#8212; and anyone with an Extra Crunch subscription can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/">access the videos</a>. For instance, Rita Liao moderated a panel with executives from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/the-rise-of-robotaxis-in-china/">three Chinese robotaxi companies</a> — WeRide, AutoX and Momenta — that also test and develop in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>One interesting takeaway on the regulations front is that policymaking for AVs in China is driven from the bottom up rather than a top-down effort by the central government, the three panelists explained. They also spoke about how foreign counterparts can crack open China&#8217;s market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jewel Li from AutoX laid out the challenges of operating in China:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it&#8217;s not as simple as opening up an office, right? It&#8217;s much more than that, to be able to succeed in the market. You need to build the landscape, you need to build the ecosystem, your own partners. The whole ecosystem chain is quite long. It&#8217;s quite complicated, involving government relations. It also involves the data that you have already accumulated. The driving experience has to fit in the local world. Many things comes into play.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other highlights included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/building-an-electric-powerhouse/">my interview with Mate Rimac</a> of Rimac Automobili, who disclosed how close the company came to failing, provided advice to fellow and aspiring founders and explained his interest in electric robotaxis. Then there was the discussion about the AV industry between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/">Motional&#8217;s Karl Iagnemma and Aurora&#8217;s Chris Urmson</a> — not an interview to miss. More recaps of the event will be published in the coming week.</p>

<p>This week, as Kirsten Korosec mentioned above, we had our big Mobility event, where the leaders, upstarts and startups of the mobility world joined us on our virtual stage to talk about the future of moving people, goods and even ideas. I led a panel with <strong>Remix</strong> co-founder and CEO <strong>Tiffany Chu</strong>, community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer <strong>Tamika L. Butler</strong> and <strong>Revel</strong> co-founder and CEO <strong>Frank Reig</strong>. We discussed the importance of mobility companies being equitable and accessible to everyone in a city, especially the most vulnerable, and how that affects profitability.</p>
<p>Something interesting that came out of my questioning was Reig&#8217;s comments about Revel achieving profitability. (The revelations about profitability were<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/revel-electric-mopeds-freedom-mayhem-uncertain-future/"> first shared in May</a>, although Reig did provide a bit more color during the event.) For three months in the summer of 2020, Revel was full-company profitable, &#8220;so beyond just market profitability, beyond just unit economics,&#8221; said Reig. &#8220;I&#8217;m talking my salary and everything else that&#8217;s involved in running a company.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was back when Revel was only an e-moped company and before it added several other business lines, including EV charging hubs, e-bikes and ride-hailing. We don&#8217;t know exactly how Revel is measuring profitably — are we talking EBITDA? Gross profit? — and on the panel we didn&#8217;t have time to dig into the money salad. But it is notable as the company settles into its newest business line of ride-hailable Tesla vehicles. We&#8217;ll be watching Revel closely as it continues to ramp up its different revenue streams. Maybe someday they&#8217;ll go public so we can have a closer look.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get back to the important issue of whether or not mobility companies, like Revel, can help cities achieve equitability of movement. Movement should be a right, not a privilege, but it often feels like we&#8217;re playing the same game with different vehicles today. Mobility has always benefited those at the top more, so why should it be any different today? Does the moral highway really drive us toward justice? What good reason do companies have to spend their time and money actually making sure their services help cities achieve equity of movement?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think if you&#8217;re doing the work that theoretically is to serve people then you should want to serve all people,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1402727043603865602">said Butler.</a> &#8220;For companies, I would say that people like to say it takes too much time or costs too much money to do things equitably, but whether or not you&#8217;re retrofitting a house or retrofitting your company, whenever you retrofit something it costs more money. So if you think about equity as something you build in from the beginning, it will actually save you money and take less time than if you try to do it later because someone tells you to do it or you&#8217;ve had some controversy.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Some micro morsels&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://leoride.co/">Leo Riders</a></strong>, an e-scooter platform for those in the hospitality industry, is expanding into Athens, Greece, with more than 20 agreements with local hotels. Hotels like Brown Hotel and Colors Urban Hotel will now be able to offer guests e-scooters to ride around the city. Sounds sick. What could go wrong?!</p>
<p>E-scooter subscription and sales company<strong> Unagi</strong> is expanding its <a href="https://allaccess.unagiscooters.com/sign_up">&#8220;All-Access&#8221; service&#8221;</a> to Chicago, D.C. and some other regions around those two great American cities.</p>
<p><strong>Lime</strong> is extending its &#8220;Ride to Recovery&#8221; initiative &#8212; which provides free e-scooter and bike rides to vaccine appointments &#8212; to the Fourth of July. Riders can access a promo code for two <a href="https://limebike.typeform.com/to/act1Mwxe">free 15-minute rides here</a>, as well as information on vaccines and where to get one.</p>
<p><strong>Future Motion&#8217;s</strong> Onewheel, the unique and fun-looking vehicle that&#8217;s like a skateboard with a giant wheel in the middle of the board, has reached 52.5 million miles. They wanted me to tell you that&#8217;s 220 trips to the moon and back, 2,100 times around the earth and nearly 18,000 trips between Santa Cruz, California and NYC.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Didi</strong>, the Chinese ride-hailing company, has already raised tens of billions of dollars from the private market. Now it&#8217;s ready to tap the public one.</p>
<p>The company filed for an IPO, and digging a bit into the filing here&#8217;s what we find. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/despite-flat-growth-ride-hailing-colossus-didis-us-ipo-could-reach-70b/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Alex Wilhelm</a> notes, the S-1 shows how quickly and painfully COVID-19 blunted Didi&#8217;s global operations. As COVID-19 numbers have fallen and economies have opened back up, Didi has settled back to late-2019 gross transaction volume numbers.</p>
<p>Didi manage a GTV recovery in China. However, its aggregate numbers are flatter, and recent quarterly trends are not incredibly attractive. And taking a historical look at its financial figures, it&#8217;s clear that Didi has never generated positive operating income. The company&#8217;s revenues in Q1 2021 were smaller than its Q3 and Q4 2020 numbers, for example.</p>
<p>A few other items of note, the company reported a $1.7 billion loss on $21.6 billion in revenue for 2020. And some of its largest stakeholders are SoftBank with 21.5%, Uber with 12/5% and Tencent with 6.8%.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Branch Insurance</strong>, a startup offering bundled home and auto insurance, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/branch-raises-50m-to-offer-bundled-auto-home-insurance-via-an-api/">$50 million in a Series B funding round</a> led by Anthemis Group. Acrew, Cherry Creek Holdings and existing backers Greycroft, HSCM Bermuda, American Family Ventures, SignalFire, SCOR P&amp;C Ventures, Foundation Capital and Tower IV also participated in the round. The startup has raised $82.5 million in total funding since its inception in 2017.</p>
<p>A couple of <strong>Chinese grocery delivery companies</strong> filed for IPOs this week. First up is <strong>Dingdong</strong>, which previously raised more than $400 million from investors including General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital China, Starquest China, Qiming Venture Partners, Bertelsmann Asia Investments and General Atlantic. The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1854545/000119312521185539/d121652df1.htm">regulatory filing</a> shows that Digndong had a net loss of $485 million on $1.73 billion in revenue last year. Then there&#8217;s <strong>Missfresh</strong>, which has raised more than $2 billion from investors, including a fund under state-backed China International Capital Corporation, ICBC International Securities, Tencent, Abu Dhabi Capital Group, Tiger Global and a fund managed by the government of Changshu county. Missfresh reported a $252 million net loss on $956 million in revenue in 2020, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1851682/000119312521185472/d123092df1.htm#rom123092_18">according to the filing</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Circulor</strong>, a supply chain traceability and CO2 tracking company, raised $14 million in a Series A funding round. The Westly Group led the round, with participation by Salesforce Ventures, BHP Ventures, Future Positive Capital, 24Haymarket and Sky Ocean Ventures, alongside existing investors in the company. Circulor&#8217;s product is used by Volvo Cars to trace the cobalt used in its all-electric XC40 Recharge and by Polestar to assess the environmental and human rights risks of sourcing cobalt, lithium, nickel, lithium and mica for its electric cars.</p>
<p><strong>Embraer&#8217;s</strong> electric vehicle takeoff and landing unit Eve Urban Air Mobility is in talks to merge with special purpose acquisition company Zanite Acquisition Corp. The deal would value the combined entity at about $2 billion, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/embraer-s-eve-said-in-2-billion-merger-talks-with-zanite-spac?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hesai</strong>, a Shanghai-based lidar maker founded in 2014, raised more than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/china-lidar-hesai-300-million-funding/">$300 million in a Series D funding round</a> led by GL Ventures, the venture capital arm of private equity firm Hillhouse Capital, smartphone maker Xiaomi, on-demand services giant Meituan and CPE, the private equity platform of Citic. Huatai International Private Equity Fund, the USD investment arm of Huatai Securities, Lightspeed China Partners and Lightspeed Venture Capital as well as Qiming Venture Partners, also participated.</p>

<p>Last week, I shared the <strong>Waymo One</strong> app information courtesy of Sensor Tower, the mobile app market intelligence firm. There are not many other AV developers that have launched ride-hailing apps, although that might be changing.</p>
<p>Argo AI and Zoox have job listings for Android software engineers. Zoox is looking for an iOS engineer as well.</p>
<p>Sensor Tower did note to TechCrunch that Pony.ai has launched a few apps. PonyPilot+ has hit about 6,000 installs on China&#8217;s App Store. PonyPilot has seen about 2,000 in the U.S., most of which happened in the first three months of 2020, according to Sensor Tower. The company also has two apps available in Russia called PonyExpress+, which has seen about 1,500 installs, and PonyFleetGO. There are no download estimates for PonyFleetGo.</p>
<p>AutoX also has an app available, AutoX Food Delivery, which has reached about 200 installs in the United States.</p>

<p><strong>President Joe Biden</strong> has set his sights on hardening the country&#8217;s supply chains for essential goods and critical minerals. The White House said on June 8 it had created a task force aimed at addressing supply chain bottlenecks, including in semiconductors and critical minerals used in EV batteries.</p>
<p>Biden wants to get many more Americans driving electric vehicles, but the majority of key critical minerals in batteries, like lithium and graphite, are mined and processed abroad. As part of a Fact Sheet also released on June 8, Biden&#8217;s administration said it would create a task force to identify opportunities to produce minerals domestically &#8212; something that until now has kicked up a lot of controversy amongst environmental groups.</p>
<p>The <strong>U.S.</strong> <strong>Department of Energy</strong> released a <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/FCAB%20National%20Blueprint%20Lithium%20Batteries%200621_0.pdf">blueprint for lithium batteries</a> through 2030 that calls for eliminating two key minerals from batteries &#8212; cobalt and nickel &#8212; as a way of fortifying the supply chain. The DOE says it will support R&amp;D efforts to develop batteries without these minerals, which are largely found in places like the Democratic Republic of Congo or Indonesia, and are processed mainly in China. Scientific innovation is certainly one way to reduce America&#8217;s dependence on foreign adversaries for its batteries.</p>
<p>The <strong>House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee</strong> passed a sweeping $547 billion infrastructure package after a whopping 19 hours of debate (pour one out for the Congressional interns). The final vote was 38-26. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/the-station-aurora-gets-closer-to-a-spac-deal-spins-new-strategy-and-waymo-one-app-numbers/">As a reminder</a>, the INVEST in America Act would largely fund improvements to roads, bridges and passenger rail, but earmarks $4 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and around $4 billion to invest in zero-emission transit vehicles.</p>
<p>Just two Republicans on the committee voted in favor of the bill. The <a href="https://transportation.house.gov/invest-in-america">INVEST in America Act</a> is still very, very far from becoming law: It now advances to the full House for further debate, then would be sent to the Senate for further rehashing, etcetera etcetera&#8230; nevertheless, it&#8217;s an encouraging sign, especially as legislators managed to work out over 200 proposed amendments to the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong> is changing its tune on proposed tailpipe emission rules in California. The country&#8217;s largest automaker had previously opposed California&#8217;s tough emissions limits for passenger vehicles, which it reached in concert with five other automakers: Ford, Honda Motor Company, Volkswagen AG, Volvo and BMW. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/us/politics/gm-biden-fuel-economy-rules.html">New York Times reported</a> that GM CEO Mary Barra said in a Wednesday letter to EPA Administrator Michael Regan that &#8220;GM supports the emissions reduction goals of California through model year &#8217;26,&#8221; and that, &#8220;the auto industry is embarking upon a profound transition as we do our part to achieve the country&#8217;s climate commitments.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, she said that GM &#8220;believes that the same environmental benefits can and should be achieved through a high-volume electric vehicle pathway.&#8221; That is to say, she said the best way to reduce emissions is to boost EV sales through government incentives, rebates and other programs.</p>
<p>The EPA will be publishing its proposed tailpipe emissions reductions and fuel economy standards in July. Regan has been meeting with major OEMs, including GM, in advance of that release.</p>

<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s Aria Alamalhodaei dug into the aspirations of the burgeoning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/the-air-taxi-market-prepares-to-take-flight/">electric vertical take-off and landing industry</a>. The upshot: The industry is bullish on its future, a view perhaps augmented by the string of partnership deals, SPACs, private funding and newly achieved unicorn statuses.</p>
<p>However, as in any disruptive industry, the forecast may be cloudier than the rosy picture painted by passionate founders and investors. A quick peek at comments and posts on LinkedIn reveals squabbles among industry insiders and analysts about when this emerging technology will truly take off and which companies will come out ahead. Other disagreements have higher stakes. Wisk Aero filed a lawsuit against Archer Aviation alleging trade secret misappropriation. Meanwhile, valuations for companies that have no revenue yet to speak of &#8212; and may not for the foreseeable future &#8212; are skyrocketing.</p>
<p>Electric air mobility is gaining elevation. But there&#8217;s going to be some turbulence ahead. This is an Extra Crunch article, which means it requires a subscription. Happy reading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Campos has struggled with depression since she was eight years old. Over the years, she’s tried all sorts of therapies &#8212; from behavioral to pharmacotherapy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, when Campos was in her early 20s, she learned to program and created a system to help manage her mental health. It started as a personal project, but as she talked to more people, Campos realized that many others might benefit from the system as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So she built an application to provide access to mental health tools for Spanish-speaking people and began testing it with a small group. At first, Campos herself was her own chatbot, texting with users who were tired of dealing with depression.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the month, I was pretending I was an app, and would send these people a list of activities they had to complete during the day, such as writing in a gratitude journal, and then asking them how those activities made them feel,” Campos recalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her thinking was that sometimes with depression and anxiety comes “a lot of avoidance,” where people resist potential treatment out of fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results from her small experiment were encouraging. So, Campos set out to conduct a bigger sample of experiments, and raised about $10,000 via a crowdfunding campaign. With that money, she hired a developer to build a chatbot for her app, which was mostly being used via Facebook Messenger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then an earthquake hit Mexico City and that developer lost everything &#8212; including his home and computer &#8212; and had to relocate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was left with nothing,” Campos says. But that developer introduced her to another, who disappeared with his payment, and again, left Campos, “with nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I realized at the beginning of 2019, I was going to have to do this by myself,” Campos said. So she used a site that she described as a “Wix for chatbots,” and created one herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After experimenting with the app with a sample of 700 people, Campos was even more encouraged and raised an angel round of funding for <a href="https://yana.com.mx/">Yana</a>, the startup behind her app. (Yana is an acronym for “You Are Not Alone.”) By early 2020, with just three months of runway left, she pivoted to create an app with chatbot integration that wasn’t just limited to use via Facebook Messenger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campos ended up launching the app more broadly during the same week that her city in Mexico went into quarantine.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165383" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165383" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2165383 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rutina.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rutina.jpg 1865w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rutina.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rutina.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rutina.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rutina.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rutina.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rutina.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165383" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yana</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, she said, she saw “normal, steady growth.” But then on October 10, 2020, Apple’s App Store highlighted Yana for International Mental Health Day, and the response was overwhelming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was also my birthday so I was at a spa in a nearby town, relaxing, when I started hearing my cell phone go crazy,” Campos recalls. “Everything went nuts. I had to go back to Mexico City because our servers were exploding since they were not used to having that kind of volume.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of that exposure, Yana went from having around 80,000 users to reaching 1 million users two weeks later. Soon after that, Google highlighted the app as one of best for personal growth in 2020, and that too led to another spike in users. Today, Yana is about to hit the 5 million-user mark and is also announcing it has raised $1.5 million in funding led by Mexico’s ALLVP, which has also invested in the likes of Cornershop, Flink and Nuvocargo.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Funding for mental health-focused startups rises in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/funding-for-mental-health-focused-startups-rises-in-2020/embed/#?secret=5wfWdQ1mdn" data-secret="5wfWdQ1mdn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the pandemic hit last year, six of Yana’s nine-person team decided to quarantine together in a “startup house” in Cancun to focus on building the company. Earlier this year, the company had raised $315,000 from investors such as 500 Startups, Magma and Hustle Fund. The company had pitched ALLVP, which was intrigued but wanted to wait until it could write a bigger check. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That time is now, and Yana is now among the top three downloaded apps in Mexico and 12 countries, including Spain, Chile, Ecuador and Venezuela.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its new capital, Yana is planning to “move away from the depression/anxiety narrative,” according to Campos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to compete in the wellness space,” she told TechCrunch. “A lot of people were looking for us to deal with crises such as a breakup or a loss but then they didn’t always see a necessity to keep using Yana for longer than the crisis lasted.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of those people would download the app again months later when hit with another crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t want to be that app anymore,” Campos said. “We want to focus on whole wellness and mental health and transmit something that needs to be built every single day, just like we do with exercise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, Yana aims to help people with their mental health not just during a crisis but with activities they can do on a daily basis, including a gratitude journal, a mood tracker and meditation &#8212; “things that prevent depression and anxiety,” Campos said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to be a vitamin for our soul, and keeping people mentally healthy on an ongoing basis,” she said. “We also want to include a community inside our application.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ALLVP’s Federico Antoni is enthusiastic about the startup’s potential. He first met Campos when she was participating in an accelerator program in 2017, and then again recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm led Yana’s latest round because it “wanted to be on her team.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She [Campos] has turned into an amazing leader, and we realized her potential and strength,” he said. “Plus, Yana is an amazing product. When you download it, it’s almost like you can see a soul in there.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brazil is a country riven with economic contradictions. It has one of the largest and most profitable banking industries in Latin America, and is among the world’s most developed financial markets. Financial transactions that would take days to process in the United States through ACH happen instantaneously in Brazil. This sophistication, however, masks a backward state of affairs plagued by appalling customer service, exorbitant fees and lack of banking access for many.</p>
<p>The country’s financial system is volatile and often leaves its citizens with few or no alternatives. <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=58873">According to an HBS case study</a>, “in December 2018 the interest rate in Brazil for corporate loans was 52.3%, for consumer loans it was 120.0% and for credit card indebtedness it was 272.42%.” Those rates are many multiples higher compared to figures in neighboring countries.</p>
<p>Brazil’s banking system is a massive market, and one ill-served by incumbents. If someone could thread the needle of product development, strategy and political horse trading required to build a bank in a country where it is nearly impossible for foreigners to own or invest in a bank, it would be one of the great startup and economic success stories of this century.</p>
<p><b>Nubank</b> is on its way to realizing that objective. Its story is one of unmitigated success, even by the standards of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec1">our EC-1 series</a> on high-flying companies and their hard-learned lessons. Just last week, this Brazilian credit card and banking fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/">raised a $750 million round led by Berkshire Hathaway</a> at a $30 billion valuation, becoming one of the most valuable startups in the world. It has 40 million users across Brazil, as well as Mexico and Colombia.</p>
<p>Yet, it’s a startup with a CEO and co-founder who isn’t Brazilian, didn’t speak the local language of Portuguese, hadn’t started a company before, and didn’t really know a lot about banking to begin with. This is a story of how raw execution, a “faster, faster” mentality and a fanaticism for making customer experience as enjoyable as a trip to Disney World can completely change the history of an industry — and country — forever.</p>
<p>Our lead writer for this EC-1 is <b>Marcella McCarthy</b>. McCarthy, who spent significant time in Brazil growing up and is trilingual in English, Spanish and Portuguese, has been covering the LatAm and Miami ecosystems for TechCrunch with an eye to the disruption underway in these interconnected regions. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b>, and illustrations were drawn by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>Nubank had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. McCarthy has no financial ties to Nubank or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For most startups, the hardest early challenge is identifying a market and a product to serve it. That wasn’t the case for Nubank CEO David Velez, who understood the massive potential for success if he could break into Latin America’s most valuable economy with even a moderately modern banking offering.</p>
<p>Instead, the challenge was how to rebuild the concept of a bank in a country where banking is widely hated, all while the incumbents heavily entrenched with the state worked to block every move.</p>
<p>Nubank knew its market and geography, and through tenacious fundraising, inventive marketing and product development, and a series of contrarian hires, Velez and his team stripped bare the morass of Brazilian banking to build one of the world’s great fintech companies.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The challenge was how to rebuild the concept of a bank in a country where banking is widely hated, all while the incumbents heavily entrenched with the state worked to block every move.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In the first part of this EC-1, I’ll look at how Velez brought his skills and experience to bear on this market, how Nubank was founded in 2013, and how the team brought a Californian rather than Brazilian vibe to their first office on — no joke — California Street, in a neighborhood called Brooklin in the city of São Paulo.</p>
<h2>The makings of an entrepreneur</h2>
<p>The idea of being his own boss was ingrained in Velez from his earliest days in Colombia, where he grew up in an entrepreneurial family, with a father who owned a button factory. “I heard from my dad over and over again that you need to start your own company,” Velez said.</p>
<p>But years would pass and Velez still had no idea what he wanted to do. To “kill time,” and also to surround himself with entrepreneurial energy, Velez attended Stanford University — partially financed by the sale of some livestock — and then worked as an analyst at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley before switching to venture capital at General Atlantic and Sequoia.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[David Velez needed to fill two key co-founding roles to begin building Nubank — he needed a CTO to lead the engineering side of the business, as Velez didn’t have an engineering background.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1-origin/">we mentioned in part 1 of this EC-1</a>, David Velez had two key co-founding roles he needed to fill to get started building Nubank. For one, he needed a CTO to lead the engineering side of the business, as Velez didn’t have an engineering background.</p>
<p>Edward Wible, an American computer science graduate who spent most of his career in private equity, would take that responsibility. He didn’t bring years of coding experience, but he had qualities that Velez considered more important: A strong belief in the potential of the product and an equally intense commitment to working on it.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Given the occasionally hostile reaction of most incumbent banks to their customers in Brazil, Nubank’s starkly contrasting openness and transparency has garnered a huge following.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That left an even more important role to fill — one that was much harder to define. This other co-founder would need to blend knowledge of the Brazilian market and local savvy with expertise in banking, all while embodying a Silicon Valley ethos of focusing on customers. This person would also have to work in São Paulo for minimal wages out of a small office with just one bathroom, all in the belief that their equity (both stock and sweat) would one day be worth it.</p>
<p>Velez would eventually stumble upon Cristina Junqueira, who was qualified to do all this, and much, much more.</p>
<p>“Once someone said I was the glue of the operation, and that someone else was the brains. And I said, ‘No, I’m the glue <i>and</i> the brains, and I bet my brain is even better than his,”’ Junqueira said.</p>
<p>Junqueira didn’t just lead Nubank’s drive into the Brazilian market, she also upended age-old notions of what it means to be a 21st-century bank. Her inspiration was nothing short of Disney, and her mission was to create a bank as popular as the magical kingdom itself.</p>
<p>A bank. As popular as Disney. Sounds like a fairy tale, frankly.</p>
<h2>Raised to be a doer</h2>
<p>Unlike her co-founders Velez and Wible, Junqueira grew up in Nubank’s home market of Brazil. The eldest of four sisters, she remembers her parents — both dentists — always assiduously working to maintain their practice.</p>
<p>Their work ethic trickled down, but so did responsibility. As the oldest at home, she was forced to grow up quickly and take on responsibilities from an early age. “I remember being 11 years old and doing grocery shopping for the month,” she said. “I did everything very young.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s easy to assume the name Nubank refers to “new bank,” but that’s not what the founders were going for. The word “nu” in Portuguese means “naked,” and Velez wanted the name to reflect his vision.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we saw in parts 1 and 2 of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/nubank-ec1/">this EC-1</a>, by mid-2013, Nubank CEO David Velez had most of what he needed to get started. He’d brought on two co-founders, assembled ambitious engineering and operations teams, raised $2 million in seed funding from Sequoia and Kaszek, rented a tiny office in São Paulo, and was armed with a mission to deliver the kind of banking services that customers in a market as large and lucrative as Brazil’s should expect.</p>
<p>Despite being named Nubank, however, the startup couldn’t actually <i>be</i> a bank: Brazil’s laws made it illegal at the time for a foreigner-run company to operate a bank. That restriction required the team to develop an inventive product strategy to find a foothold in the market while they waited for a license directly from the country’s president.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Nubank was so adamant about differentiating itself from other banks that it chose Barney purple for its brand color and first credit card.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Nubank therefore pursued a credit card as its first offering, but it had to race against a clock counting quickly down to zero. At the time, Brazil didn’t have ownership restrictions on this product segment like it did with banking, but new rules were coming into force in just a few months in May 2014 that would block a company like Nubank from launching.</p>
<p>The company needed to execute rapidly over the next eight months if it wanted to be grandfathered into the existing regulations. The speed of operations was frantic to say the least, and the company would go on to work even faster, ultimately propelling itself into the stratosphere of fintech startups.</p>
<h2>Full faith in credit</h2>
<p>It’s easy to assume that the name Nubank refers to “new bank,” but that’s not really what the founders were going for. The word “nu” in Portuguese means “naked,” and Velez and his team wanted the name to reflect their vision: To build a 21st-Century bank without any of the shackles imposed by the traditional banks in Brazil.</p>
<p>The team wanted to offer services to as many people as possible, as there is a huge wealth gap in Brazil, where the minimum wage is around $200 a month.</p>
<p>Launching with just a credit card was both a strategic and practical business decision. Credit cards were widely used in the country, and everyone understood how they worked. Additionally, you could only use credit cards to shop online in Brazil, because debit cards weren’t accepted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nubank’s first office, on California Street in the Brooklin neighborhood of São Paulo, makes for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1-origin/">a great beginning to the company’s story</a>. It wasn’t a Silicon Valley garage, but this tiny, one-bathroom rented house, where 30 people <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1-scaling/">worked insane hours to push out the company’s debut credit card</a>, lends just as well to an image of entrepreneurial spirit and drive.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As Nubank continues to make international waves, more and more VC investors are taking a look at the Brazilian ecosystem and could potentially fund other upstarts in the years to come.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But as Nubank’s story continued, the team eventually had to move out of that early office, and the next several offices, too. Eventually Nubank had to relocate to an eight-story building in São Paulo, which houses a large part of the company’s now 3,000-person team.</p>
<p>The startup reached decacorn status in far less than a decade, and it is growing faster than ever. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/fintech-darling-nubank-raises-blockbuster-400m-series-g-at-25b-valuation/">When I interviewed CEO David Velez back in January</a> to discuss Nubank’s $400 million Series G, he said, “We’ve gone from 12 million customers in 2019 to 34 million solely based on word of mouth.” By September last year, the company was onboarding 41,000 new customers per day.</p>
<p>In the five months since our interview, Nubank has managed to rope in a whopping 6 million customers to reach 40 million. It’s now valued at $30 billion.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164888" style="width: 4538px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164888" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2164888 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1233359062.jpg" alt="" width="4528" height="2888" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1233359062.jpg 4528w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1233359062.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1233359062.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1233359062.jpg?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1233359062.jpg?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1233359062.jpg?resize=1536,980 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1233359062.jpg?resize=2048,1306 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1233359062.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4528px) 100vw, 4528px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164888" class="wp-caption-text">Nubank&#8217;s present day headquarters in São Paulo, Brazil. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> NELSON ALMEIDA/AFP / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Getting there hasn’t been easy. The company’s three co-founders, Velez, Edward Wible and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1-cofounder/">Cristina Junqueira</a>, had to make key strategic decisions about how to scale themselves to retain the company’s lead in the neobanking market. That lead is getting tougher to sustain every day. Nubank’s proliferating offerings and broader geographical remit has painted a massive target on its back, and a wide number of competitors have cropped up to run on the paths it pioneered.</p>
<p>Like most Disney films, a fairy-tale ending seems in order, but it’ll take a few more rotations of the film wheel to get to the ending.</p>
<h2>Early mistakes and ingredients for success</h2>
<p>For the co-founding trio, it became increasingly clear that Nubank’s growing scale demanded critical strategic decisions on how to bring order to the company.</p>
<p>By 2018, the company had thousands of employees, millions of customers, and they still didn’t have a head of HR. Growth until then had been somewhat unstructured. According to Junqueira, waiting so long to hire a head of HR was one of their early mistakes, because it stunted their ability to grow. “[Good] people continue to be our biggest bottleneck,” she says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When they were released in 2019, Powerbeats Pro were standouts. Two-plus years later, they remain one of the more well-rounded wireless earbuds on the market. There are things I would change, of course. Even in 2019, that charging case was ridiculously large. In 2021, the original case is all the more absurd. And, of course, noise-canceling has become nearly standardized among mid-tier buds.</p>
<p>After weeks of rumors and leaks (including a very public cameo on the ears of one of <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/beats_studio_buds_spotted_in_the_ears_of_lebron_james-news-49327.php">the world’s most famous athletes</a>), Beats’ latest take on the space is finally official. Meet the Beats Studio Pro. They are not, as the company will be quick to tell you, a Powerbeats Pro replacement. Those are sticking around (which isn’t to say they won’t be getting their own upgrade).</p>
<p>Beats may be Apple-owned, but in most respects, the brand operates as it has. It was a wildly successful brand well before Apple got its hands on it, after all. So the company’s opted not to fix what’s clearly not broken. And while technology is clearly shared between the two camps (the H1 chip on the Powerbeats, example), it maintains a line between its self-branded audio offerings (AirPods, et al.) and the Beats line. There’s a reason Beats never really shows up at Apple events, in spite of having a big announcement the following week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Compared to AirPods, the Beats lines can get a bit convoluted. Effectively the new Studio Beats are a fully wireless earbud line from the company, borrowing a name from its premium over-ear line. But the new buds are actually significantly more compact than Powerbeats Pro, both in terms of the case and the buds themselves. Also notable &#8212; and frankly a bit surprising &#8212; is the pricing.</p>
<p>At $150, the Studio Buds are a fair bit cheaper than the two-year-old Powerbeats Pro, which currently go for between $160 and $200 online. Keep in mind, that’s down from a launch price of $250. That’s also $50 less than the AirPods and $20 less than the Galaxy Buds. It’s a nice price for what you’re getting here &#8212; though maybe my standards have shifted a bit, just coming off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/sony-sets-a-new-standard-with-the-wf-1000xm4-earbuds/">of a review of the $280 Sony WF-1000XM4</a>.</p>
<p>Those Sonys are in a class of their own, of course. It’s much fairer for all parties concerned to pit them against other midrange headphones. And by that metric, they perform pretty well. The biggest addition here is active noise canceling &#8212; keep in mind, it was far from standard when the Powerbeats Pro were announced. These days, however, it feels like a glaring omission at this price range (Google, I’m looking at you).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165106" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165106" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2165106" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165106" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Another interesting top-level feature is fast pairing for both iOS and Android, making the Studio Beats one of the first products to walk that line. Funny that it comes from an Apple product, but again, the company seems be afforded at least a little bit of freedom on that front. It’s a small thing &#8212; after all, many people will only use the iOS/Android one-touch pairing once, but there’s a lot to be said for making the product as accessible to as many potential customers as possible.</p>

<p>I like the new streamlined design of the buds. As mentioned above, the new case is a fraction of the size of the Powerbeats. Still, the Studio Buds have the same stated battery life, with eight hours on the headphones and 24 total, when you factor in the case. That’s a healthy bit of life, which is quickly becoming the standard these days. There’s a USB-C port on the bottom (a move away from the Apple-only Lightning), which will give you an hour of playback time on a five-minute charge.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165127" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165127" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2165127" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165127" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The case is wider and a bit thicker than the AirPods Pro, but is still easily pocketed. It has a bit of a cheap plasticky feel to it, but the matte finish is a nice touch. The branding is the standard Beats level of loud, with a big, bold white “b” set against the black. The buds, too, sport the logo, which can pass for a “9” or a “6” depending on positioning. The lid has a snap to it, and the magnets on the buds snap nicely in place &#8212; though, as with the Powerbeats, it can take a little finagling to get them into the proper position.</p>
<p>The buds are fairly compact, as well. The earhooks are gone. That’s something of a mixed bag, honestly. I didn’t think I would love the Powerbeats Pros earhooks, but as someone who experiences some ear pain with a lot of different bud designs, I’ve found them to be among the most comfortable options, transferring the load bearing to the top of the ear.</p>
<p>The Studio Buds are fairly comfortable, and I was able to work out in them (IPX4 rating FTW), though I did have some trouble keeping them in place on occasion. That’s certainly never been a problem with the Powerbeats. If you really don’t want them to move, I recommend applying a bit of pressure to really corkscrew them in place.</p>
<p>One of the design choices I really appreciate that Beats brought back is the physical button. Powerbeats had them and they&#8217;re back here on the end of the Studio Buds. It’s got a nice little click to it that I prefer to purely touch-based buttons. A single click will Play/Pause and a long click will turn ANC on and off.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165107" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165107" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2165107" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165107" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The ANC is a nice addition, of course. It does a decent job with ambient noise, but can’t really touch what you’ll find on higher-end systems. The sound quality, too, has come a ways in the last couple of years. Beats has refined things with a pair of 8.2mm drivers that offer solid sound at their price point. These aren’t sitting-around-and-enjoy-the-finer-points-of-classical-sonata-or-experimental-jazz-record buds; they are, however, solid, listen-to-music-or-a-podcast-while-going-about-your-life headphones.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to like about the buds, and with little question, they’re a much better deal in 2021 than the Powerbeats Pro, even if they don’t feel as groundbreaking as their predecessors did at launch.</p>
<p>The new Beats Studio Buds are up for preorder today and start shipping June 24.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Depending on whom you ask, the digital advertising industry is either counting down the minutes to doomsday or entering an exciting new era for engaging with consumers. Apple’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">iOS 14.5 update</a> — which effectively ends automatic opt-ins to online tracking and data collection — is finally at hand, and Google aims to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">phase out third-party cookies</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">next year</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The future could see a wave of innovations that help consumers opt out of data collection. So it’s up to the advertising industry to find ways to get these educated, empowered consumers to opt back in.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Whether these changes set digital advertisers back 15 years or pave the way to more fruitful interactions with customers remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: This is big. Allowing users to decide what browsing data can be collected, by whom and under what circumstances is a move that will change the direction of the advertising industry.</p>
<p>But the new direction does not have to lead digital marketers to oblivion, failure or poverty. In fact, it’s quite the opposite.</p>
<p>With a few changes to short-term strategy — and a longer-term plan that takes into account the fact that people are awakening to the value of their online data — advertisers can form a new type of relationship with consumers. It can be built upon trust and open exchange of value.</p>
<p>It’s up to advertisers to grasp, accept and reap the benefits of the upcoming changes. Because with iOS 14.5, cookie deprecation, and regulations like GDPR and CCPA, one era is ending and a new one is beginning. There’s a new seat at the table in the great bargaining session between advertisers and technology giants. It’s occupied — for the first time — by the user.</p>
<h2>The short-term strategy</h2>
<p>Advertisers can weather big changes in the short term by implementing several steps.</p>
<p>For starters, developers should update their application SDKs to support Apple’s new<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork"> SKAdNetwork solution</a> and then verify attribution across each channel. For example, after SDK updates, verify that the number of installs reported from your Facebook Ads matches up to the number of installs you’re seeing reported in the App Store developer console or your preferred analytics provider.</p>

<hr />
<p>This can become more complicated the more channels you’re on, but it is important to verify all of your advertising channels’ reporting. Also important is setting your<a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/blog/skadnetwork-conversion-value-ios14/"> conversion value</a>, because this is the key to getting granular information on your ad campaigns and ensuring the right entity controls the flow of information.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beleaguered electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors’ stock shares have taken another hit after the company said Monday that CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez have resigned, just a few weeks after Burns was reassuring investors of the company&#8217;s bright future.</p>
<p>Lordstown Motors’ Lead Independent Director Angela Strand was appointed executive chairwoman to oversee the transition until a permanent CEO is found. Becky Roof will serve as interim CFO. Roof has acted as interim CFO at a number of other companies, including Saks Fifth Avenue and Eastman Kodak.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded as an offshoot of former CEO Burns’ other company, Workhorse Group, announced less than stellar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">first quarter results</a> in May, including news that production volumes would likely be half &#8212; from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000 &#8212; should the company not identify more funding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The EV startup is one of a growing suite of companies in the transportation space that have gone public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/lordstown-motors-becomes-latest-ev-automaker-to-use-a-spac-to-go-public/">The deal</a>, announced last August, gave Lordstown around $675 million in gross proceeds and a market value of $1.6 billion.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lordstown Motors slashes production forecast for its electric pickup&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/embed/#?secret=GbkKKostuJ" data-secret="GbkKKostuJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Yet, less than a year after the deal was announced, Lordstown told the <a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/f0d0d2f4-d298-4576-9344-61f82e345e19">SEC in a filing</a> that it does not have enough capital to manufacture and deliver the electric pickup, dubbed &#8212; note the irony &#8212; &#8220;Endurance.&#8221; “The Company believes that its current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund commercial scale production and the launch of sale of such vehicles,” the filing said. “These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.”</p>
<p>While Burns and Rodriguez are the most prominent corporate figures in the shakeup, Lordstown also announced other changes to its executive team Monday. Jane Ritson-Parsons, who was acting as Lordstown Motors interim chief brand officer, was promoted to chief operating officer; and former head of investor relations Carter Driscoll was promoted to vice president, Corporate Development, Capital Markets and Investor Relations.</p>
<p>Lordstown on Monday also released the results of a report conducted by a special internal committee amidst <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/lordstown-motors-accused-of-faking-ev-truck-orders-by-short-seller-firm-hindenburg-research/">accusations</a> that the company was faking preorders of its debut electric pickup, in a report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research. Lordstowns’ independent inquiry is separate to an ongoing investigation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the allegations.</p>
<p>While the report “is, in significant respects, false and misleading,” the committee said that the investigation did identify some inaccuracies regarding some statements about the preorders. In particular, some entities that made a large number of preorders made commitments that were not firm enough to be included in the preorder disclosures. Overall, the special committees’ findings overwhelmingly reject Hindenburgs’ accusations against the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of startups (e.g. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/18/veriff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/berbix-raises-9m-for-its-identity-verification-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/15/passbase-is-building-a-full-stack-identity-engine-with-privacy-baked-in/">here</a> and <a href="https://identityreview.com/vouched-raises-3-million-aims-to-be-the-stripe-for-id-verification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) have fashioned themselves as the &#8220;Stripe for identity verification&#8221;, providing an easy way for developers to integrate ID authentication into a platform. Today, Stripe is stepping in to fill that need itself: The company is launching a new product called Stripe Identity &#8212; a self-serve tool that companies can use to verify user identities, with Stripe managing the customer data in an encrypted format, using computer vision and machine learning to &#8220;read&#8221; and match up government IDs with live selfies.</p>
<p>Stripe says the service works in as little as 15 seconds.</p>
<p>The service is launching in beta starting today in 30 countries, the company said, but in the meantime, it&#8217;s already quietly been in use by select partners. They include <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623753371046000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEecyu-1jiB48IV2emXu2-MBjUDmQ">Discord</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (as part of its <a href="https://blog.discord.com/the-future-of-bots-on-discord-4e6e050ab52e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ID verification feature</a>); </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.peerspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.peerspace.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623753371046000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcaiCTvF1gfwSeJDASMCUTat2NnQ">Peerspace</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (which runs ID verification when onboarding users and merchants); </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://goshippo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://goshippo.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623753371046000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHojVeHlgGI9jYomr3bHykCB9QNtA">Shippo</a> (when when it identifies high-risk users and asks them to verify themselves); and other unnamed customers using it to prevent account takeovers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Developers can <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=%2Fidentity%2Fapplication" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go here</a> to request access, and it sounds like Stripe will be talking more about the service in general during <a href="https://sessions.stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe Sessions</a>, its developer conference, later this week.</span></p>
<p>“Businesses have been asking us for an easy and fast way to verify identities online. Stripe Identity offers them just that,” said Rob Daly, head of Engineering for Stripe Identity. “Now, any internet business — from a five-person startup to a multinational enterprise — can begin securely verifying the identities of their users in a matter of minutes, not weeks or months.”</p>
<p>If you look at the list of early users, something significant stands out: Identity is another example of how Stripe is extending its reach as a powerhouse provider of services to businesses that extend well beyond payments.</p>
<p>Of course, payments remains at the heart of Stripe, and identity verification definitely has a connection to that &#8212; it can help with preventing e-commerce fraud, for starters &#8212; but as you can see, ID authentication also covers a number of other use cases, such as in helping prevent account takeovers, or to verify someone&#8217;s age, or to comply with other &#8220;know your customer&#8221; regulations, or to stamp out bots and trolls: no payments necessary. For this reason, Stripe&#8217;s confirmed that you don&#8217;t have to be an existing Stripe customer in order to use Stripe Identity.</p>
<p>Identity verification has become an important and widely-used component of the process of enabling online interactions, whether monetary or otherwise. And it has something in common with payments that makes it a ripe candidate for building as an API-enabled service: both are complex to build, requiring the integration of a number of disparate technologies and third-party data providers. Since building something like that is not likely the core competency of the companies that require ID verification, that leaves the door open for third-party companies to build that tech and provide it as a service.</p>
<p>Stripe is far from being the only one working in this field: others include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jumio-raises-150m-as-its-all-in-one-id-authentication-platform-crosses-300m-verified-identities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jumio</a> (which raised a big round earlier this year); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/onfidos-husayn-kassai-steps-back-brings-in-new-ceo-ahead-of-a-planned-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onfido</a> (reportedly planning an IPO); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/18/veriff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veriff</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/berbix-raises-9m-for-its-identity-verification-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berbix</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/15/passbase-is-building-a-full-stack-identity-engine-with-privacy-baked-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passbase</a> and more.</p>
<p>In the case of Stripe, the company is offering customers two ways to use Stripe Identity. Like Stripe&#8217;s payments product, it can be integrated into a checkout or other workflow by way of some lines of code. But it can also be offered as a service outside of that, by way of a verification link issued just around suspicious transactions or other users that are identified as high-risk.</p>
<p>While Stripe has made a number of acquisitions to expand its technology and services &#8212; last week&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/payments-giant-stripe-launches-stripe-tax-to-integrate-sales-tax-calculations-for-30-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of Stripe Tax</a>, for example, complemented its acquisition of Tax Jar earlier this year &#8212; Stripe Identity was built in-house, the company says, and has been in use for the better part of 10 years by the company to verify merchants as part of its own onboarding and anti-fraud checks.</p>

<p>“We know from experience how much work it takes to build a rigorous and secure system for global identity verification,” said Delia Pawelke, head of Global Risk Strategy and Onboarding Policy at Stripe, in a statement. “With Stripe Identity, we’re making our advanced compliance infrastructure available to all of our users. For an online business, verifying someone’s identity is now as easy as accepting a payment.” In turning its internal tool into an external product, Stripe tweaked the verification service somewhat, providing more guidance for photo-taking for example.</p>
<p>Stripe said that fees will be charged &#8220;per transaction,&#8221; but didn&#8217;t disclose to TechCrunch what those fees will be. We&#8217;ll update this post as we learn more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In January, former Uber executive<a href="https://twitter.com/limeyerd?lang=en"> Liz Meyerdirk</a> announced that she took over as chief executive of <a href="https://thepillclub.com/">The Pill Club.</a> The company, which offers an online birth control prescription and delivery service to hundreds of thousands of women, had hit record revenues, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/as-it-hits-100-million-run-rate-the-pill-club-adds-former-uber-exec-liz-meyerdirk-as-ceo/">crossing $100 million in annual run rate</a> for the first time in its four-year history.</p>
<p>She found the bridge between ride-sharing to healthcare to be smoother than some might expect, saying that she focused on how to apply technology “to logistics for an everyday use case, [to know] how that simplifies your everyday life.”</p>
<p>Now, six months into her new job, Meyerdirk announced that her company has raised more capital to capitalize on the momentum in women’s health right now. The Pill Club announced today that it has raised a $41.9 million Series B extension round led by Base 10. Existing investors, including ACME, Base10, GV, Shasta Ventures and VMG, participated in the round, as well as new investors, including Uber’s Dara Khosrowshahi and Honey’s George Ruan and iGlobe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The extension round comes over two years after the company announced its initial Series B investment, a $51 million financing led by VMG Partners. After reportedly being valued at $250 million, the company declined to provide its latest valuation, other than saying that the extension was an up-round.</p>
<p>When a customer joins The Pill Club, they are given a medical questionnaire and a digital form to input personal information. The company gives them a sense of how much the service will cost, and if the price works, it connects them to a nurse either live or via text.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a happy case, you can see a nurse immediately,&#8221; she said. “Obviously if it&#8217;s midnight, we haven&#8217;t figured that out yet.” The nurse walks though different options, since, Meyerdirk added, “contraception is not one size fits all.”</p>
<p>Once a customer makes a decision, The Pill Club can then prescribe birth control through their own pharmacy, which will be delivered to their door within two or three days.</p>
<p>The Pill Club launched in 2016 with an at-home delivery service of birth control. Between 2016 and January 2021, it launched in 43 states plus the District of Columbia. It has added five states in the past six months, and plans to get to 50 states by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>The company makes money from medical visits, insurance reimbursement for prescription drugs and cash patients who aren&#8217;t covered by insurance.</p>
<p>The chief executive views a big part of its value proposition as embedding with existing insurance plans of its customers, including Medi-CAL and Family PACT. In the last three months, 16% of The Pill Clubs’ new patients were on Medicaid.</p>
<p>“You’ve got companies like Oscar [Health] that are reimagining health insurance, and you’ve got Ro, Hims and Hers, who are [taking] cash as a primary&#8230;way to serve&#8230;patients,” she said. “That’s fantastic for those who can afford it, but for us, because so much of our value system is around access to equity, we believe everyone should have the right to get access to birth control.”</p>
<p>The company believes that it has to work within the system of insurance to have true innovation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Telemedicine that ignores the reality of insurance is always going to have a limited piece of the pie,&#8221; a spokesperson from the company said said. &#8220;Cash-only systems simply aren’t a product built for a scale. A truly innovative healthcare platform exists within the realities of the system.&#8221;</p>

<h2>By women, for women</h2>
<p>Long-term, The Pill Club wants to replace the old model of going to a primary care provider for annual visits with ongoing care for women.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m generally healthy [but] I actually do have questions on mammograms&#8230;colonoscopies, or anything,” Meyerdirk said. “And being able to have a person other than my mom” to talk to that doesn’t require a trip to the doctor or urgent care is the gap that The Pill Club wants to fill.</p>
<p>“We think it&#8217;s too good to be true, when we actually get what we deserve,” Meyerdirk said when describing women’s health. Part of her goal going forward is to think bigger, beyond contraception, and figure out how The Pill Club could bring a digital refresh to other areas of women’s health.</p>
<p>In March, the company launched a dermatology pilot, and also expanded its 2020 period care pilot. A portion of the new capital is earmarked toward launching new services for its members.</p>

<p>The Pill Club also shared the diversity metrics of its 350-person staff as part of its announcement.</p>
<p>The Pill Club has 72% of employees identifying as women, and 28% of employees identifying as male. The executive leadership similarly sees predominantly women, with the ratio being 62.5% women and 37.5% male. As for racial diversity, the overall company identifies as 33% white, 19% Asian, 16% Hispanic or Latino and 14% Black or African American; 13% of employees declined to identify.</p>
<p>“We’re by women for women,” Meyerdirk said. “It’s very, very different when you’re by men, for women.” Her appointment came as The Pill Club’s founder and former chief executive officer Nick Chang stepped down from day to day operations. He didn’t take a board seat, but does still have shares in the company.</p>

<p>The wave of prescription, for-delivery medication is only getting bigger, with The Pill Club joined by startups such as Nurx and SimpleHealth, and bigger corporations such as<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/rx-walmart-plus-161333005.html"> Walmart </a>and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/amazon-pharmacy-free-prescription-delivery-for-prime-members.html">Amazon.</a></p>
<p>“The idea of creating more choice and flexibility across healthcare is long overdue,” she said. “Everyone deserves to have great options when they consider who can best address their daily needs.”</p>
