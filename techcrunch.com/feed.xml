										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The corporate philanthropy organization <a href="https://pledge1percent.org/">Pledge 1%</a> has, since its launch in 2014, asked founders to donate 1% of their companies&#8217; equity, product, or employees&#8217; time starting on their first day of business.</p>
<p>While the Bay Area-based outfit has found meaningful support from companies like DocuSign, Box, Twilio Okta and PagerDuty that pledged their resources ahead of becoming publicly traded companies, Pledge 1% is now sharpening its ask slightly, and asking a growing list of VCs to also help<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> unlock what it hopes will become billions of dollars in donations by nudging their companies to donate 1% of their outstanding equity ahead of a public offering. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a soft sell, as the organization&#8217;s CEO, Amy Lesnick, describes it. Her five-person team isn&#8217;t asking VCs to fork over any of their ownership in pre-IPO companies. Instead, Pledge 1% &#8212; originally cofounded by Salesforce founder Marc Benioff and Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar, among others &#8212; has enlisted VCs who are also &#8220;allies&#8221; of the organization to talk more systematically with founders whose companies are poised to go public within 12 to 18 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea is to help persuade these founding teams to set up corporate donor-advised funds so that when their companies&#8217; shares begin to trade, they already have a scheduled sale of those shares in place, or else plans to exercise (and donate) them after the company&#8217;s post-IPO lock-up period.</p>
<p>It is already happening somewhat organically, she adds. In the last year, Coinbase, UiPath, and Unity worked with Pledge 1% to set aside equity worth $1 billion.</p>
<p>Much of what Pledge 1% aims to do is simply to institutionalize the process, explains Lesnick. In her view, more companies want to weave philanthropy into their corporate culture, but it&#8217;s oftentimes challenging for a fast-moving startup to know how best to do that. Meanwhile, because VCs sits on so many boards, around 50 of them have come together to help Pledge 1% create a living playbook for founders and a step-by-step guide for companies to formalize equity pledges &#8212; along with a companion guide for CFOs and in-house attorneys.</p>
<p>Indeed, while right now, participating VCs will focus on nudging their maturing portfolio companies into thinking more about gifting, Lesnick says Pledge 1%&#8217;s aspiration is that all venture-backed companies will eventually set aside some equity for social impact during during every round of capital that they raise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully,&#8221; says Lesnick, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have a conversation in five years and have a good chuckle of how we even had to talk about [startups donating equity] because it will just be the norm.&#8221;</p>
<p>To get involved with the program as a VC or as a founder, as well as to see who has already signed up (including from Accel, Bessemer, Benchmark and Andreessen Horowitz), you can learn <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/pledge-1-launches-boardroom-allies-170000654.html">more here</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>If you want to catch up on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/numerous-popular-websites-are-facing-an-outage/">why the internet broke today</a>, we have the story that you need. I suppose it’s nice to read that story without it being Amazon’s fault for once. Or Cloudflare. Now that we think about it, there are a lot of failure points for the internet. Today&#8217;s culprit, Fastly, went down, taking lots of the internet with it. But Fastly’s stock? <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSLY/news/?guccounter=1">Up more than 9%</a> as I write to you. Figure that one out &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/expensify-ec1-business/"><strong>How bottom-up sales helped Expensify blaze the path for SaaS</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The final entry of TechCrunch’s deep dive into Expensify’s business ahead of its IPO is live today. <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna</a> focused her final installment of the five-part series on how the well-known expense software company managed the growth that is helping take it public.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/u-s-pc-shipments-soar-73-in-the-first-quarter-as-apple-falls-from-top-spot/">Personal computers are not dead</a>:</strong> Remember when the iPad came out and PCs were supposedly kaput? Well, they are not dead yet, not by a long shot. In fact, here in the U.S., PC sales shot up 73% in the first quarter compared to Q1 2020 numbers. And Apple lost its top slot to HP, in America at least.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/as-monday-com-targets-6b-ipo-valuation-zoom-and-salesforce-commit-150m/">Investors still love software more than life</a>: </strong>The market for high-growth technology companies is super hot at the moment, recent evidence for which was provided by Monday.com’s IPO pricing and expected investments from both Zoom and Salesforce. The Israeli company should debut on the U.S. markets later this week.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>We have three main blocks of startup news this morning. The first deals with consumer social applications, a category that goes through booms and busts in investor interest. The second is fintech-focused. And the third is a mix of funding rounds large and small to keep you up to date on the latest.</p>
<p><strong>2 Turntables and a camera phone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/amid-controversy-dispo-confirms-series-a-funding-high-profile-advisors-and-investors/"><strong>Dispo’s camera app confirms its Series A round</strong></a><strong>: </strong>After a hyped launch and the fallout regarding a member of co-founder David Dobrik’s “Vlog Squad,” the social camera application confirmed what we had heard earlier this year: that it raised a $20 million round. It will be interesting to see when the company accesses the private markets again, if it is able to.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/turntable-fm-competitor-tt-fm-launches-beta-app-for-ios-and-android/"><strong>Turntable spins up beta apps for Android and iOS</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Turntable, similar to Turntable.fm but not the same application, is launching early-release applications for iOS and Android. Don’t forget that Turntable raised half a million dollars earlier this year. Or that Turntable.fm, a competitor, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/call-it-a-comeback-turntable-fm-raises-7-5m/">back from the dead</a>. It’s very 2021 to have two startups in the market with effectively the same name.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>From the world of fintech:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/"><strong>Nubank raises $750M</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Brazilian neobank Nubank is now worth $30 billion and has an extra three-quarters of a billion dollars in the bank. Its new capital is a sort of extension to its known Series G, though at a higher valuation. Which means it’s a new round. But, hey, it’s 2021 and rules are over.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/airbase-raises-60m-as-the-corporate-spend-market-segments-matures/"><strong>Corporate spend startup Airbase raises $60M</strong></a><strong>:</strong> On the heels of competing startups Ramp and Brex raising huge new rounds, Airbase followed suit. The company is betting that its focus on midmarket companies and software will set it apart from competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our regular funding round digest:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/kafene-raises-14m-to-offer-buy-now-pay-later-to-the-subprime-consumer/">What happens when you cross easy consumer credit and subprime lending scores</a>? </strong>Kafene is going to find out. The company raised $14 million to build what one of its founders called “Affirm for the subprime.” So, buy-now-pay-later tooling, but for folks with poor, traditional credit scores. Expect the “Affirm but for rich people” to come out next.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/compose-ai-raises-2-1m-to-help-everyone-write-faster/">Compose.ai raises $2.1M to help you write super, really, very, amazingly fast</a>: </strong>The rise of GPT-3 has helped TechCrunch get hip to all sorts of neat language-focused startups. Compose.ai is similar, even if it uses its own AI. It wants to help everyone write faster, and, in time, offer companies the ability to have their own in-house language model to help keep everyone to the same tone [<em>ed note:</em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f62c.png" alt="😬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />].</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/relativity-space-launches-its-valuation-to-4-2b-with-650m-in-new-funding/"><strong>If you cross 3D-printing and rockets, you get to raise $650M</strong></a><strong>:</strong> That’s the lesson that Relatively Space taught us this week. It’s now worth $4.2 billion after its latest fundraise, and the company thinks that it can print its new heavy rocket in 60 days. That would shake things up.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/croatias-gideon-brothers-raises-31m-for-its-%E2%80%A83d-vision-enabled-autonomous-warehouse-robots/"><strong>And the world of warehouse robotics is far from complete</strong></a><strong>: </strong>So says Gideon Brothers, a Croatian robotics startup that just raised a $31 million round. Per <a href="https://twitter.com/mikebutcher">Mike</a>, the “investment will be used to accelerate the development and commercialization of GB’s AI and 3D vision-based ‘autonomous mobile robots’ or ‘AMRs.’”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Network security startup ExtraHop skips and jumps to $900M exit</h2>
<p>News broke this morning that Bain Capital Private Equity and Crosspoint Capital Partners are purchasing Seattle-based network security startup ExtraHop.</p>
<p>Part of the Network Detection and Response (NDR) market, ExtraHop’s security solutions are for companies that manage assets in the cloud and on-site, “something that could be useful as more companies find themselves in that in-between state.”</p>
<p>A year ago, ExtraHop was closing in on $100 million in ARR and considering an IPO, so we spoke to ExtraHop CTO and co-founder Jesse Rothstein to learn more about how (and why) the deal came together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Trucks Venture Capital, a fund that focuses on early-stage entrepreneurs in transportation, is launching two new funds that it says will help build the future of transportation.</p>
<p class="p2">Its new core fund, Trucks Venture Fund 2 (TVF2), was raised over the last year and recently closed on $52,525,252. The fund is backed by three auto OEMs and three auto suppliers that make everything from bicycles to Class 8 big rig trucks, as well as one communications company, according to Trucks VC. The VC’s new follow-on fund, Trucks Growth Fund, will provide later-stage capital to some of the most promising companies already in Trucks’ portfolio.</p>
<p class="p2">&#8220;Our mission is to fund companies making transportation safer, cleaner and more accessible,&#8221; Reilly Brennan, general partner at Trucks VC, told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p2">&#8220;Safer&#8221; companies that Trucks VC looks to invest in might focus on automated vehicles, driver monitoring or vehicle maintenance and improvements. Because we are at the beginning of a decade for zero-emission transportation, &#8220;cleaner&#8221; looks like batteries and charging, electric and hydrogen vehicle platforms and last-mile logistics. And &#8220;more accessible&#8221; means companies that focus on micromobility and mass transit, according to Brennan.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JgLctKJcVk"><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/maas-transit-the-business-of-mobility-as-a-service/">MaaS transit: The business of mobility as a service</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MaaS transit: The business of mobility as a service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/maas-transit-the-business-of-mobility-as-a-service/embed/#?secret=JgLctKJcVk" data-secret="JgLctKJcVk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We also believe heavily in automated vehicles in structured environments (agriculture, mining, logistics),&#8221; said Brennan. &#8220;Given the focus on delivery and changing consumer behavior, it&#8217;s not hard to see how logistics AV becomes more valuable than robotaxi. I would go so far as to say the forthcoming exits from those sectors in AV will make the previous five years of robotaxi exits (Cruise, nuTonomy, Zoox) look relatively low in comparison.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trucks VC is also looking beyond the micromobility horizon. Brennan says a lot of the VCs with &#8220;good hair&#8221; have been calling the end of micromobility, so now&#8217;s the perfect time to spot emerging companies building a new wave of ideas in B2B, hardware and operating systems. The investment firm will follow these criteria when searching for both newer startups for TVF2 and for the Growth Fund.</p>
<p class="p2">The Growth Fund is the first formal entity Trucks VC has established for later-stage companies, although it&#8217;s selected a few follow-on investments in the past, says Brennan.</p>
<p class="p2">“The origin of this is somewhat unusual: we have this amazing community of people who read our newsletter (FoT) and they have been asking us for investing opportunities for years,” said Brennan. “Once Naval Ravikant showed us the platform they built at AngelList for rolling funds, we decided to use it. I think we&#8217;re the first venture fund that is using the new rolling fund structure as a growth fund.”</p>
<p class="p2">The growth fund might kick off its portfolio by investing in Universal Hydrogen, Gatik and Bear Flag Robotics, according to Brennan. TVF2 has already made seed investments to Universal Hydrogen &#8212; an LA-based startup that’s developing hydrogen storage solutions and conversion kits for commercial aircraft. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/universal-hydrogen-raises-20-5m-series-a-to-help-launch-hydrogen-aviation/"><span class="s1">Universal Hydrogen recently closed a $20.5 million Series A round</span></a> led by investor syndicate Playground Global.</p>

<p class="p2">TVF2 also made a seed investment and participated in a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/swyft-raises-17-5-million-to-bring-same-day-delivery-to-all-the-retailers-that-arent-amazon/"><span class="s1"> $17.5 million Series A to Swyft</span></a>, a company trying to rival Amazon on same-day retail delivery, and it provided seed funding to Token Transit, a mobile ticket booking app.</p>
<p class="p2">Trucks VC makes up to eight investments from its core seed funds every year, and the Growth Fund will similarly invest in one or two companies each quarter. The San Francisco-based fund, founded in 2015, has invested in well-known exits such as Joby Aviation and DeepScale, which was acquired by Tesla.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The continuing saga of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/dogs-of-lordstown/">Lordstown Motor&#8217;s struggles as a public company</a> took a new turn today as the electric truck manufacturer made yet more news. Bad news.</p>
<p>Shares of Lordstown are down sharply today after the company <a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/f0d0d2f4-d298-4576-9344-61f82e345e19">reported in an SEC filing</a> that it does not have enough capital to build and launch its electric truck. Here&#8217;s the official verbiage (formatting, bolding: TechCrunch):</p>
<blockquote><p>Since inception, the Company has been developing its flagship vehicle, the Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to complete the development of its electric vehicles, obtain regulatory approval, begin commercial scale production and launch the sale of such vehicles.</p>
<p><strong> The Company believes that its current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund commercial scale production and the launch of sale of such vehicles. These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, companies that are trying to invent the future are more risky than, say, established banking concerns that are generating stable GAAP net income. I&#8217;m sure that SpaceX looked dicey at times when it was busy crashing rockets on its way to learning how to land them on drone ships.</p>
<p>But in the case of Lordstown&#8217;s admission that it cannot &#8220;fund commercial scale production and the launch of sale&#8221; of its Endurance pickup are fucking galling.</p>
<p>Why? Because when the company pitched its SPAC-led combination and public debut, it was pretty freaking confident that it would have enough cash to do so.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t take my word for it. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000121390020019762/ea124863ex99-2_diamondpeak.htm">Lordstown&#8217;s investor deck</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2163325 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.21.19-PM.png?w=573" alt="" width="573" height="393" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.21.19-PM.png 573w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.21.19-PM.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.21.19-PM.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.21.19-PM.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" /></p>
<p>You will note in the &#8220;Capital Structure&#8221; section that the company claimed that it would not need more funding to go to market.</p>
<p>Now Lordstown is pretty sure it&#8217;s going to need more money. If it&#8217;s putting the possible need in a filing, it means it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the company may do to solve its problems (formatting, bolding: TechCrunch):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>To alleviate these conditions, management is currently evaluating various funding alternatives and may seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, mezzanine or debt securities, through arrangements with strategic partners or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions</strong>.</p>
<p>As we seek additional sources of financing, there can be no assurance that such financing would be available to us on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the debt and equity capital markets is subject to several factors, including market and economic conditions, our performance and investor sentiment with respect to us and our industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the company is going to have to lever itself using debt, or dilute existing shareholders through the sale of equity, and Lordstown can&#8217;t promise that it will be able to do either &#8220;on favorable terms or at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>What we&#8217;re seeing here is the difference between SEC filings, which are no-bullshit zones, and SPAC decks, which are business propaganda. Shares of Lordstown fell more than 16% during regular trading, and another 6.9% in after-hours trading, as of the time of writing.</p>
<p>This mess from the company that put out this diagram in its investor deck:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2163329 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.26.54-PM.png" alt="" width="963" height="597" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.26.54-PM.png 963w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.26.54-PM.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.26.54-PM.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.26.54-PM.png?resize=768,476 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.26.54-PM.png?resize=680,422 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.26.54-PM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 963px) 100vw, 963px" /></p>
<p>In separate news, TechCrunch received an invite to a media availability to visit Lordstown&#8217;s operations in May, which included a note that the company &#8220;look[s] forward to opening [its] doors and showing you the latest progress from Lordstown Motors as [it] prepare[s] for the beginning of production in late September.&#8221; In a new missive sent today concerning the same event, the production timeline was not present.</p>
<p>So, yeah, maybe don&#8217;t trust SPAC decks much, if at all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ring gets a lot of criticism, not just for its massive surveillance network of home video doorbells and its problematic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/ring-neighbors-exposed-locations-addresses/">privacy</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/ring-doorbell-passwords-exposed/">security</a> practices, but also for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/08/over-30-civil-rights-groups-demand-an-end-to-amazon-rings-police-partnerships/">giving that doorbell footage</a> to law enforcement. While Ring is making <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/ring-slightly-overhauls-security-and-privacy-but-its-still-not-enough/">moves towards transparency</a>, the company refuses to disclose how many users had their data given to police.</p>
<p>The video doorbell maker, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/amazon-is-buying-smart-doorbell-maker-ring/">acquired by Amazon in 2018</a>, has partnerships with at least 1,800 U.S. police departments (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258856/amazon-ring-partners-police-fire-security-privacy-cameras">and growing</a>) that can request camera footage from Ring doorbells. Prior to a change this week, any police department that Ring partnered with could privately request doorbell camera footage from Ring customers for an active investigation. Ring will <a href="https://blog.ring.com/products-innovation/ring-launches-request-for-assistance-posts-on-the-neighbors-app/">now let its police partners</a> publicly request video footage from users through its Neighbors app.</p>
<p>The change ostensibly gives Ring users more control when police can access their doorbell footage, but ignores privacy concerns that police can access users&#8217; footage without a warrant.</p>
<p>Civil liberties advocates and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/06/u-s-senator-demands-answers-from-amazon-ring-over-its-police-partnerships/">lawmakers</a> have long warned that police can obtain camera footage from Ring users through a legal back door because Ring&#8217;s sprawling network of doorbell cameras are owned by private users. Police can still serve Ring with a legal demand, such as a subpoena for basic user information, or a search warrant or court order for video content, assuming there is evidence of a crime.</p>
<p>Ring received over 1,800 legal demands during 2020, more than double <a href="https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/law-enforcement-information-requests/">from the year earlier</a>, according to a <a href="https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/law-enforcement-information-requests-in-2020/">transparency report</a> that Ring published quietly in January. Ring does not disclose sales figures but says it has <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/21/21070402/amazon-ring-sales-jumpshot-data">&#8220;millions&#8221; of customers</a>. But the report leaves out context that most transparency reports include: how many users or accounts had footage given to police when Ring was served with a legal demand?</p>
<p>When reached, Ring declined to say how many users had footage obtained by police.</p>
<p>That number of users or accounts subject to searches is not inherently secret, but an <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/tech-transparency-reports-do-you-mean-translucency-reports/">obscure side effect</a> of how companies decide — if at all — to disclose when the government demands user data. Though they are not obligated to, most tech companies publish transparency reports once or twice a year to show how often user data is obtained by the government.</p>
<p>Transparency reports were a way for companies subject to data requests to push back <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/twitters-new-transparency-report-is-disclosure-done-right/">against damning allegations</a> of intrusive bulk government surveillance by showing that only a fraction of a company&#8217;s users are subject to government demands.</p>
<p>But context is everything. <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/government-data-requests">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/pdf/requests-2020-H1-en.pdf">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/law-enforcement-requests-report">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en">Google</a>, and <a href="https://transparency.twitter.com/en/reports/information-requests.html#2020-jan-jun">Twitter</a> all reveal how many legal demands they receive, but also specify how many users or accounts had data given. In some cases, the number of users or accounts affected can be twice or more than threefold the number of demands they received.</p>
<p>Ring&#8217;s parent, Amazon, is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/amazon-government-data-demands/">rare exception</a> among the big tech giants, which does not break out the specific number of users whose information was turned over to law enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ring is ostensibly a security camera company that makes devices you can put on your own homes, but it is increasingly also a tool of the state to conduct criminal investigations and surveillance,&#8221; Matthew Guariglia, policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Guariglia added that Ring could release the numbers of users subject to legal demands, but also how many users have previously responded to police requests through the app.</p>
<p>Ring users can opt out of receiving requests from police, but this option would not stop law enforcement from obtaining a legal order from a judge for your data. Users can also switch on end-to-end encryption to prevent anyone other than the user, including Ring, from accessing their videos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s rare that a truly new way to make coffee is invented, and nearly all of them have one thing in common: heat. After all, it&#8217;s hot water that quickly extracts flavor and body from grounds. But <a href="https://drinkosma.com/">Osma</a>, a new device using an entirely novel coffeemaking technique, makes a rich, strong espresso-like drink at any temperature, including icy cold — and it might be the next big thing in the industry.</p>
<p>Osma is the latest project from designer Joey Roth, who evolved from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/16/grovemades-wooden-speaker-set-looks-like-beautiful-cybernetic-alien-eggs/">high-concept speaker tech</a> to tea and coffee tech, and now has found a way to integrate these two disparate pursuits with a unique vibratory method of extraction. And although Roth has had several successes over the years, this could be his most valuable yet.</p>
<p>To see why, it helps to understand the way coffee is ordinarily made, which generally comes down to one of two things: soaking the grounds in hot water, or forcing it through the grounds under pressure.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="F9Git0UoAl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/16/grovemades-wooden-speaker-set-looks-like-beautiful-cybernetic-alien-eggs/">Grovemade&#8217;s wooden speaker set looks like beautiful cybernetic alien eggs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Grovemade&#8217;s wooden speaker set looks like beautiful cybernetic alien eggs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/16/grovemades-wooden-speaker-set-looks-like-beautiful-cybernetic-alien-eggs/embed/#?secret=F9Git0UoAl" data-secret="F9Git0UoAl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the first case, which includes drip and pourover, French press, and others, the heat of the water passively frees the oils and volatiles from the ground beans and then the solids, drained of flavor, are left behind through filtering.</p>
<p>The second case is espresso, in which the desired chemicals are extracted not just through heat but by the process of microcavitation. This is where the heat and pressure free CO2 from the grounds, forming tiny bubbles that quickly collapse, a process that leads to the flavor and aroma compounds being forced out as well.</p>
<p>Cold water can be used in the first method, with the advantage is that certain substances that would be destroyed by heat are retained, giving a different flavor profile. Unfortunately it can take hours or even days to brew to one&#8217;s preferred strength, and other desirable compounds degrade over that duration. And cold water can&#8217;t be used in the espresso process because steam is necessary to accomplish extraction.</p>
<p>Yet despite the inconvenience inherent to cold coffee, anyone who&#8217;s visited a café in the last decade can tell you it is enormously popular, year-round but especially in the summer. There&#8217;s endless appetite for the drink, even if all it amounts to is pouring hot coffee or espresso over ice. What if strong, delicious coffee could be made without heating it up, watering it down, or waiting for days? That&#8217;s the Osma proposition.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2161732" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161732" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2161732" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="511" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg 1805w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg?resize=1536,766 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2161732" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Osma</p></div></p>
<p>The Osma system is to my knowledge unlike any other brewing method. Essentially what it does is circulate water through the grounds continuously, while agitating them with a sort of standing pressure wave. It produces 8-12 ounces of a coffee that&#8217;s less concentrated than espresso, but not as mild as coldbrew, in about two minutes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2161725" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161725" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2161725" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png" alt="Diagram showing how coffee and water move through the Osma system." width="450" height="508" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png?resize=133,150 133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png?resize=266,300 266w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png?resize=768,867 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png?resize=602,680 602w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2161725" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Osma</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="im HOEnZb adL">This is a fundamentally new expression of coffee that needs to be experienced,&#8221; said Roth when I asked him to characterize the flavor profile. He&#8217;d compared it to Kyoto-style slow drip with the added creamy mouthfeel and brighter flavors of espresso, but decided the analogy was imperfect.</span></p>
<p>His reservation is justified, as the method really is completely different. In addition to using cold water instead of hot and an acoustic wave instead of high pressure to create cavitation, the Osma Pro is unique in that it uses a circulatory process instead of one-way.</p>
<p>Almost all forms of coffee making are unidirectional: water goes in, meets up with the grounds, and coffee comes out — with the exception of percolators, which aren&#8217;t exactly the aficionado&#8217;s first choice. The Osma method, on the other hand, sucks up the water, passes it through the grounds and agitates it, then puts it back in the same vessel, where it is sucked up and passed through again.</p>
<p>This circular process can be stopped earlier or later, giving a lighter or heavier brew, but there&#8217;s a sweet spot at about two minutes that Roth thinks produces the best cup for most purposes.</p>
<p>Creating the system was equal parts serendipity and ingenuity. Roth recalled boiling water at room temperature in a commercial vacuum chamber with his co-founder Dan Yue, which sort of worked but not really, and at any rate wasn&#8217;t the type of equipment you could resell to a consumer. Yue speculated that it was the microcavitation process that allowed this extraction without significant heat.</p>

<p>&#8220;We verified this with a number of other experiments and confirmed that microcavitation was indeed the magic switch,&#8221; Roth said. &#8220;From there we spent about two years developing what’s basically a mechanism to efficiently facilitate cavitation using acoustics in a tightly packed basket of ground coffee. With the help and insight of our partners James and Hiver (co-founders of <a href="https://www.chromaticcoffee.com/">Chromatic Coffee</a> in San Jose) we developed this into the Osma Pro.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being able to pull a strong, cold coffee drink with espresso-like and cold brew-like aspects on demand could be a game-changer for coffee shops. At present they have to anticipate demand, making cold brew a day or longer before, risking shortages if demand outstrips supply, or otherwise offer hot coffee poured over ice, an accepted but rather incoherent approach.</p>
<p>At $695 the Osma Pro is a bit expensive for home use, but quite in line with the type of equipment used by most cafés. Like Roth&#8217;s other work, the industrial design is simple and beautiful. When you factor in its small footprint (about the size of a standing grinder) and the fact that it frees up valuable fridge space that would otherwise be filled with gallons of coldbrew, it starts to make a whole lot of sense.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2161723" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161723" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2161723 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg" alt="Close-up of the side of the Osma machine, with etched limited number." width="1024" height="742" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg?resize=768,557 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg?resize=680,493 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg?resize=1536,1114 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2161723" class="wp-caption-text">A limited run of a thousand&#8230; for now. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Osma</p></div></p>
<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why an unnamed but apparently major coffee company has indicated interest in partnering with Roth on the machine, as he coyly explained. Selling a couple hundred to boutique coffee shops is nice, and Roth did say that pre-orders are beyond expectations, but a big time partner that could move units in the thousands? That&#8217;s the start of a global business empire.</p>
<p>Incidentally the whole thing started with a device that may now sadly be defunct. The first Osma brew I encountered was a portable, battery-powered device Roth sent me in beta form to test out that used biodegradable coffee pods and a scaled-down version of the acoustic agitation process. But this ended up being a sort of development dead end — while an interesting tech demo and pretty good at making coffee, it quickly became clear that the countertop version, which was improving rapidly, was the future of the company.</p>
<p>The only real question now is what to call the drink. I suggested coldpresso (icepresso is more euphonious but too close to the original), Roth thought cold flash but admitted everything he thought up was corny. Whatever it&#8217;s called, you can probably expect to start seeing it at your local &#8220;serious&#8221; coffee spot. If you run one of those or drink enough cold coffee to justify a major purchase, you can get in line to pick up a machine <a href="https://drinkosma.com/">at the Osma website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle startup Fisker Inc. has set a moonshot goal of creating its first climate neutral car by 2027.</p>
<p>Fisker has yet to bring a vehicle to market — climate neutral or not — making this an ambitious target. The all-electric Fisker Ocean SUV, which is still on track to go into production in November 2022, will not be climate neutral, according to CEO Henrik Fisker who laid out the target as part of a broader update Tuesday to investors. Instead, this will be another yet to be announced vehicle.</p>
<p>Henrik Fisker, a serial entrepreneur who rose to fame as the designer behind iconic vehicles like Aston Martin V8 Vantage, the production launch design of the Aston Martin DB9 and BMW Z8 roadster, also provided a few other updates during the investor call. He said the Ocean will have an anticipated range of up to 350 miles, beyond the previously estimated 300 miles. The company has received more than 14,000 reservations for the Ocean as of March, according to an <a href="https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/33813J/20210412/AR_468005.PDF">annual report</a> distributed to shareholders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fisker, which went public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Apollo Global Management Inc. in October at a valuation of $2.9 billion, aims to have four vehicles to market by 2025. One of those, Fisker hinted at Tuesday, could be a luxury vehicle which he called the “UFO” that will use the company&#8217;s FM29 platform architecture.</p>
<h2>Fisker&#8217;s carbon neutral plan</h2>
<p>Other companies across industries have made promises to hit that carbon neutral goal before. Henrik Fisker emphasized to investors that the company will not purchase carbon offsets to accomplish that climate neutrality goal. Carbon offsets are credits that companies can purchase to “claim” a reduction in CO2 toward their project or product. Instead, Fisker said they will work with suppliers to develop climate neutral materials and manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>The company lays out some of its proposed strategies on its <a href="https://www.fiskerinc.com/climate-neutral-vehicle">website</a>, where it splits the vehicle lifecycle into five phases: upstream sourcing, manufacturing and assembly, logistics, the use phase, and end-of-life. For each phase, the company lists a few bullet points, such as localizing manufacturing. Even with these plans, achieving climate neutrality in vehicle production will be extremely difficult. Vehicles use materials and components such as steel that are notoriously hard to decarbonize, for example.</p>
<p>Fisker said that the company’s manufacturing partners have climate neutral goals of their own, which is true for automotive contract manufacturer Magna Steyr. The company inked a deal with Fisker to exclusively manufacturer the Fisker Ocean in Europe. Magna set a target of climate neutrality for its European operations by 2025 and globally by 2030. Foxconn, Fisker’s other major partner for its second, lower-price vehicle dubbed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/fisker-and-foxconn-sign-deal-to-build-electric-vehicles/">Project PEAR</a>, also has a net-zero emissions goal, but it is set for the middle of the century.</p>
<p>Moonshot goals such as this one could help push innovation in manufacturing processes and encourage other automakers and suppliers to reach for the same targets. Other automakers such as Polestar and Porsche have all made carbon neutral promises with deadlines of 2030, while Mercedes has said it will hit that target in 2039.</p>
<p>Fisker does seem to have a plan for how it might be able to recycle or reuse some of its EV batteries once they&#8217;re no longer useful in the vehicle. The company plans to extend its leasing program across the entire estimated 15-year lifespan of the vehicle, which would theoretically ensure that Fisker will be in possession of a number of its vehicles when they reach end-of-life.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Apple in 2018 closed its $400 million acquisition of music recognition app Shazam. Now, it&#8217;s bringing Shazam&#8217;s audio recognition capabilities to app developers in the form of the new ShazamKit.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple in 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/apple-closes-its-shazam-acquisition-and-says-the-music-recognition-app-will-soon-become-ad-free/">closed its $400 million acquisition</a> of music recognition app Shazam. Now, it&#8217;s bringing Shazam&#8217;s audio recognition capabilities to app developers in the form of the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/shazamkit/">ShazamKit</a>. The new framework will allow app developers &#8212; including those on both <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shazamkit">Apple platforms</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/shazamkit/android/">Android</a> &#8212; to build apps that can identify music from Shazam&#8217;s huge database of songs, or even from their own custom catalog of pre-recorded audio.</p>
<p>Many consumers are already familiar with the mobile app Shazam, which lets you push a button to identify what song you&#8217;re hearing, and then take other actions &#8212; like viewing the lyrics, adding the song to a playlist, exploring music trends, and more. Having first launched in 2008, Shazam was already one of the oldest apps on the App Store when Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/sources-apple-is-acquiring-music-recognition-app-shazam/">snatched</a> it up.</p>
<p>Now the company is putting Shazam to better use than being just a music identification utility. With the new ShazamKit, developers will now be able to leverage Shazam&#8217;s audio recognition capabilities to create their own app experiences.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are three parts to the new framework: Shazam catalog recognition, which lets developers add song recognition to their apps; custom catalog recognition, which performs on-device matching against arbitrary audio; and library management.</p>
<p>Shazam catalog recognition is what you probably think of when you think of the Shazam experience today. The technology can recognize the song that&#8217;s playing in the environment and then fetch the song&#8217;s metadata, like the title and artist. The ShazamKit API will also be able to return other metadata like genre or album art, for example. And it can identify where in the audio the match occurred.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2163306" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-3.42.16-PM.jpg?w=374" alt="" width="374" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-3.42.16-PM.jpg 694w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-3.42.16-PM.jpg?resize=82,150 82w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-3.42.16-PM.jpg?resize=165,300 165w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-3.42.16-PM.jpg?resize=374,680 374w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-3.42.16-PM.jpg?resize=27,50 27w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" /></p>
<p>When matching music, Shazam doesn&#8217;t actually match the audio itself, to be clear. Instead, it creates a lossy representation of it, called a signature, and matches against that. This method greatly reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent over the network. Signatures also cannot be used to reconstruct the original audio, which protects user privacy.</p>
<p>The Shazam catalog comprises millions of songs and is hosted in cloud and maintained by Apple. It&#8217;s regularly updated with new tracks as they become available.</p>
<p>When a customer uses a developer&#8217;s third-party app for music recognition via ShazamKit, they may want to save the song in their Shazam library. This is found in the Shazam app, if the user has it installed, or it can be accessed by long pressing on the music recognition Control Center module. The library is also synced across devices.</p>
<p>Apple suggests that apps make their users aware that recognized songs will be saved to this library, as there&#8217;s no special permission required to write to the library.</p>

<p>ShazamKit&#8217;s custom catalog recognition feature, meanwhile, could be used to create synced activities or other second-screen experiences in apps by recognizing the developer&#8217;s audio, not that from the Shazam music catalog.</p>
<p>This could allow for educational apps where students follow along with a video lesson, where some portion of the lesson&#8217;s audio could prompt an activity to begin in the student&#8217;s companion app. It could also be used to enable mobile shopping experiences that popped up as you watched a favorite TV show.</p>
<p>ShazamKit is current in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shazamkit">beta</a> on iOS 15.0+, macOS 12.0+, Mac Catalyst 15.0+, tvOS 15.0+, and watchOS 8.0+. On <a href="https://developer.apple.com/shazamkit/android/">Android</a>, ShazamKit comes in the form of an Android Archive (AAR) file and supports music and custom audio, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a>, app and game designer Panic&#8217;s first shot at hardware, finally has a firm price and ship date, as well as a bunch of surprise features cooked up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/panics-playmate-is-a-pint-sized-gaming-machine-with-a-season-of-12-intriguing-titles/">since its announcement in 2019</a>. The tiny handheld gaming console will cost $179, ship later this year and come with a 24-game &#8220;season&#8221; doled out over 12 weeks. But now it also has a cute speaker dock and low-code game creation platform.</p>
<p>We first heard about Playdate more than two years ago, were charmed by its clean look, funky crank control, and black and white display, and have been waiting for news ever since. Panic&#8217;s impeccable design credentials combined with Teenage Engineering&#8217;s creative hardware chops? It&#8217;s bound to be a joy to use, but there wasn&#8217;t much more than that to go on.</p>
<p>Now the company has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeWGukDrc1U">revealed all the important details</a> we were hoping for, and many more, to boot.</p>

<p>Originally we were expecting 12 games to be delivered over 12 weeks, but in the intervening period it seems they&#8217;ve collected more titles than planned, and that initial &#8220;season&#8221; of games has expanded to 24. No one knows exactly what to expect from these games except that they&#8217;re exclusive to the Playdate and many use the crank mechanic in what appear to be fun and interesting ways: turning a turntable, opening a little door, doing tricks as a surfer, and so on.</p>
<p>The team hasn&#8217;t decided how future games will be distributed, though they seem to have some ideas. Another season? One-off releases? Certainly the presence of a new game by one-man indie hit parade Lucas Pope would sell like hotcakes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2163265" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163265" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2163265" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png" alt="Screenshots of the Pulp game creation tool." width="1024" height="465" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png 1701w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png?resize=768,349 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png?resize=680,309 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png?resize=1536,697 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2163265" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Panic</p></div></p>
<p>But the debut of a new lo-fi game development platform called Pulp suggests a future where self-publishing may also be an option. This lovely little web-based tool lets anyone put together a game using presets for things like controls and actions, and may prove to be a sort of tiny Twine in time.</p>
<p>A dock accessory was announced as well, something to keep your Playdate front and center on your desk. The speaker-equipped dock, also a lemony yellow, acts as a magnetic charging cradle for the console, activating a sort of stationary mode with a clock and music player (Poolsuite.fm, apparently, with original relaxing tunes). It even has two holes in which to put your pens (and Panic made a special yellow pen just for the purpose as well).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2163267" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163267" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2163267" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg" alt="Playdate attached to its little cubical dock." width="1024" height="853" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg 1792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg?resize=768,640 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg?resize=680,567 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg?resize=1536,1280 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2163267" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Panic</p></div></p>
<p>The $179 price may cause some to balk — after all, it&#8217;s considerably more than a Nintendo 3DS and with the dock probably approaches the price of a Switch. But this isn&#8217;t meant to be a competitor with mainstream gaming — instead, it&#8217;s a sort of anti-establishment system that embraces weirdness and provides something equally unfamiliar and undeniably fun.</p>
<p>The team says that there will be a week&#8217;s warning before orders can be placed, and that they don&#8217;t plan to shut orders down if inventory runs out, but simply allow people to preorder and cancel at will until they receive their unit. Shipping will begin in late 2021, and if the 20,000 units in the initial run don&#8217;t cover it, they&#8217;ll make more and ship as they come in.</p>
<p>We hope to get one ourselves to test and review, but since part of the charm of the whole thing is the timed release and social aspect of discovery and sharing, it&#8217;s more than likely we&#8217;ll be experiencing it along with everyone else.</p>
<p>(This article originally stated Playdate ships next month, but it will actually ship later — preorders begin next month.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toast has raised more than $900 billion and is reportedly valued at over $5 billion. But back in 2011, no one knew this startup would see such meteoric success. It had a few things going for it, of course — founder Aman Narang hailed from Endeca, where he was a software engineer and product lead with a reputation for being able to ship a lot of software quickly.</p>
<p>But the ambitions behind Toast were big and complicated, and enough to give pause to any investor. Kent Bennett was one such VC, and while he had conviction in the founding team, he wasn&#8217;t convinced that they could tackle such a big problem.</p>
<p>Toast is a restaurant POS system that acts as a sort of operating system for an establishment, managing everything from online orders, deliveries and marketing to payroll and team management as well as the actual point of sale. Being able to do all that requires building a number of complex products, such as payments.</p>
<p>Early on, Bennett had told Narang not to build a restaurant POS. To him, it was too complicated and nuanced, which is why the systems from the &#8217;90s were still deeply entrenched 20 years later. However, he did offer space in the Bessemer office for the Toast team to work on their product.</p>
<p>&#8220;I caught up with Aman and he told me that they did this interesting thing after hearing that a lot of their customers were frustrated by payments platforms, which are separate from the POS,&#8221; said Bennett. &#8220;Aman said they built their own payments platform. Once again, I was like, &#8216;You did what? You&#8217;re not allowed to build payments.&#8217; But he told me that they built it and it improves their products, and that, by the way, they make a margin on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bennett said that when they added up the margins from the payments and the POS, it was impactful.</p>
<p>&#8220;It hit me like a ton of bricks,&#8221; said Bennett. &#8220;This is a really good business.&#8221;</p>
<p>From there, it became his obsession. And though it took a few more quarters to close the deal, they eventually got there. Bessemer led the company&#8217;s Series B financing in 2016.</p>
<p>We spoke to Bennett and Narang recently on an episode of Extra Crunch Live to explore the story of how they came together for the deal, what makes the difference for both founders and investors when fundraising, and the biggest lessons they&#8217;ve learned so far. The episode also featured the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-Off, where audience members pitched their products to Bennett and Narang and received live feedback.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is open to everyone each Wednesday at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT, but only Extra Crunch members are able to stream these sessions afterward and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/extra-crunch-live/">watch previous shows on-demand</a> in our episode library.</p>
<p>Despite the complexity of the Toast system, or maybe because of it, Narang says the fundamentals are the most important part of communicating the business, especially when fundraising.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With increased demand from the pandemic, Canalys reports that <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/us-pc-market-q1-2021?ctid=2122-fb76209fd80bef7f0644eb40d74d243f">U.S. PC shipments were up 73%</a> over the same period last year. That added up to a total of 34 million units sold. While Apple had a good quarter with sales up 36%, it was surpassed by HP, which sold 11 million units in total with annual growth up an astonishing 122.6%.</p>
<p>As Canalys pointed out, the first quarter tends to be a weaker one for Apple hardware following the holiday season, but it&#8217;s a big move for HP nonetheless. Other companies boasting big growth numbers include Samsung at 116% and Lenovo at 92.8%. Dell was up 29.2%, fairly modest compared with the rest of the group.</p>
<p>Overall though it was a stunning quarter as units flew off the shelves. Canalys Research Analyst Brian Lynch says some of this can be attributed to the increased demand from 2020 as people moved to work and school from home and needed new machines to get their work done, but regardless the growth was unrivaled historically. &#8221; … Q1 2021 still rates as one of the best first quarters the industry has ever seen. Vendors have prioritized fulfilling U.S. backlogs before supply issues are addressed in other parts of the world,&#8221; Lynch said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, low-cost Chromebooks were the most popular item as people looking to refresh their devices, especially for education purposes, turned to the lower end of the PC market, which likely had a negative impact on higher-priced Apple products, as well contributing to its drop from the top spot.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Samsung and other Chromebook vendors really shined. The firm reports that over the last year Chromebook sales shot up 548% with Samsung leading that growth with an astonishing 1,963% growth rate. Asus, HP and Lenovo all reported Chromebook sales rates up over 900%.</p>
<p>Those numbers include desktops, notebooks, tablets and workstations, but it was the notebook and tablets that get the bulk of the action here with notebooks up a whopping 131% YoY. While tablets didn&#8217;t grow at the same rate, sales were still up 51% with 11 million units sold in the quarter.</p>
<p>The company does not expect the market to slow significantly in the coming quarters with continued demand in the education market. While parts shortages, particularly in the chip market, continue to dog the industry, this will only continue to feed demand in the coming quarters, according to the firm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s only been nine months since Dispo rebranded from David’s Disposable. But the vintage-inspired photo sharing app has experienced a whiplash of ups and downs, mostly due to the brand’s original namesake, YouTuber David Dobrik.</p>
<p>Like Clubhouse, Dispo was one of this year’s most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/style/dispo-david-dobrik-disposable-camera-app.html">hyped up</a> new social apps, requiring an invite from an existing member to join. On March 9, when the company said “<a href="https://twitter.com/DispoHQ/status/1369380343963324421">goodbye waitlist</a>” and opened the app up to any iOS user, Dispo looked poised to be a worthy competitor to photo-sharing behemoths like Instagram. But, just one week later, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3"><i>Business Insider </i>reported</a> on sexual assault allegations regarding a member of Vlog Squad, a YouTube prank ensemble headed by Dispo co-founder David Dobrik. Dobrik had posted a now-deleted vlog about the night of the alleged assault, joking, “<a href="https://twitter.com/defnoodles/status/1372024094867091461">we’re all going to jail</a>” at the end of the video.</p>
<p>It was only after venture capital firm Spark Capital decided to “sever all ties” with Dispo that Dobrik stepped down from the company board. In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">a statement made to TechCrunch</a> at the time, Dispo said, “Dispo’s team, product, and most importantly — our community — stand for building a diverse, inclusive and empowering world.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dispo capitalizes on Gen Z and young millennial nostalgia for a time before digital photography, when we couldn’t take thirty selfies before choosing which one to post. On Dispo, when you take a photo, you have to wait until 9 AM the following day for the image to “develop,” and only then can you view and share it.</p>
<p>In both February and March of this year, the app hit the top ten of the Photo &amp; Video category in the U.S. App Store. Despite the backlash against Dobrik, which resulted in the app’s product page being bombarded with negative comments, the app still hit the top ten in Germany, Japan, and Brazil, according to their press release. Dispo reportedly has not yet expended any international marketing resources.</p>
<p>Now, early investors in Dispo like Spark Capital, Seven Seven Six, and Unshackled have committed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/early-investors-in-dispo-to-donate-any-profits-from-the-photo-sharing-app/">donate any potential profits</a> from their investment in the app to organizations working with survivors of sexual assault. Though Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-david-dobriks-retro-photo-app-dispo-raises-20-million-0a056861-6ea2-46d2-92af-eda697eb179b.html">reported the app’s $20M Series A funding</a> news in February, Dispo put out a press release this morning confirming the financing event. Seven Seven Six and Unshackled Ventures remain listed as investors, while Spark Capital is not. Other notable names involved in the project include high-profile photographers like Annie Leibovitz and Raven B. Varona, who has worked with artists like Beyoncé and Jay-Z. Actresses Cara Delevingne and Sofía Vergara, as well as NBA superstars Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala, are also involved with the app as investors or advisors.</p>
<p>Dobrik’s role in the company was largely as a marketer – CEO Daniel Liss co-founded the app with Dobrik and has been leading the team since the beginning. After Dobrik’s departure, the Dispo team – which remains under twenty members strong – took a break from communications and product updates on the app. It’s expected that after today’s funding confirmation, the app will continue to roll out updates.</p>
<p>Dispo is quick to shift focus to the work of their team, which they call “some of the most talented, diverse leaders in consumer tech.” With the capital from this funding round, they hope to hire more staff to become more competitive with major social media apps with expansive teams, like Instagram and TikTok, and to experiment with machine learning. They will also likely have some serious marketing to do, now that their attempt at influencer marketing has failed massively.</p>
<p>Now more than ever, Dispo is promoting the app as a mental health benefit, hoping to shift the tide away from manufactured perfectionism toward more authentic social media experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;A new era of start ups must emerge to end the scourge of big tech’s destruction of our political fabric and willful ignorance of its impact on body dysmorphia and mental health,&#8221; CEO Daniel Liss writes in a Substack post titled <a href="https://dlisscious.substack.com/p/dispo-20">Dispo 2.0</a>. &#8220;Imagine a world where Dispo is the social network of choice for every teen and college student in the world. How different a world would that be?&#8221;</p>
<p>But, for an app that propelled to success off the fame of a YouTuber with a history of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/04/david-dobrik-allegations-controversies-timeline.html">less than savory behavior</a>, that messaging might fall flat.</p>
<p>According to Sensor Tower, the highest Dispo has ever ranked in the Photo &amp; Video category on the U.S. App Store was in January 2020, when it was still called David&#8217;s Disposable. The app ranked No. 1 in that category from January 7 to January 9, and on January 8, it reached No. 1 among all free iPhone apps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’d be forgiven for being confused. I’ve been following this story and am currently writing it and I&#8217;m still fairly confused. But <a href="https://linktr.ee/turntablettfm">Turntable (or tt.fm)</a>, not to be confused with Turntable.fm (the name of both the original and recently re-released social music app) today just announced that it has launched iOS, Android and desktop versions of its own service.</p>
<p>By way of brief explanation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/turntable-fm-shutting-down-so-company-can-focus-on-turntable-live-events-platform/">the original Turntable.fm shut down in 2013</a> to focus on a live music platform. It was a sad day for those of us who wasted countless workday hours on the site. But stuff happens. People change, companies pivot.</p>
<p>Of course, that nostalgia returned something fierce when we were all stuck inside for the past year, searching for a social connection. Those of us of a certain age who maybe haven’t gone all in on Twitch started pining for the site. So founder Billy Chasen planned a return. In its current beta iteration, it’s a bit of a time capsule, albeit with a few key changes like relying on YouTube streaming to circumvent some royalty issues. It works well. I’ve been using it. It’s fun. Oh, and the company just raised $7.5 million to bring it into the new decade.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Seemingly around the same time, an early Turntable.fm employee decided to launch another take on the service. Focused on mobile usage and opting for the crowdfunding route, TT.fm rode that wave of nostalgia to $500,000 in funding, announced back in March.</p>
<p>Today that service is launching in beta. It’s in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store as we speak. Or you can visit it in a browser. Like Turntable.fm, tt.fm (as we’re going to refer to it for simplicity’s sake) relies on third-party music services. At launch, music is pulled from a linked Spotify or Apple Music account, as well as Soundcloud. YouTube functionality is coming soon.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rdTlliIThb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/call-it-a-comeback-turntable-fm-raises-7-5m/">Call it a comeback: Turntable.fm raises $7.5M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Call it a comeback: Turntable.fm raises $7.5M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/call-it-a-comeback-turntable-fm-raises-7-5m/embed/#?secret=rdTlliIThb" data-secret="rdTlliIThb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As you can see from the above shot, the offering is based on the same format as Turntable.fm, with similar but different graphics. DJs play songs on the stage and the audience bops their heads in approval if they like it. One of the ways the new offering is looking to distinguish itself is through hosted DJ sets from artists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Original Turntable fans are eager to get back on the dancefloor and have been asking for a product that serves their needs,” Perla said in a release, &#8220;including live DJ sets, social networking with music fans, music sharing and an online music community.”</p>
<p>As a fan of Turntable.fm, suddenly going from zero to two services feels like an embarrassment of riches. But the question remains whether it can move beyond a niche and really thrive in the crowded media environment of 2021. There’s probably room for one Turntable.fm.</p>
<p>But two? This already strange story is likely only getting stranger.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As the company is expected to price tomorrow and trade Thursday, we're looking at data that could prove final, unless Monday.com manages to push its IPO price range higher, or prices above estimates.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Team management software company Monday.com dropped a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1845338/000110465921077911/tm211978-16_f1a.htm">new IPO filing</a> today. The latest document &#8212; an F-1/A, because the company is based in Israel &#8212; provides what could be Monday.com&#8217;s final pre-IPO pricing notes and details planned investments from both Zoom and Salesforce after its public offering closes.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Monday.com&#8217;s price range of $125 to $140 per share values it north of $6 billion at the top end of its target interval, a steep upgrade from its final private price recorded in mid-2019.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s quickly unpack its IPO valuation range, discuss the private placements that Zoom and Salesforce plan and parse what Monday.com&#8217;s IPO news means for the broader public offering window.</p>
<p>Because the company is expected to price tomorrow and trade Thursday, we&#8217;re looking at data that could prove final, unless Monday.com manages to push its IPO price range higher or prices above its current estimates. Given the sheer number of IPOs that are either filed or rapidly forthcoming, Monday.com could prove to be a bellwether for the larger unicorn software exit market. Therefore, its debut matters to more than itself, its employees and its venture backers.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Monday.com worth?</h2>
<p>There are a few ways to value a company as it goes public. The first is its so-called simple valuation. To calculate a simple price for a debuting entity, we simply multiply the two extremes of its IPO price range by the number of shares it will have outstanding after its debut. That works out as follows in the case of Monday.com:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Ending years of debates over environmental sustainability, the United States officially <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/">declared a climate crisis</a> earlier this year, deeming climate considerations an “essential element” of foreign policy and national security. After recommitting the U.S. to the Paris Agreement, President Joseph R. Biden announced an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/">aggressive new goal</a> for reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/23/fact-sheet-president-bidens-leaders-summit-on-climate/">pushed world leaders</a> to collectively “step up” their fight against climate change.</p>
<p>At the same time, consumers are <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/01/10/1686144/0/en/CGS-Survey-Reveals-Sustainability-Is-Driving-Demand-and-Customer-Loyalty.html">increasingly looking to do business</a> with brands that align with their growing environmental values, rather than ignoring the climate consequences of their consumption. Even without regulation as a stick, consumer demand is now serving as a carrot to increase sustainability’s impact on public companies’ agendas.</p>
<p>Startups have already followed suit. Investors today view sustainability as an important pillar of any business model and are looking for entrepreneurs who “get it” from the beginning to build and scale next-generation companies. Startups interested in thriving cannot treat sustainability as an afterthought and should be prepared to enter the public eye with a plan for sustainable growth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Today, companies of all sizes are being held to a higher standard by consumers, employees, potential partners and the media.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>So what exactly do founders need to put in place to demonstrate that they’re on the right track when it comes to sustainability? Here are five attributes that investors are looking for.</p>
<h2>1. A truly customer-centric feedback loop</h2>
<p>It’s fairly easy for any company to claim that it understands customers’ wants and needs, but it’s challenging to have the tech stack in place to prove a company actually listens to customer feedback and meets those expectations.</p>
<p>Investors now expect startups to have both platforms and solutions — social listening channels, relationship management tools, surveying programs and review forums — that allow them to hear and act on the needs of their customers. Without the proper communications tools and actual people using them, your eco-friendly efforts will likely appear to be merely lip service.</p>
<p>Take the example of <a href="https://www.temperpack.com/">TemperPack</a>, which manufactures recyclable insulated packaging solutions for shipments of cold, perishable foods and pharmaceuticals. The direct relationship between a packager like TemperPack and the end consumer is often invisible. But as we were looking into investing in the company, some of its life sciences customers told us about comments they had received from end users — people who were receiving medicine twice per day. Another supplier’s packaging required them to visit a recycler for disposal, a real-world pain point that was causing them to consider switching to a different medication.</p>
<p>Revolution Growth decided to add TemperPack as a portfolio company after directly seeing its customer feedback loop in action: End-user requests informed product development, proving both a market need and customer demand on the sustainability front. This firsthand example demonstrates how an investor, a packaging maker, a life sciences company and an end user are now interconnected in one relationship while underscoring how end-user feedback can connect the dots for sustainable product development.</p>
<h2>2. Public commitment to sustainability goals</h2>
<p>Over the past several years, we have seen millennials and Gen Z consumers <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/2020/08/generation-green-is-leading-the-sustainability-agenda/">demand transparency in sustainability efforts</a>. As these generations grow in purchasing power, investors will look for startups that make their commitments to eco-friendly goals as transparent as possible to satisfy shrewd consumer needs.</p>
<p>For many VCs, making public commitments to sustainability goals is a sign that your startup is working toward becoming a next-generation company. Investors will look for goals that are thoughtful, with a clear understanding of where your company will have agency and influence, and that are S.M.A.R.T (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timely). They will also expect regular reports on progress.</p>
<p>Although a company’s management establishes these goals, its board should play a behind-the-scenes role in driving the goals forward, keeping leadership on track and setting the playing field so executives understand that they’re being evaluated on criteria transcending positive EBIDTA.</p>
<p>Taking these steps will ensure goals are responsible and ambitious while also holding the company accountable to consumers and stakeholders to see the initiatives through to completion.</p>
<h2>3. Purpose-driven culture</h2>
<p>Even the best-laid sustainability goals will go unmet without a strong culture designed to guarantee leadership and employee alignment. Sustainability must be ingrained in a startup’s culture — from the top down and bottom up — and there’s a lot at stake if it’s not.</p>
<p>Another Revolution Growth portfolio company, the global fintech-revolutionizing startup <a href="https://tala.co.ke/">Tala</a>, demonstrates how young companies can imbue their cultures with purpose-driven values. While Tala’s mission is to provide credit to the unbanked, the company believes that the consumer’s best interests should always come first. During <a href="https://tala.co.ke/2020/01/22/lessons-from-a-changing-lending-industry-in-kenya/">2019’s holiday season</a>, Tala contrasted with businesses fueling consumption by instead urging customers in Kenya to <em>not</em> take out loans, protecting them from predatory unregulated lenders amid a lack of functioning credit bureaus and loan-stacking databases. This forward-looking approach ultimately safeguarded Tala’s customers and its vibrant digital lending industry.</p>
<p>Beyond determining what they stand for, many of our portfolio companies face challenges securing talent. People have choices about where they want to work, and those with intrinsic motivations — such as concerns about the environment — will feel uncomfortable if their employers do not share their values. Regulatory risks and customer attrition pale in comparison to the human cost of losing star performers who seek other work cultures that better align with their values.</p>
<p>A clear values system should embed sustainability into the decision-making process, make obvious imperatives and empower employees to follow through.</p>
<h2>4. Accountability</h2>
<p>Companies aren’t only judged by their own initiatives — they’re also judged by their partners. As startups build new relationships or expand to work with new suppliers, investors will be keen to know that these outside parties align with their stated sustainability philosophies.</p>
<p>Before becoming publicly involved with another company, a startup should gauge each new supplier’s reputation, including insights into their employment practices. Take leading Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant <a href="https://cava.com/">Cava</a> or healthy-inspired salad-centric chain <a href="https://www.sweetgreen.com/">Sweetgreen</a>, both Revolution Growth portfolio companies; neither will source proteins from farms with inhumane policies. If companies are not aware of these factors, their customers will eventually let them know, and likely hold them accountable for the oversight.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: If a diagram of your partnerships and supplier relationships was printed on the front page of The New York Times, would you be comfortable with what it shows the world? Today, companies of all sizes are being held to a higher standard by consumers, employees, potential partners and the media. It’s no longer possible to fly under the radar with relationships that are antithetical to a company’s sustainability goals. So take a hard look at your supplier and partner ecosystem, and make clear that you are bringing your green vision to life through every extension of your business.</p>
<h2>5. Financial realism</h2>
<p>Financial realism acknowledges that a company can want to do good, but unless they have the economics, they won’t survive to make an impact. For most startups, beginning with financial realism as a mindset and incrementalism as an approach will be key to success, enabling all businesses to contribute to a more resilient planet. For startups that prioritize environmentally friendly business practices alongside a product or service, this strategy can prevent goodness from becoming the enemy of greatness. Founders in this position can commit to a stage-by-stage sustainability plan, rather than expecting an overnight transformation. Investors understand the delicate balance between striving to meet green goals and keeping the lights on.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs looking to build a business that not only adopts eco-friendly practices but also has sustainability at its heart may have to consider starting in a niche industry or market that is less price-sensitive and ready for a solution today. Once that solution is firmly established, the business can build upon what they’ve created, rather than going big with something that doesn’t scale &#8212; and failing fast. Without an initial set of customers that value and love what you’re doing, you won’t get to the bigger play.</p>
<p>As the public and private sectors continue to address the climate crisis, sustainability will increasingly become a mandate rather than an option, and funding will increasingly flow to startups that have addressed potential environmental concerns. Unfortunately, pressure for companies to meet sustainability demands has led to “greenwashing” — the deceptive use of green marketing to persuade consumers that a company&#8217;s products, aims and policies are environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>Greenwashing has forced investors to look beyond mere words for action. As we move toward a more sustainable future, startups pursuing VC funding will need to prove to investors that sustainability is a priority across their entire organizations, aligning their outreach, public commitments and cultures with accountability and concrete examples of sustainable activities. Even if those examples are just steps toward larger goals, they will show investors and customers that startups are ready today to contribute to a greener and better tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Honeywell, which only recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/honeywell-says-it-will-soon-launch-the-worlds-most-powerful-quantum-computer/">announced</a> its entry into the quantum computing race, and <a href="https://cambridgequantum.com/">Cambridge Quantum Computing</a> (CQ), which focuses on building software for quantum computers, today <a href="https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/press/2021/06/honeywell-quantum-solutions-and-cambridge-quantum-computing-will-combine-to-form-worlds-largest-most-advanced-quantum-business">announced</a> that they are combining Honeywell&#8217;s Quantum Solutions (HQS) business with Cambridge Quantum in the form of a new joint venture.</p>
<p>Honeywell has long partnered with CQ and invested in the company last year, too. The idea here is to combine Honeywell&#8217;s hardware expertise with CQ&#8217;s software focus to build what the two companies call &#8220;the world&#8217;s highest-performing quantum computer and a full suite of quantum software, including the first and most advanced quantum operating system.&#8221;</p>
<p>The merged companies (or &#8216;combination,&#8217; as the companies&#8217; press releases calls it) expect the deal to be completed in the third quarter of 2021. Honeywell Chairman and CEO Darius Adamczyk will become the chairman of the new company. CQ founder and CEO Ilyas Khan will become the CEO and current Honeywell Quantum Solutions President Tony Uttley will remain in this role at the new company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea here is for Honeywell to spin off HQS and combine it with CQC to form a new company, while still playing a role in its leadership and finances. Honeywell will own a majority stake in the new company and invest between $270 and $300 million. It will also have a long-term agreement with the new company to build the ion traps at the core of its quantum hardware. CQ&#8217;s shareholders will own 45% of the new company.</p>

<p>&#8220;The new company will have the best talent in the industry, the world&#8217;s highest-performing quantum computer, the first and most advanced quantum operating system, and comprehensive, hardware-agnostic software that will drive the future of the quantum computing industry,&#8221; said Adamczyk. &#8220;The new company will be extremely well positioned to create value in the near-term within the quantum computing industry by offering the critical global infrastructure needed to support the sector&#8217;s explosive growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The companies argue that a successful quantum business will need to be supported by large-scale investments and offer a one-stop shop for customers that combines hardware and software. By combining the two companies now, they note, they&#8217;ll be able to build on their respective leadership positions in their areas of expertise and scale their businesses while also accelerate their R&amp;D and product roadmaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we first announced Honeywell’s <span class="il">quantum</span> business in 2018, we have heard from many investors who have been eager to invest directly in our leading technologies at the forefront of this exciting and dynamic industry – now, they will be able to do so,&#8221; Adamczyk said. &#8220;The new company will provide the best avenue for us to onboard new, diverse sources of capital at scale that will help drive rapid growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>CQ launched in 2014 and now has about 150 employees. The company raised a total of $72.8 million, including a $45 million round, which it announced last December. Honeywell, IBM Ventures, JSR Corporation, Serendipity Capital, Alvarium Investments and Talipot Holdings invested in this last round &#8212; which also means that IBM, which uses a different technology but, in many ways, directly competes with the new company, now owns a (small) part of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is thrilled to announce Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian is speaking at our Pittsburgh event on June 29. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/calling-all-yinzers-techcrunch-is-virtually-headed-to-pittsburgh/">You can register here</a>. It&#8217;s free to participate and hear President Jahanian&#8217;s interview.</p>
<p>President Jahanian is an outspoken advocate for science and innovation, making him perfect to headline our event focused on startup activity in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. Speaking to a House committee in April, Jahanian identified recent trends shaping research and development throughout the United States. Among those mentioned was a widening opportunity gap and rising economic inequality &#8212; topics that are also fundamentally shaping startups in Silicon Valley, Pittsburgh and elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carnegie Mellon’s decades-long leadership in research and education in AI and robotics has catalyzed an innovation ecosystem in the Pittsburgh region where entrepreneurship, creativity and placemaking intersect,&#8221; Jahanian told TechCrunch. &#8220;These emerging technologies are changing the way we farm, enabling millions to learn a new language, leading the race to develop self-driving vehicles, and even going to the moon. We are committed to empowering citizens across Pittsburgh to take part in the economic benefits of these innovations as they continue to transform our world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pittsburgh is a fantastic startup ecosystem quickly growing by leveraging its incredible universities, a welcoming local government and experienced investors. Though thousands of miles away, Pittsburgh has long contributed to Silicon Valley’s success through research and development. To TechCrunch, Pittsburgh represents a city leveraging its local assets to help build companies in and out of the area. We recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/08/how-duolingo-became-a-2-4b-language-unicorn/">published a deep profile on Duolingo</a> that highlights how the local Pittsburgh ecosystem helped turn the startup into a billion-dollar company.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Hardware Editor Brian Heater will be interviewing Jahanian. Heater was key in shaping and programming TechCrunch&#8217;s past events, including TC Sessions: Robotics, a cornerstone discipline at CMU.</p>
<p>TechCrunch City Spotlight: Pittsburgh features talks from Jahanian, local startups and local leaders. More names will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still looking for startups to participate in the event.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-introduces-new-developer-tools-and-technologies-to-create-even-better-apps/">announced</a> a significant update to RealityKit, its suite of technologies that allow developers to get started building AR (augmented reality) experiences. With the launch of RealityKit 2, Apple says developers will have more visual, audio and animation control when working on their AR experiences. But the most notable part of the update is how Apple&#8217;s new Object Capture API will allow developers to create 3D models in minutes using only an iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple noted during its developer address that one of the most difficult parts of making great AR apps was the process of creating 3D models. These could take hours and thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>With Apple&#8217;s new tools, developers will be able take a series of pictures using just an iPhone (or iPad, DSLR or even a drone, if they prefer) to capture 2D images of an object from all angles, including the bottom.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Then, using the Object Capture API on macOS Monterey, it only takes a few lines of code to generate the 3D model, Apple explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2163123" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163123" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2163123" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.02.03-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="378" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.02.03-PM.jpg 3332w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.02.03-PM.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.02.03-PM.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.02.03-PM.jpg?resize=768,427 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.02.03-PM.jpg?resize=680,378 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.02.03-PM.jpg?resize=1536,854 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.02.03-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1138 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.02.03-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2163123" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>To begin, developers would start a new photogrammetry session in RealityKit that points to the folder where they&#8217;ve captured the images. Then, they would call the process function to generate the 3D model at the desired level of detail. Object Capture allows developers to generate the USDZ files optimized for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/">AR Quick Look</a> &#8212; the system that lets developers add virtual, 3D objects in apps or websites on iPhone and iPad. The 3D models can also be added to AR scenes in Reality Composer in Xcode.</p>
<p>Apple said developers like Wayfair, Etsy and others are using Object Capture to create 3D models of real-world objects &#8212; an indication that online shopping is about to get a big AR upgrade.</p>
<p>Wayfair, for example, is using Object Capture to develop tools for their manufacturers so they can create a virtual representation of their merchandise. This will allow Wayfair customers to be able to preview more products in AR than they could today.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2163118" style="width: 623px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163118" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2163118" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.06.02-PM.jpg?w=613" alt="" width="613" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.06.02-PM.jpg 1398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.06.02-PM.jpg?resize=135,150 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.06.02-PM.jpg?resize=270,300 270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.06.02-PM.jpg?resize=768,853 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.06.02-PM.jpg?resize=613,680 613w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.06.02-PM.jpg?resize=1384,1536 1384w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-12.06.02-PM.jpg?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2163118" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple (screenshot of Wayfair tool))</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, Apple noted developers including Maxon and Unity are using Object Capture for creating 3D content within 3D content creation apps, such as Cinema 4D and Unity MARS.</p>
<p>Other <a href="https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/realitykit/">updates in RealityKit 2 include</a> custom shaders that give developers more control over the rendering pipeline to fine tune the look and feel of AR objects; dynamic loading for assets; the ability to build your own Entity Component System to organize the assets in your AR scene; and the ability to create player-controlled characters so users can jump, scale and explore AR worlds in RealityKit-based games.</p>
<p>One developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/MikkoH?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1402136906587070469%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">Mikko Haapoja</a> of Shopify, has been trying out the new technology (see below) and shared some real-world tests where he shot objects using an iPhone 12 Max via Twitter.</p>
<p>Developers who want to test it for themselves can leverage <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/creating_a_photogrammetry_command-line_app">Apple&#8217;s sample app</a> and install Monterey on their Mac to try it out. They can use the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/qlone-3d-scanner/id1229460906">Qlone camera app</a> or any other image capturing application they want to download from the App Store to take the photos they need for Object Capture, Apple says. In the fall, the Qlone Mac companion app will leverage the Object Capture API as well.</p>
<p>Apple says there are over 14,000 ARKit apps on the App Store today, which have been built by over 9,000 different developers. With the more than 1 billion AR-enabled iPhones and iPads being used globally, it notes that Apple offers the world&#8217;s largest AR platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Maryland and Montana have become the first U.S. states to pass laws that make it tougher for law enforcement to access DNA databases.</p>
<p>The new laws, which aim to safeguard the genetic privacy of millions of Americans, focus on consumer DNA databases, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/23andme/">23andMe</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ancestry/">Ancestry</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/gedmatch/">GEDmatch</a> and FamilyTreeDNA, all of which let people upload their genetic information and use it to connect with distant relatives and trace their family tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> While popular — 23andMe has more than three million users, and GEDmatch more than one million — m</span>any are unaware that some of these platforms share genetic data with third parties, from the pharmaceutical industry and scientists to law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>When used by law enforcement through a technique known as forensic genetic genealogy searching (FGGS), officers can upload DNA evidence found at a crime scene to make connections on possible suspects, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/27/golden-state-killer-gedmatch/">the most famous example being the identification of the Golden State Killer in 2018</a>. This saw investigators upload into GEDmatch a DNA sample taken at the time of a 1980 murder linked to the serial killer and subsequently identify distant relatives of the suspect — a critical breakthrough that led to the arrest of Joseph James DeAngelo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While law enforcement agencies have seen success in using consumer DNA databases to aid with criminal investigations, privacy advocates have long warned of the dangers of these platforms. Not only can these DNA profiles help trace distant ancestors, but the vast troves of genetic data they hold can divulge a person’s propensity for various diseases, predict addiction and drug response, and even be used by companies to create images of what they think a person looks like.</p>
<p>Ancestry and 23andMe have kept their genetic databases closed to law enforcement without a warrant; GEDmatch (which was acquired by a crime scene DNA company in December 2019) and FamilyTreeDNA have previously shared their databases with investigators.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DNA analysis site that led to the Golden State Killer issues a privacy warning to users&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/27/golden-state-killer-gedmatch/embed/#?secret=mVkmXMq1Cf" data-secret="mVkmXMq1Cf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To ensure the genetic privacy of the accused and their relatives, Maryland will, starting October 1, <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb0240">require law enforcement</a> to get a judge&#8217;s sign-off before using genetic genealogy, and will limit its use to serious crimes like murder, kidnapping and human trafficking. It also says that investigators can only use databases that explicitly tell users that their information could be used to investigate crimes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In Montana, where the new rules are somewhat narrower, <a href="https://legiscan.com/MT/text/HB602/2021">law enforcement would need a warrant</a> before using a DNA database unless the users waived their rights to privacy.</p>
<div class="css-53u6y8">
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">The laws “demonstrate that people across the political spectrum find law enforcement use of consumer genetic data chilling, concerning and privacy-invasive,” said Natalie Ram, a law professor at the University of Maryland. “I hope to see more states embrace robust regulation of this law enforcement technique in the future.”</p>
</div>
<p>The introduction of these laws has also been roundly welcomed by privacy advocates, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/maryland-and-montana-pass-nations-first-laws-restricting-law-enforcement-access">including the Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. Jennifer Lynch, surveillance litigation director at the EFF, described the restrictions as a “step in the right direction,” but called for more states — and the federal government — to crack down further on FGGS.</p>
<p>“Our genetic data is too sensitive and important to leave it up to the whims of private companies to protect it and the unbridled discretion of law enforcement to search it,” Lynch said.</p>
<p>“Companies like GEDmatch and FamilyTreeDNA have allowed and even encouraged law enforcement searches. Because of this, law enforcement officers are increasingly accessing these databases in criminal investigations across the country.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for 23andMe told TechCrunch: &#8220;We fully support legislation that provides consumers with stronger privacy protections. In fact we are working on legislation in a number of states to increase consumer genetic privacy protections. Customer privacy and transparency are core principles that guide 23andMe’s approach to responding to legal requests and maintaining customer trust. We closely scrutinize all law enforcement and regulatory requests and we will only comply with court orders, subpoenas, search warrants or other requests that we determine are legally valid. To date we have not released any customer information to law enforcement.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ancestry said it worked with lawmakers in Maryland to craft a law &#8220;that achieves their public policy goals while ensuring the privacy of our consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Protecting our customers’ privacy and being good stewards of their data is Ancestry’s highest priority and we do not voluntarily work with law enforcement. Ancestry will not share any information with law enforcement unless compelled to by valid legal process, such as a court order or search warrant,&#8221; a company spokesperson said.</p>
<p>GEDmatch and FamilyTreeDNA, both of which opt users into law enforcement searches by default, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/31/science/dna-police-laws.html">The New York Times</a> that they have no plans to change their existing policies around user consent in response to the new regulation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The buy now, pay later frenzy isn’t going anywhere as more consumers seek alternatives to credit cards to fund purchases.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And those purchases aren’t exclusive to luxuries such as Pelotons (ahem, Affirm) or jewelry someone might be treating themselves to online. A new fintech company is out to help consumers finance big-ticket items that are considered more &#8220;must have&#8221; than &#8220;nice to have.&#8221; And it’s just raised $14 million in Series A funding to help it advance on that goal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neal Desai (former CFO of Octane Lending) and James Schuler (who participated in Y Combinator’s accelerator program as a high schooler) founded New York City-based <a href="https://kafene.com">Kafene</a> in July 2019. The pair’s goal is to promote financial inclusion by meeting the needs of what it describes as the “consumers that are left behind by traditional lenders.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">More specifically, Kafene is focused on helping consumers with credit scores below 650 purchase retail items such as furniture, appliances and electronics with its buy now, pay later (BNPL) model. Consider it an &#8220;Affirm for the subprime,&#8221; says Desai.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Global Founders Capital and Third Prime Ventures co-led the round, which also included participation from Valar, Company.co, Hermann Capital, Gaingels, Republic Labs, Uncorrelated Ventures and FJ labs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Historically, if you could access credit, you could go to the bank or use a credit card,” Third Prime’s Wes Barton told TechCrunch. “But if you had some unexpected expense, and had to miss a payment with the bank, there would be repercussions and you could fall into a debt trap.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kafene’s &#8220;flexible ownership&#8221; model is designed to not let that happen to a consumer. If for some reason, someone has to forfeit on a payment, Kafene comes to pick up the item and the customer is no longer under obligation to pay for it moving forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The way it works is that Kafene buys the product from a merchant on a consumers’ behalf and rents it back to them over 12 months. If they make all payments, they own the item. If they make them earlier, they get a “significant” discount, and if they can’t, Kafene reclaims the item and takes the loan loss.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2163014" style="width: 231px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163014" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2163014" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg?w=180" alt="" width="221" height="369" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg 1158w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg?resize=90,150 90w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg?resize=180,300 180w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg?resize=768,1283 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg?resize=407,680 407w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg?resize=919,1536 919w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2163014" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kafene</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s a modern take on Rent-A-Center, which charges more money for inferior products, Desai believes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is also a superior product to credit cards, and the size of that market is massive,” Barton said. “We want to take a huge chunk of credit card business in time, and give consumers the flexibility to quit at any point in time, and fly free, if you will.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Such flexibility, Kafene claims, helps promote financial inclusion by giving a wider range of consumers options to alternative forms of credit at the point of sale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It also helps people boost their credit scores, according to Desai, because if they buy out of the loan earlier than the 12-month term, their credit score goes up because Kafene reports them as a positive payer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In any situation where they don’t steal the item, their credit score improves,” he said. “Even if they end up returning it because they can’t afford it. In the long run, they can have a better credit score to qualify for a traditional loan product.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kafene rolled out a beta of its financing product in December of 2019 and then had to pause in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company essentially “hibernated” from March to June 2020 and re-launched out of beta last July.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By October, Kafene stopped all enrollment with merchants because it had more demand that it could handle &#8212; largely fueled by more people being financially strained due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2021, the company was handling about $2 million a month in merchandise volume.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With its new capital, Kafene plans to significantly scale its existing lease-to-own financing business nationally, as well as to launch a direct-to-consumer virtual lease card.</p>
