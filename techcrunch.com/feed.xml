										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nasa" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nasa">NASA&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> head of human spaceflight Kathy Lueders joined us on stage at TechCrunch Sessions: Space, where she spoke to <a href="http://www.thespacegal.com">scientist and Netflix host Emily Calandrelli</a> about her work at the agency – including NASA&#8217;s progress on the Artemis program and the return of American astronauts to the surface of the Moon.</p>
<p>The 2024 target for NASA&#8217;s first Artemis Moon landing has been oft-repeated by the agency, and by current NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, who has confirmed that his tenure is ending in January once the Biden administration takes over the U.S. Presidency. But it&#8217;s also a timeline that has raised many an eyebrow among outside observers, and seems particularly challenging given setbacks resulting from stay-at-home orders and remote work measures implemented by NASA in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we had Commercial Crew, my goal was 2017,&#8221; Lueders said. &#8220;We did not fly in 2017, even though we were working super, super hard to get to 2017. Having that 2017 goal didn&#8217;t mean that I made stupid decisions just to get to 2017 – I still carefully went through and made the decisions. And then we ended up flying in 2020 – in fact we ended up flying [the mission] in 2019, which originally would have been our 2017 goal. People get are very fixated on 2024, because it is an important goal for us. But I also know that we&#8217;ll work through this carefully, and we will inform people of our progress along the way, just like we&#8217;ve done it every single other program out there. And we will fly when we&#8217;re ready to fly with the mission capability that we need to fly in a safe and effective manner.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lueders also addressed a question about diversity, and racial diversity in the agency, and it&#8217;s importance to the agency. Lueders is the first woman to ever occupy the role of the Associate Administrator of the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, who leads all human spaceflight activities across the agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want people to see themselves in what we&#8217;re doing, because the point of this is it&#8217;s not about NASA doing this anymore,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is about you doing it, and about you being able to do it. I think one of the most striking things that I got was a letter from a nine-year-old girl in India right after I got announced. And she said, &#8216;Because you have your job, I think I can be NASA Administrator someday.&#8217; And you saw the diversity in that Artemis crew, and we want people to see themselves out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lueders also talked about the<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-names-artemis-team-of-astronauts-eligible-for-early-moon-missions"> diversity present in NASA Artemis astronaut class</a>, which it just announced, and about the potential for who from that pool will be selected to actually crew the first lunar landing for Artemis.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of my favorite things is, I&#8217;m still not sure it can&#8217;t be two women,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We need to pick the right people.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-orbit servicing startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/orbit-fab" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="orbit-fab">Orbit Fab, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which bills itself as the company focused on creating &#8220;gas stations in space,&#8221; has added an additional investor to its seed funding round. The add-on investment comes from Munich Re Ventures (the corporate VC arm of Munich Re Group, one of the largest insurance companies in the world). Munich Re is a key provider of insurance for satellite operators in particular, offering policies that cover pre-launch, launch and on-orbit operations.</p>
<p>Orbit Fab, which was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/orbit-fab-gas-stations-in-space-seed-funding/">finalist in our TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield</a> in 2019, has designed a system that consists of what are essentially in-space tugs that can guide spacecraft on-orbit to refueling depots, to which they connect with the company&#8217;s custom fueling interface. It&#8217;s designed to be relatively easy to incorporate into new satellite designs, providing a way to easily refuel in space without requiring any special robotic systems for capture and docking.</p>
<p>The goal of the startup is to help create a more sustainable orbital commercial operating environment, extending the life of spacecraft, reducing debris and saving companies money. Bringing on Munich Re Ventures should provide it with significant advantages in terms of being able to build more sustainable, long-lived operational spacecraft into launch and operation risk models for satellite operators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When we look at standing up a propellant supply chain, so much of it is the financial model,&#8221; Orbit Fab co-founder and CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/daniel-faber" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="daniel-faber">Daniel Faber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> told me in an interview. How do we use this to move our customers&#8217; risk, to make sure that we&#8217;re moving capital expenditure to operational expenditure, and yet not introducing additional risk? [Munich Re] is all over it in terms of financial products and insurance and risk assessment, so that&#8217;s a great partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faber went on to explain that Munich Re Ventures Timur Davis began to show up at more and more space conferences, and Faber began to chat with him at these events. It turned out that the venture firm was putting together an investment thesis around in-space servicing and infrastructure, and Orbit Fab eventually became the first investment on the back of that new thesis.</p>
<p>The new investment brings Orbit Fab&#8217;s total seed raise to $6 million, including between $2 to $3 million in government funding on top of VC funds. The company has also now conceived and researched a &#8220;self-driving satellite&#8221; kit for docking that it has received <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/national-science-foundation" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="national-science-foundation">National Science Foundation <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> funding to do preliminary requirements development, and it&#8217;s now at the point where it can begin designing and building that out. 2021 looks to be a big year for many new companies in the space industry, and Orbit Fab with its new approach to sustainable, scalable satellites operations is definitely among them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another day, another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">major antitrust effort</a> seeking to dismantle the unprecedented power of the world&#8217;s biggest tech companies.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a group of 38 attorneys general announced a bipartisan lawsuit against <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> alleging the company has engaged in &#8220;illegal, anticompetitive conduct&#8221; to create a monopoly in search and search advertising.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google’s anticompetitive actions have protected its general search monopolies and excluded rivals, depriving consumers of the benefits of competitive choices, forestalling innovation, and undermining new entry or expansion,&#8221; Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said. “This lawsuit seeks to restore competition.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The state of Colorado is co-leading the lawsuit with Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee and Utah. New York Attorney General Letitia James called Google the &#8220;gatekeeper of the internet&#8221; and slammed the company for leveraging the personal data it collects to solidify its market dominance.</p>
<p>Compared to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">Texas-led suit against Google</a> announced yesterday, the second lawsuit represents a broader coalition of 35 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam. The new lawsuit, embedded below,  will run in parallel with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/">Justice Department&#8217;s own federal suit</a>, which also alleges that the company has abused its power to create and maintain a monopoly.</p>
<p>In the suit, the group of states accuses Google of entering into exclusionary agreements, disadvantaging specialized search sites like Expedia and Yelp and favoring its own business with its search engine marketing tools. They describe Google&#8217;s power as self-reinforcing, blaming the company for limiting consumers&#8217; options and in turn feeding it more valuable data on their behavior.</p>
<p>Citing violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the federal antitrust law meant to protect competition, the group of state attorneys asks the court to rebalance the advantages that Google enjoys and suggests &#8220;structural divestitures&#8221; as one course of action.</p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">46 state suit against Facebook</a> we saw last week, U.S. state efforts to challenge Google were split in two. Why are there <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">two separate antitrust lawsuits</a> going after Google over similar complaints? Likely because many state leaders weren&#8217;t eager to sign on to an effort led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who not only led the doomed long-shot effort to overturn election results in four states but is also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ken-paxton-austin-texas-crime-f8413d14842d848e69cf81bb4d2e87e2">currently being investigated by the FBI</a> for bribery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of virtual communications continues to hold a central place in our socially-distanced lives, and today it looks like one of the companies reaping some of the spoils is also reaping some funding out of it. <a href="http://discord.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>, the chat and communications platform wildly popular with gamers and, increasingly, many others, is raising up to $140 million in a Series H round, at a valuation that could be as high as $7 billion, according to paperwork filed by the company and unearthed by <a href="https://primeunicornindex.com/discord-secures-140m-doubles-valuation-to-7b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prime Unicorn Index</a>. We have attached the documentation at the end of this article.</p>
<p>The analysts&#8217; report appears to confirm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/discord-is-close-to-closing-a-round-that-would-value-the-company-at-up-to-7b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our own reporting</a> from some weeks ago. At the end of November, sources had confirmed to us that the company was raising at a valuation of up to $7 billion.</p>
<p>This latest fundraising has been rumored for a while, and some have described it as a &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/genuinfo/status/1328856563205828608?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-IPO round</a>&#8221; for the privately-backed startup. Prime Unicorn notes that Discord&#8217;s most recent price per share in the documentation is $280.2487, with the Series G priced at $144.1809.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear who is in this Series H, but previous investors in the company have included Greylock, Index Ventures, IVP, Spark Capital, Tencent and Benchmark, among others. With an extra $140 million, the total amount raised by the startup would stand at $420 million.</p>
<p>We have reached out to spokespeople for the company and will update as and when we hear back.</p>
<p>The fundraise, and the size of it, is a testament not just to how virtual communications tools continue to be an important part of our lives these days; but to the growth of Discord itself.</p>
<p>Discord made its name originally as a communications channel that could exist in an easy way alongside popular online games &#8212; a byproduct, perhaps, of how it first came into existence. Discord was started by Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy as part of their Hammer &amp; Chisel gaming studio as a way for them and their teams to communicate tactics and other details to each other while playing games (their own games, other people&#8217;s games, all games).</p>
<p>It proceeded to get lots of traction on Twitch and with e-sports players, environments where it might be especially interesting for both players and spectators to have a place to provide running commentary on what is going on.</p>
<p>But just as the biggest games and gameplay has mass-market, even casual, appeal, so can the platforms that gamers use to communicate. Discord&#8217;s growth has exploded in recent years, with m<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">onthly active users almost doubling to 120 million this year with 800,000 downloads a day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That&#8217;s in part down to Discord&#8217;s use alongside newly, virally popular games like </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/style/among-us.html">Among Us</a>; but also because it&#8217;s being used for more than just games.</p>
<p>The company had already raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/discord-now-has-a-3-5b-valuation-and-100m-for-a-sales-pitch-lighter-on-the-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 million on a $3.5 billion valuation</a> earlier this year, and at the time Citron and Vishnevskiy noted that the platform had already outgrown &#8212; or at least made room for much more than &#8212; its gaming roots:</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">“It turns out that, for a lot of you, it wasn’t just about video games anymore,” they<a href="https://blog.discord.com/your-place-to-talk-a7ffa19b901b"> noted</a>, describing Discord as “a place designed to hang out and talk in the comfort of your own communities and friends&#8230; a place to have genuine conversations and spend quality time with people, whether catching up, learning something or sharing ideas.”</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">That growth among &#8220;communities&#8221; hasn&#8217;t been without its teething pains. Discord has had a high profile, ongoing battle with unsavory elements like white supremacism on its platform. The company claims that this is on the wane, and that the platform is also a home for Black Lives Matter organizers, less politicised social media influencers, and more. Some are not so convinced, so perhaps it&#8217;s a problem that not a finished story and will continue to need to be tackled, much as it is on any social platform.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">“Discord is always on and always present among these groups on the far-right,” Joan Donovan, the lead researcher on media manipulation at the Data &amp; Society Research Institute, told <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/discord-safe-space-white-supremacists.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slate</a> some years ago. “It’s the place where they do most of the organizing of doxing and harassment campaigns.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting that this latest $140 million of funding &#8212; that is if it closes &#8212; is coming so swiftly on the heels of the last round, just six months later. The company and its investors have some clear ambitions to build out not just more, better and efficient  tools for gamers, but for people online at large, and that&#8217;s not cheap.</p>
<p>Some of that is happening already: witness yesterday&#8217;s news of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/discord-will-be-able-to-screen-share-from-ios-and-android-devices-starting-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord&#8217;s screen share functionality getting extended finally beyond desktop to iOS and Android</a> (an interesting area, considering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/twitter-acquires-screen-sharing-social-app-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter&#8217;s recent acquisition of Squad</a>).</p>
<p>“Rather than throwing raw content at you, like Facebook, [Discord] provides a shared experience for you and your friends,&#8221; said Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, which led the $100 million round earlier this year. &#8220;We’ll come to appreciate that Discord does for social conversation what Slack has done for professional conversation.”</p>
<p>Prime Unicorn note that the terms in the Series H include &#8220;a pari passu liquidation preference with all other preferred, and conventional convertible meaning they will not participate with common stock if there are remaining proceeds.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://geneme.eu/">GeneMe</a>, Poland-based biotechnology company with a COVID-19 test, has secured a €5.2M round of seed funding led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/robin-tombs">Robin Tombs</a>, co-Founder of <a href="https://www.yoti.com/">Yoti</a> and previously of Gamesys, and other angel investors.</p>
<p>The startup has developed and patented a universal protein (polymerase) for RT-LAMP testing, which allows the production of highly accurate, rapid, molecular genetic COVID tests. It has three molecular NAAT COVID-19 tests: FRANKD, SAVD, and ICED. FRANKD is CE IVD-approved and FDA EUA-applied, and its solution is already utilized in over twenty countries. FRANKD has been identified, through official research made by the Scottish government, as the most accurate, rapid COVID-19 test on the market. The FRANKD solution has already been used by Heathrow Airport, Virgin Atlantic and TV show Britain’s Got Talent.</p>
<p>Dawid Nidzworski, CEO of GeneMe said: “We’re interested not only in health issues, but also in genetic predispositions, such as talents, sports abilities, learning problems, or caffeine metabolism. In the future, everyone will be able to conduct genetic analysis at home.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Robin Tombs, Co-Founder of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yoti" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yoti">Yoti <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said: “GeneMe’s innovative approach will be highly disruptive over coming years, enabling more regular testing at point of care at much lower cost.”</p>
<p>GeneMe is a spin-oout from The Institute of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/biotechnology-4c46" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="biotechnology-4c46">Biotechnology <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Molecular Medicine (IBMM), an independent biomedical research institution.</p>
<p>Recently, the company announced a partnership with U.S.-based BIOLYPH, the world leader in lyophilization services, to scale up FRANKD and SAVD significantly.</p>
<p>GeneMe’s patented technology simplifies the entire testing procedure compared to standard laboratory-based RT-PCR tests. RT-LAMP tests are more effective, which means results can be trusted. GeneMe’s testing technology can also be assembled at point-of-care, which makes it possible to integrate highly accurate testing stations at places of work and in locations with high throughput, such as international borders.</p>
<p>The global COVID-19 diagnostics market size is estimated at $84.4B in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.1% from 2021 to 2027 (Grand View Research).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month, Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">announced</a> it would soon begin testing a new social experience on its platforms involving audio-only chat rooms, similar the sometimes <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/on-community-moderation">controversial</a> startup called Clubhouse. Today, Twitter Spaces, as the product is now being called, is launching into private beta testing. During this time, the product will be limited to select individuals, largely from under-represented backgrounds, Twitter says.</p>
<p>As the company had explained in November, it would be critical to getting safety right in order for people to feel comfortable in these sorts of spaces. That&#8217;s a difficult challenge to overcome &#8212; particularly for a company like Twitter which some have argued has overly favored free speech to limit cries of censorship, even when such speech made some afraid to speak up on the platform to the potential for abuse, bullying and cancel culture.</p>
<p>Though audio-based social networking is still a relatively new concept, in its current iteration of private mobile-social &#8220;spaces,&#8221; it&#8217;s already been proven difficult to moderate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clubhouse, though still in invite-only testing phase, has seen several high-profile incidents of moderation failure, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/8/21316172/clubhouse-content-moderation-taylor-lorenz-harassment-abuse?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">the harassment of a New York Times reporter,</a> and another conversation that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495419/clubhouse-conversation-antisemitism-content-moderation">delved into anti-Semitism</a>. And it hasn&#8217;t publicly launched.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s test hopes to discover where issues impacting user safety and comfort can be addressed.</p>
<p>The test will run on iOS during the beta, offering the opportunity for users to participate in host-moderated audio conversations between two or more people.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2079726" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2079726" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2079726" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="474" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg 1832w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg?resize=768,535 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg?resize=680,474 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1070 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2079726" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>There are two ways to create a Space, Twitter says. You can either press and hold the compose button in the lower right corner of the screen, or you can create a Space through the Fleet creation screen by swiping right.</p>
<p>Hosts on Spaces will also be able to invite people to join a Space through DMs, by tweeting links, or by sharing a link elsewhere. As the test rolls out, everyone can see and join Spaces when they&#8217;re invited to do so, but hosts will control who&#8217;s speaking. Soon, hosts will also have more options to control conversations.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The test additionally adds new reaction emojis &#8211; the 100, raised hand, fist, peace sign and wave &#8212; along with reporting and blocking tools, a &#8220;very early version&#8221; of automatic transcriptions, and the ability to share tweets into a Space. Many of these features <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/twitters-audio-spaces-test-includes-transcriptions-speaker-controls-and-reporting-features/">were already spotted last month</a> by eagle-eyed reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane">Jane Manchun Wong.</a> But today, Twitter is confirming they will be part of the beta test at launch.</p>
<p>The company will also tweet about Spaces from a dedicated Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/twitterspaces">@TwitterSpaces</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic is surging in America once more. If this past year is any indication, it will hurt all of us — but communities of color will continue to suffer disproportionately.</p>
<p>Black and brown folks will make up more of the sick and the dying, and Black and brown businesses and employees will make up more of the people struggling financially.</p>
<p>Here is the good news: Interest in finding common ground and concrete solutions is also surging. That means there are some paths out of the mess we are in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			America’s biggest, best-funded, most-profitable companies are struggling to hire and retain diverse talent.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Let’s take stock: The longer the pandemic lasts, the more it could accelerate ongoing trends. Automation and advanced computing was changing how we work and undermining livelihoods before COVID-19, but by 2030, technology and automation will negatively affect hundreds of thousands of jobs that exist today.</p>
<p>The situation is worse for communities of color. Because people of color are overrepresented in fields that are likely to be automated, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-future-of-work-in-black-america">a McKinsey report</a> estimated that 23.1% of African Americans and 25.1% of Hispanic Americans will see their jobs disappear or transform in the next decade. Even before COVID-19, the situation was bleak.</p>
<p>Perhaps this shift will create new, high-tech jobs, or those same people can retrain, retool and find employment in the economy of the future?</p>
<p>In practice, it is not nearly so easy. In 2019, the average cost for online coding bootcamps was $14,623 per person. Even with loans, installment plans or income-sharing agreements, that is far beyond the reach of many of the people whose current jobs are going away.</p>
<p>The pandemic is making this worse. Nearly 80% of low-income households do not have enough savings to last three months, and a third of Americans will have trouble paying their bills this month.</p>
<p>Waiting for the good news? America’s biggest, best-funded, most-profitable companies are struggling to hire and retain diverse talent. The good news is that they know it. They know they cannot compete without the genius in underrepresented communities, and they know they are not doing well enough right now.</p>
<p>Many companies will spend an average of $20,000 just on recruiting fees for a single IT hire, but hiring an IT candidate from a diverse community can cost three times as much, and once hired, there is a massive retention problem. Since 2016, the retention rate of Black and Latinx employees in Big Tech has fallen from 7% to 5%. There is a revolving door of diverse talent entering and leaving organizations.</p>
<p>In other words, you have a whole bunch of talented, creative people crying out for high-tech jobs — and a whole bunch of powerhouse, innovative companies desperate to hire and hold onto talent and creativity.</p>
<p>These overlapping needs mean we can find common ground. One model for this was the Dream Corps TECH Town Hall this month, where activists and educators from underrepresented communities shared panels with industry leaders. Instead of lobbing bombs at each other, both groups came to talk about the problems they face and how they can work together.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>For instance, industry and educational leaders can devote resources to scholarships and training programs that come with job guarantees. Activists and CEOs can both push for universal broadband access, especially in the midst of a pandemic that is damaging learning opportunities for children, so that the next generation of coders has a shot at success.</p>
<p>Untapped talent in underrepresented communities can help companies avoid algorithmic bias and compete in a diverse, global world, and companies can help people thrive as the economy changes.</p>
<p>This common-ground approach is built on the recognition that both sides need each other in order to succeed. It can be a model for other thorny problems and produce necessary solutions. The pandemic is surging once more — but so is the demand for common ground. We can choose how we respond.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["There’s not a single organization who can claim cybersecurity perfection."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s the nightmare scenario that has worried cybersecurity experts for years.</p>
<p>Since at least March, hackers likely working for Russian intelligence have embedded themselves without detection inside the unclassified networks of several U.S. government agencies and hundreds of companies. Sen. Richard Blumenthal appeared to confirm <a href="https://twitter.com/kevincollier/status/1339040516881731586?s=21">in a tweet</a> that Russia was to blame, citing a classified congressional briefing.</p>
<p>It began Tuesday with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cybersecurity-firm-fireeye-says-it-was-hacked-by-a-nation-state/">news of a breach</a> at cybersecurity giant FireEye, which confirmed it was hacked by a &#8220;sophisticated threat actor&#8221; using a &#8220;novel combination of techniques not witnessed by us or our partners in the past.” The hackers, <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/fireeye-shares-details-of-recent-cyber-attack-actions-to-protect-community.html">FireEye said</a>, were primarily interested in information on its government customers, but that they also stole its offensive hacking tools that it uses to stress test its customers&#8217; systems against cyberattacks.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Since the hackers had several months of undetected access to several federal agencies, it&#8217;s going to be virtually impossible to know exactly what sensitive government information has been stolen.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fireeye" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fireeye">FireEye <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> breach was nothing short of audacious; FireEye has a reputation for being the first company that corporate cyberattack victims will call. But then the news broke that the U.S. Treasury, State, Commerce, the National Institute of Health and Homeland Security — the agency tasked with protecting the government from cyberattacks — had all been infiltrated.</p>
<p>Each of the victims has one thing in common: All are customers of U.S. software firm <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/solarwinds" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="solarwinds">SolarWinds, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> whose network management tools are used across the U.S. government and Fortune 500 companies. FireEye&#8217;s blog <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html">explaining the breach</a> — which didn&#8217;t say how it discovered its own intrusion — said the hackers had broken into SolarWinds&#8217; network and planted a backdoor in its Orion software, which helps companies monitor their networks and fleets of devices, and pushed it directly to customer networks with a tainted software update.</p>
<p>SolarWinds said up to 18,000 customers had downloaded the compromised Orion software update, giving the hackers unfettered access to their networks, but that it was unlikely all or even most had been actively infiltrated.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Jake Williams, a former NSA hacker and founder of Rendition Infosec, said hackers would have gone for the targets that got their &#8220;biggest bang for their buck,&#8221; referring to FireEye and government targets. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt in my mind that had the Russians not targeted FireEye we would not know about this,&#8221; Williams said, praising the security giant&#8217;s response to the attacks. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to find more government agencies that were breached. They&#8217;re not detecting it independently. This only got discovered because FireEye got hit,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The motives of the hackers aren&#8217;t known, nor do we know yet if any other major private companies or government departments had been hacked. Microsoft on Wednesday <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/">seized an important domain</a> used by the attackers, which may give the company some visibility into other victims that have been actively infiltrated.</p>
<p>Russia, for its part, has denied any involvement.</p>

<p>These kinds of so-called &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/china-spy-hack-chip-bloomberg-supply-chain/">supply chain attacks</a>&#8221; are difficult to defend against and can be near impossible to detect. You might imagine someone sneaking a hardware implant into a device on the manufacturing line. In this case, hackers injected backdoor code in the software&#8217;s development process.</p>
<p>Supply chain attacks are rare but can have devastating consequences. Last year hackers broke into computer maker Asus&#8217; network and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/25/asus-update-backdoor/">similarly pushed a backdoor</a> to &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of Asus computers through its own software update tool. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/15/uk-accuses-russia-of-2017s-notpetya-ransomware-attacks/">NotPetya ransomware attack</a> that spread across the globe in 2017 spread by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/">pushing malicious</a> code <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/">through the update feature</a> in a popular Ukrainian accounting software, used by almost everyone who files taxes in the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Allan Jones&#8217;s first startup was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/01/sciences-triple-thread-brings-personalized-commerce-to-retailers-powers-mens-clothing-site-fourth-and-grand/">Fourth and Grand</a>, a Trunk Club-like service backed by the venture studio and accelerator, Science, out of Santa Monica.</p>
<p>While the business didn&#8217;t work out, it put the budding young entrepreneur (and college dropout) on a path that would lead him to launch the Los Angeles-based startup <a href="https://get.bambee.com/hr/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=sem-br&amp;utm_campaign=brand&amp;utm_content=cmp-1754081434%7Cadg-66974496845%7Ccr-341328739390%7Cdev-c%7Ctarget-kwd-295419632816&amp;utm_term=bambee&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA63HyMDe_XF8hm-eFcCKaCRccaxX6NmTEeiZE_CW5toQKDnBnBn-Y1xoCcJkQAvD_BwE">Bambee</a>, a company that lets small businesses give their employees access to the same kinds of human resources services that large companies have.</p>
<p>What sets Bambee apart from companies like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zenefits" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zenefits">Zenefits <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and other companies looking to provide human resources services is its focus on the needs of employees as well as employers. Many tools are focused on recruitment, talent management and benefits management from the employer perspective. Bambee bills itself as handling the softer, human side of human resources, rather than the business processes that surround it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jones said that the inspiration for the business goes back to watching his own father, who owned a local minimarket in Upland, Calif., deal with a nuisance wrongful termination lawsuit from a disgruntled employee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every small business in the country should have access to a human resources professional,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;When I was a kid my dad owned a small minimarket and got sued for wrongful termination and he had to dip into my college education fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the course of working with LA startups including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/docstoc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="docstoc">Docstoc <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and ZipRecruiter, Jones realized that the precarity he had witnessed in his father&#8217;s situation as an employer carried over to employees as well. &#8220;Vulnerability existed for both sides,&#8221; Jones said.</p>
<p>Observers need look no further than the situations of employees at startups like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wework-857c" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wework-857c">WeWork, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Uber, Zenefits, or even Away, to know that a lack of human resources early in a company&#8217;s existence can snowball into larger and larger problems later.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="khkK6Iz62c"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resigns/">Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigns</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigns&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resigns/embed/#?secret=khkK6Iz62c" data-secret="khkK6Iz62c" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;This is a pervasive thing across 5.6 million companies,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;Once you realize that notion … and that there&#8217;s no solution … We thought that was insane.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bambee, Jones claims, offers 80% of what a full-time human resources professional can offer at a much smaller fraction of the price.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For $99 a month, Bambee provides its clients with their own dedicated HR manager &#8212; from</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">creating and implementing the right HR policies, collecting electronic signatures in its app, and navigating the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complex regulatory world of compliance, the company said. These </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">managers can lead </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">internal investigations, hires, onboarding, furloughs and implementation of return to work procedures.</span></p>
<p>Human resources professionals can be wellsprings of information beyond simply ensuring that management misbehavior doesn&#8217;t metastasize into a company-wide debacle. They also provide information on how to furlough employees, how to rehire staff and how to account for both situations. In the response to the COVID-19 pandemic that information became critical.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why companies like Stojo Projects, Knife Aid and Hank&#8217;s Bagels all use the company&#8217;s service. Bambee has around 10,000 customers just like them nationwide and has raised $32 million to date. In October, the company closed a $15 million round led by <a href="https://qedinvestors.com/">QED Investors</a> with participation from previous investors including AlphaEdison.</p>
<p>And Jones thinks there&#8217;s lots of room to grow. Once the company has locked in the soft services of actually managing human resources, the more commoditized tools of employee benefits management, salaries and the rest should be easy. Other financial instruments could come off the back end as well, Jones said.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of my ambition here is to better equitize the relationship between employee and employer,&#8221; Jone said. &#8220;Start at the basics and better define those relationships. Once we saw how pervasively undefined and disrespected the relationships between employee and employer world. The HR service component where the trust equity is built … how much can you expand what you can get these companies to do?&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid the rise of remote selling due to the pandemic, <a href="http://Walnut.io">Walnut</a>, billing itself as a &#8220;Wix for Sales teams,&#8221; has raised $3.5 million from SV Angel (Ron and Topher Conway) and A.Capital by Ronny Conway and former a16z partners. This brings its total amount raised to $6 million.

<p>Walnut is solving the friction between sales and back-end teams and the problem of sales demos that break during calls. A sales rep logs in to the main dashboard/product they are trying to sell and uses Walnut to choose pages and features that will be disconnected from the back end and appear as front end in Walnut&#8217;s cloud, then edit to match it to the specific client. It&#8217;s like building web pages but for sales pitches.</p>
<p>It’s currently working with enterprise clients like Varonis and Adobe. While it competes with <a href="http://Gong.io">Gong.io</a>, Walnut is hoping that its more technical approach of disconnecting front end and back end will aid its progress.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in 2018, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2018/08/29/cncf-receives-9-million-cloud-credit-grant-from-google/">announced</a> that it would provide $9 million in Google Cloud Platform credits &#8212; divided over three years &#8212; to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) to help it run the development and distribution infrastructure for the Kubernetes project. Previously, Google owned and managed those resources for the community. Today, the two organizations announced that Google is adding on to this grant with another $3 million annual donation to the CNCF to &#8220;help ensure the long-term health, quality and stability of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kubernetes" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kubernetes">Kubernetes <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and its ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Google notes, the funds will go to the testing and infrastructure of the Kubernetes project, which currently sees over 2,300 monthly pull requests that trigger about 400,000 integration test runs, all of which use about 300,000 core hours on GCP.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really happy that we&#8217;re able to continue to make this investment,&#8221; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/aparna-sinha" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="aparna-sinha">Aparna Sinha, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a director of product management at Google and the chairperson of the CNCF governing board, told me. &#8220;We know that it is extremely important for the long-term health, quality and stability of Kubernetes and its ecosystem and we&#8217;re delighted to be partnering with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation on an ongoing basis. At the end of the day, the real goal of this is to make sure that developers can develop freely and that Kubernetes, which is of course so important to everyone, continues to be an excellent, solid, stable standard for doing that.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sinha also noted that Google contributes a lot of code to the project, with 128,000 code contributions in the last twelve months alone. But on top of these technical contributions, the team is also making in-kind contributions through community engagement and mentoring, for example, in addition to the kind of financial contributions the company is announcing today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Kubernetes project has been growing so fast &#8212; the releases are just one after the other,&#8221; said <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/priyanka-sharma-2" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="priyanka-sharma-2">Priyanka Sharma, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/priyanka-sharma-takes-over-the-leadership-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation/">General Manager of the CNCF</a>. &#8220;And there are big changes, all of this has to run somewhere. [&#8230;] This specific contribution of the $3 million, that&#8217;s where that comes in. So the Kubernetes project can be stress-free, [knowing] they have enough credits to actually run for a full year. And that security is critical because you don&#8217;t want Kubernetes to be wondering where will this run next month. This gives the developers and the contributors to the project the confidence to focus on feature sets, to build better, to make Kubernetes ever-evolving.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that while both Google and the CNCF are putting their best foot forward here, there have been some questions around Google&#8217;s management around the Istio service mesh project, which was incubated by Google and IBM a few years ago. At some point in 2017, there was a proposal to bring it under the CNCF umbrella, but that never happened. This year, Istio became one of the founding projects of Open Usage Commons, though that group is mostly concerned with trademarks, not with project governance. And while all of this may seem like a lot of inside baseball &#8212; and it is &#8212; but it had some members of the open-source community question <a href="https://thenewstack.io/googles-management-of-the-istio-service-mesh-raises-questions-in-the-cloud-native-community/">Google&#8217;s commitment to organizations like the CNCF</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google contributes to a lot of open-source projects. [&#8230;] There&#8217;s a lot of them, many are with open-source foundations under the Linux Foundation, many of them are otherwise,&#8221; Sinha said when I asked her about this. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing new, or anything to report about anything else. In particular, this discussion &#8212; and our focus very much with the CNCF here is on Kubernetes, which I think &#8212; out of everything that we do &#8212; is by far the biggest contribution or biggest amount of time and biggest amount of commitment relative to anything else.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-owned <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> today announced that it is doing away with all non-essential cookies on its platform. Thanks to this, starting today, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/github" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="github">GitHub <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.com and its subdomains will not feature a cookie banner anymore, either. That&#8217;s one less cookie banner you&#8217;ll have to click away to get your work done.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one likes cookie banners,&#8221; GitHub CEO Nat Friedman writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;But cookie banners are everywhere!&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason for that, of course, is because of regulations like GDPR in the U.S. and the EU&#8217;s directive to give users the right to refuse the use of cookies that reduce their online privacy. The result, even though these regulations have the users&#8217; best interest in mind, is the constant barrage of cookie banners you experience today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;At <span class="il">GitHub</span>, we want to protect developer privacy, and we find cookie banners irritating, so we decided to look for a solution. After a brief search, we found one: just don’t use any non-essential cookies. Pretty simple, really,&#8221; Friedman writes.</p>
<p>To be fair, for a service like GitHub, it may be a bit easier to do away with cookies than for most sites &#8212; and especially content sites (and yes, I&#8217;m well aware that you probably had to click away from a cookie popup when you came to TechCrunch, too. Feel free to tell me about the irony of that in the comments). GitHub, after all, has a paid product and an audience that likely uses extensions to block trackers and unnecessary cookies anyway. Because of this, the tracking data it gathered was probably not all that useful anyway. GitHub is one of the first large sites to make this move, though, and may be able to set a bit of a trend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, day one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/#tickets">TC Sessions: Space 2020</a>, was (brace yourself) out of this world. Bad puns aside, today’s lineup promises even more in-depth interviews, Q&amp;As and breakout sessions with the top experts in the space industry. It also includes a pitch-off and plenty of networking opportunities to connect with the leading movers and shakers across public, private and defense sectors.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine a more complex or expensive industry, and you’ll need all the tips, insight, guidance — and funding — you can get to successfully launch your space startup. Here’s a quick look at just some of day two’s presentations and opportunities designed to help you build a successful business. Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/#2f65e915-5963-4a04-be6a-667c01da1e6d">the complete event agenda</a> to plan your day.</p>
<p><strong>Timely tip:</strong> The agenda automatically reflects the time zone in which you’re currently located.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Fast Money — Advancing Space Technology with NASA SBIR:</strong> Learn about the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs powered by NASA. Jenn Gustetic (NASA) and Lydia Etters (The Aerospace Corporation)</p>

<p><strong>From Idea to Orbit:</strong> Rocket Lab has quickly become one of the most sought-after launch providers in the world. Founder and CEO Peter Beck will discuss the company’s approach to making space more accessible, from cheaper, faster launches to its new satellite platform.</p>
<p><strong>Bridging Today and Tomorrow&#8217;s Tech:</strong> Corporate VC funds are a key source of investment for space startups, in part because they often involve partnerships that help generate revenue as well, and because they understand the timelines involved. We’ll talk about how they fit in with more standard venture to power the ecosystem. Don’t forget to submit your questions for the panel! Meagan Crawford (SpaceFund) and J. Christopher Moran (Lockheed Martin Ventures).</p>
<p><strong>University Showcase — Boldly Innovating in Space, for Space (Part Two):</strong> Part one was fascinating, and you don’t want to miss part two of this university research showcase.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Businesses today feel, more than ever before, the imperative to have flexible e-commerce strategies in place, able to connect with would-be customers wherever they might be. That market driver has now led to a significant growth round for a startup that is helping the larger of these businesses, including those targeting the B2B market, build out their digital sales operations with more agile, responsive e-commerce solutions.</p>
<p><a href="http://spryker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spryker</a>, which provides a full suite of e-commerce tools for businesses &#8212; starting with a platform to bring a company&#8217;s inventory online, through to tools to analyse and measure how that inventory is selling and where, and then adding on voice commerce, subscriptions, click &amp; collect, IoT commerce, and other new features and channels to improve the mix &#8212; has closed a round of $130 million.</p>
<p>It plans to use the funding to expand its own technology tools, as well as grow internationally. The company makes revenues in the mid-8 figures (so, around $50 million annually) and some 10% of its revenues currently come from the U.S. The plan will be to grow that business as part of its wider expansion, tackling a market for e-commerce software that is estimated to be worth some $7 billion annually.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series C was led by TCV &#8212; the storied investor that has backed giants like Facebook, Airbnb, Netflix, Spotify and Splunk, as well as interesting, up-and-coming e-commerce &#8220;plumbing&#8221; startups like Spryker, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/retail-technology-platform-relex-raises-200m-from-tcv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relex</a> and more. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/spryker-announces-22-million-growth-capital-investment-677062933.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Previous backers</a> One Peak and Project A Ventures also participated.</p>
<p>We understand that this latest funding values <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/berlin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="berlin">Berlin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-based Spryker at over $500 million.</p>
<p>Spryker today has around 150 customers, global businesses that run the gamut from recognised fashion brands through to companies that, as Boris Lokschin, who co-founded the company with Alexander Graf (the two share the title of co-CEOs) put it, are &#8220;hidden champions, leaders and brands you have never heard about doing things like selling silicone isolations for windows.&#8221; The roster includes Metro, Aldi Süd, Toyota and <a href="https://spryker.com/en/customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many others</a>.</p>
<p>The plan will be to continue to support and grow its wider business building e-commerce tools for all kinds of larger companies, but in particular Spryker plans to use this tranche of funding to double down specifically on the B2B opportunity, building more agile e-commerce storefronts and in some cases also developing marketplaces around that.</p>
<p>One might assume that in the world of e-commerce, consumer-facing companies need to be the most dynamic and responsive, not least because they are facing a mass market and all the whims and competitive forces that might drive users to abandon shopping carts, look for better deals elsewhere, or simply get distracted by the latest notification of a TikTok video or direct message.</p>
<p>For consumer-facing businesses, making sure they have the latest adtech, marketing tech, and tools to improve discovery and conversion is a must.</p>
<p>It turns out that business-facing businesses are no less immune to their own set of customer distractions and challenges &#8212; particularly in the current market, buffeted as it is by the global health pandemic and its economic reverberations. They, too, could benefit from testing out new channels and techniques to attract customers, help them with discovery and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve discovered that the model for success for B2B businesses online is not about different people, and not about money. They just don&#8217;t have the tooling,&#8221; said Graf. &#8220;Those that have proven to be more successful are those that are able to move faster, to test out everything that comes to mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spryker positions itself as the company to help larger businesses do this, much in the way that smaller merchants have adopted solutions from the likes of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shopify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shopify">Shopify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>In some ways, it almost feels like the case of Walmart versus <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> playing itself out across multiple verticals, and now in the world of B2B.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our biggest DIY customers [which would have previously served a mainly trade-only clientele] had to build a marketplace because of restrictions in their brick and mortar assortment, and in how it could be accessed,&#8221; Lokschin said. &#8220;You might ask yourself, who really needs more selection? But there are new providers like <a href="https://www.manomano.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mano Mano</a> and Amazon, both offering millions of products. Older companies then have to become marketplaces themselves to remain competitive.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems that even Spryker itself is not immune from that marketplace trend: part of the funding will be to develop a technology AppStore, where it can itself offer third-party tools to companies to complement what it provides in terms of e-commerce tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;We integrate with hundreds of tech providers, including 30-40 payment providers, all of the essential logistics networks,&#8221; Lokschin said.</p>
<p>Spryker is part of that category of e-commerce businesses known as &#8220;headless&#8221; providers &#8212; by which they mean those using the tools do so by way of API-based architecture and other easy-to-integrate modules delivered through a &#8220;PaaS&#8221; (clould-based Platform as a Service) model.</p>
<p>It is not alone in that category: There have been a number of others playing on the same concept to emerge both in Europe and the U.S. They include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/italys-commerce-layer-raises-6m-led-by-benchmark-for-its-headless-e-commerce-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commerce Layer</a> in Italy; another startup out of Germany called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/commercetools-raises-145m-from-insight-for-shopify-style-e-commerce-apis-for-large-enterprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commercetools</a>; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/shogun-raises-35m-to-help-brands-take-on-amazon-with-faster-and-better-sites-of-their-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shogun</a> in the U.S.</p>
<p>Spryker&#8217;s argument is that by being a newer company (founded in 2018) it has a more up-to-date stack that puts it ahead of older startups and more incumbent players like SAP and Oracle.</p>
<p>That is part of what attracted TCV and others in this round, which was closed earlier than Spryker had even planned to raise (it was aiming for Q2 of next year) but came on good terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The commerce infrastructure market has been a high priority for TCV over the years. It is a large market that is growing rapidly on the back of e-commerce growth,&#8221; said Muz Ashraf, a principal at TCV, to TechCrunch. &#8220;We have invested in across other areas of the commerce stack, including payments (Mollie, Klarna), underlying infrastructure (Redis Labs) as well as systems of engagement (ExactTarget, Sitecore). Traditional offline vendors are increasingly rethinking their digital commerce strategy, more so given what we are living through, and that further acts as a market accelerant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having tracked Spryker for a while now, we think their solution meets the needs of enterprises who are increasingly looking for modern solutions that allow them to live in a best-of-breed world, future-proofing their commerce offerings and allowing them to provide innovative experiences to their consumers.&#8221;</p>

<p>As 2020 comes to a close, the cryptocurrency world is experiencing another <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=bitcoin,ethereum,defi">late-year surge of consumer interest</a> as prices <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/bitcoin-passes-20k-and-reaches-all-time-high/">climb in value</a>. Bitcoin is over $23,000 as I write to you, an all-time high. Ethereum&#8217;s cryptocurrency has recovered sharply as well, returning to mid-2018 prices.</p>

<p>These gains have created a huge amount of wealth for crypto holders. According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/bitcoin-passes-20k-and-reaches-all-time-high/">CoinMarketCap</a>, after falling under $140 billion in mid-March during the market selloff surrounding the beginning of COVID-19&#8217;s battering of America, the value of all cryptos has surged to nearly $659 billion.</p>

But your Twitter feed is once again rife with notes about crypto and some of your friends have become insufferable once again.</p>
<p>The tweets and the friends have something of a point. This morning I went around the internet with a basket, collecting information about active bitcoin wallets, the distributed app (Dapp) market, the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) space and other aspects to get a picture of what&#8217;s going on beyond mere price records.</p>
<p>After all, the price of every damn thing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/in-public-and-private-markets-cloud-earnings-and-valuations-heat-up/">is inflated today</a>, so seeing bitcoin set an all-time-high felt more appropriate than strange. Does the data show that there&#8217;s activity behind the valuation hype?</p>
<h2>A quick look around the world of crypto</h2>
<p>We have a few metrics to peek at, but let&#8217;s start with some old bitcoin-flavored favorites.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unique bitcoin addresses</strong> used, via Blockchain.info: <strong>Modestly bullish</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Per the charting section of <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-unique-addresses">Blockchain.info</a>, bitcoin unique addresses used &#8212; a proxy for the coin&#8217;s popularity &#8212; is up some in recent weeks, and up more generally in 2020. It remains below historical highs.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever used a Snapchat or Instagram filter, you know that one of the popular use cases for AR (augmented reality) is to change up your appearance with virtual makeup &#8212; like a different shade of lipstick or eyeshadow, for example. Today, Google is moving into this space, as well, with the <a href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/shopping-beauty-product-try-it-google/">launch</a> of an AR-powered cosmetics try-on experience on Google Search. The company is working partnership with top brands like L’Oreal, Estee Lauder, MAC Cosmetics, Black Opal, and Charlotte Tilbury, to allow consumers to try on makeup shades across a range of models with various skin tones or even on themselves using their front-facing camera on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Google created the new feature with help from data partners <a href="https://modiface.com/">ModiFace</a>, which offers AR tech to beauty brands, and <a href="https://www.perfectcorp.com/business">Perfect Corp</a>, makers of the popular YouCam Makeup app and other AR beauty tech.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088571" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088571" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2088571" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/E814_AR_Beauty_Gifs_Eyes_v03.gif?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088571" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, when consumers search for a particular lipstick or eyeshadow product on Google &#8212; like &#8220;L’Oreal’s Infallible Paints Metallic Eyeshadow,&#8221; for example &#8212; they&#8217;ll come across the virtual try-on shopping experience at the top of their search results. From here, they can click through photos of models representing a range of skin tone to help compare the shades and find the right product for you.</p>
<p>To see the product on yourself, another new option will enable you to do so with your phone&#8217;s camera. In this interface, a variety of shades are shown at the bottom of the camera feed for you to tap through &#8212; much like a social media filter would offer. The experience is similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/youtubes-new-ar-feature-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-while-watching-videos/">YouTube&#8217;s AR feature for makeup try-on</a> launched last year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088573" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088573" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2088573" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/E814_AR_Beauty_Gifs_Lips_v02.gif?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088573" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Except in Google&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s not trying to beautify your image for the purposes of social sharing. Its aim is to connect consumers to brands for the purpose of making sales, as part of its overall investment in online shopping and, of course, its broader online advertising business.</p>
<p>However, the AR try-on experience itself is not considered an ad format, Google tells us, and the participating brands are not paying Google to be a part of the feature. Instead, this is a continuation of Google&#8217;s moves to open up the Google Shopping destination to more retailers. In past years, the Shopping tab had been limited to paid product listings. But earlier this year, <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/shopping/bringing-free-retail-listings-google-search/">Google announced</a> it would make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/google-switches-its-shopping-search-service-to-mostly-free-listings/">the majority of its retail listings</a> on the Shopping tab free.</p>
<p>This move came at a critical time for retailers, whose businesses were being significantly impacted by physical retail store closures due to the pandemic. But Google wasn&#8217;t making the shift for altruistic reasons. The reality was that by limiting Shopping to paid ads, Google&#8217;s Shopping search results were limited, too. They also often led to out-of-stock items or had other data quality issues. Meanwhile, Amazon was ramping up its advertising business, threatening to cut into Google&#8217;s ad revenue.</p>
<p>Plus, many younger consumers today don&#8217;t shop on Google at all. They have been finding out about products from social media, then clicking through direct links to retailers to make purchases or even transacting directly on social platforms like Facebook or Instagram without leaving the app.</p>
<p>Google is entering this influencer-driven shopping market today, as well.</p>
<p>In addition to the AR try-on, Google will now show recommendations from beauty, apparel and home and garden enthusiasts and experts, who will talk about their favorite products in videos found in Google Shopping. For example, you can hear from professional makeup artist <a href="https://shopping.google.com/explore/c/JonetWMakeup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://shopping.google.com/explore/c/JonetWMakeup&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608301123572000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEUpi8F-XffWVyhxUFsKFabdBsU1w">Jonet</a> about makeup looks or holiday gifts from <a href="https://shopping.google.com/explore/c/Homesick/v/c8dd5becaa6c8a92" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://shopping.google.com/explore/c/Homesick/v/c8dd5becaa6c8a92&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608301123572000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEHTwrpitfw6LJJNAIBnpkGoS0VvQ">Homesick Candles.</a></p>
<p>This feature comes from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/googles-latest-rd-project-is-shoploop-a-mobile-video-shopping-platform/">Shoploop</a>, a product that has now graduated from Area 120, Google&#8217;s in-house incubator. It competes with efforts in video-based shopping from Facebook, Instagram and, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">more recently, TikTok.</a></p>
<p>The launches arrive at a time when beauty brand <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/beauty-stocks-face-new-reality-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-11598952600">sales have been depressed</a> by the pandemic, not only because of store closures and a work-from-home lifestyle, but also because it doesn&#8217;t make as much sense to wear makeup when half your face is under a mask.</p>
<p>The new AR try-on and the influencer videos are available in the Google app on iOS and Android.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Europe has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2484">greenlit</a> Google&#8217;s $2.1BN acquisition of fitness wearable maker Fitbit, applying a number of conditions intended to shrink competition concerns over letting it gobble a major cache of health and wellness data following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/google-fitbit-deal-to-be-scrutinized-in-europe-over-data-competition-concerns/">months of regulatory scrutiny of the deal</a>.</p>
<p>While <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced its plan to buy Fitbit over a year ago, it only notified the transaction to the Commission on June 15, 2020 &#8212; meaning it&#8217;s taken half a year to be given a caveated go-ahead by Europe. It is also now<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/"> facing formal antitrust charges on its home turf</a> &#8212; from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">more than one angle</a> (though not related to Fitbit).</p>
<p>Under the terms of the EU&#8217;s clearance for &#8216;Gitbit&#8217;, Google has committed not use the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fitbit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fitbit">Fitbit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> data of users in the European Economic Area for ad targeting purposes for a ten year period.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It says it will maintain a technical separation between health and wellness data collected via Fitbit wearables in a data silo kept separate from other Google data.</p>
<p>It has also committed to ensuring that regional users have an &#8220;effective choice&#8221; to grant or deny the use of health and wellness data stored in their Google Account or Fitbit Account by other Google services &#8212; such as Google Search, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and YouTube. But it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how much dark pattern design gets applied there.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Commission says it <em>may</em> decide to extend the duration of the decade-long Ads Commitment by <em>up to</em> an additional ten years &#8212; if such an extension can be justified.</p>
<p>It further notes that clearance is conditional upon full compliance with all the commitments &#8212; the implementation of which will be monitored by a trustee, who must be appointed before the transaction can close.</p>
<p>This yet-to-be-appointed-person will have what the Commission couches as &#8220;far-reaching competences&#8221; &#8212; including access to &#8220;Google&#8217;s records, personnel, facilities or technical information&#8221;.</p>
<p>So EU regulators are taking a &#8216;trust but verify&#8217; approach to letting this big tech merger steamroller on.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="N5yLFtRvtZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/google-gobbling-fitbit-is-a-major-privacy-risk-warns-eu-data-protection-advisor/">Google gobbling Fitbit is a major privacy risk, warns EU data protection advisor</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google gobbling Fitbit is a major privacy risk, warns EU data protection advisor&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/google-gobbling-fitbit-is-a-major-privacy-risk-warns-eu-data-protection-advisor/embed/#?secret=N5yLFtRvtZ" data-secret="N5yLFtRvtZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There are further competition focused commitments, too.</p>
<p>Here, Google has agreed to maintain access to Fitbit users&#8217; data via a web API without charging third party developers for the access (of course subject to user consent).</p>
<p>It has also agreed to a number of commitments related to rival wearable makers&#8217; access to Android APIs &#8212; saying it will continue free licensing for all core functionality competing devices need to plug into its dominant smartphone OS, Android.</p>
<p>Improvements in device functionality are covered under the agreement, per the Commission, so it&#8217;s intended to allow rival wearable makers to continue to be able to innovate without the risk of making a better/more capable device resulting in them being shut out of the Android ecosystem.</p>
<p>Google must also maintain API support in the Android Open Source Project version of its mobile platform.</p>
<p>Another concession the Commission has extracted from Google during this half year of investigation and negotiation is to say it won&#8217;t seek to circumvent the requirement to support rivals&#8217; kit accessing Android via the API by degrading the user experience (such as by displaying warnings or error messages).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s &#8212; frankly &#8212; a pretty dysfunctional signal for a regulatory clearance to have to send. And it highlights the level of mistrust that has built up about how Google&#8217;s business operates.</p>
<p>Which in turn raises the existential question for EU regulators of why they are allowing themselves to bend over and let Google-Fitbit go ahead. Unsurprisingly, then, the Commission&#8217;s PR sounds a tad defensive &#8212; with EU lawmakers writing that the decision &#8220;is without prejudice to the Commission&#8217;s efforts to ensure fair and contestable markets in the digital sector, notably through the recently proposed <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/proposal-regulation-single-market-digital-services-digital-services-act_en.pdf">Digital Markets Act</a>&#8221; (DMA).</p>
<p>It also notes that the monitoring trustee will be entitled to share reports that it provides to the Commission with Google&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor, the Irish Data Protection Commission. (Though given the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/lack-of-big-tech-gdpr-decisions-looms-large-in-eu-watchdogs-annual-report/">massive big tech-related case backlog on its desk</a> &#8212; including a number of investigations into other elements of Google&#8217;s business &#8212; that&#8217;s unlikely to cause Mountain View any extra sleepless nights.)</p>
<p>The Commission does also say that commitments secured from Google include &#8220;a fast track dispute resolution mechanism that can be invoked by third parties&#8221;. So it&#8217;s clearly trying to go the extra mile to justify greenlighting further consolidation in a consumer digital services space that Google already massively dominates &#8212; at a time when US lawmakers are headed in the opposite direction. So, um&#8230;</p>
<p>Civil society in Europe (and beyond) has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/europe-urged-to-block-google-fitbit-ahead-of-major-digital-policy-overhaul/">raising a massive clamour</a> about the Google-Fitbit acquisition ever since it was announced &#8212; urging the bloc&#8217;s regulators to stop the tech giant from gobbling Fitbit&#8217;s cache of health data, unless or until <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/no-google-fitbit-merger-without-human-rights-remedies-says-amnesty-to-eu/">human rights protections</a> can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Today the Commission has sidestepped those wider rights concerns.</p>
<p>At best it believes it&#8217;s kicked the can down the road a decade or, max, two. And by 2030 (or 2040) it will hope that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/"> rules it&#8217;s just proposed</a> to put strictures on digital gatekeepers like Google will be in a position to prevent future abuse in check.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s oft stated preference is to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/dont-break-up-big-tech-regulate-data-access-says-eu-antitrust-chief/">regulate tech giants, not to break up their empires</a> &#8212; or, as it turns out, stand in the way of further empire expansion.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Google-Fitbit clearance in a statement, Vestager said: “We can approve the proposed acquisition of Fitbit by Google because the commitments will ensure that the market for wearables and the nascent digital health space will remain open and competitive. The commitments will determine how Google can use the data collected for ad purposes, how interoperability between competing wearables and Android will be safeguarded and how users can continue to share health and fitness data, if they choose to.”</p>
<p>Taking questions from a European parliament committee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/europe-urged-to-block-google-fitbit-ahead-of-major-digital-policy-overhaul/">last week</a>, Vestager signalled the inexorable looming clearance of Gitbit &#8212; saying the US and Europe have a different approach to dealing with market-dominating tech giants. “In Europe we do not have a ban of monopolies,&#8221; she told MEPs. &#8220;They have a different legal basis in the U.S. We would say you’re more than welcome to be successful but with success comes responsibility — which is why we have article 102 [against abusing a dominant position].&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also why the Commission has felt the need to propose new regulation to strengthen competition enforcement in digital markets &#8212; though it&#8217;ll most likely be years before the DMA is adopted.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile EU regulators are letting Google expand its dominance of people&#8217;s private information by bagging up Fitbit&#8217;s treasure trove of sensitive health data &#8212; for full exploitation later.</p>
<p>In any case, as Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/europe-urged-to-block-google-fitbit-ahead-of-major-digital-policy-overhaul/">warned last week</a>, surveillance capitalism&#8217;s business ambitions now scale far beyond mere targeted ads. The goal is to use data &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">for the sake of predictions that become more lucrative as they approach certainty&#8221;, as she put it &#8212; warning society must intervene in the public interest to put a stop to the tech giants&#8217; &#8220;epistemic coup&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Accurate predictions generated off of health data could be very lucrative indeed for Google (which has been ramping up its focus on the health sector in recent years). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Whether that&#8217;s net good or bad for humanity remains to be seen &#8212; which isn&#8217;t the kind of major gamble regulators should be comfortable with. </span>So plenty will say the Commission is just fiddling round the margins while giving big tech a handy bypass for competition enforcement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While 2020 won&#8217;t be remembered fondly by many of us for much of anything, it was a blockbuster year for enterprise M&amp;A with the top 10 deals totaling an astounding $165.2 billion.</p>
<p>This is the third straight year I&#8217;ve done this compilation. Last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/01/these-ten-enterprise-ma-deals-totaled-over-40b-in-2019/">the number was $40 billion</a>. The year prior <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/these-ten-enterprise-ma-deals-totaled-over-87-billion-this-year/">it was $87 billion</a>. Those numbers pale in comparison to 2020’s result.</p>
<p>Last year&#8217;s biggest deal &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/salesforce-closes-15-7b-tableau-deal/">Salesforce buying Tableau</a> for $15.7 billion &#8212; would have only been good for fifth place on this year&#8217;s list. And last year&#8217;s fourth largest deal, where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/vmware-acquires-carbon-black-for-2-1b-and-pivotal-for-2-7-billion/">VMware bought Pivotal</a> for $2.7 billion, wouldn&#8217;t have even made this year&#8217;s list at all.</p>
<p>The 2020 number was lifted by four chip company deals totaling $106 billion alone. Consider that the largest of these deals at $40 billion matched last year&#8217;s entire list. But let&#8217;s not forget the software company acquisitions, which accounted for the remainder, three of which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/private-equity-firms-can-offer-enterprise-startups-a-viable-exit-option/">were via private equity</a> deals.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the $165.2 billion figure doesn&#8217;t include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/oracles-tiktok-and-zoom-deals-wont-move-cloud-market-share-needle-significantly/">the Oracle-TikTok debacle</a>, which remains for now<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/tiktok-timeline/"> in regulatory limbo</a> and may never emerge from it. Nor does it include two purely fintech deals &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/robinhood-profiles-morgan-stanley-etrade/">Morgan Stanley acquiring E-Trade</a> for $13 billion or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/intuit-credit-karma/">Intuit snagging Credit Karma</a> for $7.1 billion &#8212; but we did include the $5.3 billion Visa-Plaid deal because as it involved an enterprise-y API company we felt like it fit our criteria.</p>
<p>Keep in mind as you go through this year&#8217;s list that it appears to be an outlier year in terms of total deal flow. Most years have maybe one or two megadeals, which I would define as over $10 billion. There were six this year. And there were a host of unlisted deals worth between $1 billion and $3.2 billion, several of which would have made it to the list in quieter years.</p>
<p>Without further adieu, here is this year&#8217;s Top 10 deals in M&amp;A organized from smallest to largest:</p>
<h2>10. Vista snags Pluralsight for $3.5B</h2>
<p>This deal happened <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/vista-acquires-it-education-platform-pluralsight-for-3-5b/">just this week</a> as we were writing the story, vaulting into 10th place past the $3.2 billion Twilio-Segment deal. Vista has been active as always and it has added Pluralsight, an online education platform for IT pros with plans to take it private again. At a time when more people are online, this deal seems like a wise move.</p>
<h2>9. KKR acquires Epicor for $4.7B</h2>
<p>This was one of those <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kkr-to-sell-epicor-software-in-47-billion-deal-4-years-after-buying-the-company-2020-08-31">under-the-radar private equity deals</a>, but one with a bushel of money changing hands. Epicor, hardly a household name, is a mature ERP company dating back to the early 1970s. The company has been on a rocky financial road for much of the 21st century. This could be one of those deals where KKR sees a way to squeeze life from maintenance contracts. Otherwise this one is hard to figure.</p>
<h2>8. Insight Partners nabs Veeam for $5B</h2>
<p>In yet another private equity deal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/09/insight-partners-acquires-data-management-company-veeam-for-5b/">Insight acquired Veeam</a>, a cloud data backup and recovery startup based in Switzerland for $5 billion. This one was one of the earliest deals of 2020 and set the tone for the year. The firm had previously invested $500 million into Veeam and apparently liked what it saw and bought the company. Unlike the Epicor deal, Insight probably plans to invest in the company with an end goal of going public or flipping it for a profit at some point.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been an eventful fall for <a href="https://www.getperigee.com/">Perigee</a> CEO and founder Mollie Breen. The former NSA employee participated in the TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield in September, and she just closed her first seed round on Thanksgiving, giving her a $1.5 million runway to begin building the company.</p>
<p>Outsiders Fund led the round with participation from Westport, Contour Venture Partners, BBG Ventures, Innospark Ventures and a couple of individual investors.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/perigee" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="perigee">Perigee <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wants to secure areas of the company like HVAC systems or elevators that may interact with the company&#8217;s network, but which often fall outside of the typical network security monitoring purview. Breen says the company&#8217;s value proposition is about bridging the gap between network security and operations security. She said this has been a security blind spot for companies, often caught between these two teams. Perigee provides a set of analytics that gives the security team visibility into this vulnerable area.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Breen explained when we spoke in September <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/perigee-infrastructure-security-solution-from-former-nsa-employee-moves-into-public-beta/">around her Battlefield turn</a>, the solution learns normal behavior from the operations systems as it interacts with the network, collecting data like what systems and individuals normally access it. It can then determine when something seems off and cut off an anomalous act, which may be indicative of hacker activity, before it reaches the network.</p>
<p>She says that as a female founder getting funding, she is acutely aware how rare that is, and part of the reason she wanted to publicize this funding round was to show other women who are thinking about starting a company that it&#8217;s possible, even if it remains difficult.</p>
<p>She plans to grow the company to about six people in the next 12 months, and Breen says that she thinks deeply about how to build a diverse organization. She says that starts with her investors, and includes considering diversity in terms of gender, race and age. She believes that it&#8217;s crucial to start with the earliest employees, and she actively recruits diverse candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;I write a lot of cold emails, particularly around hiring and that&#8217;s partly because with job listings it&#8217;s all inbound and you can&#8217;t necessarily guarantee that that is going to be diverse. And so by writing cold emails and really following up with those people and having those conversations, I have found a way of actually making sure that I&#8217;m talking to people from different perspectives,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As she looks ahead to 2021, she&#8217;s thinking about the best approach to office versus remote and she says it will probably be mostly remote with some in-person. &#8220;I&#8217;m really balancing at this point in time, how do we really make the connections, and make them strong and genuine with a lot of trust and do that with balancing some elements of remote, knowing that is where the industry is going and if you&#8217;re going to be a company and in a post-2020 world, you probably need to adopt to some element of remote working,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Royalties aside, songwriters are often unsung heroes of music making. Sure, some &#8212; like Carole King and Jimmy Webb &#8212; become well-known in their own right, but more often than not, names are relegated to the liner notes.</p>
<p>A new feature in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="spotify">Spotify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> seeks to correct that &#8212; or at least offers listeners a way to take deeper dives into the catalogues of the people behind their favorite songs. Songwriter Hub is a new offering that aggregates information about some of the industry’s biggest and most prolific songwriters. Some are big names in their own right. Others not so much.</p>
<p>Accessible via the Browse tab, the Hub features songwriter playlists, podcasts and devoted songwriter pages. That last bit includes the likes of Gregg Wattenberg, Ant Clemons, Noonie Bao, Sia, Bebe Rexha, Irving Berlin, Ashley Gorley, Meghan Trainor, Fraser T Smith, Missy Elliott, Teddy Geiger, Ben Billions and Justin Tranter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Having a hub for songwriters is extremely important because people need to know who these people are who are helping create the soundtrack to our lives,” Ariana Grande/Cardi B/Meek Mill writer Nija says in a press release tied to the news. “Songwriters deserve to be praised for their contributions just as much as artists &amp; producers. A lot of times we get the short end of the stick, so I’m glad that there’s a place where people can see who’s writing their favorite songs.”</p>
<p>The feature arrives today.</p>
