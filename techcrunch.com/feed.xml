										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://wise.com">Wise</a>, the fintech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/">formerly known</a> as TransferWise, has announced that it wants to become a public company on the London Stock Exchange. Instead of following the traditional IPO route, Wise plans to go public via a direct listing. This is going to be the biggest direct listing on the London Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Wise, the company specializes in cross-border money transfers. If you want to send money to someone living in another country, traditional retail banks charge a lot in foreign exchange fees, foreign transaction fees, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some well-known alternative options, such as Western Union and MoneyGram. While those companies provide some convenient on-ramp and off-ramp methods, they’re still more expensive than Wise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Wise, users first upload money to their Wise account using a bank transfer or a debit card. They can then send money in another currency to a recipient’s bank account. The company tries to be as transparent and upfront as possible when it comes to fixed and variable fees.</p>
<p>Originally founded in 2011, Wise has grown quite a lot as its revenue grew from $422 million to $586 million in its most recent financial year (from £303 million to £421 million respectively). It represents $57 million (£41 million) in profit before tax — the company says it has been profitable since 2017.</p>
<p>Overall, Wise has 10 million customers who process around $7 billion (£5 billion) in cross-border transactions every month. More recently, the company diversified its revenue by adding new products.</p>
<p>For instance, customers can hold money in 56 currencies in their Wise accounts. They get account numbers in 10 different currencies as well as a debit card. This feature is particularly useful for freelancers who want to accept payments in another country or people moving abroad for a year or two.</p>
<p>The company has also expanded beyond B2C with Wise Business. Those accounts work a bit like regular Wise accounts, but with multiple users and additional features. Wise also powers cross-border transactions in third-party services, such as Monzo and N26.</p>
<p>Opting for a direct listing is an interesting move. A few companies have chosen direct listings in the U.S., such as Spotify, Coinbase and Slack. It means that you’re confident there’ll be enough interests from investors as banks aren’t helping you with your introduction.</p>
<p>It also means that Wise doesn’t need more money as a direct listing doesn’t let you raise additional capital.</p>
<p>Like many tech companies, Wise plans to introduce a dual-class share structure, which means that all of Wise’s existing shareholders will get more votes per share for a while. This is going to be an important listing for the European fintech scene and also for the British tech ecosystem. Now, let’s see how investors feel about Wise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Free money from the government sounds like winning the lottery, but the reality is that most tech startups and even local retail businesses and restaurants can potentially qualify for tax credits related to research and development in the United States. Those credits, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/amazon-had-to-pay-federal-income-taxes-for-the-first-time-since-2016.html">which is what helps tech giants keep their tax rates to near zero</a>, are hard for smaller companies to receive because of extensive documentation requirements and potential audit costs.</p>
<p>So a number of startups have been launched to solve that gap, and now, larger companies are entering the fray as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://gusto.com">Gusto</a>, which started off with payroll for SMBs and has since expanded into employee on-boarding, insurance, benefits, and other HR offerings, today announced that it is acquiring <a href="https://ardius.com">Ardius</a>, a startup designed to automate tax compliance particularly around R&amp;D tax credits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Los Angeles-based company was founded by Joshua Lee <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ardius">in 2018</a>, who previously had worked for more than a decade at accounting firm EY. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, and Ardius will run as an independent business with the entire team transitioning to Gusto.</p>
<p>The strategy here is simple: most R&amp;D credits require payroll documentation, data that is already stored in Gusto’s system of record. Ardius in its current incarnation was designed to tap into a number of payroll data providers and extract that data and turn it into verifiable tax documents. With this tie-up, the companies can simply do that automatically for Gusto’s extensive number of customers.</p>
<p>Joshua Reeves, co-founder and CEO of Gusto, said that the acquisition falls in line with the company’s long-term focus on customers and simplicity. “We want to bring together technology, great service, [and] make government simpler,” he said. “In some ways, a lot of stuff we&#8217;re doing — make payroll simpler, make healthcare simpler, make PPP [loans] and tax credits simpler — just make these things work the way they&#8217;re intended to work.” The company presumably could have built out such functionality, but he noted that “time to market” was a crucial point in making Ardius the company’s first acquisition.</p>
<p>Tomer London, co-founder and chief product officer, said that “we&#8217;ve been looking at this space for a long time because it kind of connects to one of our original product principles of building a product that is opinionated,” he said. In a space as complicated as HR, “we want to be out there and be an advisor, not just a tool. And this is just such a great example of where you can take the payroll data that we already have and in just a few clicks and in a matter of a few days, get access to really important cash flow for a business.” He noted that tax credits is “something that&#8217;s been on our roadmap for a long time.”</p>
<p>Gusto works with more than 100 third-party services that integrate on top of its platform. Reeves emphasized that while Ardius is part of Gusto, all companies — even those who might compete directly with the product — will continue to have equal access to the platform’s data. In its release, the company pointed out that Boast.ai, Clarus, Neo.Tax, and TaxTaker are just some of the other tax products that integrate with Gusto today.</p>
<p>Of course, Ardius is just one of a number of competitors that have popped up in the R&amp;D and economic development tax credit space. MainStreet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/free-money-for-startups-its-possible-with-mainstreets-platform-for-economic-development-incentives/">which I last profiled in 2020 for its seed round</a>, just raised $60 million in funding in March led by SignalFire. Meanwhile, Neo.tax, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/rd-tax-credits-are-due-july-15th-neo-tax-wants-to-help-startups-apply-and-raised-3m-to-do-it/">which I also profiled last year</a>, has raised a total of $5.5 million.</p>

<p>Reeves was sanguine about the attention the space is garnering and the potential competition for Ardius. When it comes to R&amp;D tax credits, “whatever creates more accessibility, we’re a fan of,” he said. “It&#8217;s great that there&#8217;s more awareness because it&#8217;s still under-utilized frankly.” He emphasized that Gusto would be able to offer a more vertically-integrated solution given its data and software than other competitors in the space.</p>
<p>While the pandemic particularly hit SMBs, who often lacked the financial wherewithal of larger companies to survive the crisis, Gusto actually expanded its business as new companies sprouted up. Reeves said the company grew its customer base 50% in its last fiscal year, which ended in April. It “turns out in a health pandemic and in an economic crisis, things like payroll and accessing health care are quite important,” he said. Gusto <a href="https://gusto.com/covid-19/paycheck-protection-program">launched a program to help SMBs collect the government’s stimulus PPP loans</a>.</p>
<p>The company’s main bases of operation are in San Francisco, Denver and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/smb-payroll-startup-gusto-raises-200m-series-d-plans-rd-expansion-to-nyc/">New York City</a>, and the company has a growing contingent of remote workers, including the Ardius crew, who will remain based in LA. While Reeves demurred on future acquisitions, Gusto’s focus on expanding to a comprehensive financial wellness platform for both employees and businesses would likely suggest that additional acquisitions may well be in the offing in the future.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If I told you a decade ago that a spin bike would be a social community, you’d have had a good laugh. But that’s precisely what Peloton is: A spin bike with a social community where the instructors are the influencers.</p>
<p>Peloton is just one example of how social is being integrated into every aspect of the customer experience in an increasingly digital world. Whether it’s considering a new restaurant to check out, a movie to see or a product to buy, most people look at reviews before making a final decision. They want social proof as an indicator of quality and relevance.</p>

	</p>
<p>Influencers are a natural byproduct of this desire for social validation, and as social permeates the customer journey, creators have become an essential source of validation and trust. Indeed, social validation is what social platforms are built on, so it’s a significant component of how we derive relevance online — and the deeper integration of social is changing the dynamic between brands and digital creators.</p>
<h2>The shifting economy of creator monetization</h2>
<p>Brand sponsorships are the holy grail for creators hoping to monetize their online influence. According to an <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/influencer-monetization-2021">eMarketer report</a>, brand partnerships are still the No. 1 source of revenue for most digital creators.</p>
<p>However, digital creators have a lot more monetization options to choose from, thanks to Patreon, affiliate platforms, paid content platforms and platform revenue sharing, making it easier to earn a living without relying so heavily on brand sponsorships.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?<br />

<hr />
<p>As a result, creators are diversifying their revenue streams, which, for some creators, allows them to be more selective about the brands they work with. What’s more, creators aren’t reliant on just one channel or one form of revenue.</p>
<p>YouTube creators probably have the most diversified revenue, often combining brand sponsorships, subscription models, affiliate deals, tipping/donations, their line of branded products and revenue share. However, it’s important to note that not all monetization options apply to every creator. But with so many options to choose from, making a living as a digital creator is more accessible than ever.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the ways online creators can monetize their content:</p>
<p><strong>Ad revenue sharing: </strong>Advertising is the most traditional form of revenue for online creators. With this model, ads are injected into and around the creator’s content, and they make a certain percentage of revenue based on impressions. However, the revenue split can vary based on the platform, and some platforms have a specific threshold creators must hit before they can participate in ad revenue sharing.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliate marketing: </strong>Similar to advertising or a brand sponsorship, affiliate marketing is an agreement for a share of revenue based on products sold. This kind of arrangement generally works best when the creator has a blog, website or YouTube account. Affiliate links allow the influencer to proactively choose the products they want to talk about and earn from, rather than having to wait for a brand deal to come their way.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lordstown Motors does not have binding orders from customers for its electric Endurance pickup truck — a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lordstown-motors-execs-cite-binding-orders-to-restore-confidence-a-day-after-ceo-cfo-resignations/"> reversal from claims</a> made earlier this week by company executives in an effort to restore confidence in the troubled company, according to a regulatory filing released Thursday.</p>
<p>Lordstown Motors interim CEO Angela Strand and President Rich Schmidt made a series of statements Tuesday at an Automotive Press Association event that drove up shares in the company, including that it has enough “binding orders” from customers to fund limited production of its electric pickup truck through May 2022. Those comments came just a day after an executive shakeup that included the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/lordstown-motors-ceo-and-cfo-resign-amidst-production-woes/">resignation of the company&#8217;s CEO and CFO</a>.</p>
<p>It appears those &#8220;binding orders&#8221; were more like agreements to maybe lease or buy, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000110465921082332/tm2119909d1_8k.htm">according to a document</a> Lordstown filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing has caused shares of Lordstown to fall more than 4%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The document reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>To clarify recent remarks by company executives at the Automotive Press Association online media event on June 15, although these vehicle purchase agreements provide us with a significant indicator of demand for the Endurance, these agreements do not represent binding purchase orders or other firm purchase commitments. As previously disclosed in our Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 8, 2021, to date, we have engaged in limited marketing activities and we have no binding purchase orders or commitments from customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lordstown notes in the SEC filing that an important aspect of its sales and marketing strategy involves pursuing relationships with specialty upfitting and fleet management companies. For instance, in March 2021. Lordstown announced an agreement with ARI, a fleet management affiliate of Holman Enterprises. Under the agreement, ARI &#8220;would use reasonable efforts to facilitate orders from its leasing clients for the Endurance over a three-year time period on the terms set forth in the agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lordstown has also entered into vehicle purchase agreements with additional specialty upfitting and fleet management companies as a component of that strategy, the company explained. This might sound like a binding order, but it&#8217;s not, as the following language in the SEC doc makes more clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;These vehicle purchase agreements generally include a projected buyer order schedule over the 3- to 5-year life of the agreement, and may be terminated by either party at will on 30 days&#8217; notice,&#8221; the filing from Lordstown reads. &#8220;They do not commit the counterparties to purchase vehicles, but we believe that they provide us with a significant indicator of demand for the Endurance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reversal from Lordstown is just the latest in a string of issues at the newly public company. Lordstown Motors is an offshoot of the now former CEO Steve Burns’ other company, Workhorse Group, a battery-electric transportation technology company that is also publicly traded. Workhorse holds a 10% stake in Lordstown Motors. Lordstown Motors went public after merging with special purpose acquisition company DiamondPeak Holdings Corp.</p>
<p>In March, Hindenburg Research, the short-seller firm whose report on Nikola Motor led to an SEC investigation and the resignation of its founder, said it had<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> taken a short position on Lordstown Motors, causing shares to plummet 21%. Hindenburg said at the time that its short position was based on a company that has &#8220;no revenue and no sellable product, which we believe has misled investors on both its demand and production capabilities.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Hindenburg disputes that the company has booked 100,000 pre-orders for its electric pickup truck, a stat shared by Lordstown Motors in January. The short seller says that &#8220;extensive research reveals that the company&#8217;s orders appear largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy.&#8221; The firm goes further and alleges that Lordstown founder and CEO Steve Burns paid consultants for every truck pre-order as early as 2016 while he was leading Workhorse.</p>
<p>Two months later, Lordstown reported in its first-quarter earnings that production volumes of the Endurance would likely be half &#8212; from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000 &#8212; due to a lack of funding. The statements made by Lordstown execs Tuesday appeared to be an attempt, which backfired, to assuage investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three Chinese astronauts have docked at China’s space station core module, named Tianhe, for the first time.</p>
<p>The three astronauts flew to space as part of the Shenzhou 12 mission, China’s first crewed mission since 2012. They will call the core module of the Tiangong space station home until September, making it the longest crewed space mission in China’s history.</p>
<p>The three men, Commander Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo, arrived to their final destination just over seven hours after taking off from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China. Nie had been to low Earth orbit twice before: once on the Shenzhou 6 mission in 2005 and again aboard the Shenzhou 10 eight years later. Boming has also been to space, once in 2008.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The men will be busy during their tenure in orbit. Their mission marks the third of a series of 11 planned launches through 2022, all aimed at getting China’s first space station up and running. The goal of the Shenzhou 12 mission is to bring the core module into service, test its systems and ensure it is ready for subsequent stages of station assembly. Of the eight remaining launches, three are expected to be crewed.</p>
<p>Building its own space station is a logical step for China, a country that has not been shy about its space ambitions in recent years. It especially makes sense considering that China is barred from boarding the International Space Station after Congress passed a law in 2011. However, that does not mean that China’s space station will always be for its own exclusive use, country officials said during a news conference Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ji Qiming, an assistant director with the Shenzhou program, said that China “welcome[s] co-operation in this regard in general,” <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57504052">the BBC reported</a>. &#8220;It is believed that, in the near future, after the completion of the Chinese space station, we will see Chinese and foreign astronauts fly and work together,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As part of its burgeoning space program, the Chinese rover Zhurong touched down on Mars last month, making China the only country besides the United States to land a robot on the planet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is following in the footsteps of app store giants Apple and Google with this week&#8217;s introduction of its Amazon Appstore Small Business Accelerator Program. The new program will reduce the commissions Amazon takes on app developer revenues for qualifying smaller businesses. Previously, Amazon&#8217;s Appstore took a 30% cut of revenue, including that from in-app purchases. Now, it will take only 20% from developers who earned up to $1 million in the prior calendar year. The program will additionally offer AWS credits.</p>
<p>This program&#8217;s structure is similar to Apple&#8217;s App Store Small Business Program, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">announced in late 2020</a>, which reduced Apple&#8217;s cut to 15% for developers who earn up to a $1 million threshold, after which they&#8217;re moved to the higher 30% standard rate. This rate then continues as they enter the following year. Google, more recently, took <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">a slightly different course</a>, by lowering the commissions to 15% on the first $1 million of developer revenue earned through the Play billing system each year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5vhdCyIraO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">Google Play drops commissions to 15% from 30%, following Apple&#8217;s move last year</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google Play drops commissions to 15% from 30%, following Apple&#8217;s move last year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/embed/#?secret=5vhdCyIraO" data-secret="5vhdCyIraO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s cut remains larger, at 20%, but that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s offering developers a different type of perk: AWS credits.</p>
<p>The company says developers with less than $1 million in Appstore revenue in a calendar year will receive 10% of their revenue as promotional credit for AWS services. This includes infrastructure technologies like compute, storage and databases &#8212; to emerging technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, data lakes and analytics, and Internet of Things, notes Amazon. This brings total program benefits up to an equivalent of 90% of revenue, Amazon says.</p>
<p>If the developer&#8217;s revenue exceeds $1 million during the current year, they&#8217;ll revert to the standard royalty rate and no longer receive the AWS credits for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>And if the developer&#8217;s revenue in a future year drops below $1 million, they&#8217;ll become eligible for the Small Business program again in the next calendar year.</p>
<p>&#8220;By helping small businesses get started with AWS through credits, we are making it easier for them to build and grow their app businesses,&#8221; noted Amazon Appstore Director Palanidaran Chidambaram, in an <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/appstore/post/93e89be7-1611-4764-8f97-f4eef0a7c0e0/coming-soon-amazon-appstore-small-business-accelerator-program">announcement</a>. &#8220;AWS gives developers easy access to a broad range of technologies so they can innovate faster and build nearly anything they can imagine,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The changes to app store commission structures come at a time when tech giants are seeing increasing regulatory pressure over the nature of their businesses, which larger app publishers, including Basecamp, Spotify, Epic Games and others have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/epic-games-founder-tim-sweeney-likens-fight-against-apple-to-fight-for-civil-rights/">argued</a> are anticompetitive. Epic is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/25/epics-latest-argument-in-its-fight-against-apple-keeps-antitrust-issues-front-and-center/">also</a> suing Apple over its app store fees, in a potentially precedent-setting case. In response, Apple and Google lowered fees for smaller businesses as a gesture of goodwill &#8212; and one that wouldn&#8217;t significantly impact their own app store platform revenues.</p>
<p>Amazon says the new program will launch in Q4 2021, and more details about how to participate will be provided at that time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Databases run the world, but database products are often some of the most mature and venerable software in the modern tech stack. Designers will pixel push, frontend engineers will add clicks to make it more difficult to drop out of a soporific Zoom call, but few companies are ever willing to rip out their database storage engine. Too much risk, and almost no return.</p>
<p>So it’s exceptional when a new database offering breaks through the barriers and redefines the enterprise.</p>
<p><a href="https://neo4j.com">Neo4j</a>, which offers a graph-centric database and related products, announced today that it raised $325 million at a more than $2 billion valuation in a Series F deal led by Eurazeo, with additional capital from Alphabet’s venture wing GV. Eurazeo managing director Nathalie Kornhoff-Brüls will join the company’s board of directors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That funding makes Neo4j among the most well-funded database companies in history, with a collective fundraise haul of more than half a billion dollars. For comparison, MongoDB, which trades on Nasdaq, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mongodb-inc/company_financials">raised $311 million in total</a> (according to Crunchbase) before its IPO. Meanwhile, Cockroach Labs of CockroachDB fame has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cockroach-labs/company_financials">now raised $355 million in funding</a>, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/cockroach-labs-scores-160m-series-e-on-2b-valuation/">a $160 million round earlier this year</a> at a similar $2 billion valuation.</p>
<p>The past decade has seen a whole new crop of next-generation database models, from scale-out SQL to document to key-value stores to time series and on and on and on. What makes graph databases like Neo4j unique is their focus on the connections between individual data entities. Graph-based data models have become central to modern machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, and are now widely used by data analysts in applications as diverse as marketing to fraud detection.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Emil Eifrem said that Neo4j, which was founded back in 2007, has hit its growth stride in recent years given the rising popularity of graph-based analysis. “We have a deep developer community of hundreds of thousands of developers actively building applications with Neo4j in any given month, but we also have a really deep data science community,” he said.</p>
<p>In the past, most business analysis was built on relational databases. Yet, inter-connected complexity is creeping in everywhere, and that’s where Eifrem believes Neo4j has a durable edge. As an example, “any company that ships stuff is tapping into this global fine-grain mesh spanning continent to continent,” he suggested. “All of a sudden the ship captain in the Suez Canal … falls asleep, and then they block the Suez Canal for a week, and then you’ve got to figure out how will this affect my enterprise, how does that cascade across my entire supply chain.” With a graph model, that analysis is a cinch.</p>
<p>Neo4j says that 800 enterprises are customers and 75% of the Fortune 100 are users of the company’s products.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/neo4j-4-0-graph-database-platform-brings-unlimited-scaling/">We last checked in with the company in 2020 when it launched 4.0</a>, which offered unlimited scaling. Today, Neo4j comes in a couple of different flavors. It’s a database that can be either self-hosted or purchased as a cloud service offering which it dubs Aura. That’s for the data storage folks. For the data scientists, the company offers Neo4j Graph Data Science Library, a set of comprehensive tools for analyzing graph data. The company offers free (or “community” tiers), affordable starting tiers and full-scale enterprise pricing options depending on needs.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Neo4j 4.0 graph database platform brings unlimited scaling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/neo4j-4-0-graph-database-platform-brings-unlimited-scaling/embed/#?secret=Ei0NjZkveW" data-secret="Ei0NjZkveW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Development continues on the database. This morning at its developers conference, Neo4j demonstrated what it dubbed its &#8220;super-scaling technology&#8221; on a 200 billion node graph with more than a trillion relationships between them, showing how its tools could offer &#8220;real-time&#8221; queries on such a large scale.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Eifrem said that the new venture funding will be used to continue doubling down on “product, product, product” but emphasized a few major strategic initiatives as critical for the company. First, he wants to continue to deepen the company’s partnerships with public cloud providers. It already has a deep relationship with Google Cloud (GV was an investor in this round after all), and hopes to continue building relationships with other providers.</p>
<p>It’s also seeing a major uptick in interest from the APAC region. Eifrem said that the company recently opened up an office in Singapore to accelerate its sales in the broader IT market there.</p>
<p>Overall, “We think that graphs can be a significant part of the modern data landscape. In fact, we believe it can be the <i>biggest</i> part of the modern data landscape. And this round, I think, sends a clear signal [that] we&#8217;re going for it,” he said.</p>
<p>Erik Nordlander and Tom Hulme of GV were the leads for that firm. In addition, DTCP and Lightrock newly invested and previous investors One Peak, Creandum and Greenbridge Partners joined the round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google this morning announced the launch of Tau, a new family of virtual machines built on AMD’s third-gen EPYC processor. According to the company, the new x86-compatible system offers a 42% price-performance boost over standard VMs. Google notably first started utilizing <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/amd-epyc-processors-come-to-google-and-to-google-cloud">AMD EPYC processors for Cloud back in 2017</a>, while <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/amd/">Amazon Cloud&#8217;s offerings date back to 2018.</a></p>
<p>Google claims the Tau family “leapfrogs” existing cloud VMs. The systems come in a variety of configurations, ranging up to 60vCPUs per VM, and 4GB of memory per vCPU. Networking bandwidth goes up to 32 Gbps, and they can be coupled with a variety of different network attached storage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Customers across every industry are dealing with more demanding and data-intensive workloads and looking for strategic ways to speed up performance and reduce costs,” Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said in a press release.  “Our work with key strategic partners like AMD has allowed us to broaden our offerings and deliver customers the best price performance for compute-heavy, business-critical applications&#8211; all on the cleanest <span class="il">cloud</span> in the industry.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Google has already signed up some high-profile customers for an early trial, including Twitter, Snap and DoIT.</p>
<p>“High performance at the right price point is a critical consideration as we work to serve the global public conversation,&#8221; Twitter Platform Lead Nick Tornow said <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/google-cloud-introduces-tau-vms">in a blog post</a>. “We are excited by initial tests that show potential for double digit performance improvement. We are collaborating with Google Cloud to more deeply evaluate benefits on price and performance for specific compute workloads that we can realize through use of the new Tau VM family.”</p>

<p>The Tau VMs will be arriving for Google Cloud in Q3 of this year. The company has already opened the system up to clients for pre-registration. Pricing is dependent on the configuration. For example, a 32vCPU VM sporting 128GB RAM will run around $1.35 an hour.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch City Spotlight: Pittsburgh is getting closer, with impressive featured speakers including Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian and Mayor Bill Peduto. However, we&#8217;ve saved the best for last: Our last speaker is Karin Tsai, director of engineering at Duolingo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">a $2.4 billion business</a> that is all about making language learning fun and accessible.</p>
<p>The event will be held on June 29, so make sure to <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">register here (for free)</a> to listen to these conversations, enjoy the pitch-off and network with local talent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tsai joined Duolingo in 2012 as one of its first engineers, and firsthand witnessed the growth of the company from a scrappy startup into a 400-person global business. Her timestamp on the company has made her a key decision-maker in many of its biggest decisions, from which features to scrap to how to monetize without compromising its mission of providing free education to all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">One thing to note is that even though a whimsical owl and creative UX might seem straightforward, the language learning universe is controversial and requires healthy debate &#8212; and testing &#8212; for anyone within it.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p dir="ltr">“We’re trying to do things that no other apps really tackle: How do we create an experience that actually makes you extremely proficient in a language while accommodating the expectations from our learners” to be fun and convenient, Tsai told me when I interviewed her for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-product/">my Duolingo EC-1.</a> “Balancing efficacy with engagement is something that we constantly struggle with.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this chat, Tsai will break down how Duolingo turned to A/B testing to answer some of its biggest questions. We&#8217;ll also chat about more meta topics, as when to give up on measuring the unmeasurable, and when tests fail and instinct reigns supreme. Tsai admitted to me once that Duolingo spent years trying to figure out how to find a metric that could encompass learning comprehension and engagement in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>“What used to freeze us is that we thought we would need such a metric to make progress,” she explained. “And I think what honestly liberated us was saying essentially, ‘Screw it.’ We couldn’t make progress waiting for a learning metric.”</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be interviewing Tsai, so anyone who registers for this event is welcome to<a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_"> throw me questions</a> for her that I&#8217;ll try to incorporate into my chat.</p>
<p>Tsai will give us the startup builder perspective, while Mayor Peduto will speak to the challenges of building a startup ecosystem, and Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian will discuss how to go from student to startup with the correct resources.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I spoke to Refraction AI co-founder/CTO Matthew Johnson-Roberson on the occasion of the Michigan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/last-mile-delivery-robotics-company-refraction-ai-raises-4-2m/">startup’s $4.2 million seed raise</a>. This week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/refraction-ais-matthew-johnson-roberson-on-finding-the-middle-path-to-robotic-delivery/">we posted a Q&amp;A</a> where he answers a wider range of topics about the delivery robotics company, and this bit jumped out at me:</p>
<blockquote><p>It still boggles my mind that nobody has tried to copy what we’re doing. There were 10 or 12 sidewalk robot companies in early 2015, 2016 and 2017. Many of them, with a few exceptions, went out of business.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_1853779" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1853779" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-1853779" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RefractionAI.jpg" alt="Refraction autonomous delivery robot" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RefractionAI.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RefractionAI.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RefractionAI.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RefractionAI.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RefractionAI.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RefractionAI.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1853779" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Refraction</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The first part of the quote points to seemingly obvious truths that are still worth reiterating here. First: If you spot a need in the market you believe you can address, go for it. Second: There are likely even more opportunities for robotics and automation than we’ve considered. The second sentence seemingly negates the second point to some degree, but more than anything, I think it’s an indictment of how merciless this industry can be.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1Jrln2525R"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/refraction-ais-matthew-johnson-roberson-on-finding-the-middle-path-to-robotic-delivery/">Refraction AI&#8217;s Matthew Johnson-Roberson on finding the middle path to robotic delivery</a></p></blockquote>

<p>High risk/high reward, and all that, but even with a great idea, smart people and a healthy raise, bad timing can still land you flat on your face. For now, it seems, the timing is right. Delivery robotics are very much an industry that has been accelerated by the pandemic, in terms of interest, innovation and, of course, funding.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166311" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166311" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2166311" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FedEx-Nuro-Image.jpg" alt="FedEx-Nuro" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FedEx-Nuro-Image.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FedEx-Nuro-Image.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FedEx-Nuro-Image.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FedEx-Nuro-Image.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FedEx-Nuro-Image.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FedEx-Nuro-Image.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FedEx-Nuro-Image.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FedEx-Nuro-Image.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166311" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nuro</p></div></p>
<p>As I noted last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/how-autonomous-delivery-startups-are-navigating-policy-partnerships-and-post-pandemic-operations/">I spoke to</a> Gatik co-founder and chief engineer Apeksha Kumavat, Nuro head of operations Amy Jones Satrom and Starship Technologies co-founder and CTO Ahti Heinla at last week’s TC Sessions: Mobility event. Here’s what Kumavat had to say about that acceleration:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even before the pandemic hit, this whole e-commerce trend was already on the rise. No one wants their deliveries to be done after a week or two weeks. Everyone is expecting them to be done on the same day, as well as curbside pickup options. There was already a rise in the expectations of e-commerce and on-demand deliveries even before the pandemic hit. Post-March 2020, what we have seen is a huge increase in that trajectory.</p></blockquote>
<p>More big news from Nuro (try saying that five times, fast), the delivery company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/autonomous-delivery-startup-nuro-moves-into-logistics-with-fedex/">just signed a deal with FedEx</a>, marking a big step into package delivery.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165706" style="width: 923px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165706" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2165706" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/scythe.jpg" alt="" width="913" height="607" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/scythe.jpg 913w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/scythe.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/scythe.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/scythe.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/scythe.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/scythe.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165706" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Scythe Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>This week, I also spoke to another pair of robotics startups that have emerged from the pandemic with sizable rounds. Boulder-based Scythe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/robotic-landscaping-startup-scythe-emerges-from-stealth-with-18-6m-raise/">emerged from stealth with a $13.8 million Series A</a>, bringing its total funding to $18.6 million. The company specializes in landscaping robotics, starting with a mower. Given the potential market size, I’m honestly surprised there aren’t more companies doing this.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the company is offering a RaaS (robotics as a service) model, which is becoming increasingly popular in the space. Here it’s charging customers based on the number of acres mowed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165358" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165358" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2165358" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dusty-FieldPrinter.png" alt="" width="1024" height="585" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dusty-FieldPrinter.png 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dusty-FieldPrinter.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dusty-FieldPrinter.png?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dusty-FieldPrinter.png?resize=768,439 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dusty-FieldPrinter.png?resize=680,388 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dusty-FieldPrinter.png?resize=1536,877 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dusty-FieldPrinter.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165358" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dusty Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>Bay Area-based Dusty Robotics, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/construction-robotics-firm-dusty-raises-16-5m/">raised a $16.5 million Series A</a>, bringing its total raised to $23.7 million. Construction is a huge potential market with a lot of interest and players. Dusty’s offering is interesting and fairly unique, effectively printing plans on the floor of a construction site. The company likens it to “Ikea Instructions.” Here’s co-founder and CEO, Tessa Lau:</p>
<blockquote><p>We just released our third-generation hardware platform, which was designed from the ground up by our team in Mountain View to be purpose-built for producing accurate and speedy layout on construction sites. We’ve been working on this product since fall of 2018 and have incorporated lessons learned from completing over 1 million square feet of production layout into this third-generation design.</p></blockquote>
<p>And for good measure, here’s a fun one from Tencent Robotics.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZtlRVO8fpE0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=33&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/tencents-new-wheeled-robot-flicks-its-tail-to-do-backflips">IEEE Spectrum</a> spotted the robot, which was actually announced a few weeks ago. <a href="https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/conferences/ICRA21/program/ICRA21_ContentListWeb_2.html">According to the paper</a> where Ollie appeared, the wheeled robot is more experimental than practical, but it&#8217;s capable of some pretty impressive feats none the less:</p>
<blockquote><p>Experimental results demonstrate that the linear output regulation can maintain the standing of the robot, and that nonlinear controller can balance the robot under an initial starting angle far away from the equilibrium point, or under a changing robot height.</p></blockquote>
<p>There isn’t a ton of info about Ollie available yet, but it sure is fun to watch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram Reels are getting ads. The company announced today it&#8217;s launching ads in its short-form video platform and TikTok rival, Reels, to businesses and advertisers worldwide. The ads will be up to 30 seconds in length, like Reels themselves, and vertical in format, similar to ads found in Instagram Stories. Also like Reels, the new ads will loop, and people will be able to like, comment on, and save them, the same as other Reels videos.</p>
<p>The company had <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/the-evolution-of-facebook-and-instagram-video-advertising#">previously tested</a> Reels ads in select markets earlier this year, including India, Brazil, Germany and Australia, then <a href="https://www.adweek.com/social-marketing/instagram-extends-reels-ads-test-to-canada-france-uk-us/">expanded those tests</a> to Canada, France, the U.K. and the U.S. more recently. Early adopters of the new format have included brands like BMW, Nestlé (Nespresso), Louis Vuitton, Netflix, Uber and others.</p>
<p>Instagram tells us the ads will appear in most places users view Reels content, including on the Reels tab, Reels in Stories, Reels in Explore and Reels in your Instagram Feed, and will appear in between individual Reels posted by users. However, in order to be served a Reels ad, the user first needs to be in the immersive, full-screen Reels viewer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2167409" style="width: 438px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167409" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2167409" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reels-Ads.png?w=428" alt="" width="428" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reels-Ads.png 760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reels-Ads.png?resize=94,150 94w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reels-Ads.png?resize=189,300 189w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reels-Ads.png?resize=428,680 428w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reels-Ads.png?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167409" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>The company couldn&#8217;t say how often a user might see a Reels ad, noting that the number of ads a viewer may encounter will vary based on how they use Instagram. But the company is monitoring user sentiment around ads themselves, and the overall commerciality of Reels, it says.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YouTube announces a $100M fund to reward top YouTube Shorts creators over 2021-2022&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/embed/#?secret=y0AtH0pNGV" data-secret="y0AtH0pNGV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like Instagram&#8217;s other advertising products, Reels ads will launch with an auction-based model. But so far, Instagram is declining to share any sort of performance metrics around how those ads are doing, based on tests. Nor is it yet offering advertisers any creator tools or templates that could help them get started with Reels ads. Instead, Instagram likely assumes advertisers already have creative assets on hand or know how to make them, because of Reels ads&#8217; similarities to other vertical video ads found elsewhere, including on Instagram&#8217;s competitors.</p>
<p><div style="width: 1244px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-2167398-1" width="1244" height="2092" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reels_Ad_Mockup.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reels_Ad_Mockup.mp4">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reels_Ad_Mockup.mp4</a></video></div></p>
<p>While vertical video has already shown the potential for driving consumers to e-commerce shopping sites, Instagram hasn&#8217;t yet taken advantage of Reels ads to drive users to its built-in <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/introducing-shops-on-instagram">Instagram Shops</a>, though that seems like a natural next step as it attempts to tie the different parts of its app together.</p>
<p>But perhaps ahead of that step, Instagram needs to make Reels a more compelling destination &#8212; something other TikTok rivals, which now include both <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/20/snapchat-paying-1-million-a-day-to-video-creators.html">Snap</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/">YouTube</a> &#8212; have done by funding creator content directly. Instagram, meanwhile, had <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-to-reel-in-tiktok-creators-raising-stakes-in-social-media-rivalry-11595928600">made offers</a> to select TikTok stars directly.</p>
<p>The launch of Instagram Reels ads follows news of TikTok&#8217;s climbing ad prices. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/tiktok-is-jacking-up-prices-as-it-builds-its-ad-business?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a> this month that TikTok is now asking for more than $1.4 million for a home page takeover ad in the U.S., as of the third quarter, which will jump to $1.8 million by Q4 and more than $2 million on a holiday. Though the company is still building its ads team and advertisers haven&#8217;t yet allocated large portions of their video budget to the app, that tends to follow user growth &#8212; and TikTok now has over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-five-things-you-need-to-know-in-mobile/">Both</a> <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/">apps</a>, Instagram and TikTok, now have more than a billion monthly active users on a global basis, though Reels is only a part of the larger Instagram platform. For comparison, Instagram Stories is used by some <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/">500 million users</a>, which demonstrates Instagram&#8217;s ability to drive traffic to different areas of its app. Instagram declined to share how many users Reels has as of today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Until recently, Google&#8217;s namesake Android app, which has more than five billion installs to date, had a vulnerability that could have allowed an attacker to quietly steal personal data from a victim&#8217;s device.</p>
<p>Sergey Toshin, founder of mobile app security startup Oversecured, said <a href="https://blog.oversecured.com/Why-dynamic-code-loading-could-be-dangerous-for-your-apps-a-Google-example/">in a blog post</a> that the vulnerability has to do with how the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox">Google app</a> relies on code that is not bundled with the app itself. Many Android apps, including the Google app, reduce their download size and the storage space needed to run by relying on code libraries that are already installed on Android phones.</p>
<p>But the flaw in the Google app&#8217;s code meant it could be tricked into pulling a code library from a malicious app on the same device instead of the legitimate code library, allowing the malicious app to inherit the Google app&#8217;s permissions and granting it near-complete access to a user&#8217;s data. That access includes access to a user&#8217;s Google accounts, search history, email, text messages, contacts and call history, as well as being able to trigger the microphone and camera, and access the user&#8217;s location.</p>
<p>The malicious app would have to be launched once for the attack to work, Toshin said, but that the attack happens without the victim&#8217;s knowledge or consent. Deleting the malicious app would not remove the malicious components from the Google app, he said.</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company fixed the vulnerability last month and it had no evidence that the flaw has been exploited by attackers. Android&#8217;s in-built malware scanner, Google Play Protect, is meant to stop malicious apps from installing. But no security feature is perfect, and malicious apps have slipped through its net before.</p>
<p>Toshin said the Google app vulnerability is similar to another bug discovered by the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/tiktok-android-bugs-account-hijack/">in TikTok earlier this year</a>, which if exploited could have allowed an attacker to steal a TikTok user&#8217;s session tokens to take control of their account.</p>
<p>Oversecured has found several other similar vulnerabilities, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/android-bug-apps-data/">Android’s Google Play app</a> and, more recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/security-flaws-found-in-samsungs-stock-mobile-apps/">apps pre-installed on Samsung phones</a>.</p>

But if you go through an obstacle course, and you show them how to navigate a series of challenges to get to the end unscathed, they would.</p>
<p>Most machine learning algorithms are shouting names in the street. They perform perceptive tasks that a person can do in under a second. But another kind of AI &#8212; deep reinforcement learning &#8212; is strategic. It learns how to take a series of actions in order to reach a goal. That’s powerful and smart &#8212; and it’s going to change a lot of industries.</p>
<p>Two industries on the cusp of AI transformations are manufacturing and supply chain. The ways we make and ship stuff are heavily dependent on groups of machines working together, and the efficiency and resiliency of those machines are the foundation of our economy and society. Without them, we can’t buy the basics we need to live and work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

They are attacking enormous markets: The industrial control and automation market was worth <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/factory-industrial-automation-sme-smb-market-541.html">$152 billion</a> last year, while logistics automation was valued at more than <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2021/02/02/2167982/0/en/The-logistics-automation-market-was-valued-at-USD-52-19-billion-in-2020-and-is-expected-to-be-USD-104-23-billion-in-2026-registering-a-CAGR-of-12-42-during-the-forecast-period-2021.html">$50 billion</a>.</p>

			Deep reinforcement learning consistently produces results that other machine learning and optimization tools are incapable of.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As a technologist, you need a lot of things to make deep reinforcement learning work. The first piece to think about is how you will get your deep reinforcement learning agent to practice the skills you want it to acquire. There are only two ways &#8212; with real data or through simulations. Each approach has its own challenge: Data must be collected and cleaned, while simulations must be built and validated.</p>
<p>Some examples will illustrate what this means. In 2016, GoogleX advertised its robotic “arm farms” &#8212; spaces filled with robot arms that were learning to grasp items and teach others how to do the same &#8212; which was one early way for a reinforcement learning algorithm to practice its moves in a real environment and measure the success of its actions. That feedback loop is necessary for a goal-oriented algorithm to learn: It must make sequential decisions and see where they lead.</p>
<p>In many situations, it is not feasible to build the physical environment where a reinforcement learning algorithm can learn. Let’s say you want to test different strategies for routing a fleet of thousands of trucks moving goods from many factories to many retail outlets. It would be very expensive to test all possible strategies, and those tests would not just cost money to run, but the failed runs would lead to many unhappy customers.</p>
<p>For many large systems, the only possible way to find the best action path is with simulation. In those situations, you must create a digital model of the physical system you want to understand in order to generate the data reinforcement learning needs. These models are called, alternately, digital twins, simulations and reinforcement-learning environments. They all essentially mean the same thing in manufacturing and supply chain applications.</p>
<p>Recreating any physical system requires domain experts who understand how the system works. This can be a problem for systems as small as a single fulfillment center for the simple reason that the people who built those systems may have left or died, and their successors have learned how to operate but not reconstruct them.</p>
<p>Many simulation software tools offer low-code interfaces that enable domain experts to create digital models of those physical systems. This is important, because domain expertise and software engineering skills often cannot be found in the same person.</p>

<p>Why would you go through all this trouble for a single algorithm? Because deep reinforcement learning consistently produces results that other machine learning and optimization tools are incapable of. <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind</a> used it, of course, to beat the world champion of the board game of Go. Reinforcement learning was part of the algorithms that were integral to achieving breakthrough results with chess, protein folding and Atari games. Likewise, <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI</a> trained deep reinforcement learning to beat the best human teams at Dota 2.</p>
<p>Just like deep artificial neural networks began to find business applications in the mid-2010s, after Geoffrey Hinton was hired by Google and Yann LeCun by Facebook, so too, deep reinforcement learning will have an increasing impact on industries. It will lead to quantum improvements in robotic automation and system control on the same order as we saw with Go. It will be the best we have, and by a long shot.</p>
<p>The consequence of those gains will be immense increases in efficiency and cost savings in manufacturing products and operating supply chains, leading to decreases in carbon emissions and worksite accidents. And, to be clear, the chokepoints and challenges of the physical world are all around us. Just in the last year, our societies have been hit by multiple supply chain disruptions due to COVID, lockdowns, the Suez Canal debacle and extreme weather events.</p>
<p>Zooming in on COVID, even after the vaccine was developed and approved, many countries have had trouble producing it and distributing it quickly. These are manufacturing and supply chain problems that involve situations we could not prepare for with historical data. They required simulations to predict what would happen, as well as how we could best address crises when they do occur, as Michael Lewis illustrated in his recent book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Premonition-Pandemic-Story-Michael-Lewis-ebook/dp/B08V91YY8R">The Premonition</a>.”</p>
<p>It is precisely this combination of constraints and novel challenges that take place in factories and supply chains that reinforcement learning and simulation can help us solve more quickly. And we are sure to face more of them in the future.</p>

<p>“People are the backbone of any organization. People are more important than the product. Without people, you don’t have a product,” says Joseph Ifiegbu, who is Snap’s former head of human resources technology and also previous lead of WeWork’s People Analytics team.</p>
<p>Ifiegbu’s startup, called <a href="https://www.eqtble.com/">eqtble</a>, wants to give HR teams the same kind of detailed analytics that product, sales and marketing departments have had for a long time, with the goal of creating more engaged and inclusive workplaces. The company, a Y Combinator alum, announced today it has raised $2.7 million in seed funding, led by Initialized Capital, with participation from SB Opportunity Fund, RS Ventures and other venture capital firms and angel investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ifiegbu joined WeWork’s People Analytics team in 2017, when the company had a total of about 2,000 employees. By the time he left in 2020, that number had grown to 15,000 people. One of Ifiegbu’s first hires at WeWork was Gabe Horwitz, the first data scientist on the People Analytics team and now eqtble’s co-founder and chief product officer. The startup’s third co-founder and chief technology officer is Ethan Veres.</p>
<p>At many companies, especially ones that are growing quickly, workforce data is scattered across different HR software, including human resources information systems (HRIS), engagement platforms, benefit programs and employee surveys.</p>
<p>Because information is so fragmented, companies can miss important correlations. For example, they might not see the links between why top employees are quitting and how long it typically takes to promote people, or overlook pay inequality. This in turn impacts a company’s culture, including its approach to diversity, equity and inclusion, and ability to retain talented people.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A glimpse inside the minds of tech&#8217;s DEI leaders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/a-glimpse-inside-the-minds-of-techs-dei-leaders/embed/#?secret=Mc8pcFCFH0" data-secret="Mc8pcFCFH0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As WeWork was rapidly scaling, the People Analytics team built tools to analyze data from across the company.</p>
<p>“There were a lot of questions being asked, like what is our promotion like? What is our attrition, are we hiring more men than women? There were all these questions and bottlenecks in our processes, and we wanted to have an understanding of our employees,” says Ifiegbu. “So we built systems to capture all that data, clean it, structure it and deliver dashboard insights to our leadership.”</p>
<p>The process took about two years, and the People Analytics team eventually grew to 15 people. Ifiegbu and Horwitz realized there were many companies that needed the same kind of analytics, but didn’t have WeWork’s resources. This prompted them to start working on eqtble.</p>
<p>“It took us such a long time and quite a bit of money because we had this team [at WeWork],” he says. “So how do we build something that delivers these insights to them, but doesn’t take that much time to do it, because we realize it’s very important that leadership and decision makers have the data to make decisions about their employees.”</p>
<h2>How eqtble works</h2>
<p>The current version of eqtble can be onboarded in six weeks, and Ifiegbu says the company’s goal is to shorten that process to just two days. Eqtble is sector agnostic and its target customers are high-growth companies that have between 250 to about 3,000 employees.</p>
<p>The human resources analytics platform can collect data from more than 100 sources (including Workday, ADP, Oracle, PeopleSoft, Qualtrics and Culture Amp, to name a few), and deliver insights and visualizations about four main areas: talent recruitment, workforce, engagement (including attrition, or when workers quit) and compensation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167323" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Summary-Page-Screenshot-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167323" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2167323" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Summary-Page-Screenshot-1.png?w=680" alt="A screenshot of HR analytics eqtble's dashboard" width="800" height="479" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Summary-Page-Screenshot-1.png 3242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Summary-Page-Screenshot-1.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Summary-Page-Screenshot-1.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Summary-Page-Screenshot-1.png?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Summary-Page-Screenshot-1.png?resize=680,407 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Summary-Page-Screenshot-1.png?resize=1536,920 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Summary-Page-Screenshot-1.png?resize=2048,1227 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Summary-Page-Screenshot-1.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2167323" class="wp-caption-text">One of eqtble&#8217;s summary dashboards. (Image: eqtble)</p></div></p>
<p>One of the things the platform can help HR teams do is identify why top candidates are declining offers.</p>
<p>For example, one of eqtble’s clients realized that their hiring managers were being passed more applications than they had time to look at. This created a bottleneck, because they weren’t able to interview people quickly enough. Other clients saw that candidates were dropping out because the interview process was too long.</p>
<p>“If you as an organization are saying &#8216;we’re going to have six rounds of interviews, it’s going to take three months to interview,&#8217; you’re going to lose out on good candidates,” says Ifiegbu. “Other people are closing candidates within one to two weeks.”</p>
<h2>Using data to increase diversity, equity and inclusion</h2>
<p>It’s easy for a company to make DEI pledges, but even the best of intentions don’t result in progress if an organization isn’t willing to scrutinize itself. Because eqtble combines data from across a company, it can highlight potential issues before decision makers realize what is happening.</p>
<p>“Last year, all the companies were saying, ‘oh, we’re going to do this, we’re going to do all these things,’ and it’s like, ok, great, you can say anything, but the truth is you cannot change what you don’t measure,” says Ifiegbu.</p>
<p>For example, a company might be be proud of having a workforce that is divided equally between men and women, or that has a large percentage of people of color, when the reality is that many of them aren’t getting raises or being promoted into management roles.</p>
<p>“That 50/50 doesn’t mean anything if you don’t see representation at higher levels for women and people of color. What we’re doing is showing you a picture of your organization. If you can see the different parts of it, you can see the parts you can improve on and take actionable steps, not just lip service for the media,” says Ifiegbu. “Eqtble surfaces places you can improve or places where you are doing well so you can keep doing that.”</p>

<p>Ifiegbu is excited that the HR analytics space is gaining attention. “I feel like using data to drive decisions is such an important thing, and ultimately builds a healthier company.”</p>
<p>The seed funding will be used to grow eqtble’s engineering team and its platform’s machine learning and visualization capabilities, and user acquisition.</p>
<p>In a statement, Initialized Capital partner and president Jen Wolf said, “Important organizational issues like DEI or equitable compensation are not simply a box a company can check, they take honest commitment. Companies willing to make that commitment shouldn’t have to wait months or be discouraged by the financial investment it takes to understand the data they already own to make these meaningful changes. The eqtble team knows how to solve this, and they’re empowering other companies to do so.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Output copied to clipboard! --></p>
<p>Jonathan Bush, the CEO and co-founder of Athenahealth, is a controversial figure in the controversial field of healthcare.</p>
<p>More than two decades after he started the now-public healthcare company, Bush lost Athenahealth to Elliott Management, an activist investor that bought the company alongside Veritas Capital. During this tense period of time, <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/athenahealth-ceo-jonathan-bush-apologizes-14-year-old-incidents-alleged-domestic-violence">domestic violence allegations surfaced</a> from his ex-wife, Sarah Seldon. Bush took responsibility for what he described as “regrettable incidents” that happened 14 years ago during a “particularly difficult personal time” in his life. Seldon, who TechCrunch attempted to reach for this story, made a statement then too, explaining that she and Bush have a “co-parenting relationship” with “respect, collaboration and love.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After these public incidents, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/03/jonathan-bushs-life-after-athenahealth-and-the-battle-with-elliott.html">Bush went quiet and only later re-emerged</a> as the executive chairman of Firefly Health, a primary care startup.</p>
<p>Now, Bush is back once again, this time as the co-founder of a new startup that aims to re-invent the digital health data stack. The company, <a href="https://zushealth.com/">Zus</a>, wants to create a shared data platform that doctors, regardless of specialty or location, can access to better understand their patients. Think of it as massive, fancy Google Doc built for healthcare, that health tech startups can use to kickstart their solutions, faster.</p>
<p>Along with its launch, Zus announced today that it has raised a $34 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from F-Prime Capital, Maverick Ventures, Rock Health, Martin Ventures and Oxeon Investments.</p>
<p>Bush’s venture-backed return to entrepreneurship may come as a surprise to some, including himself.</p>
<p>“I loved running Athena very much, all 22 years,” he said. “But I also loved fourth grade, and I don&#8217;t want to go back. I didn&#8217;t feel like I wanted to run a company again.” He changed his mind for two reasons: First, he expects that building a platform company will be different, and potentially less controversial, than building a traditional services business. Second, he sees “strong calling” to bring his tool to life amid a broader digital health boom.</p>
<p>“These digital health companies will largely not work if they aren&#8217;t dramatically accelerated,” he said. “All of them now are facing this quandary: that it’s very hard to hire engineers, enormous regulation and complexity, one too many types of complexity associated with building technologies in medicine.”</p>
<p>With Zus, he’s trying to create capacity. The company has a lot of plans, which includes a growing library of software tools around patient relationship management, a data aggregation service that helps standardize medical records for sharing purposes, a platform that sits atop this information so that multiple doctors can access the same information and a patient portal that lets users understand how their data is shared and accessed.</p>
<p>So far, the platform is being used by four partners: Cityblock Health, Dorsata, Firefly Health, which is Bush’s previous employer, and Oak Street Health.</p>
<p>Part of the company’s existence can be tied to recent regulation progress. The 21st Century Cures Act gave patients the right to access their medical records, and by next year, third parties can access that same data as well. Many think this newfound data portability could seed a <a href="https://techmonitor.ai/leadership/digital-transformation/21st-century-cures-act">massive new generation of healthcare apps,</a> although there are some concerns about if patients know what they are signing up for.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/msliu/">Mimi Liu</a>, chief technology officer of Firefly Health, said in a statement that Zus will help build out the parts of its infrastructure stack that can be commoditized, bringing its roll-out time from years to weeks and months. She added that its clinical value proposition will be improved because of the “downstream network effect that comes as a result of information sharing.”</p>
<p>A16z, which led the round, is an investor in Firefly Health, as well as a number of healthcare startups like Incredible Health, Omada, PatientPing and Cedar.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 strategies for building a digital health unicorn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/4-strategies-for-building-a-digital-health-unicorn/embed/#?secret=fOKnp7AbuS" data-secret="fOKnp7AbuS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/author/julie-yoo/">Julie Yoo</a>, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, said that Zus embodies its digital health stack thesis, which argues need for “infrastructure platforms that serve the large and rapidly growing population of digital health companies, such that each company no longer has to build the same underlying tech and operations components over and over again, from scratch.”</p>
<p>When asked about Zus’ differentiation, Yoo said that the company will create a community-based marketplace for digital health companies to set up and trade notes, which she thinks has not yet existed in the sector.</p>
<p>“If anything, one might say that the precursor to this concept was the More Disruption Please (MDP) program at Athenahealth, which makes Jonathan Bush uniquely qualified to build this more modern version of said concept,” she said. The MDP program was launched by Bush in 2017 with the goal of filling 200 seats in Athenahealth’s San Francisco office with upcoming entrepreneurs in healthcare.</p>
<p>Zus isn’t the first company to try to start an AWS for healthcare, and in fact there are numerous companies that all work on the different services that Zus wants to one day own, from administrative workflow to patient data retrieval. But, its holistic approach at a time when regulation is changing and investment is booming, along with an experienced founder with the right connections, could prepare it well for what&#8217;s to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://try.twine.nyc/">Twine</a>, a video chat startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/08/twine-aims-to-end-social-isolation-with-its-video-chat-app-for-deep-conversations/">launched</a> amid the pandemic as a sort of &#8220;Zoom for meeting new people,&#8221; shifted its focus to online events and, as a result, has now closed on $3.3 million in seed funding. To date, twine&#8217;s events customers have included names like Microsoft, Amazon, Forrester and others, and the service is on track to do $1 million in bookings in 2021, the company says.</p>
<p>The new round was led by Moment Ventures, and included participation from Coelius Capital, AltaIR Capital, Mentors Fund, Rosecliff Ventures, AltaClub and Bloom Venture Partners. Clint Chao, founding partner at Moment, will join twine’s board of directors with the round&#8217;s close.</p>
<p>The shift into the online events space makes sense, given twine&#8217;s co-founders &#8212; Lawrence Coburn, Diana Rau and Taylor McLoughlin &#8212; hail from DoubleDutch, the mobile events technology provider<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/cvent-acquires-mobile-event-technology-provider-doubledutch/"> acquired by Cvent in 2019.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Coburn, previously CEO of DoubleDutch, had been under a non-compete with its acquirer until December 2020, which is one reason why he didn’t first attempt a return to the events space.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s original idea was to help people who were missing out on social connections under COVID lockdowns find a way to meet others and chat online. This early version of twine saw some small amount of traction, as 10% of its users were even willing to pay. But many more were nervous about being connected to random online strangers, twine found.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167142" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167142" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2167142 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twine-one-to-one.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twine-one-to-one.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twine-one-to-one.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twine-one-to-one.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twine-one-to-one.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twine-one-to-one.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twine-one-to-one.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167142" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> twine</p></div></p>
<p>So the company shifted its focus to the familiar events space, with a specific focus on online events which grew in popularity due to the pandemic. While setting up livestreams, text chats and Q&amp;A has been possible, what’s been missing from many online events was the casual and unexpected networking that used to happen in-person.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hardest thing to bring to virtual events was the networking and the serendipity &#8212; like the conversations that used to happen in an elevator, in the bar, the lobby &#8212; these kinds of things,&#8221; explains Coburn. &#8220;So we began testing a group space version of twine &#8212; bringing twine to existing communities as opposed to trying to build our own, new community. And that showed a lot more legs,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>By January 2021, the new events-focused version of twine was up and running, offering a set of professional networking tools for event owners. Unlike one-to-many or few-to-many video broadcasts, twine connects a small number of people for more intimate conversations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did a lot of research with our customers and users, and beyond five [people in a chat], it turns into a webinar,&#8221; notes Coburn, of the limitations on twine&#8217;s video chat. In twine, a small handful of people are dropped into a video chat experience &#8212; and now, they&#8217;re not random online strangers. They&#8217;re fellow event attendees. That generally keeps user behavior professional and the conversations productive.</p>
<p>Event owners can use the product for free on twine&#8217;s website for small events with up to 30 users, but to scale up any further requires a license. Twine charges on a per attendee basis, where customers buy packs of attendees on a software-as-a-service model.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s customers can then embed twine directly in their own website or add a link that pops open the twine website in a separate browser tab.</p>
<p>Coburn says twine has found a sweet spot with big corporate event programs. The company has around 25 customers, but some of those have already used twine for 10 or 15 events after first testing out the product for something smaller.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re working with five or six of the biggest companies in the world right now,&#8221; noted Coburn.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167143" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167143" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167143" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twine-cyber-cafe.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twine-cyber-cafe.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twine-cyber-cafe.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twine-cyber-cafe.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twine-cyber-cafe.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twine-cyber-cafe.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twine-cyber-cafe.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167143" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> twine</p></div></p>
<p>Because the matches are digital, twine can offer other tools like digital &#8220;business card&#8221; exchanges and analytics and reports for the event hosts and attendees alike.</p>
<p>Despite the cautious return to normal in the U.S., which may see in-person events return in the year ahead, twine believes there&#8217;s still a future in online events. Due to the pandemic&#8217;s lasting impacts, organizations are likely to adopt a hybrid approach to their events going forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s ever been an industry that has gone through a 15 months like the events industry just went through,&#8221; Coburn says. &#8220;These companies went to zero, their revenue went to zero and some of them were coming from hundreds of millions of dollars. So what happened was a digital transformation like the world has never seen,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Now, there are tens of thousands of event planners who have gotten really good at tech and online events. And they saw the potential in online, which would sometimes deliver 4x or 5x the attendance of virtual, Coburn points out.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why you see LinkedIn drop $50 million on Hopin,&#8221; he says, referring to the recent fundraise for the virtual conference technology business. (The deal was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/09/linkedin-invests-in-hopin-betting-on-post-pandemic-remote-events.html">reportedly</a> for less than $50 million). &#8220;This is why you see the rounds of funding that are going into Hopin and Bizzabo and Hubilo and all the others. This is the taxi market, pre-Uber.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-UhGd8io9Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, virtual events may end up less concerned with social features when they can offer an in-person experience. And those who want to host online events may be looking for a broader solution than Zoom + twine, for example.</p>
<p>But twine has ideas about what it wants to do next, including asynchronous matchmaking, which could end up being more valuable as it could lead to better matches since it wouldn&#8217;t be limited to only who&#8217;s online now.</p>
<p>With the funding, twine is hiring in sales and customer success, working on accessibility improvements and expanding its platform. To date, twine has raised $4.7 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For all that&#8217;s said about fundraising and working alongside investors, rarely do we get to see founders and their investors in candid conversation with one another. Extra Crunch Live is changing that. On the weekly live show, we sit down with founders and the VCs who funded them to talk about how they came together on the deal, what stood out about the other party that led to their commitment and how they operate today. We also (usually) take a walk through their early pitch decks to get a feel for how success starts.</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-emergence-capital-and-retail-zipline?ref=928ff1c911ab">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Emergence&#8217;s Lotti Siniscalco and Retail Zipline&#8217;s Melissa Wong to discuss all that and more. The event goes down on Wednesday, June 23 at 3 p.m. ET/noon PT. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-emergence-capital-and-retail-zipline?ref=928ff1c911ab">You can register to attend right here.</a></p>
<p>Siniscalco is a principal at Emergence Capital, investing in early-stage enterprise software companies. She currently serves on the board of directors at Whistic and High Alpha. Prior to Emergence, she was an investor in financial services and technology at Advent International, a PE firm, and led diligence for Ribbit Capital (also fintech focused) before that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other words, she&#8217;s an expert in fintech and can bring a wealth of wisdom to our conversation around fundraising and startup growth.</p>
<p>Melissa Wong, on the other hand, has spent 10 years in retail communications at Old Navy. It was here that she realized a problem that Zipline Retail, a retail communication and store execution platform, could solve and set out on her own venture.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live also features the ECL Pitch-off, where startups in the audience can virtually &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; to pitch their startup live on our stream. Our expert guests will give their feedback on each pitch. If you want to throw your hat in the ring, you have to show up.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is accessible to everyone, but only Extra Crunch members can access the content on demand. We do these every week, so there are scores of episodes across a wide variety of startup sectors in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">ECL Library</a>. It&#8217;s but one of many reasons to become an Extra Crunch member. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">Join here.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Claroty, an industrial <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> company that helps customers protect and manage their Internet of Things (IoT) and operational technology (OT) assets, has raised $140 million in its latest, and potentially last round of funding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>With the new round of Series D funding, co-led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bessemer-venture-partners/">Bessemer Venture</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/40-north-ventures/">40 North</a>, the company has now amassed a total of $235 million. Additional strategic investors include LG and I Squared Capital&#8217;s ISQ Global InfraTech Fund, with all previous investors — Team8, Rockwell Automation, Siemens, and Schneider Electric — also participating.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Founded in 2015, the late-stage startup focuses on the industrial side of cybersecurity. Its customers include General Motors, Coca-Cola EuroPacific Partners, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pfizer/">Pfizer</a>, with Claroty helping the pharmaceutical firm to secure its COVID-19 vaccine supply chain. Claroty tells TechCrunch it has seen “significant” customer growth over the past 18 months, largely fueled by the pandemic, with 110% year-over-year net new logo growth and 100% customer retention.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It will use the newly raised funds to meet this rapidly accelerating global demand for The Claroty Platform, an end-to-end solution that provides visibility into industrial networks and combines secure remote access with continuous monitoring for threats and vulnerabilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission is to drive visibility, continuity, and resiliency in the industrial economy by delivering the most comprehensive solutions that secure all connected devices within the four walls of an industrial site, including all operational technology (OT), Internet of Things (IoT), and industrial IoT (IIoT) assets,&#8221; said Claroty CEO Yaniv Vardi.</p>
<p>To meet this growing demand, the startup is planning to expand into new regions and verticals, including transportation government-owned industries, as well as increase its global headcount. The company, which is based in New York, currently has around 240 employees.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Claroty hasn’t yet made any acquisitions, though CEO Yaniv Vardi tells TechCrunch that this could be part of the startup’s roadmap going forward.</p>
<p>“We’re waiting for the right opportunity at the right time, but it’s definitely part of the plan as part of the financial runway we just secured,&#8221; he said, adding that this latest funding round will likely be the company’s last before it explores a potential IPO.</p>
<p>“We are thinking that this is a pre-IPO funding round,” he said. “The end goal here is to be the market leader for industrial cybersecurity. One of the mascots can be going public with an IPO, but there are different options too, such as SPAC.”</p>
<p>The funding round comes amid a sharp increase in cyber targeting organizations that underpin the world&#8217;s critical infrastructure and supply chains. According to a recent survey carried out by Claroty, the majority (53%) of US industrial enterprises have seen an increase in cybersecurity threats since the start of 2020. The survey of 1,110 IT and OT security professionals also found that over half believed their organization is now more of a target for cybercriminals, with 67% having seen cybercriminals use new tactics amid the pandemic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The number of attacks, and impact of these attacks, is increasing significantly, especially in verticals like food, automotive, and critical infrastructure. Vardi said. “That creates a lot of risk assessments public companies had to do, and these risks needed to be addressed with a security solution on the industrial side.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies like Stripe and Twilio have put APIs front and center as an effective way to integrate complex functionality that may not be core to your own technology stack but a necessary part of your wider business. Today, a company that has taken that model to create an effective way to integrate email, calendars and other tools into other apps using APIs is announcing a big round of funding to expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nylas.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nylas</a>, which describes itself as a communications API platform &#8212; enabling more automation particularly in business apps by integrating productivity tools through a few lines of code &#8212; has raised $120 million in funding, money that it will be using to continue expanding the kinds of APIs that it offers, with a focus in particular not just on productivity apps, but AI and related tools to bring in more automation into workflows.</p>
<p>Nylas is not disclosing its valuation, but this is a very significant step up for the company comes at a time when it is seeing strong traction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is more than double what Nylas had raised up to now ($55 million since being founded in 2015), and when it last raised &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/22/nylas-scores-16m-series-b-to-expand-email-api-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$16 million Series B</a> in 2018 &#8212; it said it had &#8220;thousands of developers&#8221; among its users. Now, that number has ballooned to 40,000, with Nylas processing some 1.2 billion API requests each day, working out to 20 terabytes of data, daily. It also said that revenue growth tripled in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>The Series C is bringing a number of interesting names to Nylas&#8217;s cap table. New investor Tiger Global Management is leading the round, with previous backers Citi Ventures, Slack Fund, 8VC and Round13 Capital also participating. Other new backers in this round include Owl Rock Capital, a division of Blue Owl; Stripe co-founders Patrick Collison and John Collison; Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski; and Tony Fadell.</p>
<p>As with other companies in the so-called API economy, the gap and opportunity that Nylas has identified is that there are a lot of productivity tools that largely exist in their own silos &#8212; meaning when a person wants to use them when working in an application, they have to open a separate application to do so. At the same time, building new, say, tools, or building a bridge to integrate an existing application, can be time-consuming and complex.</p>
<p>Nylas first identified this issue with email. An integration to make it easier to use email and the data housed in it &#8212; which works with emails from major providers like Microsoft and Google, as well as other services built with the IMAP protocol &#8212; in other apps picked up a lot of followers, leading the company to expand into other areas that today include scheduling and calendaring, a neural API to build in tools like sentiment analysis or productivity or workflow automation; and security integrations to streamline the Google OAuth security review process (used for example in an app geared at developers).</p>
<p>“The fundamental shift towards digital communications and connectivity has resulted in companies across all industries increasingly leaning on developers to solve critical business challenges and build unique and engaging products and experiences. As a result, APIs have become core to modern software development and digital transformation,” Gleb Polyakov, co-founder and CEO of Nylas, said in statement.</p>
<p>“Through our suite of powerful APIs, we’re arming developers with the tools and applications needed to meet customer and market needs faster, create competitive differentiation through powerful and customized user experiences, and generate operational ROI through more productive and intelligently automated processes and development cycles. We’re thrilled to continue advancing our mission to make the world more productive and are honored to have the backing of distinguished investors and entrepreneurs.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the rise of Nylas and the function it fulfills is part of a bigger shift we&#8217;ve seen in businesses overall: as organizations become more digitized and use more cloud-based apps to get work done, developers have emerged as key mechanics to help that machine run. A bigger emphasis on APIs to integrate services together is part of their much-used toolkit, one of the defining reasons for investors backing Nylas today.</p>
<p>“Companies are rapidly adopting APIs as a way to automate productivity and find new and innovative ways to support modern work and collaboration,” said John Curtius, a partner at Tiger, in a statement. “This trend has become critical to creating frictionless and meaningful data-driven communications that power digital transformation. We believe Nylas is uniquely positioned to lead the future of the API economy.” Curtius is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Valencia-based startup <a href="https://internxt.com">Internxt</a> has been quietly working on an ambitious plan to make decentralized cloud storage massively accessible to anyone with an Internet connection.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just bagged $1M in seed funding led by Angels Capital, a European VC fund owned by Juan Roig (aka Spain&#8217;s richest grocer and second wealthiest billionaire), and Miami-based The Venture City. It had previously raised around half a million dollars via a token sale to help fund early development.</p>
<p>The seed funds will be put towards its next phase of growth &#8212; its month-to-month growth rate is 30% and it tells us it&#8217;s confident it can at least sustain that &#8212; including planning a big boost to headcount so it can accelerate product development.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Spanish startup <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has spent most of its short life to date developing a decentralized infrastructure that it argues is both inherently more secure and more private than mainstream cloud-based apps (such as those offered by tech giants like Google).</span></p>
<p>This is because files are not only encrypted in a way that means it cannot access your data but information is also stored in a highly decentralized way, split into tiny shards which are then distributed across multiple storage locations, with users of the network contributing storage space (and being recompensed for providing that capacity with &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; crypto).</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a distributed architecture, we&#8217;ve got servers all over the world,&#8221; explains founder and CEO Fran Villalba Segarra. &#8220;We leverage and use the space provided by professionals and individuals. So they connect to our infrastructure and start hosting data shards and we pay them for the data they host &#8212; which is also more affordable because we are not going through the traditional route of just renting out a data center and paying them for a fixed amount of space.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like the Airbnb model or Uber model. We&#8217;ve kind of democratized storage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Internxt clocked up three years of R&amp;D, beginning in 2017, before launching its first cloud-based apps: Drive (file storage), a year ago &#8212; and now Photos (a Google Photos rival).</p>
<p>So far it&#8217;s attracting around a million active users without paying any attention to marketing, per Villalba Segarra.</p>
<p>Internxt Mail is the next product in its pipeline &#8212; to compete with Gmail and also ProtonMail, a pro-privacy alternative to Google&#8217;s freemium webmail client (and for more on why it believes it can offer an edge there read on).</p>
<p>Internxt Send (file transfer) is another product billed as coming soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re working on a G-Suite alternative to make sure we&#8217;re at the level of Google when it comes to competing with them,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>The issue Internxt&#8217;s architecture is designed to solve is that files which are stored in just one place are vulnerable to being accessed by others. Whether that&#8217;s the storage provider itself (who may, like Google, have a privacy-hostile business model based on mining users&#8217; data); or hackers/third parties who manage to break the provider&#8217;s security &#8212; and can thus grab and/or otherwise interfere with your files.</p>
<p>Security risks when networks are compromised can include ransomeware attacks &#8212; which have been on an uptick in recent years &#8212; whereby attackers that have penetrated a network and gained access to stored files then hold the information to ransom by walling off the rightful owner&#8217;s access (typically by applying their own layer of encryption and demanding payment to unlock the data).</p>
<p>The core conviction driving Internxt&#8217;s decentralization push is that files sitting whole on a server or hard drive are sitting ducks.</p>
<p>Its answer to that problem is an alternative file storage infrastructure that combines zero access encryption and decentralization &#8212; meaning files are sharded, distributed and mirrored across multiple storage locations, making them highly resilient against storage failures or indeed hack attacks and snooping.</p>
<p>The approach ameliorates cloud service provider-based privacy concerns because Internxt itself cannot access user data.</p>
<p>To make money its business model is simple, tiered subscriptions: With (currently) one plan covering all its existing and planned services &#8212; based on how much data you need. (It is also freemium, with the first 10GB being free.)</p>
<p>Internxt is by no means the first to see key user value in rethinking core Internet architecture.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/23/maidsafe/">Scotland&#8217;s MaidSafe</a> has been trying to build an alternative decentralized Internet for well over a decade at this point &#8212; only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/12/after-a-decade-of-rd-maidsafes-decentralized-network-opens-for-alpha-testing/">starting alpha testing its alt network</a> (aka, the <a href="https://twitter.com/safenetworktech">Safe Network</a>) back in 2016, after ten years of testing. Its long term mission to reinvent the Internet continues.</p>
<p>Another (slightly less veteran) competitor in the decentralized cloud storage space is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/storj-brings-low-cost-decentralized-cloud-storage-to-the-enterprise/">Storj</a>, which is targeting enterprise users. There&#8217;s also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/filecoins-ico-opens-today-for-accredited-investors-after-raising-52m-from-advisers/">Filecoin</a> and <a href="https://sia.tech">Sia</a> &#8212; both also part of the newer wave of blockchain startups that sprung up after Bitcoin sparked entrepreneurial interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain/decentralization.</p>
<p>How, then, is what Internxt&#8217;s doing different to these rival decentralized storage plays &#8212; all of which have been at this complex coal face for longer?</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re the only European based startup that&#8217;s doing this [except for MaidSafe, although it&#8217;s UK not EU based],&#8221; says Villalba Segarra, arguing that the European Union&#8217;s legal regime around data protection and privacy lends it an advantage vs U.S. competitors. &#8220;All the others, Storj, plus Sia, Filecoin&#8230; they&#8217;re all US-based companies as far as I&#8217;m aware.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other major differentiating factor he highlights is usability &#8212; arguing that the aforementioned competitors have been &#8220;built by developers for developers&#8221;. Whereas he says Internxt&#8217;s goal is be the equivalent of &#8216;Coinbase for decentralized storage&#8217;; aka, it wants to make a very complex technology highly accessible to non-technical Internet users.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge technology but in the blockchain space we see this all the time &#8212; where there&#8217;s huge potential but it&#8217;s very hard to use,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;That&#8217;s essentially what Coinbase is also trying to do &#8212; bringing blockchain to users, making it easier to use, easier to invest in cryptocurrency etc. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to do at Internxt as well, bringing blockchain for cloud storage to the people. Making it easy to use with a very easy to use interface and so forth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only service in the distributed cloud space that&#8217;s actually usable &#8212; that&#8217;s kind of our main differentiating factor from Storj and all these other companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of infrastructure it&#8217;s actually pretty similar to that of Sia or Storj,&#8221; he goes on &#8212; further likening Internxt&#8217;s &#8216;zero access&#8217; encryption to Proton Drive&#8217;s architecture (aka, the file storage product from the makers of end-to-end encrypted email service ProtonMail) &#8212; which also relies on client side encryption to give users a robust technical guarantee that the service provider can&#8217;t snoop on your stuff. (So you don&#8217;t have to just trust the company not to violate your privacy.)</p>
<p>But while it&#8217;s also touting zero access encryption (it seems to be using off-the-shelf AES-256 encryption; it says it uses &#8220;military grade&#8221;, client-side, open source encryption that&#8217;s been audited by Spain&#8217;s S2 Grupo, a major local cybersecurity firm), Internxt takes the further step of decentralizing the encrypted bits of data too. And that means it can tout added security benefits, per Villalba Segarra.</p>
<p>&#8220;On top of that what we do is we fragment data and then distribute it around the world. So essentially what servers host are encrypted data shards &#8212; which is much more secure because if a hacker was ever to access one of these servers what they would find is encrypted data shards which are essentially useless. Not even we can access that data.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that adds a huge layer of security against hackers or third party [access] in terms of data. And then on top of that we build very nice interfaces with which the user is very used to using &#8212; pretty much similar to those of Google&#8230; and that also makes us very different from Storj and Sia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Storage space for Internxt users&#8217; files is provided by users who are incentivized to offer up their unused capacity to host data shards with micropayments of crypto for doing so. This means capacity could be coming from an individual user connecting to Internxt with just their laptop &#8212; or a datacenter company with large amounts of unused storage capacity. (And Villalba Segarra notes that it has a number of data center companies, such as OVH, are connected to its network.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have any direct contracts [for storage provision]&#8230; Anyone can connect to our network &#8212; so datacenters with available storage space, if they want to make some money on that they can connect to our network. We don&#8217;t pay them as much as we would pay them if we went to them through the traditional route,&#8221; he says, likening this portion of the approach to how Airbnb has both hosts and guests (or Uber needs drivers and riders).</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the platform that connects both parties but we don&#8217;t host any data ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Internxt uses a reputation system to manage storage providers &#8212; to ensure network uptime and quality of service &#8212; and also applies blockchain &#8216;proof of work&#8217; challenges to node operators to make sure they&#8217;re actually storing the data they claim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of the decentralized nature of our architecture we really need to make sure that it hits a certain level of reliability,&#8221; he says. &#8220;So for that we use blockchain technology&#8230; When you&#8217;re storing data in your own data center it&#8217;s easier in terms of making sure it&#8217;s reliable but when you&#8217;re storing it in a decentralized architecture it brings a lot of benefits &#8212; such as more privacy or it&#8217;s also more affordable &#8212; but the downside is you need to make sure that for example they&#8217;re actually storing data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Payments to storage capacity providers are also made via blockchain tech &#8212; which Villalba Segarra says is the only way to scale and automate so many micropayments to ~10,000 node operators all over the world.</p>
<p>Discussing the issue of energy costs &#8212; given that &#8216;proof of work&#8217; blockchain-based technologies are facing increased scrutiny over the energy consumption involved in carrying out the calculations &#8212; he suggests that Internxt&#8217;s decentralized architecture can be more energy efficient than traditional data centers because data shards are more likely to be located nearer to the requesting user &#8212; shrinking the energy required to retrieve packets vs always having to do so from a few centralized global locations.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve seen in terms of energy consumption is that we&#8217;re actually much more energy efficient than a traditional cloud storage service. Why? Think about it, we mirror files and we store them all over the world&#8230; It&#8217;s actually impossible to access a file from Dropbox that is sent out from [a specific location]. Essentially when you access Dropbox or Google Drive and you download a file they&#8217;re going to be sending it out from their data center in Texas or wherever. So there&#8217;s a huge data transfer energy consumption there &#8212; and people don&#8217;t think about it,&#8221; he argues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data center energy consumption is already 2%* of the whole world&#8217;s energy consumption if I&#8217;m not mistaken. So being able to use latency and being able to send your files from [somewhere near the user] &#8212; which is also going to be faster, which is all factored into our reputation system &#8212; so our algorithms are going to be sending you the files that are closer to you so that we save a lot of energy from that. So if you multiple that by millions of users and millions of terabytes that actually saves a lot of energy consumption and also costs for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>What about latency from the user&#8217;s point of view? Is there a noticeable lag when they try to upload or retrieve and access files stored on Internxt vs &#8212; for example &#8212; Google Drive?</p>
<p>Villalba Segarra says being able to store file fragments closer to the user also helps compensate for any lag. But he also confirms there is a bit of a speed difference vs mainstream cloud storage services.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of upload and download speed we&#8217;re pretty close to Google Drive and Dropbox,&#8221; he suggests. &#8220;Again these companies have been around for over ten years and their services are very well optimized and they&#8217;ve got a traditional cloud architecture which is also relatively simpler, easier to build and they&#8217;ve got thousands of [employees] so their services are obviously much better than our service in terms of speed and all that. But we&#8217;re getting really close to them and we&#8217;re working really fast towards bringing our speed [to that level] and also as many features as possible to our architecture and to our services.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Essentially how we see it is we&#8217;re at the level of Proton Drive or Tresorit in terms of usability,&#8221; he adds on the latency point. &#8220;And we&#8217;re getting really close to Google Drive. But an average user shouldn&#8217;t really see much of a difference and, as I said, we&#8217;re literally working as hard as possible to make our services as useable as those of Google. But we&#8217;re ages ahead of Storj, Sia, MaidSafe and so forth &#8212; that&#8217;s for sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Internxt is doing all this complex networking with a team of just 20 people currently. But with the new seed funding tucked in its back pocket the plan now is to ramp up hiring over the next few months &#8212; so that it can accelerate product development, sustain its growth and keep pushing its competitive edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the time we do a Series A we should be around 100 people at Internxt,&#8221; says Villalba Segarra. &#8220;We are already preparing our Series A. We just closed our seed round but because of how fast we&#8217;re growing we are already being reached out to by a few other lead VC funds from the US and London.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a pretty big Series A. Potentially the biggest in Spain&#8230; We plan on growing until the Series A at at least a 30% month-to-month rate which is what we&#8217;ve been growing up until now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also tells TechCrunch that the intention for the Series A is to do the funding at a $50M valuation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were planning on doing it a year from now because we literally just closed our [seed] round but because of how many VCs are reaching out to us we may actually do it by the end of this year,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;But timeframe isn&#8217;t an issue for us. What matters most is being able to reach that minimum valuation.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>*Per the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks">IEA</a>, data centres and data transmission networks each accounted for around 1% of global electricity use in 2019</em></p>
