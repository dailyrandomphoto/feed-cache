										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Year-old startup Capiter announced last week that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/egyptian-startup-capiter-raises-33m-to-expand-b2b-e-commerce-platform-across-mena/">raised</a> a $33 million Series A to digitize Egypt&#8217;s traditional offline retail market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s looking to take a large pie in the budding e-commerce and retail play, where multiple startups are pulling their weight including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartona, also a year-old startup out of Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://cartona.com/">Cartona</a> is announcing that it has raised a $4.5 million pre-Series A funding round to connect retailers and manufacturers via an application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company confirmed that Dubai-based venture capital firm Global Ventures led the round, with Pan-African firm Kepple Africa, T5 Capital and angel investors also participating</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cairo-based Cartona, founded in August 2020, focuses on solving the supply-chain and operational challenges of players in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry by helping buyers access products from sellers on a single platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyers, in this case, are retailers, while sellers are FMCG companies, distributors and wholesalers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem retailers in Egypt and most of Africa face mainly revolves around limited access to suppliers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are also issues around transparency in market prices, which are dependent on traditional logistical capabilities.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For suppliers, the lack of data and inability to make data-backed decisions to improve margins and aid growth add up to unoptimized warehouses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The trade market is completely inefficient and it&#8217;s not good for the supplier nor the manufacturers, and it&#8217;s definitely not good for retailers,&#8221; CEO Mahmoud Talaat told TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So we came up with the idea of Cartona, which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> light-asset model that connects manufacturers and wholesalers to retailers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talaat founded the company alongside Mahmoud Abdel-Fattah. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Cartona, Abdel-Fattah founded Speakol, a MENA-focused adtech platform serving 60 million monthly users, while Talaat was the chief commercial officer of agriculture company Lamar Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartona works as an asset-light marketplace. On the platform, grocery retailers can get orders from a curated network of sellers. The company says this way, it can provide visibility through real-time price comparisons and clarity on delivery times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, FMCGs and suppliers can optimize their go-to-market execution through the use of data and analytics. Cartona tops it off by providing embedded finance and access to credit to retailers and suppliers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartona makes money through all these processes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes a commission on orders made, charges suppliers for running advertising to merchants (since they compete for the latter&#8217;s attention), and provides market insights on buyer behavior, price competition and market share</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is time to capitalize on technology beyond warehouses and trucks. Data and technology will transform traditional retail to a digitally native one, which in return will drastically improve the supply chain efficiency,&#8221; Abdel-Fattah said about how the company sells information to retailers and suppliers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartona has over 30,000 merchants on its platform. Together, they have processed more than 400,000 orders with an annualized gross merchandise value of EGP 1 billion (~$64 million). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartona also works with more than 1,000 distributors, wholesalers and 100 FMCG companies, offering consumers more than 10,000 products, including dry, fresh and frozen food</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s business and revenue model is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other companies in this space, but t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he main difference lies in whether they own assets or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a look at the players in Egypt, for instance, MaxAB operates its warehouses and fleets; Capiter uses a hybrid model in which it rents these assets and owns inventory when dealing with high-turnover products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But Cartona </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">solely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> manages an asset-light model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO tells me that he thinks this model works best for all the stakeholders involved in the retail market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He argues that not owning assets and leasing the ones on the ground shows that the company is trying to improve the operations of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suppliers and merchants instead of displacing them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the infrastructure already exists. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We already have many warehouses, many small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, and wholesalers and distributors and companies that have a lot of assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to fix the problem, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one should enable the people who are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> located in small streets all over Egypt and have the infrastructure but don&#8217;t have the technology needed to optimize their warehouses and carts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current margins for suppliers with warehouses are slim, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartona provides the technology &#8212; an inventory and ordering system &#8212; to provide efficiency in its supply chain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general partner at lead investor Global Ventures, Basil Moftah, said in a statement that Cartona&#8217;s technology and not owning inventory proved critical in the firm&#8217;s decision to back the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The trade market is one of the most sophisticated, yet [it is] characterized by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> critical inefficiencies across the value chain,&#8221; he said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartona&#8217;s asset-light approach tackles those inefficiencies by optimizing the trade process in unique ways and does so with minimal capital spent.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proceeds of the investment focus on improving this technology, Talaat said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Cartona is expanding its team and operations beyond two cities in Egypt &#8212; Cairo and Alexandria &#8212; to other parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A longer-term plan might include horizontal and vertical product expansion into pharmaceuticals, electronics and fashion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

		Joseph Wengier competed in five Paralympics and won nine gold medals. He promotes the advancement of a more inclusive internet as an ambassador for accessibility technology company <a href="https://userway.org/">UserWay</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">After winning my first gold medal in the 1972 Paralympics, I went out with the swim team for a celebratory dinner. I’ll never forget the paradoxical sight of my teammates — all world-class athletes — being carried in their wheelchairs up the few steps into an inaccessible restaurant. While far from a rare occurrence at the time, the stark contrast between that moment and our victory in the pool earlier that day made it stand out.</p>
<p>As I strapped on my braces and slowly made my way up the stairs, I reflected on the irony of the situation. As Paralympic champions, we were sources of inspiration to millions. We were breaking down stereotypes and changing perceptions about what disabled people could accomplish. Yet while we were celebrated by society, we were not accommodated by it.</p>
<p>Accessing many basic goods and services required herculean feats of strength and agility. Attempts at participating fully in the physical world were met with hurdles and obstacles. At that time, it was clear that for the Paralympic movement, which strived to promote disability rights through Paralympic sport, the work was not yet done. In fact, it was just beginning.</p>
<p>Over the subsequent four Paralympic games that I participated in, we began to see the gradual shift toward more accessible cities. The Paralympic movement played no small part in that advancement. By putting a wide range of disabled people on TV around the world, it brought the need for equal access from the shadows into the spotlight.</p>

Wengier is second from left. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joseph Wengier.</p></div></p>
<p>The Paralympics also demanded host cities do better, requiring <a href="https://theconversation.com/lessons-from-london-how-hosting-the-paralympics-can-make-cities-more-accessible-53044">meaningful and lasting improvements</a> to the accessibility of cities’ infrastructure. Today, while there is certainly still much room for improvement, disabled people have found solutions for most problems and are able to participate in society more than ever before.</p>
<p>Yet with the internet taking an increasingly central part in our daily lives, we are seeing the same exclusionary practices that we experienced — and fought against — all those years ago reappearing in a new form. A <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">recent study</a> reviewed the world&#8217;s top 1 million websites and found accessibility issues on the homepages of more than 97% of them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A restaurant website that lacks support for keyboard navigation or does not work properly with screen readers can prevent a person who relies on these technologies from ordering food, similar to the way that lack of wheelchair access can prevent them from entering the establishment.</p>
<p>Now, with COVID-19 upending our daily routines, the shift online has accelerated. More and more businesses are going digital, with their website being the only way to schedule an appointment, buy groceries or apply for a job. This makes the need for accessible websites more critical than ever. It is not a matter of a minor inconvenience or an inability to access a new technology or service. We are seeing basic day-to-day needs moving online and becoming less accessible in the process. It is this slide backward that has compelled me to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7LSnYaXcCY">speak up</a> and share my story.</p>
<p>As we go online to watch the highlight clips of our favorite athletes’ performances in Tokyo, take to social media to congratulate them, or visit our favorite sports site to read the coverage of the events, let’s demand that these businesses make their websites accessible so that Paralympic champions can do the same.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://sorare.com">Sorare</a> has announced that it has raised a significant funding round. SoftBank&#39;s Vision Fund 2 has led a $680 million Series B round, which values the company at $4.3 billion.</p>
<p>Sorare has built a fantasty football (soccer) platform based on NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. Each digital card is registered as a unique token on the Ethereum blockchain. Players can buy and sell cards from other players. Transactions are all recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>What makes Sorare unique is that it has partnered with 180 football organizations, including some of the most famous clubs in Europe, such as Real Madrid, Liverpool and Juventus. It creates a barrier to entry for other companies in the space.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand to new sports, open an office in the U.S., hire more people and invest in marketing campaigns. You can expect more partnership announcements with professional sports organizations in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to SoftBank&#39;s Vision Fund team, Atomico, Bessemer Ventures, D1 Capital, Eurazeo, IVP and Liontree are also participating in the round. Some of the startup’s existing investors are also investing once again, such as Benchmark, Accel, Headline and various business angels.</p>
<p>Sorare generates revenue by issuing new cards on the platform. Players can then buy those new cards and add them to their collection. They can also manage a squad of players and earn points based on real-life performances.</p>
<p>Over time, the value of a card can go up or down. That’s why players often buy and sell cards from other players — there are even <a href="https://www.soraredata.com">third-party websites</a> that help you track auctions. $150 million worth of cards have been traded on the platform since January. Sorare doesn’t take a cut on player-to-player transactions right now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the volume of transaction is quite big, there is still a lot of potential for user growth. There are currently 600,000 registered users and 150,000 users who are buying a card or composing a team every month. Sales have grown by 51x between the second quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>“We saw the immense potential that blockchain and NFTs brought to unlock a new way for football clubs, footballers, and their fans to experience a deeper connection with each other. We are thrilled by the success we have seen so far, but this is just the beginning. We believe this is a huge opportunity to create the next sports entertainment giant, bringing Sorare to more football fans and organisations, and to introduce the same proven model to other sports and sports fans worldwide,” Sorare co-founder and CEO Nicolas Julia said.</p>
<p>Sorare’s Series B is a huge funding round, especially for a French startup. Fantasy sports games are one of the best way to expose new people to the world of NFTs. That’s probably why NBA Top Shot is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/nba-top-shot-maker-dapper-labs-is-now-worth-2-6-billion-thanks-to-half-of-hollywood-the-nba-and-michael-jordan/">incredibly popular</a> for NBA fans.</p>
<p>And those platforms have become a great on-ramp to get started in cryptocurrencies. It’s going to be interesting to see whether it becomes more regulated in the future as more people start playing on Sorare.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix said on Monday it is launching a free mobile plan in Kenya as the global streaming giant looks to tap the East African nation that is home to over 20 million internet users.</p>
<p>The free plan, which will be rolled out to all users in Kenya in the coming weeks, won’t require them to provide any payment information during the sign-up, the company said. The new plan is available to any user aged 18 or above with an Android phone, the company said. It will also not include ads.</p>
<p>Netflix, available in over 190 countries, has experimented with a range of plans in recent years to lure customers in developing markets. For instance, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/netflix-is-testing-a-mobile-only-subscription-to-make-its-service-more-affordable/">began testing a $3 mobile-only plan in India in 2018</a> &#8212; before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/netflix-malaysia-mobile-only-cheap-plan/">expanding</a> it to users in several other countries.</p>
<p>This is also not the first time Netflix is offering its service for free &#8212; or at little to no price. The company has previously supported free trials in many markets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/now-streaming-on-netflix-globally-free-original-shows-and-movies-to-non-subscribers/">offered a tiny portion</a> of its original movies and shows to non-subscribers, and has run at least one campaign in India when the service was available at no charge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/netflix-to-test-free-weekend-long-access-in-india/">over the course of a weekend</a>.</p>
<p>But its latest offering in Kenya is still remarkable. The company <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netflix-kenya-idUSKBN2GG1LY">told Reuters</a> that it is making about one quarter of its movies and television shows catalog available to users in the free plan in the East African nation.</p>
<p>“If you’ve never watched Netflix before — and many people in Kenya haven’t — this is a great way to experience our service,” Cathy Conk, Director of Product Innovation at Netflix, <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-launches-free-plan-in-kenya">wrote in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>“And if you like what you see, it’s easy to upgrade to one of our paid plans so you can enjoy our full catalog on your TV or laptop as well.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company didn’t disclose how long it plans to offer this free tier in Kenya &#8212; and whether it is considering expanding this offering to other markets.</p>
<p>On its past earnings calls, Netflix executives have insisted that they study each market and explore ways to make their service more compelling to all. The ability to sign up without a payment information lends credibility to such claims. Many individuals in developed countries don&#8217;t have a credit or debit card, which renders services requiring such payment instruments at the sign-up inaccessible to them.</p>
<p>The new push to win customers comes as the company, which is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/netflix-says-its-gaming-push-will-begin-with-mobile/">planning to add mobile games to its offering</a>, added only 1.5 million net paying subscribers in the quarter that ended in June this year, lower than what it had forecast. Netflix, which has amassed over 209 million subscribers, as well as Amazon Prime Video and other streaming services are increasingly trying to win customers outside of the U.S. to maintain faster growth rates.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/">introduced a free and ad-supported video streaming service</a> within its shopping app in India to tap more customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We recently caught up with longtime VC Mark Suster of L.A.-based <a href="https://upfront.com/">Upfront Ventures</a>, which last raised both an early-stage fund and a growth stage fund several years ago and, according to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1813608/000181360820000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">regulatory filings</a>, is <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1788021/000178802119000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">in the market</a> right now, though Suster couldn&#8217;t discuss either owing to SEC regulations.</p>
<p>We did talk about a wide range of things, from his firm&#8217;s big bet on the micromobility business Bird (which could be <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-265593/">publicly traded soon</a>), to his views on decentralized finance, to his fitness regime (we had to ask, as Suster has shed 60 pounds since early last year). If you&#8217;re curious to hear that conversation, you can <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/upfront-ventures-mark-suster-on-investing-in-a-fast/id1498270180?i=1000534279721">listen here</a>. In the meantime, what follows are outtakes of his reflections on broader industry trends, including the feverish pace of deal-making.</p>
<p><strong>On changing seed-stage check sizes, and how much time VCs have to write them right now:</strong></p>
<p>It used to be 10 years ago that I could write a $3 million or $4 million or $5 million [check] and that was called an A round, and that company probably had raised a few hundred thousand dollars from angels and maybe some seed funds, and I could get a lot of data on how companies were doing. I could talk to customers. I could look at customer retention. I could look at a startup&#8217;s marginal cost structure. I could talk to references of the founders. I could take my time and be thoughtful.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a decade, and $5 million is a seed round, and now there are pre seed rounds and &#8220;day zero&#8221; companies and seed extensions and A rounds and &#8220;A prime,&#8221; there&#8217;s B … I&#8217;m not actually doing anything differently than I did 10 years ago, in terms of deploying capital, getting involved with founders very early, helping you build your executive team . . . But the pressure on me is, I now need to make faster decisions. I need to be involved with your company earlier. So I&#8217;m taking a little more risk in terms of not being able to look at customers. You may not even have customers.</p>
<p><strong>On why his firm is averse to today&#8217;s A and B rounds and leaning more heavily into growth rounds. (It just brought aboard a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/catching-up-with-twitters-most-recent-head-of-corp-dev-and-new-vc-seksom-suriyapa/">former Twitter exec</a> to lead the charge here and has meanwhile plugged more than $50 million into several of its portfolio companies, including Bird; Rally, an investing platform for buying shares in collectibles; and Apeel Sciences, which makes edible coatings for fruit.)</strong></p>
<p>I would never rule out any round. But what I will tell you is that the new A round that I maybe have an aversion to is, call it, $20 million to $30 million. What does that imply? It implies that you&#8217;re paying a $50 million, $60 million, $70 million valuation. It implies that to really drive fund-level returns, you have to have $5 billion, $10 billion, or $15 billion outcomes or greater.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The world is producing more of those. There are maybe 11 companies in the United States that are pure startups that are worth more than $10 billion. I get it. But if you want to be writing $20 million A rounds where you&#8217;re taking that level of risk, you have to have a $700 million to an $800 million to a $1 billion fund. And I don&#8217;t want to be in that business, not because I think it&#8217;s bad, but it&#8217;s a different business that implies different skills.</p>
<p>We want to be super early, like the earliest capital; we&#8217;ll even take a risk on you want to leave your company and we&#8217;ve known you. Let&#8217;s say we knew you at Riot Games, we knew you at Snapchat, we knew you at Facebook, we knew you when you were working at Stripe or PayPal. We will back you at formation &#8212; at day zero. We want to [then] skip the expensive rounds and come in later.</p>

<p><strong>On whether Upfront invests in priced rounds as well as convertible notes, wherein an investor is entitled to invest at a discount to the next round:</strong></p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a lot of misnomers that rounds themselves aren&#8217;t priced. Almost every round is priced. People just think they&#8217;re not priced. So [maybe the question is]: Are we willing to do convertible notes, are we willing to do SAFE notes, are we willing to do all this stuff, and the answer is yes. Now, most convertible notes, most SAFE notes, they don&#8217;t fix a price, but they have a cap. And the cap is the price. What I always try to tell founders is, what you have is a maximum price with no minimum price. If you were willing to just raise capital and set the price, you&#8217;d have a maximum and it&#8217;s better for you. But for whatever reason, a generation of founders has been convinced that it&#8217;s better not to set a price, which really what they&#8217;re doing is setting a max, not a [minimum], and I&#8217;m not going to have that argument again. People don&#8217;t understand it. [The short version is] we will do convertible notes; we would not fund something that had no maximum price.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding how Upfront competes in a world where deals are happening within shorter time windows than ever before:</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for [a firm that will invest after one call] you&#8217;re calling the wrong firm. We don&#8217;t have as much time to know if customers love your product. You may not even have customers. But please don&#8217;t mistake that. We spend as much time as we can getting to know the founders. We might know the founders for five years before they create a company. We might be the people egging them on to quit Disney and go create a company. So we really want to know the founder. The bet that we&#8217;re making is now more on the founder skills and vision than on customer adoption of a product. That&#8217;s really what&#8217;s changed for us.</p>
<p>I always tell founders: If someone is willing to fund you after a 30-minute meeting, that&#8217;s a really bad trade for you. If a fund is doing 35 investments or 50 investments or even 20 investments and they get it wrong because they didn&#8217;t do due diligence, OK, well, they have 19 or 30 other investments. If you get it wrong and you chose an investor who&#8217;s not helpful, not ethical, not leaning in, not supportive, not adding value, you live with that. There&#8217;s no divorce clause.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By the end of this week, potentially thousands of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/the-station-gogoro-scoots-into-a-spac-a-rivian-milestone-and-tesla-prepares-to-unleash-fsd-beta-software/">Tesla owners will be testing out the automaker&#8217;s newest version of its &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; beta software</a>, version 10.0.1, on public roads, even as regulators and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/"> federal officials investigate the safety of the system</a> after a few high-profile crashes.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457521003791?via%3Dihub#!">study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> lends credence to the idea that the FSD system, which despite its name is not actually an autonomous system but rather an advanced driver assist system (ADAS), may not actually be that safe. Researchers studying glance data from 290 human-initiated Autopilot disengagement epochs found drivers may become inattentive when using partially automated driving systems.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SelXozO7TN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">US safety regulator opens investigation into Tesla Autopilot following crashes with parked emergency vehicles</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;US safety regulator opens investigation into Tesla Autopilot following crashes with parked emergency vehicles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/embed/#?secret=SelXozO7TN" data-secret="SelXozO7TN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Visual behavior patterns change before and after [Autopilot] disengagement,&#8221; the study reads. &#8220;Before disengagement, drivers looked less on road and focused more on non-driving related areas compared to after the transition to manual driving. The higher proportion of off-road glances before disengagement to manual driving were not compensated by longer glances ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that not everyone who has paid for the FSD software will be able to access the beta version, which promises more automated driving functions. First, Tesla will use telemetry data to capture personal driving metrics over a seven-day period in order to ensure drivers are still remaining attentive enough. The data may also be used to implement a new safety rating page that tracks the owner&#8217;s vehicle, which is linked to their insurance.</p>
<p>The MIT study provides evidence that drivers may not be using Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot (AP) as recommended. Because AP includes safety features like traffic-aware cruise control and autosteering, drivers become less attentive and take their hands off the wheel more. The researchers found this type of behavior may be the result of misunderstanding what the AP features can do and what its limitations are, which is reinforced when it performs well. Drivers whose tasks are automated for them may naturally become bored after attempting to sustain visual and physical alertness, which researchers say only creates further inattentiveness.</p>
<p id="screen-reader-main-title" class="Head u-font-serif u-h2 u-margin-s-ver"><span class="title-text">The report, titled &#8220;A model for naturalistic glance behavior around Tesla Autopilot disengagements,&#8221; has been following Tesla Model S and X owners during their daily routine for periods of a year or more throughout the greater Boston area. The vehicles were equipped with the Real-time Intelligent Driving Environment Recording data acquisition system1, which continuously collects data from the CAN bus, a GPS and three 720p video cameras. These sensors provide information like vehicle kinematics, driver interaction with the vehicle controllers, mileage, location and driver&#8217;s posture, face and the view in front of the vehicle. MIT collected nearly 500,000 miles&#8217; worth of data. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The point of this study is not to shame Tesla, but rather to advocate for driver attention management systems that can give drivers feedback in real time or adapt automation functionality to suit a driver&#8217;s level of attention. Currently, Autopilot uses a hands-on-wheel sensing system to monitor driver engagement, but it doesn&#8217;t monitor driver attention via eye or head-tracking.</p>
<p>The researchers behind the study have developed a model for glance behavior, &#8220;based on naturalistic data, that can help understand the characteristics of shifts in driver attention under automation and support the development of solutions to ensure that drivers remain sufficiently engaged in the driving tasks.&#8221; This would not only assist driver monitoring systems in addressing &#8220;atypical&#8221; glances, but it can also be used as a benchmark to study the safety effects of automation on a driver&#8217;s behavior.</p>
<p>Companies like Seeing Machines and Smart Eye already work with automakers like General Motors, Mercedes-Benz and reportedly Ford to bring camera-based driver monitoring systems to cars with ADAS, but also to address problems caused by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/drunk-driving-provision-could-fuel-demand-for-driver-detection-technology/">drunk or impaired driving</a>. The technology exists. The question is, will Tesla use it?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Open banking &#8212; a disruptive technology that seeks to bypass the dominance of card networks and other traditional financial rails by letting banks open their systems directly to developers (and new services) by way of APIs &#8212; continues to gain ground in the world of financial services. As a mark of that traction, a startup playing a central role in open banking applications is announcing a big round of funding with a milestone valuation.</p>
<p><a href="https://truelayer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TrueLayer</a>, which provides technology for developers to enable a range of open-banking-based services has raised $130 million in a funding round that values the London-based startup at over $1 billion.</p>
<p>Tiger Global Management is leading the round, and notably, payments juggernaut Stripe is also participating.</p>
<p>Open Banking is a relatively new area in the world of fintech &#8212; the UK was an early adopter in 2018, Europe then signed on, and it looks like we are <a href="https://www.finextra.com/the-long-read/234/why-bidens-executive-order-is-a-green-light-for-us-open-banking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now seeing more movements that the U.S.</a> may soon also join the party &#8212; and TrueLayer is considered a pioneer in the space.</p>
<p>The vast majority of transactions in the world today are still made using card rails or more antiquated banking infrastructure, but the opportunity with open banking is to build a completely new infrastructure that works more efficiently, and might come with less (or no) fees for those using it, with the perennial API promise: all by way of few lines of code.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a vision that finance should be opened up, and we are actively woking to remove the frictions that exist between intermediaries,&#8221; said CEO Francesco Simoneschi, who co-founded the company with Luca Martinetti (who is now the CTO), in an interview. &#8220;We want a financial system that works for everyone, but that hasn’t been the case up to now. The opportunity emerged five years ago, when open banking came into law in the UK and then elsewhere, to go after the most impressive oligopoly: the card networks and everything that revolves around them. Now, we can easily say that open banking is becoming a viable alternative to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems that the world of finance and commerce is slowly catching on, and so the funding is coming on the heels of some strong growth for the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Services that TrueLayer currently include payments, payouts, user account information and user verification; while end users range from neobanks, crypto startups, and wealth management apps through to e-commerce companies, marketplaces and gaming platforms.</p>
<p>And the startup says it now has &#8220;millions&#8221; of consumers making open banking transactions enabled by TrueLayer&#8217;s technology, and some 10,000 developers are building services based on open banking standards. TrueLayer so far this year has doubled its customer base, picking up some key customers like Cazoo to enable open-banking based payments for cars; and it has processed &#8220;billions&#8221; of dollars in payments, with payment volume growing 400%, and payment up 800%.</p>
<p>The plan is to use the funding to invest in building out that business further &#8212; specifically to extend its payments network to more regions (and more banks getting integrated into that network), as well as to bring on more customers using open banking services for more regular, recurring transactions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The shift to alternative payment methods is accelerating with the global growth of online commerce, and we believe TrueLayer will play a central role in making these payment methods more accessible,&#8221; said Alex Cook, partner, Tiger Global, in a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to partner with Francesco, Luca and the TrueLayer team as they help customers increase conversion and continue to grow the network.”</p>
<p>Notably, Stripe is not a strategic investor in TrueLayer at the moment, just a financial one. That is to say, it has yet to integrate open banking into its own payments infrastructure.</p>
<p>But you can imagine how it would be interested in it as part of the bigger mix of options for its customers, and potentially also to build its own standalone financial rails that well and truly compete with those provided by the card networks (which are such a close part of what Stripe does that its earliest web design was based on the physical card, and even its name is a reference to the stripe on the back of them.</p>
<p>There are other providers of open banking connectivity in the market today &#8212; Plaid out of the U.S. is one notable name &#8212; but Simoneschi believes that Stripe and TrueLayer on the same page as companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We share a profound belief that progress comes through the eyes of developers so it&#8217;s about delivering the tools they need to use,&#8221; he he said. &#8220;We<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> are in a very complementary space.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the opportunities in the gaming world continue to expand aggressively as part of post-COVID shifts to the entertainment sector, esports has found its own opportunities in reaching new audiences. While competitive gaming is still in its early stages, the stakeholders of the industry are some of gaming&#8217;s most prominent publishers and organizations, and disrupting how business gets done can be a major challenge for rising leagues and platforms.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to have Evil Geniuses CEO Nicole LaPointe Jameson join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> this week to discuss the business of competitive gaming and how esports is faring in its quest to gain an even larger audience. We&#8217;ll talk to LaPointe Jameson about the various leagues and stakeholders in the industry and where the momentum is shifting.</p>
<p>Evil Geniuses is a two decade-old competitive gaming brand, but over the past few years, the esports company has seen a dramatic revamp, exiting leagues and joining new ones while bulking up its roster and looking to find new opportunities in a space that has matured dramatically this decade but is still chasing after mainstream audiences. The esports organization was formerly part of Amazon as a result of the Twitch acquisition, but in 2019 was acquired by Chicago-based Peak6 Investments.</p>
<p>LaPointe Jameson joined Evil Geniuses as CEO back in 2019. At the time, the 25-year-old investor had scant experience running a gaming organization, but since her appointment, the esports company has looked to shake up how companies in the esports world operate. Earlier this year, the company launched its own esports analytics platform, collecting and parsing professional and amateur gameplay data and giving the industry access to more streamlined tools to analyze players and recruit.</p>
<p>As one of very few Black women in charge of an esports organization, LaPointe Jameson has looked to build out a more diverse organization and find a more expansive audience outside traditional niches. The league has helped pioneer signing mixed-gender teams to compete at major competitions.</p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&#8220;To clarify for the people in the back that didn&#8217;t catch it the first time&#8230; I don&#8217;t care where you come from. Nor your creed, gender, religion, class, past industry, or sexual orientation. If you are the best of the best, you have a home here at [Evil Geniuses],&#8221; LaPointe Jameson <a href="https://twitter.com/totheLaPointe/status/1354633861976576004?s=20">tweeted</a> earlier this year.</span></p>
<p>We look forward to chatting with LaPointe Jameson, alongside a whole host of amazing speakers at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Disrupt</a>, including Canva CEO Melanie Perkins, and actor-entrepreneur <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ryan-reynolds-is-coming-to-disrupt/">Ryan Reynolds</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The show is coming up fast. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Get your ticket now</a> for less than $100 before the price increases tonight &#8212; and we’ll see you soon.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/following-sec-lawsuit-threat-coinbase-cancels-launch-of-lend-product/"><strong>Coinbase pulls plug on lending product:</strong></a> U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has decided to shelve its “Lend” product that would have provided yield to investors who stake their crypto assets. Why? The U.S. regulatory body involved with such products views the creation as a security and said that it would sue Coinbase if it launched the product. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong publicly made the case that the SEC was being silly, which didn’t seem to help much. Perhaps somewhat-snarky Twitter threads are not the way to regulatory victory.</li>
<li><strong>IPOs galore: </strong>Alrighty folks who care about public-market liquidity, we have a bevy of stories for you today. Here’s who is going to <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/which-vcs-are-set-to-make-a-killing-in-gitlabs-ipo/">get rich from GitLab’s IPO</a></strong>, here is a <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/toast-raises-ipo-price-range-providing-a-monday-bump-to-fintech-valuations/">dig into the new pricing</a></strong> for Toast’s IPO, and here are <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/freshworks-valuation-could-crest-10b-in-upcoming-ipo/">a few notes</a></strong> on Freshworks’ raised IPO price. Enjoy!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/facebook-warned-over-very-small-indicator-led-on-smart-glasses-as-eu-dpas-flag-privacy-concerns/"><strong>Europe wants Facebook to turn its lights on:</strong></a> Or at least <em>more</em> on. In the wake of Facebook’s announced Ray-Ban camera-glasses, the “lead privacy regulator in Europe has raised concerns” about the hardware. At issue is the small light indicating that they are recording. Perhaps a bigger light would be better. That or we may be in another cycle of Glasshole discourse, which I am sure we’d all rather avoid.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/near-space-labs-closes-13m-series-a-to-send-more-earth-imaging-robots-to-the-stratosphere/"><strong>You don’t have to go to space to image the Earth:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the lesson from Near Space Labs’ latest round of capital, a $13 million infusion. While several startups want to take lots of pictures of the Earth for commercial purposes from satellites (Albedo is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/satellite-imagery-startup-albedo-closes-10m-seed-round/">one we’ve covered before</a>), Near Space wants to use balloons that are merely, well, near space. Reaching orbit is cheaper than ever, but certainly still not <em>cheap</em>. Perhaps this is the way forward?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/fivetran-hauls-in-565m-on-5-6b-valuation-acquires-competitor-hvr-for-700m/">Fivetran raises huge round, buys smaller company:</a> </strong>Hard enterprise reporter Ron Miller covered this $565 million investment for TechCrunch, noting that Fivetran is now worth some $5.6 billion. The company is also shelling out $700 million for HVR, what Miller describes as a “data integration competitor that had raised more than $50 million.” The latter deal is a mix of cash and stock. Fivetran helps companies move data around. Given the scale of data in the world, that’s big business.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/salesforce-backs-indian-payments-startup-razorpay/"><strong>Salesforce makes investment in Razorpay:</strong></a> As the Chinese market for startup investment retreats, India’s continues to collect checks, with the latest being an investment from Salesforce Ventures into Razorpay, a major fintech player in the Indian market that was last valued at $3 billion. This deal doesn’t appear huge in dollar terms, but that Salesforce is bridging the Pacific does in fact matter.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/facetune-maker-lightricks-raises-130-million-ahead-of-ma-plans/"><strong>Video and photo editing is an industry:</strong></a> As companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/picsart-raises-130m-from-softbank-becomes-unicorn-on-the-back-of-its-visual-creator-tools/">Picsart</a> raise nine-figure rounds, it’s perhaps not a surprise to see the company behind Facetune and other editing applications raise similar-sized rounds. In this case, Facetune developer Lightricks has put together a $130 million round. The company “operates more than a dozen subscription-based photo- and video-editing apps across iOS and Android,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/airwallex-raises-200m-at-a-4b-valuation-to-double-down-on-business-banking/"><strong>B2B fintech is hot:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Airwallex just secured a $200 million round at a $4 billion valuation, which is notable not only for the dollars involved but also due to the fact that the company is based in Australia. The now-multiple unicorn offers embedded fintech services for other companies, as well as business banking services.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/flippa-raises-11m-to-match-online-asset-and-business-buyers-sellers/"><strong>A marketplace for selling businesses sells part of its business:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the news from Flippa, a marketplace where online businesses and digital assets can be bought and sold. The company just secured an $11 million round, and as part of that released what has to be the single worst non-GAAP metric since community-adjusted EBITDA. TechCrunch writes that the company “sees over 600,000 monthly searches from investors looking to connect with business owners.” To which I say, sirs, are you so afraid of sharing real metrics that <em>that</em> is what you went with?</li>
<li>In related news, this newsletter is the leading internet missive that includes both “daily” and “crunch” in its heading, giving us a market-leading pace of readership activation and conversion of our newsletter-to-reads pipeline.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/19/indias-cars24-a-used-vehicle-marketplace-raises-450m-at-a-1-84b-valuation/"><strong>Cars24 raises $450 million in cash, debt:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Indian used-car marketplace Cars24 is now worth $1.84 billion after raising $340 million in equity capital and $110 million in debt. It’s a healthy round for a company that has “sold 400,000 vehicles to date.” See? That’s an actually useful metric. Not <em>incredibly</em> useful; a rate of sales would be better than an absolute stat, but still!</li>

<h2>The next healthcare revolution will have AI at its center</h2>
<p>In an excerpt from <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/ai-2041-ten-visions-for-our-future/9780593238295">&#8220;AI 2041: Ten Visions For Our Future,&#8221;</a> author Kai-Fu Lee makes the case that recent advances in artificial intelligence are starting to transform healthcare.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that AI is as good as humans when it comes to diagnosing disease, but the pandemic has accelerated the digitization of patient records and data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the coming decades, we can expect medical diagnosis to evolve from an AI tool that provides analysis of options to an AI assistant that recommends treatments,&#8221; writes Lee.</p>
<p>Lee identifies several areas where AI will improve outcomes in drug discovery, complex surgeries and monitoring, but also looks at potential concerns, such as legal liabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;AI healthcare is not just a market — it represents a tidal wave of transformations that will change the entire industry.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/ios-15-adds-all-the-little-features-that-were-missing/">Maybe we’ve figured out this generation of mobile operating systems:</a> </strong>TechCrunch’s dive into iOS 15 notes that the new mobile OS brought with it quality-of-life improvements and feature-bumps to Apple’s own apps. That’s what you have to look forward to. Or, more precisely, you will update to the new code, I reckon, and then instantly forget that you have. Such is the state of today’s mobile OSes, which, along with smartphone hardware, seem to have reached a plateau of boring excellence. It’s time for a new paradigm to shake things up.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/netflix-and-apple-tv-clean-up-at-the-emmys-with-the-crown-and-ted-lasso/">Big Tech wins some awards that your parents cared about:</a> </strong>How much stock do you put in the Emmys? Do you actually know what an Emmy is? I don’t. But it turns out that Netflix and Apple won some the other day. Good for them. It turns out that if you are among the most wealthy companies in the history of the world, you are able to buy talent and take enough shots on goal that you score some points. Or in this case, small, ugly trophies.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2021/09/20/news-consumption-across-social-media-in-2021/">report</a> from Pew Research finds that around a third of U.S. adults continue to get their news regularly from Facebook, though the exact percentage has slipped from 36% in 2020 to 31% in 2021. This drop reflects an overall slight decline in the number of Americans who say they get their news from any social media platform &#8212; a percentage that also fell by 5 percentage points year-over-year, going from 53% in 2020 to a little less than 48%, Pew&#8217;s study found.</p>
<p>By definition, &#8220;regularly&#8221; here means the survey respondents said they get their news either &#8220;often&#8221; or &#8220;sometimes,&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;rarely,&#8221; &#8220;never&#8221; or &#8220;don&#8217;t get digital news.&#8221;</p>
<p>The change comes at a time when tech companies have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/18/more-americans-now-say-government-should-take-steps-to-restrict-false-information-online-than-in-2018/">come under heavy scrutiny</a> for allowing misinformation to spread across their platforms, Pew notes. That criticism has ramped up over the course of the pandemic, leading to vaccine hesitancy and refusal, which in turn has led to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/cdc-study-shows-unvaccinated-people-are-29-times-more-likely-to-be-hospitalized-with-covid.html">worsened</a> health outcomes for many Americans who consumed the misleading information.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, the percentage of Americans who regularly get their news from various social media sites hasn&#8217;t changed too much over the past year, demonstrating how much a part of people&#8217;s daily news habits these sites have become.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205332" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205332" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2205332" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-01.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="491" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-01.png 840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-01.png?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-01.png?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-01.png?resize=768,554 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-01.png?resize=680,491 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-01.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205332" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pew Research</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to the one-third of U.S. adults who regularly get their news on Facebook, 22% say they regularly get news on YouTube. Twitter and Instagram are regular news sources for 13% and 11% of Americans, respectively.</p>
<p>However, many of the sites have seen small declines as a regular source of news among their own users, says Pew. This is a different measurement compared with the much smaller percentage of U.S. adults who use the sites for news, as it speaks to how the sites&#8217; own user bases may perceive them. In a way, it&#8217;s a measurement of the shifting news consumption behaviors of the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/">often younger social media user</a>, more specifically.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, 55% of Twitter users regularly get news from its platform, compared with 59% last year. Meanwhile, Reddit users&#8217; use of the site for news dropped from 42% to 39% in 2021. YouTube fell from 32% to 30%, and Snapchat fell from 19% to 16%. Instagram is roughly the same, at 28% in 2020 to 27% in 2021.</p>
<p>Only one social media platform grew as a news source during this time: TikTok.</p>
<p>In 2020, 22% of the short-form video platform&#8217;s users said they regularly got their news there, compared with an increased 29% in 2021.</p>
<p>Overall, though, most of these sites have very little traction with the wider adult population in the U.S. Fewer than 1 in 10 Americans regularly get their news from Reddit (7%), TikTok (6%), LinkedIn (4%), Snapchat (4%), WhatsApp (3%) or Twitch (1%).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205333" style="width: 402px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205333" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2205333" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-03.png?w=392" alt="" width="392" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-03.png 620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-03.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-03.png?resize=173,300 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-03.png?resize=392,680 392w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PJ_2021.09.20_news-social-media_0-03.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205333" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pew Research</p></div></p>
<p>There are demographic differences between who uses which sites, as well.</p>
<p>White adults tend to turn to Facebook and Reddit for news (60% and 54%, respectively). Black and Hispanic adults make up significant proportions of the regular news consumers on Instagram (20% and 33%, respectively.) Younger adults tend to turn to Snapchat and TikTok, while the majority of news consumers on LinkedIn have four-year college degrees.</p>
<p>Of course, Pew&#8217;s latest survey, conducted from July 26 to August 8, 2021, is based on self-reported data. That means people&#8217;s answers are based on how the users perceive their own usage of these various sites for newsgathering. This can produce different results compared with real-world measurements of how often users visited the sites to read news. Some users may underestimate their usage and others may overestimate it.</p>
<p>People may also not fully understand the ramifications of reading news on social media, where headlines and posts are often molded into inflammatory clickbait in order to entice engagement in the form of reactions and comments. This, in turn, may encourage strong reactions &#8212; but not necessarily from those worth listening to. In recent Pew studies, it found that social media news consumers tended to be <a href="https://www.journalism.org/2020/07/30/americans-who-mainly-get-their-news-on-social-media-are-less-engaged-less-knowledgeable/">less knowledgeable</a> about the facts on key news topics, like elections or COVID-19. And social media consumers were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/study-u-s-adults-who-mostly-rely-on-social-media-for-news-are-less-informed-exposed-to-more-conspiracies/">more frequently exposed to fringe conspiracies</a> (which is pretty apparent to anyone reading the comments!).</p>
<p>For the current study, the full sample size was 11,178 respondents, and the margin of sampling error was plus or minus 1.4 percentage points.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Australian growth marketing agency Ammo encourages startups to develop a minimum viable brand and provides services to make sure that their marketing efforts are correctly calibrated.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you are the founder of a young startup, it is always very hard to gauge the right amount of effort to dedicate to marketing. Botch it and you risk looking unprofessional. Hire a traditional agency and you might be wasting time and money.</p>
<p>Australian growth marketing agency <a href="https://www.ammo.marketing/">Ammo</a>, in contrast, wants to make sure that its clients aren&#8217;t overinvesting nor underinvesting. Geared toward tech startups, it boasts that it has &#8220;supercharged the growth of over 200 innovative businesses,&#8221; from fintech and SaaS to hardware.</p>
<p>Ammo is based in Perth and an active member of Western Australia&#8217;s startup community, where it is &#8220;very highly regarded,&#8221; in the words of the survey respondent who recommended it to TechCrunch. But if that person decided to work with Ammo, they said it&#8217;s because &#8220;their results spoke.&#8221; (If you have growth marketing agencies or freelancers to recommend, please <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">fill out our survey</a>!)</p>
<p>After reading this, we reached out to Ammo&#8217;s director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/camsinclair1/">Cam Sinclair</a> for insights on early-stage brand development, marketing readiness and more. Check out our interview below:</p>

<p><b>Can you give us an overview of Ammo?</b></p>
<p><b>Cam Sinclair: </b>Ammo is a growth marketing team based in Perth, Western Australia. We work with startups and innovative businesses to help them set and reach their growth goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>We’ve been in this community for seven years now, and have a small, lean team from a variety of backgrounds — none of which are traditional marketing.</p>
<p>As a nerdy kid I loved tech and was fascinated by how business works. I always knew I wanted to find some way to help founders and innovators get their great ideas out into the world. After working in political campaigns, I realized that many of the skillsets overlapped with what startups need: moving fast, being lean, communicating well, being adaptable and staying flexible.</p>
<p>That inspired me to grow an &#8220;anti-agency&#8221; where startup founders could genuinely feel like they had someone on their team who understood their challenges and the risks they were taking.</p>
<p><b>How do you collaborate with startups?</b></p>
<p>Our services cater to every stage of the founder journey. When you’re starting, you’ll need a brand, strategy and the marketing infrastructure to reach early customers. As you’re growing, you’ll need ongoing marketing campaigns and automation that bolsters your funnel. As you’re maturing, you’ll need the broader reach that PR and ongoing strategic advice provides.</p>
<p>We like to keep engagements as flexible as possible because startups are always discovering new marketing opportunities or customer needs. Some relationships are ongoing, others are quick projects completed in a week. Our long-term relationships start with a growth strategy workshop, where we identify a north star metric so that everyone is pulling in the same direction from day one.</p>
<p>Our workshops help startup teams design a customer journey using the pirate metrics framework and turn that into a clear, step-by-step action plan which they can implement or outsource.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03"><i>Respond to our survey</i></a><i> and help other startups find top growth marketers they can work with!</i></em></p>
<hr />
<p><b>There&#8217;s a survey on your site that encourages companies to check whether they are &#8220;ready for growth marketing.&#8221; What are the high-level points that make a company ready?</b></p>
<p>It’s really about having a small number of early fanatical customers — evangelists. Many people call it product-market-fit, but it’s really customer fit.</p>
<p>There is little point in lighting a rocket under a startup to grow and reach a wide audience without a clear, confident direction. Sure, you might get somewhere fast, but where are you going?</p>
<p>We’ve made the mistake of taking on clients who were too early for growth, so we know how important it is to say &#8220;no&#8221; when it’s not a good fit. We can direct all the traffic in the world to your website, but without customer fit you&#8217;ll be fighting for every sale.</p>
<p>Startups need to get a few things right to be primed for growth. Not every startup will be ready for what we can do for them. We’re focused on our own customer fit too.</p>
<p><b>For one-on-one work, who are your typical clients? </b></p>
<p>Our most successful relationships are with startups who have already established customer fit and are looking to grow quickly. We work with B2B and B2C SaaS companies, as well as more traditional businesses who are looking to disrupt the way things are done in their industry.</p>
<p>We’ve grown startups in Australia and abroad, including neuroscience startup Humm, based in Berkeley, California. We worked with them to identify early customers and preorder channels while they were gathering initial investment, build a learning/experimenting system within the team as they grew and, more recently, provide advisory at a strategic level.</p>

<p><b>What mistakes do you help startups avoid when it comes to branding? </b></p>
<p>After working with over 230 startups, we know what works and what doesn’t. Our clients work with us because they know we can help them avoid the pitfalls that inexperienced founders regularly fall into and make the most of the tight budgets that startups run on.</p>
<p>Marketing agencies are taking money that startups don’t have to build brand identities that startups don’t need. We would much prefer to see those resources invested into building their product and talking to their customers.</p>
<p>That said, it’s important for a landing page or slide deck to be believable to customers, investors and partners — and when startups underinvest in their branding, people are less likely to hand over their attention, email address and money.</p>
<p>For example, some clients often don’t even have suitable logo files or a wide enough color palette to create websites that effectively convert people into customers. If someone can’t clearly see your “sign-up” button when they land on your website because everything on your website is blue, it doesn’t matter how good your product or service is.</p>
<p><b>Can you explain why you <a href="https://www.ammo.marketing/mvb">advise startups</a> to create a &#8220;minimum viable brand&#8221;? </b></p>
<p>The temptation in the startup world is to use a freelancer through an online marketplace (or even worse — letting an overenthusiastic employee create a logo in PowerPoint). But this usually results in a surface-level logo design without any consideration for how it might develop over time or fit within a larger brand identity.</p>
<p>Other startups might work with an agency to create a brand identity, and this can lead to brand overkill — stationery kits, photography, lofty mission statements and endless meetings. None of which pre-seed startups need yet. This process wastes time and money better spent elsewhere and traps pivoting startups with an expensive brand that can’t evolve as they do.</p>
<p>We take branding processes used by world-class agencies and distill it down to the core parts of the brand you need right now. This leads to a minimum viable brand identity that’s built to grow and created with the expectation that it will change as your startup does. It’s inspired by lean methodology and the minimum viable product (MVP) — it’s built to challenge assumptions and catch the attention of customers without overinvesting.</p>
<p><b>What&#8217;s the process you follow to help startups develop their minimum viable brand?</b></p>
<p>Initially we help them come up with a name.</p>
<p>Naming is important so we generally invest time into this part to avoid changing it in the future if possible. We want to make sure it meets the basic principles of distinctiveness, brevity, appropriateness, easy spelling and pronunciation, likeability, extendibility and protectability (based on Marty Neumeier’s branding-in-business book <a href="https://www.martyneumeier.com/zag">Zag</a>).</p>
<p>From there we design a logo. A good logomark (the “icon” part of the logo) is generally figurative and not literal. It should be scalable, simple and work in multiple environments including single color black or white. The logo is then complemented with brand color selections, fonts and simple imagery direction to create a basic but useful brand guide.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we believe your startup’s brand guidelines should be available publicly online, rather than in a PDF hidden in a folder on your Dropbox. Somewhere that you can direct your team members and partners to so you can ensure everyone can maintain brand consistency.</p>
<p><b>How does Ammo compare to having an in-house CMO?</b></p>
<p>Like a CMO, we’re strategic. But unlike a CMO, we have experience with hundreds of startups across dozens of industries — we can pull insights and lessons from unexpected places when we’re working with clients.</p>
<p>While we align closely with commercial goals like an in-house CMO, we also know the importance for startups to move quickly. That’s why everyone at Ammo rolls up their sleeves and gets things done for our clients.</p>
<p>We don’t have the mindset of taking months to develop an annual marketing strategy, we want to help our clients get in front of customers quickly, collect valuable data along the way and stay nimble to adapt when they need it.</p>
<p><b>How do you and your clients measure your impact?</b></p>
<p>At Ammo, we don’t measure time, we measure outcomes. At the start of every project we define what success looks like with the client. Every client is different, and we’re responsive to that. We check back in with ongoing clients in monthly meetings to see how we’re tracking toward the success metric we agreed on, adjusting as necessary.</p>
<p>All of this is measured through quantitative analytics, qualitative feedback from customers and gut instinct.</p>
<p>In the past we have described our role as making ourselves obsolete — that our clients would grow large enough to be able to hire their own in-house marketing team. Today we still retain many of these client relationships in different ways, by providing more strategic advice. Those long-term relationships are the greatest indication to us that we’ve had a valuable impact.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The global pandemic has heightened our understanding and sense of importance of our own health and the fragility of healthcare systems around the world. We’ve all come to realize how archaic many of our health processes are, and that, if we really want to, we can move at lightning speed. This is already leading to a massive acceleration in both the investment and application of artificial intelligence in the health and medical ecosystems.</p>
<p>Modern medicine in the 20th century benefited from unprec­edented scientific breakthroughs, resulting in improvements in every as­pect of healthcare. As a result, human life expectancy increased from 31 years in 1900 to 72 years in 2017. Today, I believe we are on the cusp of another healthcare revolution — one driven by artificial intelligence (AI). Advances in AI will usher in the era of modern medicine in truth.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Over the coming decades, we can expect medical diagnosis to evolve from an AI tool that provides analysis of options to an AI assistant that recommends treatments.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Digitization enables powerful AI</h2>
<p>The healthcare sector is seeing massive digitization of everything from patient records and radiology data to wearable computing and multiomics. This will redefine healthcare as a data-driven industry, and when that happens, it will leverage the power of AI — its ability to continuously improve with more data.</p>
<p>When there is enough data, AI can do a much more accurate job of diagnosis and treatment than human doctors by absorbing and checking billions of cases and outcomes. AI can take into account everyone’s data to personalize treatment accordingly, or keep up with a massive number of new drugs, treatments and studies. Doing all of this well is beyond human capabilities.</p>
<h2>AI-powered diagnosis</h2>
<p>I anticipate diagnostic AI will surpass all but the best doctors in the next 20 years. Studies have shown that AI trained on sizable data can outperform physicians in several areas of medical diagnosis regarding brain tumors, eye disease, breast cancer, skin cancer and lung cancer. Further trials are needed, but as these technologies are deployed and more data is gathered, the AI stands to outclass doctors.</p>
<p>We will eventually see diagnostic AI for general practitioners, one disease at a time, to gradually cover all diagnoses. Over time, AI may become capable of acting as your general practitioner or family doctor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors said Monday it will <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/sep/0920-bolt.html">replace battery modules</a> in recalled Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV vehicles as soon as next month now that supplier LG Chem has restarted production of cells at two Michigan factories.</p>
<p>Replacement modules, which are made up of lithium-ion battery cells, will begin shipping to dealers as soon as mid-October, the company said. Chevy Bolt EV owners will be able to bring their vehicles to the dealership, where the old modules will be swapped out for new ones.</p>
<p>GM halted production of Chevy Bolt EV and EUVs in August due to a battery pack shortage related to the widespread safety recall of the two electric vehicles. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/gm-extends-chevy-bolt-ev-production-shutdown-another-two-weeks/">production downtime</a> has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/gm-extends-chevy-bolt-ev-production-shutdown-through-mid-october/">extended twice</a> since then. Battery packs in EVs are comprised of modules.</p>
<p>The recall, which includes all Chevy Bolt EV and EUV models made since 2017, was issued after the automaker discovered two manufacturing defects in the battery cell — a torn anode tab and folded separator — that could increase the risk of fire. The fire risk prompted GM to recommend Bolt owners set the vehicle to a 90% state of charge limitation, avoid depleting the battery below 70 miles of range and charge the vehicle more frequently. GM still recommends owners park their Bolt EV and EUVs outside immediately after charging and to not leave vehicles charging indoors overnight.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>LG has new manufacturing processes in place and has worked with GM to improve its quality assurance programs to provide confidence in its batteries moving forward. GM said the battery supplier will institute these new processes in other facilities that supply cells to the automaker.</p>
<p>Doug Parks, GM&#8217;s executive vice president of global product development, purchasing and supply chain, noted in a statement that resuming battery module production is a first step. However, GM&#8217;s Chevy Bolt EV problem is not entirely solved. The company must complete the replacement process for all recalled Bolts and assuage owners that the vehicles are safe to charge and park.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GM is counting on a new advanced diagnostic software package to help. The company said it will launch the software package, which will need to be installed by dealers, in the next 60 days. The diagnostic software is designed to detect specific abnormalities that might indicate a damaged battery in Bolt EVs and EUVs by monitoring the battery performance.</p>
<p>The software will alert customers of any anomalies, according to GM, which said customers will be able to return to a 100% state of charge once all diagnostic processes are complete.</p>
<p>GM, which aims to add 30 new EVs to its global lineup by 2030, also must secure the battery cells it needs to power these vehicles. LG is its primary and longtime partner in this endeavor. Parks said GM will &#8220;continue to work aggressively with LG to obtain additional battery supply.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/ios-15-is-now-available-to-download/">release of iOS 15</a> should be a major event for mobile operating systems. And yet, this year, there’s no breakthrough feature or overarching theme that makes this release stand out. Apple has focused on quality-of-life updates as well as new features for its own apps.</p>
<p>The result is a solid update that is not going to be controversial. Some people are going to take advantage of the new Focus feature. They’ll spend a lot of time customizing their phone to make it as personal as possible. Other people are just going to miss or dismiss the new features.</p>
<p>This year’s update is also a bit different because you don’t have to update to iOS 15. If you’re fine with iOS 14, Apple won’t force you to make the jump to iOS 15. You’ll still receive security patches. Some people will simply dismiss iOS 15 altogether.</p>
<p>It seems like a small change, but it actually says a lot about the current state of iOS. Apple considers iOS as a mature platform. Just like you don’t have to update your Mac to the latest version of macOS if you don’t want to, you can now update at your own pace.</p>
<p>Also, iOS should be considered as a mature platform for app developers, so iOS 15 adoption will be slower than usual as people won’t necessarily update to iOS 15 right away. Apps should potentially work on older iOS versions for longer.</p>
<p>Of course, users will &#8220;update&#8221; to a new version of iOS when they buy a new iPhone and replace their old iPhone. But Apple has people who pre-ordered the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/this-is-the-iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> and will get iOS 15.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205238" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205238" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2205238" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg 1960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_hero_09202021b.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205238" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<h2>Focusing on you instead of your phone</h2>
<p>One of the biggest changes in iOS 15 is the ability to change your Focus from Control Center. It’s a surprisingly powerful feature with a lot of options and tweaks. I would say it doesn’t feel like an Apple feature.</p>
<p>But it’s definitely one of the most interesting features of iOS 15. Chances are you spend a lot of time with your phone, and your device requires a lot of attention from you. With this new feature, it reverses the balance and puts you back in charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do Not Disturb&#8221; users are already quite familiar with the idea that you can silence notifications when you don’t want them. If you want to keep using &#8220;moon mode&#8221; with iOS 15, you don’t have to change anything.</p>
<p>But you can now create additional Focuses. By default, Apple suggests a few Focuses — Work, Sleep, Driving, Fitness, Gaming, Mindfulness, Personal and Reading. Each Focus is customizable to your needs and you can create new Focuses from scratch.</p>
<p>When you turn on a specific Focus, it basically blocks notifications by default. You can then add people and apps so that notifications from those people and apps still go through. App developers can also mark a notification as time sensitive so that it always goes through. I hope they won’t abuse that feature.</p>
<p>There are three more settings that you can activate. First, you can optionally share that your notifications are currently silenced in Messages and compatible third-party apps. Second, you can hide home screen pages altogether. Third, you can hide notifications from the lock screen and hide badges from the home screen.</p>
<p>Focus gets particularly interesting when you realize that you can couple specific Focuses with automation features. For instance, you can automatically turn on &#8220;Sleep&#8221; at night or you can automatically turn on &#8220;Work&#8221; when you arrive at work.</p>
<p>Power users will also have a lot of fun setting up a Focus and pairing it with a Shortcut. For instance, you could use Shortcuts to open the Clock app when you turn on Sleep mode. You get it, this new feature has a lot of depth and beta users have just started scratching the surface.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205240" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205240" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2205240" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1433" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205240" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<h2>Update all apps</h2>
<p>With iOS 15, Apple has improved nearly all the default apps. Some additions are definitely nice improvements. Others have been a bit more controversial.</p>
<p>Let’s start with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apple-walks-back-controversial-safari-changes-with-ios-15-beta-6-update/">the controversial one</a>: <strong>Safari</strong>’s design has been updated. But what you saw at WWDC in June doesn’t look at all like what’s shipping today. Essentially, Apple has listened to feedback and changed the user interface of its web browser during the summer.</p>
<p>By default, the address bar is now at the bottom of the screen, right above the row of buttons that let you open bookmarks, share the current page or go to the previous page. I think it works better. But if you really don’t want the address bar at the bottom, you can move it back to the top of the screen.</p>
<p>Other than that, Safari changes are all good improvements. For instance, the browser now supports traditional web extensions. It’s going to be interesting to see if popular Google Chrome extensions eventually come to Safari. Another nice new feature is the ability to create tab groups and find your tab groups from your other devices.</p>
<p><strong>FaceTime</strong> has become a versatile video-conferencing service. You can now create links, share them with friends and add them to calendar invites. For the first time, people who don’t own an Apple device will be able to join FaceTime calls from a web browser. There’s also a new Zoom view… I mean, grid view.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the big new FaceTime feature is not ready for prime time just yet. SharePlay, the feature that lets you sync audio and video playback with your friends, is going to be released later this Fall.</p>
<p>The <strong>Weather</strong> app has also been redesigned. It is now packed with a lot more information, such as precipitation maps, next-hour precipitation notifications and a new UV index. It has become a solid alternative to third-party weather apps. I still use <a href="https://bjango.com/ios/snowflake/">Snowflake</a>, but differences are smaller and smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Messages</strong> is now better integrated with other Apple apps. Whenever someone sends you an article, a photo album, a podcast or a song, you’ll see those recommendations in Apple’s other apps — Apple News, Photos, Apple Podcasts, Apple Music, etc. Once again, this is a nice addition in my testings but it’s not going to change the way you use your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Maps</strong> is getting better and better, especially if you live in San Francisco. If you haven’t used it in a few years, I encourage you to try it again. It’s now a solid alternative to Google Maps.</p>
<p>Some cities, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and London, are receiving new detailed maps with 3D buildings, bus lanes, sidewalks and more. It feels like navigating a video game given how detailed it is. The app has also been redesigned with new place cards, a new driving user interface and settings in the app.</p>
<p><strong>Photos</strong> is also receiving a bunch of improvements. Every year, the company is refining Memories. I’m not sure a ton of people are using this feature, but it’s better than before. There is now more information if you swipe on a photo as well, such as the shutter speed and lens that were used.</p>
<p>But the biggest change to your photo library is that you can now search for text in your photo; iOS is scanning your photos to find text and save it for Spotlight searches.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can now point your camera at text and select text from there. It is incredibly convenient if you’re looking for the restaurant address on the menu and want to share it with a friend or if you’re traveling and you want to translate some text.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205244" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205244" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2205244" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1433" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205244" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
<p>There are a ton of small changes that make iOS 15 better than iOS 14. Let me list some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a compatible home key, hotel key, office key or ID card, you can now add all of those to the Wallet app.</li>
<li>You can share some health data with someone else. It can be useful if you’re living far away from your loved ones or if you want to update your healthcare team.</li>
<li>If you pay for iCloud, you’re now an iCloud+ user. In addition to storage, you get additional features: iCloud Private Relay, which is available as a beta feature, lets you browse the web with increased privacy; Hide My Email lets you create randomly generated email addresses to create new accounts around the web.</li>
<li>Similarly, if your family is using iCloud for their email addresses, you can now set up a personal domain name and set it up in iCloud.</li>
<li>iOS uses on-device speech recognition, which means you can dictate text much faster.</li>
<li>But that’s not all, iOS processes some Siri requests on your device directly, which means that you can start a timer, set an alarm or change the music instantly. It has changed the way I use Siri.</li>
<li>You can add an account recovery contact in case you get locked out of your iCloud account. This is important to convince more people to use two-factor authentication.</li>
<li>Talking about two-factor authentication, Apple’s built-in password manager called &#8220;Passwords&#8221; can now save 2FA details and auto-fill 2FA fields. It works pretty much like 2FA in 1Password.</li>
<li>You can set up a legacy person for your Apple ID. I encourage you to look at that feature carefully. I’ve talked with several persons who couldn’t get their loved one’s photos after they passed away because Apple couldn’t just hand out the photos.</li>
<li>Apple has added tags to Reminders and Notes. You can also @-mention people in Notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the list of changes in iOS 15 is quite long. But it’s up to you to decide whether you want to update to iOS 15. When Apple added cut, copy and paste with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_OS_3">iPhone OS 3</a>, it was an obvious decision. I personally like the new features and it was worth updating. And I hope this review can help you decide whether to update or not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The decreasing cost of launch and a slew of other tech innovations have brought about a renaissance in geospatial intelligence, with multiple startups aiming to capture higher-quality and more frequent images of Earth than have ever before been available.</p>
<p>Most of these startups, however, are focused on using satellites to collect data. Not so for <a href="https://nearspacelabs.com/">Near Space Labs</a>, a four-year-old company that instead aims to gather geospatial intelligence from the stratosphere, using small autonomous wind-powered robots attached to weather balloons. The company has named its platform “Swifty,” and each one is capable of reaching altitudes between 60,000 and 85,000 feet and capturing 400-1,000 square kilometers of imagery per flight.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2017 by Rema Matevosyan, Ignasi Lluch and Albert Caubet. Matevosyan, who is an applied mathematician by training and previously worked as a programmer, did her masters in Moscow. There, she started doing research in systems engineering for aerospace systems and also flew weather balloons to test aerospace hardware. “It clicked that we can fly balloons commercially and deliver a much better experience to customers than from any other alternative,” she told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Four years after launch, the company has closed a $13 million Series A round led by Crosslink Capital, with participation from Toyota Ventures and existing investors Leadout Capital and Wireframe Ventures. Near Space Labs also announced that Crosslink partner Phil Boyer has joined its board.</p>
<p>Near Space, which is headquartered in Brooklyn and Barcelona, Spain, is primarily focused on urbanized areas where change happens very rapidly. The robotic devices that attach to the balloons are manufactured at the company’s workshop in Brooklyn, which are then shipped to launch sites across the country. The company’s CTO and chief engineer are both based in Barcelona, so the hardware R&amp;D takes place over there, Matevosyan explained.</p>
<p>The company currently has eight Swifies in operation. It sells the data it collects and has developed an API through which customers can access the data via a subscription model. The company doesn’t need to have specific launch sites &#8212; Matevosyan said Swifties can launch from “anywhere at any time” &#8212; but the company does work in concert with the Federal Aviation Administration and air traffic control.</p>

<p>The main value proposition of the Swifty as opposed to the satellite, according to Matevosyan, is the resolution: From the stratosphere, the company can collect “resolutions that are 50 times better than what you would get from a satellite,” she said. “We are able to provide persistent and near real-time coverage of areas of interest that change very quickly, including large metro areas.” Plus, she said Near Space can iterate it’s technology quickly using Swifties’ “plug-and-play” model, whereas it’s not so easy to add a new sensor to a satellite fleet that’s already in orbit.</p>

<p>Near Space has booked more than 540 flights through 2022. While customers pay for the flights, the data generated from each trip is non-exclusive, so the data can be sold again and again. Looking ahead, the company will be using the funds to expand its geographical footprint and bring on a bunch of new hires. The goal, according to Matevosyan, is to democratize access to geospatial intelligence &#8212; not just for customers, but on the developer side, too. “We believe in diverse, equal and inclusive opportunities in aerospace and Earth imaging,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The effects of a warming planet, from frequent and extreme flooding to hurricanes and drought, has prompted activists and governments to take action. It’s also spurred a growing number of entrepreneurs to launch technology startups focused on the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>At the center of this activity are the venture capitalists deciding which startup — and tech — has the best chance to decarbonize the planet while providing returns. Unlike other categories, climate tech is particularly complex because it spans so many different industries. Investors might be meeting with a founder trying to develop a plant-based fabric on a Monday and one who claims to have developed cutting-edge carbon capture technology on Tuesday.</p>
<p>TechCrunch is excited to announce that Carmichael Roberts, who co‐leads the investment committee at Breakthrough Energy Ventures, and Sean O’Sullivan, managing general partner at SOSV, will join me on our virtual stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>. The virtual conference kicks off September 21 and runs through September 23.</p>
<p>Roberts and O&#8217;Sullivan will dig into what climate tech means — and what it doesn&#8217;t — their investing approach, the hottest and most promising technology within this sector and the risk of not getting it right.</p>
<p>The pair have the expertise to weigh in. Roberts is also co-founder and managing partner of Material Impact, a fund that builds resilient technology companies developing products to solve real‐world problems using innovative materials. Before he became an investor, Roberts  co‐founded several ventures, in which he served as president and CEO or chairman. He also worked in business development at GelTex Pharmaceuticals, acquired by Genzyme for $1.3 billion, and in new product and business development at Dow Chemical (formerly Union Carbide Corporation).</p>
<p>Before Sullivan founded SOSV, one of the most active venture investors in the world, he founded MapInfo. The company grew to a $200 million revenue public company with more than 1,000 employees, and popularized street mapping on computers. He also founded NetCentric, is credited as the co-creator of the term &#8220;cloud computing&#8221; and co-founded Dial2Do.</p>
<p>The panel is just one of many investment-focused discussions we&#8217;ll be having at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Disrupt 2021</a>. But as moderator, this is the one I look most forward to!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://fivetran.com">Fivetran</a>, the data connectivity startup, had a big day today. For starters it announced a $565 million investment on a $5.6 billion valuation, but it didn&#8217;t stop there. It also announced its second acquisition this year, snagging HVR, a data integration competitor that had raised more than $50 million, for $700 million in cash and stock.</p>
<p>The company last raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/fivetran-snares-100m-series-c-on-1-2b-valuation-for-data-connectivity-solution/">a $100 million Series C</a> on a $1.2 billion valuation, increasing the valuation by over 5x. As with that Series C, Andreessen Horowitz was back leading the round, with participation from other double dippers General Catalyst, CEAS Investments, Matrix Partners and other unnamed firms or individuals. New investors ICONIQ Capital, D1 Capital Partners and YC Continuity also came along for the ride. The company reports it has now raised $730 million.</p>
<p>The HVR acquisition represents a hefty investment for the startup, grabbing a company for a price that is almost equal to all the money it has raised to date, but it provides a way to expand its market quickly by buying a competitor. Earlier this year Fivetran acquired <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210624005275/en/Fivetran-Introduces-Breakthrough-for-Database-Replication">Teleport Data</a> as it continues to add functionality and customers via acquisition.</p>
<p>&#8220;The acquisition — a cash and stock deal valued at $700 million — strengthens Fivetran’s market position as one of the data integration leaders for all industries and all customer types,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</p>

<p>While that may smack of corporate marketing-speak, there is some truth to it, as pulling data from multiple sources, sometimes in siloed legacy systems, is a huge challenge for companies, and both Fivetran and HVR have developed tools to provide the pipes to connect various data sources and put it to work across a business.</p>
<p>Data is central to a number of modern enterprise practices, including customer experience management, which takes advantage of customer data to deliver customized experiences based on what you know about them, and data is the main fuel for machine learning models, which use it to understand and learn how a process works. Fivetran and HVR provide the nuts and bolts infrastructure to move the data around to where it&#8217;s needed, connecting to various applications like Salesforce, Box or Airtable, databases like Postgres SQL or data repositories like Snowflake or Databricks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whether bigger is better remains to be seen, but Fivetran is betting that it will be in this case as it makes its way along the startup journey. The transaction has been approved by both companies&#8217; boards. The deal is still subject to standard regulatory approval, but Fivetran is expecting it to close in October.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Freshworks now expects to charge between $32 and $34 per share in its debut, up from the $28 to $32 per-share range that it initially disclosed.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/toast-raises-ipo-price-range-providing-a-monday-bump-to-fintech-valuations/">examined</a> the new IPO price range for Toast. The U.S. software-and-fintech company moved its valuation materially higher in anticipation of pricing tomorrow after the bell and trading on Wednesday. It was not alone in doing so.</p>
<p>Freshworks is also targeting a higher IPO price range, it disclosed today in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001544522/000162828021018866/freshworkss-1a3.htm">fresh SEC filing</a>. The customer-service-focused software firm now expects to charge between $32 and $34 per share in its debut, up from the $28 to $32 per-share range <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/freshworks-aims-for-nearly-9-billion-valuation-in-us-ipo/">that it initially disclosed</a>.</p>
<p>Doing some back-of-the-envelope math, Freshworks&#8217; IPO valuation could just pass the $10 billion mark, calculated on a fully diluted basis. Its simple IPO valuations, while rising, are lower than that figure.</p>
<p>Mathing that out, Freshworks expects to have 284,283,200 shares outstanding when public, inclusive of its underwriters&#8217; option, but not inclusive of vested shares present in RSUs or options. At its new IPO price range, Freshworks would be worth between $9.1 billion and $9.7 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Toast will have to post pretty damn strong growth numbers for it to keep its multiple up. But the market appears willing to take that risk.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. technology unicorn Toast filed a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001650164/000119312521276664/d166297ds1a.htm">new S-1 document</a> this morning detailing a higher IPO price range for its shares. The more expensive range indicates that Toast may be worth more in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/toast-looks-toward-18b-valuation-in-upcoming-ipo/">its debut than it initially expected</a>, a bullish sign for technology companies more broadly.</p>
<p>Toast&#8217;s rising valuation may provide a boon to two different subsectors of technology: software and fintech. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">restaurant-focused Toast</a> sells software on a recurring basis (SaaS) to restaurants while also providing financial technology solutions. And while it is best known as a software company that dabbles in hardware, Boston-based Toast generates the bulk of its aggregate top line from financial services.</p>
<p>Software revenues are valuable thanks to their high margins and recurring structure. Toast&#8217;s financial-services revenues, by contrast, are largely transaction-based and sport lower gross margins. The company&#8217;s IPO price, then, could help the private markets more fairly price startups offering their own blend of software-and-fintech incomes.</p>
<p>The so-called &#8220;vertical SaaS&#8221; model, in which startups build software tailored to one particular industry or another, has become a somewhat two-part business effort; many startups today are pursuing both the sale of software along with fintech revenues. Toast&#8217;s IPO, then, could operate as a bellwether of sorts for a host of startups.</p>
<p>To see Toast raise its range, therefore, got our eyebrows up. Let&#8217;s talk money.</p>
<h2>Toast&#8217;s new IPO range</h2>
<p>From a previous range of $30 to $33, Toast now expects to price its IPO between $34 and $36.</p>
<p>Toast now expects its IPO price to clear its previous upper-end guidance at the low end of its new range. That&#8217;s bullish &#8212; and indicative of a thus-far receptive market for the company&#8217;s equity.</p>
