										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Otonomo, the cloud-based software startup that help companies capture and monetize connected car data, is headed to the public market. The Israeli-based startup said Monday it has agreed to merge with special purpose acquisition company Software Acquisition <span style="font-weight: 400;">Group Inc. II </span>with a valuation of $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Otonomo is joining a growing pool of automotive startups that have sidestepped the traditional IPO path in favor of merging with a SPAC, or blank check company.  Arrival, Canoo, Lordstown Motors, Luminar, ChargePoint, The Lion Electric and Proterra are just some of the transportation-related companies that have announced or closed their SPAC mergers in the past several months.</p>
<p>The capital provided by public markets has become too tempting for companies that either have capitally intensive projects — like attempting to become a vehicle manufacturer — or for those that are hoping to speed up their growth. Otonomo falls in the latter camp.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Otonomo said it raised $172.5 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from investors that included Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, BNP Paribas Asset Management Energy Transition Fund and Senvest Management LLC, with support from strategic investors Dell Technologies Capital, and Hearst Ventures. Current Otonomo shareholders will own a majority of the combined company at closing. Otonomo will have more than $307 million in cash proceeds once the companies combine.</p>
<p>Otonomo said it plans to use cash proceeds from the transaction to fund growth and accelerate its entry into new markets and use cases.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otonomo launched in 2015 with a cloud-based software platform that can capture and anonymize vehicle data, which can then be used to create apps to provide services such as electric vehicle management, mapping, subscription-based services, parking, usage-based insurance, traffic management, media and emergency services. The company&#8217;s platform is used by 16 vehicle manufacturers, fleets and more than 100 service providers, according to Otonomo.</span></p>
<p>The company has landed a dozens of customers on its pitch that it can help companies monetize all the date running through their connected vehicles. Otonomo says it securely collects the data, where its then modified so companies can use it to develop apps and services for fleets, smart cities and individual customers. The platform also enables GDPR, CCPA and other privacy regulation-compliant solutions using both personal and aggregate data.</p>
<p>Otonomo&#8217;s growth can be measured — at least in one way — by examining the number of data points that run through the platform. A year ago, the company said its platform was taking in 2.6 billion data points a day from more than 20 million vehicles through partnerships with automakers, fleets and farm and construction manufacturers. Today, the company said the platform ingests <span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 4 billion data points per day from over 40 million global connected vehicles. </span></p>
<p>The merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. Ben Volkow continuing to serve as CEO of Otonomo, which will trade on the NASDAQ exchange.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every sport has its practice drills and exercises to help players hone skills between games. Why would esports be any different?</p>
<p><a href="https://gwoop.com/">Gwoop</a>, a startup out of Minnesota, wants to be the place where gamers go to train between matches. They&#8217;re building up a collection of free browser-based training tools meant to help you measure and improve vital stats like reaction time, mouse control, and aim, and see how your stats compare to the best.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the training games currently up and running:</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reaction Training</strong>: Wait for it&#8230;. click! As soon as the screen changes from grey to orange, you click the mouse button. The lower your reaction time (measured in milliseconds), the better. Harder levels throw in more colors to fake you out and give you a bit of pause.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Speed</strong>: Target boxes spawn one-at-a-time all around a 2D plane. Click one, and another appears. The more boxes you click before time runs out, the higher your score.</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard speed</strong>: Straightforward keyboard key-finding practice, because any time spent looking at your keyboard is time not spent dodging shots.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2106829" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-4.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="430" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-4.jpg 1469w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-4.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-4.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-4.jpg?resize=768,486 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-4.jpg?resize=680,430 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-4.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mouse control</strong>: If you can&#8217;t get your mouse to go where you want it, you can&#8217;t aim. Gwoop&#8217;s mouse control exercise has you drag a ball through a curved track; the more tracks you complete, the higher your score.</li>
<li><strong>FPS Training Arena</strong>: Strafe around a 3D arena (pictured up top), scanning for randomly generated targets and clicking them as they appear. Bonus points for hitting the dead center of a target.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the tools are linked back to an analytics dashboard, allowing you to gauge your performance metrics over time. Each skill gets its own leaderboard so you can see, for example, how your average reaction time compares to others worldwide and amongst your friends.</p>
<p>Even in its 3D exercises, Gwoop&#8217;s graphics are pretty simple — and that&#8217;s intentional. They want it to work for as many players as possible. They&#8217;ve got no reason to try to look like a AAA title; the more graphically intense a game is, the more powerful your computer would have to be to run it smoothly. Co-founder Gavin Lee tells me that their goal is to keep it so that &#8220;all you need is a computer and the Internet. It doesn&#8217;t matter if your device is 10 years old.&#8221; Even its 2D exercises have switches you can flip to further simplify the graphics and improve performance.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same reason they&#8217;ve built everything to work in the browser: not requiring any downloads means more people can train, with the added benefit for the Gwoop team of not having to worry about maintaining separate Mac/PC clients.</p>
<p>While the existing exercises might seem focused around improving first-person shooter skills, Lee tells me that they&#8217;re aiming to be &#8220;genre-agnostic&#8221; and are planning expansions tailored to other kinds of games. He mentions a &#8220;MOBA Arena&#8221; in the works meant to help polish skills required for games like League of Legends or DOTA, and another exercise-in-progress that&#8217;s &#8220;very Rocket League centric.&#8221; Their training tools seem mostly focused on keyboard/mouse users right now, but they&#8217;re working on more functionality for players who prefer controllers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2106830" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-3.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="412" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-3.jpg 1161w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-3.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-3.jpg?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-3.jpg?resize=768,466 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-3.jpg?resize=680,412 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-3.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Gwoop is entirely free to players —so how will they make money? Lee tells me they&#8217;ve got two different strategies there: they&#8217;ll sell additional advanced analytics tools to teams, and, once they&#8217;ve got enough players clicking around, hopefully be able to serve as a platform for esports recruiters. Lee says players should be able to opt-in to having their data shared with potential sponsors and esports teams, with Gwoop getting paid to connect the dots. &#8220;All these division one schools have these platforms where you can upload football films and get recruited,&#8221; says Lee &#8220;we want to become that platform [for esports].&#8221;</p>
<p>Why the name &#8220;Gwoop&#8221;? Is it a bit of super cool gaming lingo, or some sort of acronym? Nope! It was just a quick, memorable domain Lee had been holding onto for decades. &#8220;I wish I had a better story for you,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but I bought the domain in 2002 just because I wanted a five letter domain that you could pronounce and was available.&#8221; It&#8217;s okay, Gavin: most people don&#8217;t care why Google is called Google, after all.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s timing is pretty good here. With most people being stuck at home, more people are getting into gaming than ever before. Battle Royale games like Fortnite, PUBG, and Apex Legends are blowing up&#8230; but it&#8217;s hard to get better in a game where you spend the first ten minutes looting only to get shredded in 10 seconds when a skilled team rotates through. While many titles have dedicated training areas or firing ranges to practice in, they&#8217;re usually meant more for quick pre-game warmups and don&#8217;t do things like help you track metrics and improvements over time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2106824 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="397" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-2.jpg 1333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-2.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-2.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-2.jpg?resize=768,449 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-2.jpg?resize=680,397 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gwoop-2.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The Minneapolis-based team is currently comprised of its three cofounders. It&#8217;s self-funded to date, but I&#8217;m told a seed round is underway.</p>
<p>Gwoop is currently in semi-closed Beta and generally requires an invite to signup, but Lee tells me that the code #TC2021# should let our readers past the signup gate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/event-discovery-network-irl-raises-16m-series-b-after-refocusing-on-virtual-events/">$16 million Series B last fall</a>, event discovery network <a href="https://www.irl.com/">IRL</a> is launching a new website that adds more social features around events, including profiles, chats and the ability to join group events, among other things. With the changes, users will also be able to receive personalized event recommendations, participate in group events, as well as talk about events with their friends, across both web and mobile. The combined efforts make IRL.com feel less like an online event search engine and more like a real social network.</p>
<p>The startup, which had previously focused on real-world events, could have easily imploded last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which effectively shut down the in-person events industry overnight. But it instead <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/streaming-events-calendar/">quickly pivoted</a> its event discovery app to include virtual events. In April, IRL adapted to the government lockdowns and restrictions on in-person gatherings by indexing online events, like livestreamed concerts, esports events, Zoom parties and more.</p>
<p>The changes, in a way, made IRL more accessible because it became a tool that anyone could use &#8212; not only those with the time and money to travel and attend real-world events.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2106750" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106750" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106750" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Categories-5-Selected.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="469" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Categories-5-Selected.png 1385w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Categories-5-Selected.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Categories-5-Selected.png?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Categories-5-Selected.png?resize=768,530 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Categories-5-Selected.png?resize=680,469 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Categories-5-Selected.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106750" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IRL</p></div></p>
<p>In fitting with those changes, the company also last year redesigned its mobile app to make it easier for users to find new events to attend remotely.</p>
<p>It organized events into categories like gaming, music, tv, wellness, sports, podcasts, lifestyle and more &#8212; including those sourced from partners like TikTok, Meetup, Twitch, Spotify, SoundCloud, HBO, Ticketmaster, Eventbrite and others. (We&#8217;re also seeing Apple TV+ shows on the site, but IRL can&#8217;t officially confirm if Apple is a partner. We&#8217;re told IRL does have permission to display these events, however.)</p>
<p>The new IRL website is meant to better mirror the recently redesigned mobile experience.</p>
<p>As users join IRL.com for the first time, they can pick event categories they&#8217;re interested in and find their friends who are already using the service.</p>
<p>Also like the mobile app, you can now click across filters at the top of the website to drill down into events by category &#8212; like gaming, music, TV, sports, wellness, lifestyle, podcasts and others. And you can filter to see events taking place this weekend or view IRL&#8217;s own suggestions of &#8220;Top Picks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The site directs users to create their own group events with friends through the new built-in chat feature, which had previously only been available on mobile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because everybody&#8217;s at home, there&#8217;s a big demand for a web messenger,&#8221; notes IRL founder and CEO Abraham Shafi.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106752" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106752" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106752" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-1.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106752" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IRL</p></div></p>
<p>He explains that the startup&#8217;s focus around messaging as the basis for a group is what allows IRL to differentiate itself from other groups-focused products. Facebook Groups, for example, are built around the idea of discussion boards, he says. But IRL is instead building its social network around messaging.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no group chatting app that also allows you to add events,&#8221; Shafi says. &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing that become really valuable for any groups that have upcoming and scheduled activities. It could be a TV show that you really like. Or it could be your friends playing Among Us or playing video games. [On IRL], you can imagine, literally, any type of group &#8212; like a book club that meets weekly and has weekly events coming up,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>In addition, students who sign up with an .edu email address can now find on-campus events and groups that are available only to those who attend the same school. These aren&#8217;t typically indexed publicly and won&#8217;t appear on the IRL homepage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106751" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106751" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106751" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Main.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="632" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Main.png 1406w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Main.png?resize=150,139 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Main.png?resize=300,279 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Main.png?resize=768,714 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Main.png?resize=680,632 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Main.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106751" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IRL</p></div></p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s focus on group messaging has helped the app grow, despite the pandemic.</p>
<p>The company now reports over 10 million monthly active users, and its group messaging feature has been growing at around 30% month over month since August. Today, there are over 30 million chats sent on IRL per day, with over a billion chats that have been sent to date, Shafi says.</p>
<p>In time, IRL plans to expand the site to include more local events as well as deepen its relationship with partners.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.irl.com/tiktok">the IRL TikTok account</a> has been the first to reach over a million followers. But currently, all the events TikTok posts to the site are hand-curated. IRL says it&#8217;s working on a deeper integration that will help pull in more TikTok content, including top trends.</p>
<p>The company also expects to attract more influencers with the website launch, like those who want to build a name for themselves as a &#8220;cool curator&#8221; of a specific type of event &#8212; such as the <a href="https://www.irl.com/sneakerheads">Sneakerheads account</a>, for instance, which tracks sneaker drops.</p>

<p>As users participate on the website and app by following events, adding friends, and joining chats, IRL will be able to make better recommendations as to what sort of events they might like to try next.</p>
<p>And as the world recovers from COVID, allowing in-person events once again, the company believes usage will jump.</p>
<p>&#8220;When in-person returns &#8212; because that&#8217;s inevitable &#8212; we&#8217;ll be supporting that, for sure,&#8221; says Shafi, adding that he expects IRL to then &#8220;explode.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to take virtual away. Virtual will always be there … quite honestly, it will probably always be a hybrid,&#8221; he says. &#8220;This pandemic has allowed us to focus on something that will actually help us grow once we can support both the real and the remote.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me and the team are very grateful that we&#8217;ve had the opportunity to build something deeply meaningful in these times &#8212; even though at the outset, it would have seemed like we were screwed,&#8221; Shafi adds.</p>
<p>Initially, IRL tested the web app&#8217;s revamp only with its existing users. But the relaunch of the site now makes the changes accessible to all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another hour, another billion-dollar round. That&#8217;s how February is kicking off. This time it&#8217;s <a href="https://databricks.com/">Databricks</a>, which just raised $1 billion Series G at a whopping $28 billion post-money valuation.</p>
<p>Databricks is a data-and-AI focused company that interacts with corporate information stored in the public cloud.</p>
<p>News of the new round <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/sources-databricks-raising-at-27">began leaking last week</a>. Franklin Templeton led the round, which also included new investors Fidelity and Whale Rock. Databricks also raised part of the capital from major cloud vendors including AWS, Alphabet via its CapitalG vehicle, and Salesforce Ventures. Microsoft is a previous investor, and it took part in the round as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But we&#8217;re not done! Other prior investors including a16z, T. Rowe Price, Tiger Global, BlackRock, and Coatue were also involved along with Alkeon Capital Management.</p>
<p>Consider that Databricks just raised a bushel of capital from a mix of cloud companies it works with, public investors it wants as shareholders when it goes public, and some private money that is enjoying a stiff markup from their last check into the company.</p>
<p>The company has made its mark with a series of <a href="https://databricks.com/product/data-lakehouse">four open source products</a> with a core data lake product call Delta Lake leading the way. You may recall that another hot data lake company, Snowflake, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/09/after-479m-round-on-12-4b-valuation-snowflake-ceo-says-ipo-is-next-step/">raised almost a half a billion dollars</a> on a $12.4 billion valuation a year ago before going public last September with a valuation twice that. Databricks has already exceeded that public valuation with this round &#8212; as a private company.</p>
<p>When we spoke to Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi at the time of his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/databricks-announces-400m-round-on-6-2b-valuation-as-analytics-platform-continues-to-grow/">company&#8217;s $400 million round in 2019</a>, one which valued the company at $6.2 billion at the time, he said his company was the fastest growing enterprise cloud software companies ever, and that&#8217;s saying something.</p>
<p>The company makes money by offering each of those open source products as a software service and it&#8217;s doing exceedingly well at it, so much so that investors were tripping over each other to be part of this deal. In fact, Ghodsi said in a conversation with TechCrunch today that his company had targeted a much more modest $200 million raise, but that figure grew as more parties wanted to invest funds into the company. Even with that, Databricks had to turn capital away, he added, after deciding to cap the round at $1 billion.</p>
<p>The extra $800 million that the company raised will be used for M&amp;A opportunities with an eye on talent, spend on establishing a <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/01/30/what-is-a-data-lakehouse.html">Lakehouse</a> concept, international expansion, while also expanding its engineering team, the CEO said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lE1MdGVRtL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/databricks-crossed-350m-run-rate-in-q3-up-from-200m-one-year-ago/">Databricks crossed $350M run rate in Q3, up from $200M one year ago</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Databricks crossed $350M run rate in Q3, up from $200M one year ago&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/databricks-crossed-350m-run-rate-in-q3-up-from-200m-one-year-ago/embed/#?secret=lE1MdGVRtL" data-secret="lE1MdGVRtL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ghodsi also made clear that he does not intend to let the percentage of revenue that the company spends on R&amp;D to drop, as is common at modern software companies &#8212; as many SaaS companies grow, they expend more of their revenue on sales and marketing efforts over product spend, something that Databricks wants to avoid by continuing to invest in engineering talent.</p>
<p>Why? Because Ghodsi says that the pace of innovation in AI is so rapid that IP becomes outdated in just a few years. That means that companies that want to lead in this space will have to stay on the bleeding edge of their market or fall back swiftly.</p>
<p>The Databricks model appears to be working well, with the company closing 2020 at $425 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR. That figure, up 75% from the year-ago period, is also up from a $350 million run rate at the end of its Q3 2020. (For more on Databricks&#8217; business, product and growth, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/databricks-crossed-350m-run-rate-in-q3-up-from-200m-one-year-ago/">head here</a>.)</p>
<p>Notably Ghodsi told TechCrunch that this deal only started to come together in December. It&#8217;s February 1st today, which means that it took on this bushel of new funding remarkably quickly.</p>
<p>Finally, at $425 million in ARR, is the CEO worried about having a valuation sitting at roughly a 65x multiple? Ghodsi said that he is not. He said that he told his company during an all-hands earlier today that the AI market is a long journey, one that he hopes to be on for decades, and the stock market will go up and down. His point, as far as I could read into it, was that so long as Databricks keeps growing as it has, its valuation will take care of itself (and that seems to be the case so far with this company).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s certainly true is that Databricks is now as rich as it has ever been, as large as it has ever been, and in a market that is maturing. Let&#8217;s see what it can do with all this money.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Companies become industry leaders because of sparks: Ideas that lead to innovation, which shakes up a category. Apple changed the world when it realized that people wanted a PC in their pocket and it had to feel and look good.</p>
<p>Research makes sparks possible. In the modern economy, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/oct/19/steven-johnson-good-ideas">“eureka” moments are rare</a>, and product-market fit like the iPhone, PayPal, and so many others are the outcome of sparks of innovation, yes — but more importantly, rigorous research. People still have great ideas in the shower, but most of the time, big advances happen after countless hours of market research, A-B testing and the like.</p>
<p>As one might expect, the pandemic has forced research online. The companies that figure out remote research will find success and profitability more quickly than those who are still struggling to. Remote research will remain the rule even as the worst of the pandemic mercifully ends, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/21/health/us-vaccination-timeline-analysis/index.html">as our lives will still be upended for months or even years</a>. For those investing in tech companies, newly honed remote research capabilities are a critical yet undervalued asset and a stealth indicator of company health.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			The companies that figure out remote research will find success and profitability more quickly than those who are still struggling to.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The pandemic has been a major challenge for good corporate research. Most researchers — myself included — historically relied on in-real-life, face-to-face conversations with current and potential customers. Now that 2021 is underway, the onus is on organizations to explain how they’ve figured out the remote research problem. They’ve had 10 months to do so, and if they haven’t, they better have a plan for how they’re going to fix it.</p>
<p>Investors, executives and teams from the bottom-up must see — and demand — that companies get research right. Billions of dollars ride on it. No one wants to be Quibi, where good <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/23/why-quibi-is-a-cautionary-tale-shortform-netflix">consumer research would have made all the difference</a>.</p>
<p>There are ways to recreate effective research techniques digitally. Leaders should ask what tools researchers are using; what hacks they’ve developed to serve their needs in new and different ways. Are researchers using collaboration tools to draw out ideas and get to know people better? For example, I ask for photo collages of a person’s home life to help understand a person’s context. The next question should be how the research team is using these tools. Are they just giving a presentation, or are they using these tools in an open-ended fashion to spur dynamic conversation? I often use a digital whiteboard to provide a personal touch with real-time drawing and diagramming, which can be fun and even silly. It helps people let their guard down.</p>
<p>Next, leaders need to make sure the company is incorporating research into the design process, regardless of the collaboration difficulties the pandemic has imposed. Researchers and the design team need to answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is research just a box to check? Or are designers and developers constantly referring to it?</li>
<li>Is the research team properly elevated, ideally reporting into the chief product officer and sharing insights frequently with the executive team to provide a sharper sense of consumer desires?</li>
<li>Are researchers given the freedom to learn more about the hacks that consumers are implementing in today’s unusual reality?</li>
<li>Are designers and developers using the research as a jumping-off point, and do they have permission to design and create in new ways?</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, research should be a core dimension of good product decisions, of sound digital product design and development. If it isn’t, organizations should make changes in 2021.</p>
<p>There is quantitative data to back up this statement. According to <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/design-better/design-maturity-model/">InVision’s industry research</a>, only 10% of 2,300 teams surveyed deploy the most design-mature research practices, which increase speed-to-market, revenue and valuation. Only 7% say they rely on customer reviews and co-create products alongside their customers (important research practices).</p>
<p>Put more starkly, it’s likely the companies that are getting investment are not using research in the best possible way. Fewer than 10% of thousands of teams surveyed elevate design research. That means fewer than 10% of organizations are able to meet today’s remote research challenges easily, adapt to new realities quickly and succeed in this extreme time of change. In the throes of a pandemic, that is a problem.</p>
<p>Even after COVID, companies that thrive — or even simply survive — will be design-mature and digital-first. They will derive more of their revenue, interact with customers and gain new research insights digitally. In such an economy, technical and engineering prowess are critical, but all the technical ability in the world is worthless without understanding what consumers want a company to create. It is worthless without feedback. It is worthless without insight that leads to innovation.</p>
<p>It is worthless without a mature design process that uses research to validate, understand and turn the spark of an idea into reality.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in an effort to “automate millions of repetitive, mind-numbing tasks for business and government organizations all over the world, improving productivity, customer experience and employee job satisfaction.” Its goal is to give workers the mental energy and time to focus on more complex jobs. Competitors include Microsoft Power Automate, Blue Prism, Automation Anywhere. SAP also recently </span><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/robotic-process-automation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">entered the space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has been growing like crazy. Back when I covered its </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/ai-powered-uipath-scores-568m-at-7b-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$568 million Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in April of 2019, UiPath had 4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">00,000 users in 200 countries. At the time, the company said it had increased its annual recurring revenue (ARR) from $8 million in April 2017 to over $200 million. UiPath said then it had grown its headcount by 16 times over a two-year period, to more than 2,500 employees. It also hinted that it was considering an IPO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True to its word, UiPath in December submitted a draft registration to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering. So it’s especially interesting that it raised such a huge round now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some, UiPath’s going public could be the Snowflake IPO of 2021. Alternative payments provider Affirm followed a similar path recently – raising $500 million before filing for an IPO weeks later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UiPath declined to comment on its latest funding round beyond a </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005753/en/UiPath-Closes-750-Million-in-Series-F-Funding."><span style="font-weight: 400;">press release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In addition to AirPlay support for Fitness+, today’s iOS 14.5 developer beta is bringing some key new features to mobile operating system. At the top of the list is undoubtedly Apple Watch unlock for users wearing face coverings.</p>
<p>The long-awaited feature arrives a year or so into a pandemic that has made face masks a reality in parts of the world that previously had not seen wide scale adoption. The Apple Watch has, of course, long had the ability to unlock Macs, so this integration seems like a pretty sensible addition.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KVQhVclJ9h"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/29/apple-face-id-unlock-mask/">Apple will make it easier to unlock your iPhone while wearing a face mask</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple will make it easier to unlock your iPhone while wearing a face mask&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/29/apple-face-id-unlock-mask/embed/#?secret=KVQhVclJ9h" data-secret="KVQhVclJ9h" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Starting with iOS 14.5, Apple Watch wearers will be able to opt-in to iPhone unlock under the phone’s Face ID &amp; Passcode settings. Once enabled, the Watch will give a haptic buzz to notify the wearer that the handset has been unlocked. The Watch needs to be unlocked, on a wrist and in close proximity to the iPhone in order to work.</p>
<p>It beats having to pull your mask down in public (even if some folks are still feeling nostalgic for Touch ID).</p>
<p>The addition should be included in the consumer version of the software when it launches. Also included are the ability to ask Siri to call emergency contacts and app tracking controls that require permissions from developers. Support for new Xbox and PlayStation game controllers has been added, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft today<a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2021/02/01/azure-quantum-preview/"> announced</a> that <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/quantum/">Azure Quantum</a>, its cloud-based platform for using quantum hardware and software tools from partners like Honeywell Quantum Solutions, IonQ, 1QBit and others, is now in public preview. Azure Quantum went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/microsofts-quantum-computing-platform-is-now-in-limited-preview/">into limited preview</a> last May. At the time, it was only open to a small number of select Microsoft partners and customers, but starting today, anyone with an interest in quantum computing can start experimenting with the service.</p>
<p>The service offers a small free allowance to get started. After that, using it could get pricey pretty quickly, though. You can find the complete pricing chart <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/azure-quantum/">here</a>, but to use the system for trying out the basics, you&#8217;re looking at about $10 per compute hour.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106775" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/overview.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106775" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2106775" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/overview.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="641" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/overview.jpg 1250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/overview.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/overview.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/overview.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/overview.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/overview.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2106775" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s still early days in quantum computing, so building on a specific platform, be that Microsoft&#8217;s or that of competitors like IBM and Rigetti, means buying into a specific toolset as well. For Microsoft, that&#8217;s the open-source Quantum Development Kit and its Q# language, as well as its recently announced hardware-agnostic Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR) intermediate language based on <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The transition to Public Preview of Azure Quantum is a key milestone for quantum computing and our ecosystem,&#8221; writes Krysta Svore, the GM of Microsoft Quantum &#8220;This continues the momentum we saw last year, which includes selection for the National Quantum Initiative Quantum Research Centers, the addition of new Azure Quantum partners, and hardware advances in scaling control circuitry for qubits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s own efforts to build a quantum computer haven&#8217;t resulted in a working qubit yet, but the company has made <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/full-stack-ahead-pioneering-quantum-hardware-allows-for-controlling-up-to-thousands-of-qubits-at-cryogenic-temperatures/">strides in other areas</a>. For the time being, though, Microsoft is betting on partnerships with other players in the space to power this platform. This also allows the company to claim that it offers the &#8220;world’s first full-stack, public cloud ecosystem for quantum solutions.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A week after introducing Time to Walk, Apple has released another software update aimed at expanding its Fitness+ footprint. With today’s arrival the developer seed of watchOS 7.4 and iOS 14.5, the company is adding a new feature that will make it possible to stream workouts to an AirPlay enabled TV – with some caveats.</p>
<p>Users can stream audio and video the company’s subscription-based fitness app to AirPlay 2-enabled sets. That’s a nice addition for those without an Apple TV and users looking to bring the service on the road with them via compatible hotel TVs (when people start staying in hotels again).</p>
<p>The biggest difference here is that metrics won’t be displayed on screen. That means you lose things like your rings, calories burned, etc. They’ll have to rely on the connected Apple Watch and iPhone or iPad for that information. Not the end of the world, but they’re an important part of the Fitness+ experience. Apple no doubt wants to continue to incentivize its own hardware ecosystem, while working to grow the exercise app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Fitness+ arrived at the right time for the company, as Covid-19 has caused many of us to let our gym memberships lapse, in favor of at home workouts. There’s a question of sustainability of home workouts in general, with the roll out of numerous vaccines.</p>
<p>Maintaining and continuing to grow these applications will require flexibility. When I spoke to Apple about Fitness+ last week, the company noted that it envisions people bringing the app with them on the go. That could mean doing a Fitness+ workout on the iPad at their gym or finding a way to back the experience in a bag and use it during their travels.</p>
<p>The feature is currently available as part of the developer seeds of the new watchOS and iOS versions, and should be available to consumers when the final versions go live.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Smartphone maker <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-xiaomi-complaint/chinas-xiaomi-files-legal-complaint-against-u-s-defense-treasury-ban-idUSKBN29Z01A">Xiaomi has sued</a> the United States government over its inclusion in a military blacklist. <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.226816/gov.uscourts.dcd.226816.1.0.pdf">The filing</a>, which was submitted on Friday, calls the decision “unlawful and unconstitutional.”</p>
<p>The Chinese smartphone maker adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not owned or controlled by, or otherwise affiliated with the Chinese government or military, or owned or controlled by any entity affiliated with the Chinese defense industrial base. Nor does the Chinese government or military, or any entity affiliated with the defense industrial base, possess the ability to exert control over the management or affairs of the company.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The filing reflects similar statements by the company in the wake of the listing. The designation came in the waning days of the Trump administration, less than a week before Biden’s inauguration. Huawei and DJI have also been caught up in U.S. blacklists in recent years, though those companies were tagged as part of the separate entity list maintained by the Commerce Department. Huawei filed suit against the government in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/06/huawei-sues-us-government/">March 2019</a>.</p>
<p>The listing, which is set to go into effect on March 15, bars investment in the smartphone maker. It’s already had an impact on its bottom line. Xiaomi already has a massive global footprint, ranking No. 2 behind Apple and Samsung, according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/smartphone-sales-slowed-decline-in-q4-with-a-big-assist-from-apple/">latest figures from Canalys</a>. The company saw a 31% annual growth in market share y-o-y for Q4, as the larger industry continued to stall. Xiaomi hasn’t had much visibility in the U.S., but a potential ban in the world’s third-largest market could severely hamper the company’s growth.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how the new U.S. administration will impact relations with both China and its hardware makers. Notably, the letter addresses Biden appointees Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Poland-based <a href="https://telemedi.co/en/">Telemedico</a> has closed a €5.5 million (~$6.6M) Series A round of funding. The round is led by Flashpoint Venture Capital, Uniqa Ventures, PKO VC, Black Pearls VC (an existing investor) and Adamed.</p>
<p>Telehealth services specifically, and digital health <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/kaia-health-gets-26m-to-show-it-can-do-more-with-digital-therapeutics/">more broadly</a>, have racked up plenty of growth during the pandemic as demand for remote consultations (and other types of support) has accelerated sectoral <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">uplift.</span></p>
<p>Telemedico, which was founded back in 2014 &#8212; but only launched its current b2b model (which is primarily targeted at insurance firms) in 2017 &#8212; says 2020 was a record year for its business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One million consultations were carried out via its platform during the 12-month period, it told us.</p>

<p>Pawel Sieczkiewicz, founder and CEO at Telemedico, says it&#8217;s fielding over 100,000 consultations per month at this stage &#8212; and is projecting that to increase to 250,000 by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>The platform has been used by more than 900,000 patients to date. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While more than 600 doctors currently provide remote consultations for Telemedico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Services its platform offers include </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">consultations with a doctor via chat, video, telephone; AI-</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">triaging and coordination; and booking of in-person visits and blood testing. </span></p>
<p>The business has been growing 3x YoY since 2018, per Sieczkiewicz, who says it has carried out more than 2.5 million appointments in total to-date, spanning 10 languages.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s expecting to double the size of its (60-strong) team this year, he adds.</p>
<p>The Series A funding will be put towards international expansion &#8212; including eyeing potential growth opportunities in LatAm.</p>
<p>Expanding supported languages is part of that plan. (Currently it supports consultations in English, Spanish, Polish, Czech, Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian, Portuguese, Turkish, Arabic; languages it&#8217;ll be adding next are: Italian, French, Greek, German, and Romanian.)</p>
<p>Telemedico&#8217;s best markets to date are Poland and Spain, per Sieczkiewicz, who says it&#8217;s active in 14 markets in total.</p>
<p>&#8220;We aim to increase our presence on the markets where we are already active: Spain, Russia, Portugal, Turkey, and launch on new markets, with new languages &#8212; mainly EU Countries, like France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Romania,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s a lot of activity in the telehealth space, Telemedico bills itself as one of the only &#8216;plug and play&#8217; platforms for insurance companies &#8212; offering a whitelabel service geared towards a sector that Sieczkiewicz argues may not want to relinquish so much control to brasher, brand-building &#8216;digital first&#8217; competitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We provide our enterprise customers with a platform they can customise to meet their needs and a network of over 600 doctors who speak 10 languages that they can mix with their own network,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We help our customers strengthen their value chain, so they can stand up against digital-first insurance companies who have been emerging for the last couple of years.</p>
<p>&#8220;The top three competitors are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/babylon-health-confirms-550m-raise-to-expand-its-ai-based-health-services-to-the-us-and-asia/">Babylon Health</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/12/kry-bags-66m-to-launch-its-video-call-a-doctor-service-in-more-european-markets/">KRY</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/07/pushdoctor/">Pushdoctor</a>. They represent a B2C approach, with a strong local presence. They are also building strong brand awareness around the service, and force insurance companies to let their customers leave their ecosystem. From the feedback that we receive from insurance companies, this isn’t their favourite way of organizing the patient flow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One major drawback for insurers using the Babylon-style setup is that in the future, Babylon might be able to begin offering insurance cover directly to consumers, cutting out the original insurance companies themselves &#8212; similar to how digital-first insurance companies like Oscar Health operate,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Telemedico says its system can be deployed within around 48 hours &#8212; letting insurance firms and other enterprise customers offer a telehealth platform that gives their users access to web and mobile white-label patient portals; online consultations; medical documentation storage; in person visits; automated triaging; and symptom checker tools.</p>
<p>The startup also offers insurance companies access to an ‘insurance product creator’ to manage variants of their current product suite for specific groups of users.</p>
<p>Telemedico says its platform is used by &#8220;a number&#8221; of health ministries around the world, as well as PZU, Allianz, AXA, Metrored, Compensa, TU Zdrowie and more than 50 other insurance and medical assistance companies (&#8220;mostly&#8221; within the telemedicine space).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spanish startup Elma gets $3.2M for a digital-first health insurance play&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/spanish-startup-elma-gets-3-2m-for-a-digital-first-health-insurance-play/embed/#?secret=Vpj0vfgbS9" data-secret="Vpj0vfgbS9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It does also offer a direct-to-consumer telehealth service in Poland, via the public healthcare system &#8212; where consultation fees are covered by the insurance of the publicly funded National Health Fund of Poland (i.e. free at the point of use for patients).</p>
<p>It also offers consultations via a fee-for-service model. Sieczkiewicz says its USP is &#8220;that we are built on three foundations: B2B, whitelabel and cross-country services&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Telemedico is primarily a B2B company,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;The majority of our business comes from recurring enterprise customers, such as insurance companies, banks, pharmacies and other companies who either offer health services and want to improve them with a digital layer or want to offer health services to their digital offering.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see a huge trend among insurance companies, that add new healthcare products to their offers. We help create those products with our so-called ‘insurance product creator’, providing them with tools for setting up and management of their digital health services, patient flow, and more.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also says the &#8216;plug and play&#8217; style SaaS platform supports a modular approach &#8212; enabling the target b2b users to zero in on the most useful aspects of its platform for their particular customer case (be it telemedicine, drug ordering or automated triage).</p>
<p>The software can be completely integrated into a customer’s platform or run as a stand-alone product, he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Telemedicine is no longer an add-on to insurance packages but in many countries the first touchpoint with medical services &#8212; a way to increase patients satisfaction and decrease costs for the insurer,&#8221; Sieczkiewicz suggests.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Series A funding in a statement, Michael Szalontay, general partner at Flashpoint VC, said: “We are convinced that telemedicine will become a primary distribution channel for medical services in the next decade and Telemedico is poised to become a European leader in this domain. We are proud to become Pawel’s partner in Telemedico, he has an amazing energy and conviction, and in our experience, such gumption is a prerequisite for success.”</p>
<p>“This decade will be the Golden Twenties for telemedicine,&#8221; added Dr. Andreas Nemeth, general partner at UNIQA Ventures, in another supporting statement. &#8220;The potential is enormous and telemedi.co is already setting standards here today. telemedi.co has the right product, the right team and the right culture to support insurers in providing seamless telemedicine services. We are therefore delighted and proud to be able to follow the path together in the future and pleased to be able to become a part of the company’s international growth story.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google regularly tweaks its search results pages and tries out new designs. It&#8217;s not that often, though, that it adds new features to those results, so when it does, it&#8217;s worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Today, Google is adding a new menu item to virtually all search results in English in the U.S. on mobile, desktop and its Android Google app. This new link will provide searchers with more information about the site they are about to visit &#8212; and before they click on the actual link.</p>
<p>Clicking the new hamburger-style menu icon will pop up a new info panel with additional information about the site. These include a short description of what the site is about &#8212; taken from Wikipedia when available&#8211; and some data about whether the connection to the site is secure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2101276" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Search-Results_Square.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101276" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2101276" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Search-Results_Square.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2101276" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>For sites without a Wikipedia entry, Google will show when it first indexed the site and other data if it&#8217;s available.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a full link and a short line about whether it&#8217;s a native search result or an ad (which seems like a tacit admission that it&#8217;s too hard to distinguish ads from regular search results on Google). At the bottom of the pane, there are also links to your privacy settings and to an explainer about &#8216;how search works.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you search for information on <span class="il">Google</span>, you probably often come across results from sources that you’re familiar with: major retailer websites, national news sites and more,&#8221; Google product manager JK Kearns writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;But there’s also a ton of great information on and services available from sites that you may not have come across before. And while you can always use <span class="il">Google</span> to do some additional research about those sites, we’re working on a new way for you to find helpful info without having to do another search.&#8221;</p>
<p>This new feature will start rolling out today and as usual, it may take a while before you see it in your own search results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kleiner Perkins is one of the most prestigious venture firms in all of Silicon Valley. The firm has invested in startups like Twitter, Google, Square, Peloton, Spotify, Robinhood and many, many more. As such, the folks at Kleiner Perkins know a thing or two about what it takes to fundraise across the various stages of a company.</p>
<p>One of the more difficult jumps to make is going from raising a seed round to picking up a Series A. Rather than focusing on the idea and the product market fit, founders must show that their product can scale, with numbers to back it up.</p>
<p>It can be grueling and complicated, but <a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/people/bucky-moore">Kleiner Perkins partner Bucky Moore</a> is going to break it all down for us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=kleinerpost">TechCrunch Early Stage &#8211; Operations &amp; Fundraising on April 1 &amp; 2</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=kleinerpost">TC Early Stage &#8211; Operations &amp; Fundraising</a> is a virtual event focused squarely on early stage founders. The event will have dozens of breakout sessions led by investors and experts that break down the most difficult parts of building a business, focusing on startup core competencies like fundraising and operations.</p>
<p>Moore will lead a session called <strong>&#8220;4 things to think about before raising a Series A&#8221;</strong> at the event, which takes place on April 1 &#8211; 2 and is totally virtual. Plus, Moore will answer questions from the audience.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at what the presentation will focus on:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most important part of raising a Series A is the decisions made before the fundraise. A shockingly common mistake founders make is not thinking through four critical areas before talking to investors. Bucky Moore will share how founders can prepare for a successful Series A, and discuss what investors are looking for when they write a Series A check. His advice will be valuable to all entrepreneurs looking to raise early-stage funding.</p></blockquote>
<p>What are those four areas? You&#8217;ll have to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/#tickets?promo=kleinerpost">pick up a ticket (which includes a year of Extra Crunch) to find out</a>!</p>
<p>Moore sits on the boards of Netlify, Materialize, CodeSandbox, Opstrace and Stackbit, and tends to focus his energy on developer-facing software and infrastructure. Before Kleiner Perkins, he was an. investor at Costanoa Ventures, and prior to that he was at Battery.</p>
<p>He also published a list of the areas he&#8217;s most interested in as we head into 2021, which <a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/a-2020-perspective/">you can check out here</a>. Unsurprisingly, data, ML/AI, and advances in cloud technology are front and center.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re amped to hear from Moore at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/#tickets?promo=kleinerpost">TechCrunch: Early Stage</a>. You can pick up a ticket to the show <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/#tickets?promo=kleinerpost">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular, highly-scrutinized trading app Robinhood has raised $2.4 billion to its balance sheet from shareholders, as first reported by the </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-raises-another-2-4-billion-from-shareholders-11612197680"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Journal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/2/1/robinhood-raises-34-billion-to-fuel-record-customer-growth"><span style="font-weight: 400;">then confirmed by the company.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The private startup raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-raises-1b-after-trading-halts-to-keep-its-platform-running/">$1 billion on Friday</a>, meaning that it has raised $3.4 billion in a handful of days as it seeks to support a flood of retail investors looking to invest in individual stocks on its app – spurred by Redditors investing in GameStop in a effort to frustrate short sellers, in part. </span></p>
<p>Per Robinhood, the new funds were &#8220;led by Ribbit Capital, with participation from existing investors including ICONIQ, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, Index Ventures, and NEA with terms being finalized.&#8221; It&#8217;s somewhat unconventional to announce a raise that is still being sorted, but Robinhood wants to calm nerves, so shouting about the capital ahead of the paperwork being fully smoothed makes some sense.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital comes at a challenging time for the unicorn, which could </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pursue an IPO this year</span></a> – but also a time when it&#8217;s enjoying considerable public attention, likely introducing it to many potential new users<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Robinhood found itself overwhelmed by the demand of new investors looking to invest in meme-stocks such as GameStop and AMC. Robinhood had to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinho"><span style="font-weight: 400;">temporarily ban trading on these stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to stiff financial requirements. As of right now, Robinhood users are limited to buying just a few</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-limits-users-to-a-single-share-of-gamestop-and-other-stocks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shares of GameStop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other stocks despite the company haven taken on more capital since the GameStop run began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch emailed Robinhood asking for details of the $2.4 billion infusion, curious if it was raised as primary capital, convertible debt that could convert at the time of a public offering, or other mechanism. <em><strong>Update:</strong> Robinhood declined to comment on the record. Sources familiar, however, tell TechCrunch that the funds were raised in the form of a convertible note. Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizahaverstock/2021/02/01/exclusive-robinhood-secures-another-1-billion-in-funds-and-is-in-talks-for-more-as-downloads-hit-record-1-million-per-day/?sh=4c16ee893005">initially broke</a> the news that the financing was raised as a convertible note.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[A]mid this week’s extraordinary circumstances in the market, we made a tough decision today to temporarily limit buying for certain securities. As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment. These requirements exist to protect investors and the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously, including through the measures we have taken today,” the company wrote in a post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words: Robinhood ran low on capital, which meant it had to limit the frenzy of activity on its app. While the reasons behind Robinhood’s limits were technical, investors largely saw the constriction as a slap in the face in favor of hedge funds. Late Friday, Robinhood released yet </span><a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> detailing what happened during what some see as </span><a href="https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1354789569221300226"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a pivotal week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the company’s trajectory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to enable purchasing for all securities on our platform. This is a dynamic, volatile market, and we have and may continue to take action to make sure we meet our requirements as a broker so we can continue to serve our customers for the long term,” the statement read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s new capital will likely help Robinhood add some much needed buffer room, to the delight of its customers and investors. </span></p>

<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get right to it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Oh wait, one item first. Tesla earnings happened and as always a bunch of new promises and products <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/elon-musk-says-tesla-semi-is-ready-for-production-but-limited-by-battery-cell-output/">and timelines</a> were laid out, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/this-is-the-new-interior-of-teslas-model-s/">Knight Rider-inspired steering yoke</a> in the &#8220;plaid&#8221; Model X.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106342" style="width: 1004px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106342" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2106342 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg" alt="tesla steering yoke" width="994" height="824" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg 994w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg?resize=300,249 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg?resize=768,637 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg?resize=680,564 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2106342" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tesla</p></div></p>
<p>This stalkless yoke steering wheel is suboptimal. (yup I said it). And it&#8217;s already getting the attention of federal safety regulators.</p>
<p>Yes yes, you&#8217;ve seen these yokes in race cars. However, the steering ratio is vastly different between race cars and the vehicle sitting in your driveway.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the only who sees this as an awkward and potentially dangerous design choice.</p>
<p>Tim Stevens at CNET&#8217;s Roadshow, who has a deep background in automotive, notes that a race car needs as little as 180 degrees of rotation to turn from the left-most steering extent to the right, while the average passenger car has 900 degrees of rotation from full left to right.</p>
<p>That matters because daily driving requires you to change the positioning of your hands on the steering wheel while making U-turns and the like. When the steering wheel is a circle, it&#8217;s an easy task. This shape can make it awkward and prone to flubbing the maneuver.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that we don&#8217;t yet know if Tesla adjusted the steering ratio. Still, a higher steering ratio introduces other potential issues. You can read his <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-model-s-steering-yoke/">complete thoughts here</a>.</p>
<p>Lucid Motors jumped in and threw a little shade Tesla&#8217;s way with a tweet that shows a picture of the new Lucid Air steering wheel and this: &#8220;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Take the wheel: The knurled metal turbines and capacitive touchbars provide intuitive control of </span><span class="r-18u37iz">#LucidAir</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> DreamDrive ADAS functions.

<p>After a quiet few weeks, the micromobbin&#8217; news floodgates opened. Perhaps, it was due to the three-day Micromobility World event that was held this past week.</p>
<p>First up, is <strong>Spin</strong> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/spin-bets-its-scooter-future-on-3-wheels-and-remote-control-tech/">three-wheel scooter</a> it rolled out with partners Segway-Ninebot and software startup Tortoise. (the scooter is pictured below) The scooter has the noteworthy addition of a third wheel to make it more stable and easier to ride, important features for any micromobility company hoping to appeal to a wider demographic.</p>
<p>The Spin S-200 scooter, as it&#8217;s call, is also equipped with repositioning software that allows remote operators thousands of miles away to move vehicles off the sidewalk and into a proper parking spot. A fleet of about 300 Spin S-200 scooters will be tested in Boise, Idaho this spring. But the goal is much grander. Spin ultimately wants to roll out remotely operated scooters to cities in North America and Europe in 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2101289" style="width: 2890px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101289" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2101289 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png" alt="Spin S-200 Tortoise scooter" width="2880" height="1574" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png?resize=768,420 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png?resize=680,372 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png?resize=1536,839 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png?resize=2048,1119 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2101289" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spin</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Lime</strong> is adding a whole new mode to its portfolio: electric mopeds. Lime CEO Wayne Ting first hinted late last year that a “third mode” of transport beyond scooters and bikes was in the works for the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>The addition of the mode can be viewed in two ways, depending on how bullish you are about Lime. Is this a desperate attempt to appeal to its investors and find new revenue streams? Or is this a long-planned strategy aimed at owning the spectrum of inner city travel from jaunts to the corner store to longer distance trips up to five miles?</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, it seems this plan has been in the works for some time, but was delayed due to COVID.</p>
<p>Lime plans to launch as many as 600 electric mopeds on its platform this spring in Washington D.C. The company is also working with officials to pilot the mopeds in Paris. Eventually, the mopeds will be offered in a “handful of cities” over the next several months.</p>

<p><strong>One more interesting item &#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Voi Technology, the European micromobility company, is aiming to secure a license to operate in New York City. It&#8217;s big selling point? The company said it has developed an electric scooter that can measure air quality as it travels through urban areas.</p>
<p>The Voiager 4 (V4) has been designed to contribute to lowering traffic congestion and fuels, as well as helping cities to collect data on the improvements, the company said. The scooter, which is coming out in spring, will have other features like antimicrobial handlebars, audible alarms to alert pedestrians and <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Near Field Communication technology that lets users unlock it with the tap of a smartphone or smart watch.</span></p>

<p>Sila Nanotechnologies raised $590 million in capital the good old fashioned way: institutional investors and venture capital firms. (I couldn&#8217;t have a SPAC as &#8216;deal of the week,&#8217; yet again.)</p>
<p>Sila Nanotechnologies is a Silicon Valley battery materials company that has spent the better part of a decade developing technology designed to pack more energy into a cell at a lower cost.</p>
<p>With demand for batteries climbing, automakers are looking for the next-generation tech that will give them a competitive edge. Sila Nano might just be the <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">product automakers are looking for. The company, co-founded by Tesla alum Gene Berdichevsky, has already locked in partnerships with Amperex Technology Limited as well as automakers BMW and Daimler. </span></p>
<p>Sila Nano, which has a post-money valuation of $3.3 billion, plans to use the funds to hire another 100 people this year and begin to buildout a factory in North America capable of producing 100 gigawatt-hours of silicon-based anode material, which is used in batteries for the smartphone and automotive industries. Sila Nano said it plans to start production at the factory in 2024. Materials produced at the plant will be in electric vehicles by 2025, according to the company, which has yet to reveal the location of the factory.</p>
<p>The Series F funding round was led by Coatue with significant participation by funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. Existing investors 8VC, Bessemer Venture Partners, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Sutter Hill Ventures also participated in the round.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>AUTO1</strong>, a used car trading platform based in German, set the share price for its initial per offering between 32 and 38 euros with an aim to raise at least 1.5 billion euros ($1.83 billion), <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-auto1-ipo/germanys-auto1-seeks-to-raise-at-least-1-5-billion-euros-in-ipo-idUSKBN29U0M6">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Faraday Future</strong>, the electric vehicle startup that has come close to imploding numerous times in its short history, has found money where everyone else has: public markets via a SPAC. The company said it has reached an agreement to merge with Property Solutions Acquisition Corp in a deal valuing the combined entity at $3.4 billion. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/ev-maker-faraday-agrees-to-merge-with-property-solutions-spac?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg&#8217;s article</a> included a quote from Jordan Vogel, chairman and c-CEO of Property Solutions, that answered one of my questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no skeletons in the closet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have spent an exorbitant amount of time examining the history.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Freewire Technologies</strong>, the electric vehicle charging and power solutions company, raised $50 million in a Series C funding round led by Riverstone Holdings with participation from current shareholders bp ventures, Energy Innovation Capital, TRIREC and Alumni Ventures Group. The company said the funds will be used to boost production of its Boost Charger product and speed up its expansion into international markets.</p>
<p><strong>Starship Technologies</strong>, the autonomous delivery robot startup, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/starship-technologies-raises-17m-to-roll-out-more-delivery-bots/">raised $17 million</a>. Despite some struggles, the company has expanded its fleet five-fold since COVID-19 swept through the European and North American markets that it operates in. Starship now has 1,000 autonomous delivery bots in its fleet.</p>
<p>One item that I didn&#8217;t uncover until after publication: the company&#8217;s CEO Lex Bayer, a former sales leader from Airbnb, who took over the top spot at Starship in 2018, has left the company. Ahti Heinla, Starship Technologies’ co-founder and CTO, is serving as interim CEO while the company &#8220;conducts a thorough search for the best person to lead the company into the future,&#8221; a spokesperson told me.</p>
<p><strong>Wheels Up</strong>, the jet charter company, is in talks to go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Aspirational Consumer Lifestyle Corp, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aspirational-con-m-a-wheels-up-exclus/exclusive-wheels-up-in-talks-with-spac-to-go-public-sources-idUSKBN29V04B">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Wingcopter</strong>, the German drone technology startup, raised $22 million in a Series A round led by Silicon Valley VC Xplorer Capital, as well as German growth fund Futury Regio Growth. As TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/wingcopter-raises-22-million-to-expand-to-the-u-s-and-launch-a-next-generation-drone/">Darrell Etherington notes</a>, the company has come a long way since its founding in 2017. In the past four year, Wingcopter has developed, built and flown its heavy-lift cargo delivery drone, which offers all the benefits of vertical take-off and landing with the advantages of fixed-wing aircraft for longer-distance horizontal flight.</p>
<p><strong>Zadar Labs</strong>, an early stage startup that is developing high-resolution, low-cost imaging radars for autonomous systems <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zadar-labs-developing-next-generation-imaging-radar-closes-5-6m-in-seed-funding-301214844.html">raised $5.6 million</a> in seed funding led by Tim Kentley Klay — yes the Tim Kentley Klay, who co-founded Zoox, was ousted as CEO by the board and has since gone on to found a new AV startup called HYPR. Other investors include Leslie Ventures, Jeff Rothschild, Plug and Play, and Mentors Fund.</p>
<h2>GM charts its EV future</h2>

<p>GM is hardly the first company to pledge to become carbon neutral by [insert some distant date]. But GM&#8217;s announcement this past week is different than other sustainability promises and platitudes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually surprised it didn&#8217;t receive more attention. I guess Robinhood and Gamestop were too intriguing.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">In short: GM pledged to be carbon neutral by 2040, a goal it will achieve by removing emissions from all of its products and global operations as well as offsetting those emissions through carbon credits or carbon capture.</p>
<p>The company also committed to produce only electric vehicles by 2035 — just 14 years away. In automaker years, thats just two, maybe three design cycles. In other words: that&#8217;s short.</p>
<p>To be clear, when I spoke to GM, I heard words like &#8220;hope&#8221; and &#8220;aspire to.&#8221; But when pressed, the company said &#8216;yes, this a real goal.&#8217;</p>
<p>Moving its portfolio, which today is dominated by internal combustion engine vehicles, will be a transition, a GM spokesperson told TechCrunch, adding that the main priority is to bring employees along in that shift.</p>
<p>A &#8220;transition&#8221; doesn&#8217;t adequately articulate what will need to happen to pull off a goal of this size and scope. Yes, there are new EVs coming in the pipeline. And GM has committed to spend $27 billion over the next five years on the development of electric vehicles and automated technology, a 35% increase that exceeds the automaker’s investment in gas and diesel.</p>
<p>But a look across its current portfolio and there&#8217;s no denying that GM is a maker of gas and diesel vehicles.</p>
<p>Will these vehicle models cease to exist or will they be &#8220;electrified?&#8221; How quickly will GM be able to transition its numerous factories to reflect its &#8220;only electric&#8221; mission? How will its workforce respond?</p>
<p>My questions abound. I am confident to make this prediction: the next decade at GM is going to be a wild ride.</p>
<h2>AutoX&#8217;s next big move in China</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896325 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png" alt="the station autonomous vehicles1" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>I was just thinking to myself, &#8216;what is AutoX up to?&#8217; when I saw their latest announcement. The Chinese autonomous vehicle company, which has also been developing and testing its tech in the U.S., opened its robotaxi pilot program to the public in Shenzhen. These robotaxis can be hailed and do not have a human safety operator behind the wheel.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a milestone for the company and the country. AutoX said this is the first time that the general public will be able to book a completely autonomous robotaxi without accompanying safety drivers in China. Once a person registers, they can book rides through AutoNavi, the mapping and transportation-booking app owned by Alibaba, one of the startup’s investors.</p>
<p>You might recall that inAutoX opened in April 2020, an 80,000-square-foot Shanghai Robotaxi Operations Center, following a 2019 agreement with municipal authorities to deploy 100 autonomous vehicles in the Jiading District. The vehicles in the fleet were assembled at a factory about 93 miles outside of Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Shanghai operations center marked an escalation of AutoX’s ambitions that have expanded over the past year.</p>
<p>AutoX has now set up a robotaxi operations center in Shenzhen to support this new driverless program. The company says this new facility is more advanced than the previous operations centers it built in Shanghai.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Millions of Ford and Lincoln-branded vehicles will be powered by Android operating system beginning in 2023 as part of a six-year partnership announced Monday that will bring embedded Google apps and services to drivers.</p>
<p>Ford and Google said as part of the partnership they will establish <span style="font-weight: 400;">a new collaborative group called Team Upshift that will be used to develop new consumer experiences and services powered by the Android Automotive operating system. The team might create services that will change how customers buy a vehicle, for instance. The companies are </span>also working together to create new business models with data. Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian noted that could mean using data to send consumers real-time notices or handle maintenance requests.</p>
<p>The two companies also announced that Ford has chosen Google Cloud as its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/ford-bets-on-google-cloud-for-its-digital-transformation/">preferred cloud provider</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The partnership marks a shift for Ford, which has for years attempted to avoid third-party companies like Google and Apple, and instead pushed its open source platform. In 2017, Ford and Toyota Motor even formed a consortium known as SmartDeviceLink Consortium — a reference to an open source software version of Ford&#8217;s AppLink. The aim, at the time, was to speed up the deployment of the open source software to give consumers more options in how they connect and control their smartphone apps.</p>
<p>Ford told TechCrunch that the SDL Consortium remains active and has more than 20 active members. &#8220;SDL enabled mobile applications remain a key way Ford is delivering innovations into our in-vehicle experiences,&#8221; a Ford spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Android Automotive OS shouldn&#8217;t be confused with Android Auto, which is a secondary interface that lies on top of an operating system and relies on the user&#8217;s smartphone. Android Automotive OS is modeled after its open-source mobile operating system that runs on Linux. But instead of running smartphones and tablets, Google modified it so it could be used in cars.</p>
<p>David McClelland, For Vice President of Strategy and Partnerships, said the partnership with Google &#8220;turbocharges&#8221; its more recent efforts and investments to build out its data analytics team and develop software expertise.</p>
<p>&#8220;We both believe that the relationship between Google and Ford will establish an innovation powerhouse,&#8221; McClelland said. &#8220;It will accelerate the modernization of our business at Ford, and most importantly, it will let us exceed our customers expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ford isn&#8217;t the only company with plans to incorporate a version of its Android operating system into its vehicles, although McClelland emphasized that the services and offerings would be unique.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For instance, Volvo announced in 2017 that it would use the Android OS and a year later said it would embed voice-controlled Google Assistant, Google Play Store, Google Maps and other Google services into its next-generation Sensus infotainment system. lvo. Polestar, the electric vehicle brand under Volvo, also uses Android Automotive OS to power the infotainment system for its newest vehicle, the Polestar 2. </span>Google announced in 2019 that it was opening its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/google-opens-android-automotive-os-to-spotify-other-media-app-developers/">Android Automotive operating system</a> up to third-party developers to bring music and other entertainment apps into vehicle infotainment systems, starting with the Polestar 2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google and Ford today <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/ford-vehicles-will-be-powered-by-googles-android-operating-system/">announced</a> a new partnership around bringing Android Automotive to Ford&#8217;s Ford and Lincoln-branded cars, starting in 2023. But at the same time, the two companies also announced that Ford has chosen Google Cloud as its preferred cloud provider.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Google Cloud, Ford will digitally transform from the front office to the car to the manufacturing plant floor,&#8221; Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said in a press conference today. &#8220;And there are a number of different applications, including modernizing product development, improving manufacturing and supply chain management, using computer vision AI for employee training, inspection of equipment on the assembly line and other applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurian also noted that Google and Ford are working to find new ways to monetize Ford&#8217;s data through features like maintenance requests and trade-in alerts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="j8lGNMYkdM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/ford-vehicles-will-be-powered-by-googles-android-operating-system/">Ford vehicles will be powered by Google&#8217;s Android operating system</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ford vehicles will be powered by Google&#8217;s Android operating system&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/ford-vehicles-will-be-powered-by-googles-android-operating-system/embed/#?secret=j8lGNMYkdM" data-secret="j8lGNMYkdM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;At Ford, we&#8217;ve got world-class in-house data insights and analytics teams,&#8221; David McClelland, Ford&#8217;s VP for strategy and partnerships, said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve recruited significant software expertise and we&#8217;re making great progress in this area. And we&#8217;re moving rapidly towards commercializing our new self-driving business. And with this news that Thomas [Kurian] and I are announcing today, we&#8217;re turbocharging all of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>McClelland stressed that Google &#8220;brought the entire company to the table for us across cloud, Android, Maps and much more.&#8221; It&#8217;s maybe also no surprise, given Google&#8217;s expertise in this area, that Ford is looking to leverage Google Cloud&#8217;s AI tools as well. This work will go beyond the actual driving experience, too, and include work on modernizing Ford&#8217;s product development, manufacturing and supply chain, as well as predictive maintenance in Ford&#8217;s plants.</p>
<p>Like other car manufacturers, Ford is also looking to find ways to use the data it collects to create a connection to its drivers that goes beyond the buying experience and (maybe) the occasional maintenance visit to a dealership. For this to work, it needs to be able to understand its customers and offer personalized experiences.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement marks a bit of a turnaround for Ford, which had previously <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/06/03/fords-tech-might-end-up-in-your-toyota/">banded together</a> with a group of other car manufacturers with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/ford-and-toyota-team-up-to-launch-the-smartdevicelink-consortium/">explicit goal</a> of keeping Google&#8217;s role in the automotive industry to a minimum. Now, only a few years later, the two are coming together in one of the deeper partnerships in the industry.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that not too long ago, Ford had a deep partnership with Microsoft, which provided the basis of Ford&#8217;s Sync technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the first moving assembly line to the latest driver-assist technology, Ford has set the pace of innovation for the automotive industry for nearly 120 years,&#8221; said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet. &#8220;We’re proud to partner to apply the best of Google’s AI, data analytics, compute and cloud<br />
platforms to help transform Ford&#8217;s business and build automotive technologies that keep people safe and connected on the road.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://wandb.ai/">Weights &amp; Biases</a>, a startup building tools for machine learning practitioners, is announcing that it has raised $45 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Lukas Biewald, Chris Van Pelt and Shawn Lewis — Biewald and Van Pelt previously founded CrowdFlower/Figure Eight (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/10/appen-acquires-figure-eight/">acquired by Appen</a>). Weights &amp; Biases says it now has more than 70,000 users at more than 200 enterprises.</p>
<p>Biewald (whom I&#8217;ve known since college) argued that while machine learning practitioners are often compared to software developers, &#8220;they&#8217;re more like scientists in some ways than engineers.&#8221; It&#8217;s a process that involves numerous experiments, and Weights &amp; Biases&#8217; core product allows practitioners to track those experiments, while the company also offers tools around data set versioning, model evaluation and pipeline management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;If you have a model that’s controlling a self-driving car and the car crashes, you really want to know what happened,&#8221; Biewald said. &#8220;If you built that model years ago and you&#8217;ve run all these experiments since then, it can be hard to systematically trace through what happened&#8221; unless you&#8217;re using experiment tracking.</p>
<p>He described the startup as &#8220;an early leader&#8221; in this market, and as competing tools emerge, he said it&#8217;s also differentiated because it is &#8220;completely focused on the ML practitioner&#8221; rather than top-down enterprise sales. Similarly, he said that as machine learning has been adopted more widely, Weights &amp; Biases is occasionally confronted by a &#8220;high-class problem.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106631" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106631" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106631" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?w=680" alt="Weights &amp; Biases screenshot" width="680" height="412" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg 2600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?resize=768,465 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?resize=680,412 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?resize=1536,930 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?resize=2048,1241 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106631" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Weights &amp; Biases</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We’re not interested in selling to companies that are doing machine learning for machine learning&#8217;s sake,&#8221; Biewald said. &#8220;With some companies, there&#8217;s a mandate from the CEO to sprinkle some machine learning in the company. That’s just really depressing to me, to not have any impact. But I would actually say the vast majority of companies that we talk to really do something useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, he said agriculture giant John Deere is using the startup&#8217;s platform to continually improve<a href="https://medium.com/pytorch/ai-for-ag-production-machine-learning-for-agriculture-e8cfdb9849a1"> the way it uses robotics to spray fertilizer</a>, rather than pesticides, to kill weeds and pests. And there are pharmaceutical companies using the platform for how they model how different molecules will behave.</p>
<p>Weights &amp; Biases previously raised $20 million in funding. The new round was led by Insight Partners, with participation from Coatue, Trinity Ventures and Bloomberg Beta. Insight&#8217;s George Mathew is joining the board of directors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve never seen a MLOps category leader with such a high NPS and deep customer focus as Weights and Biases,” Mathew said George Mathew said in a statement. “It’s an honor to make my first investment at Insight to serve an ML practitioner user-base that grew 60x these last two years.”</p>
<p>The startup says it will use the funding to continue hiring in engineering, growth, sales and customer success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many founders only know their own experience fundraising and don&#8217;t hear much about what other founders went through. On <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/check-out-the-amazing-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-february/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Extra Crunch Live</a> on Wednesday, we&#8217;re going to remedy that.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/grafana/">Grafana Labs</a> has raised upward of $75 million since it launched in 2014. Lightspeed Venture Partners, and partner Gaurav Gupta to be specific, led both the startup&#8217;s Series A and Series B rounds. As far as commitments go, that&#8217;s a pretty significant one.</p>
<p>The new and improved Extra Crunch Live pairs founders and the investors who led their earlier rounds to talk about how the deal went down, from the moment they met to the conversations they had (including some disagreements) to the relationship as it exists today. Hell, we may even take a peek at the original pitch deck that made it all happen.</p>
<p>Then, we&#8217;ll turn our eyes back to you, the audience. That same founder/investor duo (in this case, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/radutt">Grafana Labs CEO Raj Dutt</a> and <a href="https://lsvp.com/team/gaurav-gupta/">LVP&#8217;s Gaurav Gupta</a>) will take a look at your pitch decks and give their own feedback. (If you haven&#8217;t yet submitted a pitch deck to be torn down on Extra Crunch Live, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">you can do so here</a>.)</p>
<p>The hour-long episode is sandwiched between two 30-minute rounds of networking. From start to finish, it goes from 11:30 a.m. PST/2:30 p.m. EST to 1:30 p.m. PST/4:30 p.m. EST. And Extra Crunch Live will come to you at the same time, every week, with a new pair of speakers.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s learn a little bit more about Gupta and Dutt.</p>
<p>Before becoming an investor, Gupta enjoyed a rich career in the product development sphere, holding positions at Elastic (where he led product management), Splunk (VP of Products), as well as Google, Gateway and the McKenna Group. He joined Lightspeed in 2019 as a partner, focusing primarily on enterprise software. He&#8217;s led investments in Impira, Blameless, Hasura and Panther, and of course, Grafana. He sits on the board of the last three companies in that list.</p>
<p>Dutt is the co-founder and CEO at Grafana Labs, but the fast-growing company isn&#8217;t his first go at entrepreneurialism. Dutt also founded and led Voxel, a cloud-hosting startup that was acquired by Internap for $30 million in 2012.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Gupta and Dutt join us on our first episode of Extra Crunch Live in 2021. As a reminder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=lightspeedgrafana">Extra Crunch Live is for Extra Crunch members only</a>. We&#8217;re coming to you with a new pair of speakers every week, and you can catch everything you missed on-demand if you can&#8217;t join us live. It&#8217;s worth the cost of the subscription on its own, but EC members also get access to our premium content, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ec-market-map/">market maps</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ec-investor-survey/">investor surveys</a>. Long story short? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=lightspeedgrafana">Subscribe, smarty.</a> You won&#8217;t regret it.</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/check-out-the-amazing-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-february/?tpcc=ECTW2020">here&#8217;s a look at other speakers you can expect to see on Extra Crunch Live</a>:</p>
<p>Aydin Senkut (Felicis) + Kevin Busque (Guideline) — February 10<br />
Steve Loughlin (Accel) + Jason Boehmig (Ironclad) — February 17<br />
Matt Harris (Bain Capital Ventures) + Isaac Oates (Justworks) — February 24</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just the February slate!</p>
<p>All the details to register for this upcoming episode (and more) are available below. Can&#8217;t wait to see you there!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[So much for a blowback!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/how-robinhood-and-chime-raised-2b-in-the-last-year/">Deeply funded</a> fintech company Robinhood has been the world&#8217;s most discussed startup over the last week. After the discount trading pioneer found itself in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">the midst of a battle</a> between hedge funds on one side and a slurry of retail and institutional capital on the other, Robinhood&#8217;s trading volume spiked last week.</p>
<p>But after the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">raised its deposit requirements</a> before the market open on Friday, Robinhood was forced to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-raises-1b-after-trading-halts-to-keep-its-platform-running/">restrict trading</a> in a number of popular stocks. The company also drew down its credit lines and raised new capital from prior investors to stay open during a trading avalanche.</p>

<hr />
<p>According <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/elon-musk-goes-live-on-clubhouse-but-with-the-room-full-fans-stream-audio-on-youtube/">to a Clubhouse chat</a> between Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and Elon Musk last night, the NSCC initially asked Robinhood to post $3 billion in reserve capital. That figure was reduced to $1.4 billion and later to $700 million after Robinhood agreed to limit certain trades. Robinhood transmitted the funds and opened Friday.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s all recent news. Let&#8217;s look back further.</p>

The key revenue source for Robinhood is trackable, as the company has to file its incomes from it. This provides a good view into the company&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p>Today we&#8217;re parsing its Q4 2020 data, which shows a return to sequential-quarterly growth at the trading upstart.</p>
<p>Of course, we won&#8217;t have Q1 2021 data for another three months, but we do have &#8212; at last &#8212; a good look at how Robinhood wrapped 2020 and some insight into why its investors were willing to put in another $1 billion just last week.</p>
<h2>Robinhood&#8217;s Q4 2020</h2>
<p>Regular readers of The Exchange will recall that after a stonking Q2 2020, Robinhood&#8217;s Q3 2020 PFOF incomes were large, but not sequentially impressive; while Robinhood likely saw sharp revenue gains from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020, when we stacked last year&#8217;s third-quarter against its second, the company&#8217;s growth had slowed enough that we were curious what would happen in Q4.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
