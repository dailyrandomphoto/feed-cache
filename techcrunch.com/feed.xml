										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2017, Microsoft has</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/27/microsoft-office-arrives-on-chromebooks-via-google-play-store/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">offered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its Office suite to Chromebook users via the Google Play store, but that is set to come to an end in a few short weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Sept. 18, Microsoft is discontinuing support for Office, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Outlook, on Chromebook. Microsoft is not, however, abandoning the popular mobile device altogether. Instead of an app that is downloaded, Microsoft is encouraging users to go to the web instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In an effort to provide the most optimized experience for Chromebook customers, Microsoft apps (Office and Outlook) will be transitioned to web experiences (Office.com and Outlook.com) on September 18, 2021,&#8221; Microsoft wrote in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft&#8217;s statement also noted that &#8220;this transition brings Chromebook customers access to additional and premium features.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Microsoft web experience will serve to transition its base of Chromebook users to the Microsoft 365 service, which provides more Office templates and generally more functionality than what the app-based approach provides. The web approach is also more optimized for larger screens than the app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of how Microsoft wants Chromebook users to get access to Office and Outlook, the plan is for customers to, &#8220;..sign in with their personal Microsoft Account or account associated with their Microsoft 365 subscription,&#8221; according to the statement. Microsoft has also provided</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-install-and-run-microsoft-office-on-a-chromebook-32f14a23-2c1a-4579-b973-d4b1d78561ad"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">online documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to show users how to run Office on a Chromebook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chromebooks run on Google&#8217;s Chrome OS, which is a Linux-based operating system. Chromebooks also enable Android apps to run, as Android is also Linux based, with apps downloaded from Google Play. It&#8217;s important to note that while support for Chromebooks is going away, Microsoft is not abandoning other Android-based mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those Chromebook users that have already downloaded the Microsoft Office apps, the apps will continue to function after September 18, though they will not receive any support or future updates. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With more than 270,000 stickers, Stipop&#8217;s library of colorful, character-driven expressions has a little something for everyone.</p>
<p>The company offers keyboard and social app stickers through ad-supported mobile apps on iOS and Android, but it&#8217;s recently focused more on providing stickers to developers, creators and other online businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to gather so many artists because we actually began as our own app that provided stickers,&#8221; <a href="https://stipop.io/">Stipop</a> co-founder Tony Park told TechCrunch. The team took what they learned from running their own consumer-facing app — namely that collecting and licensing hundreds of thousands of stickers from artists around the world is hard work — and adapted their business to help solve that problem for others.</p>
<p>Stipop was the first Korean company to go through Yellow, Snapchat&#8217;s exclusive accelerator. The company is also part of Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2021 cohort.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1RFqmpYo3I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Stipop&#8217;s sticker library is accessible through an SDK and an API, letting developers slot the searchable sticker library into their existing software. The company already has more than 200 companies that tap into its huge sticker trove, which offers a &#8220;single-day solution&#8221; for a process that would otherwise necessitate a lot more legwork. Stipop launched a <a href="https://developers.stipop.io/">website</a> recently that helps developers integrate its SDK and API through quick installs.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can just add a single line of code inside their product and will have a fully customized sticker feature [so] users will be able to spice up their chats,&#8221; Park said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Park points out that stickers encourage engagement — and for social software, engagement means growth. Stickers are a playful way to send characters back and forth in chat, but they also pop up in a number of other less obvious spots, from dating apps to ecommerce and ridesharing apps. Stipop even drives the sticker search in work collaboration software Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>The company has already partnered with Google, which uses Stipop&#8217;s sticker library in Gboard, Android Messages and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/google-acquires-gif-platform-tenor/">Tenor</a>, a GIF keyboard platform that Google bought in 2018. That partnership drove 600 million sticker views within the first month. A new partnership between Stipop and Coca-Cola on the near horizon will add Coke-branded stickers to its sticker library and the company is <a href="https://stipop.io/brands">opening its doors to more brands</a> that understand the unique appeal of stickers in messaging apps.</p>
<p>Park says that people tend to compare stickers and gifs, two ways of wordlessly expressing emotion and social nuance, but stickers are a world unto themselves. Stickers exist in their own creative universe, with star artists, regional themes and original casts of characters that take on a life of their own among fans. &#8220;Sticker creators have their own profession,&#8221; Park said.</p>
<p>Visual artists can also find a lot of traction releasing stickers, even without sophisticated illustrations. And since they&#8217;re all about meaning rather than refinement, non-designers and less skilled artists can craft hit stickers too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stickers are great for them because it [is] so easy to go viral,&#8221; Park said. The company has partnered with 8,000 sticker creators across 25 languages, helping those artists monetize their creations and generate income based on how many times a sticker is shared.</p>
<p>Stickers command their own visual language around the world, and Park has observed interesting cultural differences in how people use them to communicate. In the West, stickers are often used in place of text, but in Asia, where they&#8217;re used much more frequently, people usually send stickers to enhance rather than replace the meaning of text.</p>
<p>In East Asia, users tend to prefer simple black and white stickers, but in India and Saudi Arabia, bright, golden stickers top the trends. In South America, popular stickers take on a more pixelated, unique quality that resonates culturally there.</p>
<p>&#8220;With stickers, you fall in love with [the] characters you send&#8230; that becomes you,&#8221; Park said.</p>

Employees are also demanding <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/12/09/how-the-coronavirus-outbreak-has-and-hasnt-changed-the-way-americans-work/">flexible schedules and remote work</a>, and as a result, executives are planning to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-future-of-work-after-covid-19">reduce office space by 30%</a>. The data surrounding the global shift to remote work is piling up and our post-pandemic professional landscape is starting to take shape.</p>
<p>Are you ready to lead a digital workforce?</p>
<p>The seismic shift in how we work requires a reassessment of how we manage, even for — or <em>especially</em> for — seasoned leaders. How do you wrangle a highly educated, decentralized workforce and rally them around a singular mission? How do you become a better people manager amid a workplace sea change?</p>
<p>As a seasoned CMO who has managed global workforces, I’ve finally hit my stride as a remote-only manager, all while navigating a global pandemic and riding my company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/okr-focused-gtmhub-raises-30m-series-b-after-growing-3x-in-2020/">unprecedented growth</a>. What’s the secret sauce to managing today’s remote workforce? Strengthen your team by creating authentic workplace transparency, using numbers as a universal language and providing meaning behind your team’s work.</p>
<p>The biggest secret behind my management practices? It’s possible to produce more success with less stress. Consider these three ways I’ve strengthened my team and, in turn, become a more nimble manager.</p>
<h2>Focus your team on meaningful work</h2>
<p>A Harvard Business Review study found that <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/11/9-out-of-10-people-are-willing-to-earn-less-money-to-do-more-meaningful-work">knowledge workers are more fulfilled</a> when they understand what organizations are trying to achieve and how their work lifts up their workplaces as a whole. In other words, meaning motivates your digital workforce.</p>
<p>On the surface, communicating your organization’s overarching mission, its reason for being, seems like a simple enough task. But I challenge you to ask each one of your team members to define your organization’s mission. If you have 10 employees, I bet you get nine or 10 different answers.</p>
<p>Instead of expecting employees to find your organization’s mission and vision on PowerPoint decks or on the website’s “about us” page, use the proven objectives and key results (OKRs) methodology.</p>
<p>The next piece of the puzzle helps you raise the visibility around <em>why</em> your employees are doing what they’re doing every day and creates a culture of motivation through meaning. Collaborate with your employees to create individual OKRs that identify goals and metrics for achievement. These OKRs should detail exactly how each employee contributes to the organization’s success and become the impetus behind<em> everything </em>an employee does.</p>
<p>I tell my workforce to review their OKRs every morning to help them focus on what’s important. It is like daily meditation for your business. So I didn’t worry when my director of marketing recently moved and had a baby. Because we had worked together to set thoughtful OKRs, my team member’s objectives and results were well defined. She knew where to focus her limited time. No distractions from the cacophony of requests. No anxiety over letting down her team. Just peace of mind that she was focusing on the right tasks.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The design space has undergone major changes in the last decade. What once was dominated by a single player in Adobe has now become a burgeoning software landscape, with a handful of major players answering the needs of designers across every industry.</p>
<p>One such player is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/canva/">Canva</a>, the startup valued at over $15 billion. The company started out with a consumer-facing product, making design accessible to non-designers. But on the back of launching an enterprise-centric suite of tools, the growth of Sydney-based Canva has been staggering.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Canva co-founder and CEO Melanie Perkins join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Disrupt (Sept 21-23)</a> for a fireside chat.</p>
<p>Since launching the company in 2013, Perkins has led its growth to now see more than 55 million users each month, ranging from individual creators to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to Perkins about how she shifted the company from individual creators to a B2B platform, what it&#8217;s like to run an industry-specific startup in the midst of a fundamental evolution — see: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/05/design-may-be-the-next-entrepreneurial-gold-rush/">Design may be the next entrepreneurial gold rush</a> — and how she&#8217;s handled this period of monumental growth for the company.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We’ve seen non-venture funds flow into the later stages of startup land, pushing VCs toward earlier-stage and more venture-y deals. Why would CVCs be immune to the same trend?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the global market for startup investing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">presses to new heights in terms of dollars invested this year</a>, and deal volume ticks up in several regions, corporations are diving into the action.</p>
<p>Data from <a href="http://cbinsights.com">CB Insights</a> and <a href="https://stryber.com/">Stryber</a> indicate that corporate investors are taking part in deals worth more than ever, even if corporate venture capital (CVC) deal activity is not up uniformly around the world.</p>

<hr />
<p>In a sense, it’s not surprising that CVCs are seeing the deals that they participate in rising in size &#8212; the global venture capital market has trended toward larger deals and more dollars for some time now. But questions lie inside the eye-popping figures: How are corporate investors adapting to a more rapid-fire and expensive venture capital market? We also wanted to know if CVCs are shaking up their deal sourcing, and whether the classic corporate venture tension between strategic investing and deploying capital for financial return is seeing a focus mix shift.</p>

(TechCrunch last covered CVC outfit WIND Ventures <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/wind-ventures-gears-up-to-invest-in-startups-looking-at-latin-america/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Let’s talk data and then dig into the nuance behind the numbers.</p>
<h2>A boom in deal value</h2>
<p>Precisely measuring CVC activity is interestingly difficult. When we discuss the value of venture capital deals, for example, what counts and what doesn’t is a matter of taste. For example, how to treat the SoftBank Vision Fund. Do deals that it leads that include venture capital participation count toward larger VC activity for a given period of time? What about investments led by crossover funds?</p>
<p>No matter what you choose, aggregate venture capital data will always include dollars invested by non-venture entities. So you do the best you can. CVC has the same problem, amplified. Because CVCs are often participatory to deals, instead of leading them, especially in the later stages of startup investing today, tallying concrete corporate venture investment is difficult. So we proceed in the same manner as we do with aggregate venture data counting, including deals that a particular investor type participated in.</p>
<p>Perfect, no. But it’s consistent, which is what we likely care about more. All that’s to say that when we observe the following deal and dollar data, CB Insights notes plainly that for its purposes, “‘CVC-backed funding’ and ‘CVC-backed deals’ refer to corporate venture capital participation in these funding rounds.”</p>
<p>Fair enough. Per <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/corporate-venture-capital-trends-h1-2021">CB Insights&#8217; H1 2021 CVC report</a>, CVCs participated in $78.7 billion in funding activity in the first half of 2021, a record for a half-year period. That dollar figure was derived from some 2,099 deals around the world. Precisely how strong those figures are is not clear from their absolute scale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk’s Tesla is looking beyond electric vehicles, solar panels and energy storage and wants to now supply electricity directly to customers, according to an application filed with Texas electricity regulators earlier this month. <a href="http://www.energychoicematters.com/stories/20210816z.html">Energy Choice Matters</a> first reported on the application.</p>
<p><a href="http://interchange.puc.texas.gov/Documents/52431_1_1147491.PDF">The application</a>, filed with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas on August 16, is a request to become what’s called a “retail electric provider” (REP) under its subsidiary Tesla Energy Ventures. On the deregulated, idiosyncratic Texas power market, REPs generally purchase wholesale electricity from power generators and sell it to customers. More than 100 REPs currently compete on the open market.</p>
<p>The company also filed separate applications for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/teslas-utility-scale-batteries-are-coming-to-texas/">several utility-scale batteries</a> in the Lone Star state: a 250-megawatt battery situated near its Gigafactory outside Austin, and a 100 MW separate project outside Houston. These projects are unrelated to the company’s efforts to become an electric provider, but taken as a whole, they reveal an ambitious roadmap for Tesla’s energy businesses.</p>
<p>Imagine: Tesla could not only sell electricity to customers, but it could also broker customers selling their excess energy &#8212; generated from Tesla Powerwall or Solar panel products, of course &#8212; back to the grid. It’s certainly one way to fulfill Musk’s vision of turning every home into a distributed power plant.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jPHtPTokx4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/tesla-wants-to-make-every-home-a-distributed-power-plant/">Tesla wants to make every home a distributed power plant</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tesla wants to make every home a distributed power plant&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/tesla-wants-to-make-every-home-a-distributed-power-plant/embed/#?secret=jPHtPTokx4" data-secret="jPHtPTokx4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The latest request to the PUC comes just six months after an unprecedented winter storm shut down large parts of Texas’ power grid for days, leaving millions without power during a string of sub-freezing days. A handful of REPs shut down after the storm, which jammed wholesale electricity prices up to $9,000 per megawatt-hour (the seasonal average is around $50).</p>
<p>Musk, who moved many operations to Texas from California, including SpaceX’s sprawling facility in Boca Chica, criticized the state’s grid operator on Twitter at the time:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">.<a href="https://twitter.com/ERCOT_ISO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ERCOT_ISO</a> is not earning that R</p>
<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1361962505573031938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p>He said the company was not “earning that R” – referring to the R in the acronym, which stands for Electric Reliability Council of Texas.</p>
<p>Tesla Energy Ventures told PUC regulators that it would use Tesla’s existing energy division to help drive sales, including leveraging the company’s mobile app and website. “Specifically, [Tesla Energy Ventures] will target its existing customers that own Tesla products and market the retail offer to customers through the mobile application and Tesla website,” the application says. “In addition to the Tesla mobile application and Tesla website, the applicant&#8217;s existing &#8216;Tesla Energy Customer Support&#8217; organization will be trained to provide support and guidance to customers in customer acquisition efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ana Stewart is listed as president of Tesla Energy Ventures. She’s been with Tesla since 2017 as the director of regulatory credit trading. Prior, she worked at Tesla-acquired SolarCity.</p>
<p>The application is listed under docket number 52431.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Tuesday, Peloton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/peloton-tread-arrives-next-week-with-enhanced-safety-features-following-recall/">announced</a> the upcoming release of its entry-level Tread device. The news came ahead of a disappointing earnings report and after recalls of both of its treadmill products. Today, the connected fitness company noted in a filing with the SEC that it has been subpoenaed by both the U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Both subpoenas are part of investigations around the way the company reported injuries from its treadmills. It’s seemingly another sign that, in spite of the return of one of its two Tread products to market, the larger implications are far from over for the company.</p>
<p>Peloton writes <a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/d84f3085-8c04-45d0-b6ab-0550de50c7ad">in the filing:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Injuries sustained by Members or their friends and family members, or others who use or purchase our Connected Fitness Products, could subject us to regulatory proceedings and litigation by governance agencies and private litigants brought against us, that regardless of their merits, could harm our reputation, divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees and other costs. For example, we are presently subject to a CPSC investigation and other litigation related to injuries sustained by Members and others who use or purchase the Tread+, and we have reporting obligations to safety regulators in all jurisdictions where we sell Connected Fitness Products, where reporting may trigger further regulatory investigations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company declined to comment further on the investigations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BGlc50lhKe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/peloton-tread-arrives-next-week-with-enhanced-safety-features-following-recall/">Peloton Tread arrives next week with enhanced safety features, following recall</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Peloton Tread arrives next week with enhanced safety features, following recall&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/peloton-tread-arrives-next-week-with-enhanced-safety-features-following-recall/embed/#?secret=BGlc50lhKe" data-secret="BGlc50lhKe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Peloton was, notably, at odds with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)’s initial warning to stop using its treadmill products after an accident with the Tread+ resulted in a child’s death. At the time, Peloton said it was &#8220;troubled&#8221; by the reporting and insisted that &#8220;there is no reason to stop using the Tread+, as long as all warnings and safety instructions are followed.&#8221; In May, CEO John Foley apologized for the pushback and agreed to work with the CPSC on a recall.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Commission cited more than 70 incidents in all, noting, “a six-year-old child recently died after being pulled under the rear of the treadmill. In addition, Peloton has received 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations.”</p>
<p>The cheaper Tread model, meanwhile, was at the center of separate issue wherein the product’s touchscreen could detach and cause injury during use. The new version of the device features a reinforced screen. The recalls impacted around 125,000 Tread+ systems and more than 5,500 Treads, which were in early release.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian, the electric vehicle startup backed by a host of institutional and strategic investors, including Ford and Amazon, has confidentially filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to go public.</p>
<p>The size and price range for the proposed offering have yet to be determined. The initial public offering is expected to take place after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions, the brief statement said.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The confidential filing comes less than two months since Rivian announced it had closed a $2.5 billion private funding round led by Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, D1 Capital Partners, Ford Motor and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Third Point, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Dragoneer Investment Group and Coatue also participated in that round.</p>

<p>The company did not share a post-money valuation at the time of the July 2021 announcement.</p>
<p>The electric automaker, which now employs 7,000 people, is preparing to deliver its R1T pickup truck in September. The road to produce the R1T and an accompanying SUV requires capital, which Rivian has had little trouble raising.</p>
<p>Rivian has raised roughly $10.5 billion to date. In January, the company brought in $2.65 billion from existing investors T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Fidelity Management and Research Company, Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund, Coatue and D1 Capital Partners. New investors also participated in that round, which pushed Rivian&#8217;s valuation to $27.6 billion, a source familiar with the investment round told TechCrunch at the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

Well, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Cologne-based startup </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.sastrify.com">Sastrify</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> is here to help &#8212; offering what it describes as a &#8220;highly automated&#8221; platform (covering some 20,000+ SaaS solutions) to help other businesses with procurement and management of third-party services.</span></p>
<p>It may not sound the sexist startup business to be in, but despite only launching earlier this year, Sastrify is already cash-flow positive &#8212; and can tout &#8220;a high six-digit recurring revenue&#8221; just a few months post-launch. Not bad for a startup that was only founded last summer.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Today it&#8217;s announcing closing a $7 million seed</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> round from HV Capital and the founders of FlixMobility, Personio and SumUp. </span>That follows a $1.3 million pre-seed raised back in late 2020, ahead of its launch.</p>
<p>Sastrify tells us it has around 50 customers at this stage &#8212; including &#8220;unicorn startups like Gorillas&#8221;. It says its approach works best for growing companies with 100+ employees, and is perhaps especially suited to European tech scale-ups.</p>
<p>On the competitive front the startup points to U.S.-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/vendr-raises-huge-60m-series-a-as-its-saas-purchasing-service-scales/"><span aria-invalid="spelling">Vendr</span></a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/tropic-picks-up-25m-to-streamline-software-procurement-experiences/">Tropic</a>, which may further explain the regional focus (although it&#8217;s not only selling in Europe).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Vendr raises huge $60M Series A as its SaaS-purchasing service scales&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/vendr-raises-huge-60m-series-a-as-its-saas-purchasing-service-scales/embed/#?secret=uJlCAL4HgO" data-secret="uJlCAL4HgO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Sastrify&#8217;s sales pitch to SMEs includes that current customers have seen an average 6.5x return on their investment &#8212; in addition to what it bills as &#8220;thousands of working hours&#8221; saved from &#8220;wasted&#8221; activities related to SaaS procurement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cost savings are another carrot &#8212; which the startup is claiming its customers are &#8220;typically&#8221; saving around 20-30% of their SaaS cost.</p>
<p>So how does it actually make it easier for businesses to navigate the pros &amp; cons of the smorgasbord of SaaS(es) now out there?</p>
<p>&#8220;Our main mantra is: &#8216;Effective procurement asks the right questions at the right time&#8217;,&#8221; says co-founder Sven Lackinger, who previously co-founded a SaaS startup himself of course (evopark), exiting that company back in 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;To ensure that we&#8217;ve defined and implemented a five-step process into our platform, covering the whole life-cycle of SaaS applications within enterprises. Our clients can search for the suitable SaaS solutions while we guide them through the right evaluation process per use case and tool (e.g. what are similar companies using?).</p>
<p>&#8220;We then take over the whole buying process, aka automatically reaching out to different vendors, AI-/OCR-based comparing and benchmarking for offers. Once the tool is implemented, we make sure to track usage frequently (via regular, automated surveys to tool owners) and re-evaluate over time so there is no ongoing waste of licenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a more automated platform [than Vendr and Tropic] and can also resell licenses to our customers directly (e.g. for Google, Microsoft and others) to ensure best prices and fast delivery,&#8221; he also tells us. &#8220;This allows us to offer a faster and cheaper solution which is more suited to the European market (where the average SaaS expense per company is still smaller than in the US).&#8221;<i> </i></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re outsourcing all this other stuff to SaaS providers, why not get a specialist service to stay on top of how you do that too, is the basic idea.</p>

<p>The 30-strong Sastrify team will be using the seed funding to accelerate sales, marketing and product dev so it can expand its SaaS management service to more companies in Europe and beyond.</p>

<p>Commenting on the funding in a statement, Jasper Masemann, partner at HV Capital, added: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“Cloud software adoption is massively accelerating and almost every company nowadays uses SaaS products but does not buy and manage them efficiently. Sastrify’s astonishing growth underlines the broad customer value the team has already created. It is early days but Sastrify could create an SAP Arriba with a payment solution for SMB – a massive market just in Europe.”</span></p>

		<div class="contributor-byline__bio">
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/venky-adivi-0a548b4/">Venky Adivi</a> is director of strategic capture and proposal management at <a href="https://canonical.com/"> Canonical</a>, publisher of Ubuntu.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In recent years, the private sector has been spurning proprietary software in favor of open source software and development approaches. For good reason: The open source avenue saves money and development time by using freely available components instead of writing new code, enables new applications to be deployed quickly and eliminates vendor lock-in.</p>
<p>The federal government has been slower to embrace open source, however. Efforts to change are complicated by the fact that many agencies employ large legacy IT infrastructure and systems to serve millions of people and are responsible for a plethora of sensitive data. Washington spends tens of billions every year on IT, but with each agency essentially acting as its own enterprise, decision-making is far more decentralized than it would be at, say, a large bank.</p>
<p>While the government has made a number of moves in a more open direction in recent years, the story of open source in federal IT has often seemed more about potential than reality.</p>
<p>But there are several indications that this is changing and that the government is reaching its own open source adoption tipping point. The costs of producing modern applications to serve increasingly digital-savvy citizens keep rising, and agencies are budget constrained to find ways to improve service while saving taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>Sheer economics dictate an increased role for open source, as do a variety of other benefits. Because its source code is publicly available, open source software encourages continuous review by others outside the initial development team to promote increased software reliability and security, and code can be easily shared for reuse by other agencies.</p>
<p>Here are five signs I see that the U.S. government is increasingly rallying around open source.</p>
<h2>More dedicated resources for open source innovation</h2>
<p>Two initiatives have gone a long way toward helping agencies advance their open source journeys.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>, a team within the General Services Administration that acts as consultancy to help other agencies build digital services, is an ardent open source backer. Its work has included developing a new application for accessing Federal Election Commission data, as well as software that has allowed the GSA to improve its contractor hiring process.</p>
<p>18F — short for GSA headquarters’ address of 1800 F St. — reflects the same grassroots ethos that helped spur open source’s emergence and momentum in the private sector. &#8220;The code we create belongs to the public as a part of the public domain,&#8221; the group says on its website.</p>
<p>Five years ago this August, the Obama administration introduced a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf">Federal Source Code Policy</a> that called on every agency to adopt an open source approach, create a source code inventory, and publish at least 20% of written code as open source. The administration also launched <a href="https://code.gov/#/">Code.gov</a>, giving agencies a place to locate open source solutions that other departments are already using.</p>
<p>The results have been mixed, however. Most agencies are now consistent with the federal policy’s goal, though many still have work to do in implementation, <a href="https://code.gov/agency-compliance/compliance/dashboard">according to</a> Code.gov’s tracker. And a <a href="https://github.com/GSA/code-gov/blob/master/docs/FederalSourceCodeStudy/FederalSourceCodeStudy.pdf">report</a> by a Code.gov staffer found that some agencies were embracing open source more than others.</p>
<p>Still, Code.gov says the growth of open source in the federal government has gone farther than initially estimated.</p>
<h2>A push from the new administration</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text">American Rescue Plan</a>, a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill that President Biden signed in early March 2021, contained $9 billion for the GSA’s <a href="https://tmf.cio.gov/">Technology Modernization Fund</a>, which finances new federal technology projects. In January, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/legislation/2021/01/20/president-biden-announces-american-rescue-plan/">said</a> upgrading federal IT infrastructure and addressing recent breaches such as the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/985439655/a-worst-nightmare-cyberattack-the-untold-story-of-the-solarwinds-hack">SolarWinds hack</a> was “an urgent national security issue that cannot wait.”</p>
<p>It’s fair to assume open source software will form the foundation of many of these efforts, because White House technology director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidrecordon/">David Recordon</a> is a long-time open source advocate and once led Facebook’s open source projects.</p>
<h2>A changing skills environment</h2>
<p>Federal IT employees who spent much of their careers working on legacy systems are starting to retire, and their successors are younger people who came of age in an open source world and are comfortable with it.</p>
<p>About 81% of private sector hiring managers <a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OpenSourceJobsReport_2020_Final-1.pdf">surveyed</a> by the Linux Foundation said hiring open source talent is a priority and that they’re more likely than ever to seek out professionals with certifications. You can be sure the public sector is increasingly mirroring this trend as it recognizes a need for talent to support open source’s growing foothold.</p>
<h2>Stronger capabilities from vendors</h2>
<p>By partnering with the right commercial open source vendor, agencies can drive down infrastructure costs and more efficiently manage their applications. For example, vendors have made great strides in addressing security requirements laid out by policies such as the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/federal-information-security-modernization-act">Federal Security Security Modernization Act</a> (FISMA), <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/current-fips">Federal Information Processing Standards</a> (FIPS) and the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/">Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program</a> (FedRamp), making it easy to deal with compliance.</p>
<p>In addition, some vendors offer powerful infrastructure automation tools and generous support packages, so federal agencies don’t have to go it alone as they accelerate their open source strategies. Linux distributions like Ubuntu provide a consistent developer experience from laptop/workstation to the cloud, and at the edge, for public clouds, containers, and physical and virtual infrastructure.</p>
<p>This makes application development a well-supported activity that includes 24/7 phone and web support, which provides access to world-class enterprise support teams through web portals, knowledge bases or via phone.</p>
<h2>The pandemic effect</h2>
<p>Whether it’s accommodating more employees working from home or meeting higher citizen demand for online services, COVID-19 has forced large swaths of the federal government to up their digital game. Open source allows legacy applications to be moved to the cloud, new applications to be developed more quickly, and IT infrastructures to adapt to rapidly changing demands.</p>
<p>As these signs show, the federal government continues to move rapidly from talk to action in adopting open source.</p>
<p>Who wins? Everyone!</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> were joined by none other than TechCrunch&#8217;s own <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann Azevedo</a>, in her first-ever appearance on the show. She&#8217;s pretty much the best person and we&#8217;re <em>stoked</em> to have her on the pod.</p>
<p>And it was good that Mary Ann was on the show this week as she wrote about half the dang site. Which meant that we got to include all sorts of her work in the rundown. Here&#8217;s the agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding rounds from: Ramp, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">raised $300 million at a $3.9 billion valuation</a>; NoRedInk, which put together <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/noredink-raises-50-million-series-b-to-help-students-become-better-writers/">an impressive $50 million Series B</a>; and Playbook, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/playbook-which-aims-to-be-the-dropbox-for-designers-raises-4m-in-round-led-by-founders-fund/">building a sort of Dropbox for designers</a>. Each company gave us something different to noodle on, be it the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-and-brex-draw-diverging-market-plans-with-ma-strategy/">diverging strategies at Ramp and Brex</a>, how NoRedInk is different from Grammarly, and why Dropbox is not the Dropbox for designers.</li>
<li>Then we spun the globe to narrow our focus to Latin America, a booming startup scene that Mary Ann <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/">recently profiled for Extra Crunch</a>. In a nutshell, venture capital is helping drive an enormous wave of startup activity in the region &#8212; or perhaps a wave of startup activity is driving a boom in venture investment? &#8212; leading to huge companies, and perhaps some tech-powered inclusion of more folks into the modern banking and digital economy. (For more, here are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/as-its-startup-market-accelerates-brazil-could-be-in-for-an-ipo-bonanza/">notes on the Brazilian market&#8217;s rising exit tally</a>! And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/mexican-neobroker-flink-raises-57m-from-lightspeed-the-chainsmokers-to-boost-financial-inclusion-in-latam/">Flink raised</a>, which was worth chewing on as well.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>We quickly pivoted to the hot-button issue of the moment for every startup (and business): hiring. Natasha noted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/workstreams-text-based-recruitment-tool-gets-a-48m-bet-from-bond-and-beyond/">how startups used to focus on runway</a>, and now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/how-to-hire-is-the-new-how-to-conserve-runway/">they are looking to fill empty seats amid the great resignation. </a></li>
<li>Finally, we nattered about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bostons-startup-market-is-more-than-setting-records-in-scorching-start-to-year/">huge venture results from Boston</a>, big numbers from Austin and what increasingly feels like an everything bubble. Chicago is doing well, too. Pick a city, it&#8217;s putting up big numbers.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The buildout of 5G networks continues apace, with wide-scale deployments across much of the developed world. Yet, one of the largest challenges with closing the gaps in coverage maps are constraints on 5G transmissions. Because of the spectrum that 5G technology uses compared to 4G, telecom operators need to install many times more towers to deliver the advertised bandwidth with the same quality signal that users expect.</p>
<p>Installing cell towers is a daunting proposition though. An operator has to find exactly the right location in terms of line of sight to users, then make sure the location has power and internet access, and then negotiate a contract with the property owner to keep the tower there for a decade or more. Now repeat tens of thousands of times (and maybe even more).</p>
<p><a href="https://sitenna.com">Sitenna</a>, which will debut next week as part of Y Combinator’s Summer 2021 Demo Day, wants to radically speed up the process of selecting tower sites and securing contracts, creating a marketplace for landlords, tower operators and telcos alike.</p>
<p>Tower siting and access to poles have in some cases emerged as national infrastructure priorities. In the United States, the challenges around installing new towers — and new towers quickly — became a top priority of the FCC during the Trump administration, which <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-354326A1.pdf">launched a 5G FAST Plan</a> to try to ease regulations around tower installation.</p>
<p>Sitenna’s founders Daniel Campion and Brian Sexton saw an opportunity with such programs to help with the movement. Over the past year, they have built out what is essentially a marketplace that on one hand helps property owners figure out if they have an asset that’s worth investigating for telecom usage, and on the other, helps tower operators select and digitally sign deals for installation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195013" style="width: 515px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195013" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2195013" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Daniel-Campion.jpg?w=505" alt="" width="505" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Daniel-Campion.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Daniel-Campion.jpg?resize=111,150 111w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Daniel-Campion.jpg?resize=223,300 223w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Daniel-Campion.jpg?resize=505,680 505w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Daniel-Campion.jpg?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195013" class="wp-caption-text">Sitenna co-founder and CEO Daniel Campion. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sitenna</p></div></p>
<p>The company launched in the United Kingdom in June, and “it kind of resonated,” Campion said, noting that 65,000 real estate assets and roughly 15% of the towers in the U.K. are now on the platform. The company has kicked off two pilots with Vodafone and its tower provider <a href="https://www.cornerstone.network">Cornerstone</a>. He said the company intends to enter the U.S. market in the first quarter of next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the company is starting with a marketplace, like many startups today, it is also augmenting that marketplace with B2B SaaS tools. In its case, that means tools for telcos to manage the process of onboarding a new tower location and then managing the asset. “Once they find the site, they ping pong emails back and forth,” Campion said. “So we have built some tools to help them on their workflows.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195011" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195011" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2195011" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-screenshot.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="373" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-screenshot.png 1013w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-screenshot.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-screenshot.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-screenshot.png?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-screenshot.png?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-screenshot.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195011" class="wp-caption-text">Sitenna&#8217;s platform allows landlords and tower operators to inspect and transact tower locations. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sitenna</p></div></p>
<p>While there is definitely a large wave of tower installations underway now with the transition to 5G wireless, that wave doesn’t mean that tower installation will suddenly dry up in a few years. Campion notes that there is a “continual refresh of 15-20% on the carrier side” due to everything from changing usage patterns and building redevelopment to just standard hardware replacement.</p>
<p>And of course, there is always 6G, which while completely amorphous today, is a real thing that I get invites to conferences for. There’s always going to be a next generation of wireless, and Sitenna wants to become the center for managing that infrastructure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What a busy week in the world of media liquidity.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a sentence you don&#8217;t get to write often. Regardless, news broke this week that <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210826005451/en/Axel-Springer-to-Acquire-POLITICO">Axel Springer is buying U.S. political journalism outfit POLITICO</a>. The transaction was expected, but the eye-popping roughly $1 billion price tag still has tongues wagging. We even got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/politico-sells-forbes-spacs-and-vice-cuts/">on the podcast</a> to chat about it.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2021/08/26/forbes-to-become-public-company-through-business-combination-with-special-purpose-acquisition-company-magnum-opus/?sh=6995b05320eb">Forbes announced</a> that it is going public via a SPAC. The business publication&#8217;s news follows BuzzFeed&#8217;s journey to the public markets through a blank-check company. Hot media liquidity summer? Something like that.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>That TechCrunch is in the process of being sold to private equity, of course, is not something that we should forget. Shoutout to the Verizon bankers who found a way to get rid of us while also deleveraging Verizon&#8217;s debt profile. Ten points.</p>

Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/5-takeaways-from-buzzfeeds-spac-deck/">notes on BuzzFeed&#8217;s are here</a>, in case you want to run comparisons. This will be easy and fun. Perfect Friday morning fare. Into the data!</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s it worth?</h2>
<p>In corporate-speak, Forbes Global Media Holdings is merging with blank-check company Magnum Opus Acquisition Limited. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2021/08/26/forbes-to-become-public-company-through-business-combination-with-special-purpose-acquisition-company-magnum-opus/?sh=699c8090320e">transaction</a> will close either Q4 2021 or Q1 2022, Forbes estimates.</p>
<p>The deal itself is somewhat modest in scale compared with other SPAC deals we&#8217;ve recently looked into. Forbes reports that it will sport &#8220;an implied pro forma enterprise value of $630 million, net of tax benefits,&#8221; after its completion. Some $600 million in gross proceeds will be derived from Magnum Opus funds &#8220;and $400 million of additional capital through a private placement of ordinary shares of the combined company,&#8221; Forbes writes.</p>
<p>The company will sport an equity valuation of $830 million after the deal closes, per its own calculations. That number will change some depending on redemptions ahead of the combination. The gap between the large dollars going into the deal and the modest final valuation of the public Forbes entity is due to some $440 million in secondary transactions for existing Forbes shareholders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://stonehengelabs.tech/">Stonehenge Technology Labs</a> wants consumer packaged goods companies to gain meaningful use from all of the data they collect. It announced $2 million in seed funding for its STOPWATCH commerce enhancement software.</p>
<p>The round was led by Irish Angels, with participation from Bread and Butter Ventures, Gaingels, Angeles Investors, Bonfire Ventures and Red Tail Venture Capital.</p>
<p>CEO Meagan Kinmonth Bowman founded the Arkansas-based company in 2019 after working at Hallmark, where she was tasked with the digital transformation of the company.</p>
<p>“This was not a consequence of them not being good marketers or connected to mom, but they didn’t have the technology to connect their back end with retailers like Amazon, Walmart or Hobby Lobby,” she told TechCrunch. “There are so many smart people building products to connect with consumers. The challenge is the big guys are doing things the same way and not thinking like the 13-year-olds on social media that are actually winning the space.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mpMozU732l"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/end-to-end-operators-are-the-next-generation-of-consumer-business/">End-to-end operators are the next generation of consumer business</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;End-to-end operators are the next generation of consumer business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/end-to-end-operators-are-the-next-generation-of-consumer-business/embed/#?secret=mpMozU732l" data-secret="mpMozU732l" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Kinmonth Bowman and her team recognized that there was a missing middle layer connecting the world of dotcom with brick and mortar. If the middle layer could be applied to the enterprise resource plans and integrate public and private data feeds, a company could be just as profitable online as it could be in traditional retail, she said.</p>
<p>Stonehenge’s answer to that is STOPWATCH, which takes in over 100 million rows of data per workspace per day, analyzes the data points, adds real-time alerts and provides the right data to the right people at the right time.</p>
<p>Dan Rossignol, a B2B SaaS investor, said the CPG world is also about consumerizing our life, and the global pandemic showed that even at home, people could have a productive day and business. Rossignol likes to invest in underestimated founders and saw in Stonehenge a company that is getting CPGs out from underneath antiquated technologies.</p>
<p>“What Meagan and her team are doing is really interesting,” he added. “At this stage, it is all about the people, and the ability to bet on doing something larger.”</p>
<p>Kinmonth Bowman said she had the opportunity to base the company in Silicon Valley, but chose Bentonville, Arkansas instead to be closer to the more than 1,000 CPG companies based there that she felt were the prime customer base for STOPWATCH.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The platform was originally created as a subsidiary of a consulting company, but in 2018, one of their clients told them they just wanted the software rather than also paying for the consulting piece. The business was split, and Stonehenge went underground for eight months to make a software product specifically for the client.</p>
<p>Kinmonth Bowman admits the technology itself is not that sexy — it is using exact transfer loads to extract data from hundreds of systems into a “lake house,” and then siloing it by retailer and other factors and then presenting the data in different ways. For example, the CEO will want different metrics than product teams.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the company has doubled its revenue and also doubled the amount of contracts. It already counts multiple Fortune 100 companies and emerging brands as some of its early users and plans to use the new funding to hire a sales team and go after some strategic relationships.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1eTusqpaUm"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/checkout-is-the-key-to-frictionless-b2b-e-commerce/">Checkout is the key to frictionless B2B e-commerce</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Checkout is the key to frictionless B2B e-commerce&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/checkout-is-the-key-to-frictionless-b2b-e-commerce/embed/#?secret=1eTusqpaUm" data-secret="1eTusqpaUm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Stonehenge is also working on putting together a diverse workforce that mimics the users of the software, Kinmonth Bowman said. One of the challenges has been to get unique talent to move to Arkansas, but she said it is one she is eager to take on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Brett Brohl, managing partner at Bread and Butter Ventures, said the Stonehenge team “is just crazy enough, smart and driven” to build something great.</p>
<p>“All of the biggest companies have been around for a long time, but not a lot of large organizations have done a good job digitizing their businesses,” he said. “Even pre-COVID, they were building fill-in-the-blank digital transformations, but COVID accelerated technology and hit a lot of companies in the face. That was made more obvious to end consumers, which puts more pressure on companies to understand the need, which is good for STOPWATCH. It went from paper to Excel spreadsheets to the next cloud modification. The time is right for the next leap and how to use data.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company bills itself as an easy accounting platform for e-commerce businesses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As <a href="https://synder.com/">Synder</a>’s two co-founders Michael Astreiko and Ilya Kisel wrap up their time at Y Combinator, they also announced their seed round of $2 million from TMT Investments.</p>
<p>Though the round was acquired before going into the accelerator program, the Belarus-based pair wanted to wait to publicly share the milestone. As they focus their sights on their next journey of growth and expansion, the new funding will go toward attracting more clients, visibility and sales.</p>
<p>The company bills itself as an easy accounting platform for e-commerce businesses. It was originally founded as CloudBusiness in 2016 and developed accounting automation and management of business finances for small and mid-size businesses.</p>
<p>Astreiko and Kisel started Synder, in 2018 and a year later focused on the company full-time to develop an easy way for commerce companies to shift to omnichannel sales, something Astreiko told TechCrunch can be “a huge pain” due to the complexity of different payment systems and high fees.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of solutions on the market, but you still have to have special knowledge to operate within accounting or commerce,” Kisel said. “For us, the simplicity means that it is worth it if you can have access in several clicks to consolidated inventory, profits and liabilities. Small businesses sometimes are not sharing this information due to competition, but if something is working and easy, they will definitely share it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Synder does the heavy lifting for companies by connecting sales channels like Amazon, Shopify, eBay and Etsy into one platform that users can manage with one-click operations. It also created a way to help the accounting stream so that all of the different payment methods can still be used, Kisel said.</p>
<p>The company is already working with 4,000 clients, and will now be fast-tracking their expansion, but will need the right people on board to help the company grow, Astreiko said.</p>
<p>Igor Shoifot, a partner at TMT Investments, said he will join Synder’s board after the company graduates from YC. He likes the simplicity of what the company is doing.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Vsi66BMbxH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/embedded-procurement-will-make-every-company-its-own-marketplace/">Embedded procurement will make every company its own marketplace</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Embedded procurement will make every company its own marketplace&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/embedded-procurement-will-make-every-company-its-own-marketplace/embed/#?secret=Vsi66BMbxH" data-secret="Vsi66BMbxH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Often the best solutions are economical, succinct and elegant — you can be onboarded in 10 minutes,” he added. “There is really nobody that really provides a similar solution that was that easy or didn’t require downloading or installing something. I also like their focus on growth, the fact they have no burn and they are making money.”</p>
<p>Synder’s business model is a subscription SaaS model that starts off as a free trial, and users can purchase additional services inside the platform to fit small and large companies.</p>
<p>Its more than 15 employees are spread around Europe, and the company just started hiring in the areas of marketing and sales in the U.S.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Buoyant says its hybrid design solves the notoriously difficult problem of dropping off cargo – difficult because as airships offload weight, they risk shooting back up into the air.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of companies have emerged in recent years aiming to resurrect the airship, an early technology that was abandoned in favor of airplanes and helicopters.</p>
<p>Flying Whales in France, Hybrid Air Vehicles in the U.K., Lockheed Martin and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/sergey-brins-airship-will-use-worlds-biggest-mobile-hydrogen-fuel-cell/">billionaire Sergey Brin</a> all have airship projects in development, particularly focused on carrying cargo. None have yet started servicing customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.buoyant.aero/">Buoyant</a> wants to be the first.</p>
<p>The startup graduated from Y Combinator this year with the goal of building small unmanned airships to move middle-mile cargo. Think depot-to-depot delivery, rather than depot-to-home. The two founders, Ben Claman and Joe Figura, say they can cut the cost of delivery in half, relative to flights performed by small planes or helicopters. And they say they’ll succeed where others have stalled by staying small &#8212; instead of building massive, multi-hundred-foot airships that need a lot of capital to build and a lot of gas to lift, Buoyant’s final vehicle will only be around 60 feet long.</p>
<p>Claman and Figura are two MIT hardware engineers who cut their teeth building spacecraft and antennas. Both had worked on projects with previous employers that involved providing low-cost connectivity to remote places, like Alaska (Claman also grew up there).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194696" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194696" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2194696" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSCF1093.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="769" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSCF1093.jpg 5328w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSCF1093.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSCF1093.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSCF1093.jpg?resize=768,577 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSCF1093.jpg?resize=680,511 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSCF1093.jpg?resize=1536,1153 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSCF1093.jpg?resize=2048,1538 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSCF1093.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194696" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Buoyant. Buoyant founders Joe Figura and Ben Claman.</p></div></p>
<p>“What [Joe and I] were talking about when we were working at these companies was how hard it is to get actual goods to these places, not just the internet,” Claman said. “In these places, people are shopping online, they’re getting things sent to them. They sometimes have to wait weeks or months for them to arrive.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Claman added when the company started YC, they had imagined building an airship that’s closer to their existing prototype &#8212; a small craft capable of doing last-mile deliveries for Amazon, for example.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve talked to a bunch of companies, and it seemed like from talking to them, that rural middle-mile is a much bigger problem than rural last-mile. Let’s say you have 5,000 people living in a community, you can basically subcontract the postal service to one of those people to do the last-mile delivery. … But getting the parcels from your main hub to that place is actually really challenging and really, really expensive.”</p>
<p>To solve that problem, Buoyant developed a “hybrid” battery electric airship, meaning that it generates around 70% of its lift using lighter-than-air gas &#8212; in this case, helium. The remaining 30% of the lift comes from its tilt-rotor architecture. This hybrid design is what Buoyant says solves the notoriously difficult problem of dropping off cargo – difficult because as airships offload weight, they risk shooting back up into the air. The tilt-rotor allows the airship to operate closer to a helicopter during takeoff and landing.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEYOfVcwRhk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>But where helicopters need to be capable of lifting their weight &#8212; anywhere from 1,500 to 10,000 pounds of carbon fiber and stainless steel &#8212; Buoyant’s airship will only need to lift the weight of the payload itself and its airframe. Not only do Buoyant&#8217;s founders say this saves on capital costs, but they&#8217;re developing the ship to eventually run autonomously, so the company won’t have to use pilots.</p>
<p>Buoyant has built and flown four prototype airships. The most recent sub-scale ship that went to air is 20 feet long, with airspeeds of up to 35 miles per hour and a payload capacity of 10 pounds, but the ultimate aim is to build an airship that’s capable of delivering up to 650 pounds of cargo at a cruise speed of around 60 miles per hour.</p>
<p>The airship has been operating under a Part 107 license. Before the company can start serving customers, it will need to achieve two certifications: a type certification verifying the airworthiness of the craft and operator certifications for the groups flying them. “Both require a lot of flight hours, which will be our main development activity,” Figura said on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28278515">HackerNews</a>.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company is planning to continue iterating its flight control system and doing a field demo with the sub-scale prototype in the coming months. Buoyant wants to build a full-scale version next year, which Claman said they will likely manufacture in-house.</p>
<p>These next few steps will be crucial for Buoyant to turn letters of intent worth $5 million that it has signed with several potential customers —  including from an Alaskan regional air carrier — into official contracts.</p>
<p>Buoyant also has two pilot programs in the pipeline: one with the sub-scale prototype this fall, and the second with the full-scale ship in a year&#8217;s time, both with logistics/parcel delivery companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;People were building blimps before computers, people were building blimps before they really understood aerodynamics, so we have some advantage there on just the length of time that people have been building airships,&#8221; Claman added. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of data out there. It&#8217;s not like airship development has stopped. People have been developing airships continuously, basically, over 100 years.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://a16z.com/">Andreessen Horowitz</a> has begun to announce new funds almost as routinely as some startups have begun announcing follow-on rounds. After announcing a third biotech fund in February 2020 that&#8217;s currently investing <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/02/04/bio-fund-iii-announcement/">$750 million</a>, a pair of new funds totaling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/a16z-is-now-managing-16-5-billion-after-announcing-two-new-funds/">$4.5 billion</a> last November and, most recently, a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">$2.2 billion</a> crypto-focused fund, the firm is rolling out a brand new fund: a $400 million vehicle that is focused expressly on backing seed-stage companies.</p>
<p>In the broader historical context of the firm, it&#8217;s an interesting development. Many years ago, Andreessen Horowitz walked away from writing seed checks to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest &#8212; even while the firm didn&#8217;t have a conflict policy around nascent deals. As Marc Andreessen <a href="http://www.strictlyvc.com/2013/10/20/andreessen-horowitz-backs-seed-investing/">explained it in 2013</a>, there is often too much uncertainty at the earliest stages of company formation, and though the firm conveyed this thinking to founders, they didn&#8217;t always listen, and bets that evolved to be similar made them feel bad and caused problems.</p>
<p>Of course, things changed over time, competition is competition and, before long, the firm was again writing checks to very young startups. In fact, today, not only have seed-stage investments again become very much part of the program, but since the beginning of 2020, about half the firm&#8217;s investments have been in seed companies, according to a16z. Indeed, General Partner Martin Casado said yesterday that the new fund is largely about optimizing its processes around seed deals, and ensuring investors are rewarded properly for the associated risk. Here&#8217;s some of that conversation, edited lightly for length.</p>

<p><strong>TC: You say this seed fund doesn&#8217;t change anything about your investment strategy, that it&#8217;s more about putting a formal structure around these deals. So we won&#8217;t necessarily see even more seed-stage deals out of Andreessen Horowitz?</strong></p>
<p>MC: Well what&#8217;s interesting is the entire industry has picked up the pace dramatically in the last three years. I think the industry has doubled the number of seed funds, and we&#8217;ve kept pace with the industry. The seed investments from Andreessen Horowitz have gone up dramatically in the last three years in response to the industry. That we have a separate seed fund doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re going to pick up the pace [further still].</p>
<p><strong>TC: How might formalizing this new fund impact your relationship with other seed-stage firms?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MC: We work closely with seed funds and we plan to continue to do so. I do think the environment has become more and more competitive at the seed stage, and if you actually look at some seed [stage startups] that I have personally been involved with, [they&#8217;ve received] term sheets from hedge funds, growth funds &#8212; all the way down to angel investors. Everybody is in the mix at the seed stage. I think this is an evolution of the industry rather than kind of a key shift.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who will be making these seed investments at a16z? Is there a team that will be primarily managing the fund?</strong></p>
<p>MC: We do not have seed-specific investors [investing this new capital]. If we do Series A and Series B deals, it&#8217;s the same set of investors.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Andreessen Horowitz has used scouts in the past. Is that true currently and if so, what percentage of your seed-stage deals come from them?</strong></p>
<p>MC: Yes, we use scouts, but they are responsible for zero percent of our seed-stage deals. That&#8217;s an independent function where they can put small dollars in deals of their choosing, but those, to us, aren&#8217;t seed [deals]. Seeds to us are $1 million to $4 million led by an investor at the firm where we get real ownership and have real involvement.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So these scouts are really just founders and operators who Andreessen Horowitz wants in its ecosystem?</strong></p>
<p>MC: The scouts serves two functions. We get to develop a relationship with key people and key influencers, whether they&#8217;re entrepreneurs or they&#8217;re going to be entrepreneurs. It also gives us access to interesting deal flow to see what activity is happening now and kind of draft off that judgment.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You mention $1 million to $4 million checks.  What constitutes a seed investment, in a16z&#8217;s view?</strong></p>
<p>MC: Typically, for us, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s $6 million &#8212; these aren&#8217;t hard and fast rules &#8212; and we typically don&#8217;t take board seats.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And you look to own how much with that first check?</strong></p>
<p>MC: We don&#8217;t have target ownership, really. It all depends on the market dynamics; we tend to respond to the market.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You mention that it&#8217;s gotten very competitive, seed-stage investing. Do you prefer to go it alone or work with a syndicate or investors?</strong></p>
<p>MC: Personally, I love working with other seed funds. We absolutely do not have any sort of internal rules or biases one way or the other on this. I think independent GPs have independent views on this. For myself, I love it because there are great seed funds out there that I love splitting deals with or sharing deals with that we then work on together.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And you want to see what, exactly? How early is too early for the firm to invest?</strong></p>
<p>M: If we know the space very, very well, meaning we&#8217;ve done the work in the space and we have a deal partner like myself [who is] particularly expert in a space, it can be just a person and an idea, because we believe that we understand the market. We&#8217;ve invested in solo founders before their company existed.</p>
<p>If we don&#8217;t understand the space very well, we&#8217;d like to see kind of some maturity in the company, maybe some early customer traction, maybe some early product work, maybe an early demo, because that way we&#8217;ll have a better sense of the market. So I would say the maturity of the actual company we invest in is inversely correlated with our knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s the decision-making process look like? I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s different when you&#8217;re writing a $6 million check versus a check that&#8217;s many times bigger than that.</strong></p>
<p>MC: Yeah, the amount of work and scrutiny that we do for seed tends to be less than for a Series A. The number of people involved is less. And because we&#8217;re not taking a board seat, the firm&#8217;s [time] commitment is a bit less. So it just tends to be a lighter-weight process. Typically, we have at least two GPs take a look [whereas] if we&#8217;re doing an A and above, you want to kind of have everybody in the vertical be involved, and then, for the larger checks, everybody in the fund [is involved].</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are some of the firm&#8217;s most successful seed investments?</strong></p>
<p>MC: We&#8217;ve had some great ones. Slack was first money. Databricks was first money. I believe we had a seed check in Coinbase.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Enterprises use Zeal to pay large volumes of workers and keep payment data on their own native systems.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Embedded fintech company <a href="https://www.zeal.com/">Zeal</a> secured $13 million in Series A funding to continue developing its platform for building individualized payroll products.</p>
<p>Spark Capital led the Series A, with participation from Commerce Ventures and a group of individual investors, including Marqeta CEO Jason Gardner and CRO Omri Dahan, Robinhood founder Vlad Tenev, UltimateSoftware executives Mitch Dauerman and Bob Manne and Namely founder Matt Straz. The latest round now gives the company $14.6 million in total funding, which includes a $1.6 million seed round in 2020, CEO Kirti Shenoy told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The Bay Area company’s origin was as Puzzl, a payment processing startup for the gig economy, founded in 2018 by Shenoy and CTO Pranab Krishnan. It was part of Y Combinator’s 2019 cohort. The pair had to pivot the company after needing to move some of its thousands of 1099 contractors to W2 employee status.</p>
<p>They went looking for payroll processors that could handle high volumes of payroll automatically, like ADP or Paycor, but found they didn’t match some of the capabilities Shenoy and Krishnan wanted, including to pay workers daily and customize earning components.</p>
<p>To ensure other companies didn’t run into the same problem, they decided to build a payroll API that enables their customers to build their own payroll products, even being able to pay their workers everyday. Traditionally, companies would layer together antiquated third-party payroll tools and spend millions of dollars on consulting fees. Zeal’s API tool modernizes the payroll process and takes on the payroll liability while managing the back-end payment logistics, Shenoy said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, enterprises use Zeal to pay large volumes of workers and keep payment data on their own native systems, while software platforms that sell business-to-business services use Zeal to build their own payroll product to sell to their customers.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to touch every American paycheck with our tax and payment technology, ensuring that American employees are paid correctly and efficiently,” Krishnan said.</p>
<p>And that is a complex goal: there are 200 million American employees, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cew/publications/employment-and-wages-annual-averages/current/home.htm">over $8.8 trillion of payroll is processed annually</a> in the U.S. and the country’s 11,000 tax jurisdictions produce over 25,000 income tax code changes a year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shenoy cited IRS data that showed more than 40% of small and medium businesses pay at least one payroll penalty per year. That was one of the drivers for Zeal’s latest product, the <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/abacus-3">Abacus</a> gross-to-net calculator, which payroll companies can use to ensure they are compliant in paying their income taxes.</p>
<p>The co-founders intend to use the new funding to build out their team and strengthen compliance measures to ensure its track record with enterprises.</p>
<p>“We are starting to win more enterprise deals and moving millions of dollars each day,” Shenoy said. “This has been a legacy space for so long, so companies want to work with a provider to move fast.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Embedded procurement will make every company its own marketplace&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/embedded-procurement-will-make-every-company-its-own-marketplace/embed/#?secret=VGitlAgZzN" data-secret="VGitlAgZzN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Shenoy predicts that more companies will shift to hyper-customized experiences in the next five to 10 years. Whereas the default was a company like ADP, companies will want to control their own data and build products so their customers can do everything payroll-related from one platform.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Spark Capital’s partner Natalie Sandman has joined Zeal’s board of directors. The firm previously invested in other embedded fintech companies like Affirm and Marqeta, and she thinks there are new experiences in the sector that APIs can unlock.</p>
<p>Sandman felt the payroll-building pain points herself when she worked at Zenefits. At the time, the company was trying to do the same thing, but there were no APIs to connect with. There were all of these spreadsheets to transfer data, but one wrong deduction would trickle down and cause a tax penalty.</p>
<p>Shenoy and Krishnan are both “customer-obsessed,” she said, and are balancing speed with thoughtfulness when it comes to understanding how their customers want to build payroll products.</p>
<p>She is seeing a macro shift to audience-driven human resources where bringing new employees online will mean embedding them into products that will be more valuable versus the traditional spreadsheet.</p>
<p>“To me, it is a no-brainer that APIs provide flexibility in the way wages and deductions need to be made,” Sandman said. “You can lose trust in your employer. Payroll is at the deepest trust point and where you want transparency and a robust solution to solve that need.”</p>
