										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Video sharing platforms that offer a service in the UK have to comply with new regulations intended to protect users and under 18s from harmful content such as hate speech and videos/ads likely to incite violence again protected groups.</p>
<p>Ofcom, the country&#8217;s comms, broadcast and &#8212; in an expanding role &#8212; Internet content regulator, has published the <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/226301/statement-vsp-harms-guidance.pdf">guidance</a> for platforms like TikTok, Snapchat, Vimeo and Twitch today.</p>
<p>Among the requirements for in-scope services are that they must take &#8220;appropriate measures&#8221; to protect users from harmful material.</p>
<p>Terrorist content, child sexual abuse material, racism and xenophobia also fall under the &#8216;harmful content&#8217; bracket.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/news-centre/2021/better-protections-from-harmful-online-videos">press release</a> the regulator said its <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/216492/yonder-report-experience-of-potential-harms-vsps.pdf">research</a> shows that a third of UK Internet users say they have witnessed or experienced hateful content; a quarter claim they’ve been exposed to violent or disturbing content; while one in five have been exposed to videos or content that encouraged racism.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HMm60o2Rs6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code/">UK now expects compliance with children&#8217;s privacy design code</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK now expects compliance with children&#8217;s privacy design code&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code/embed/#?secret=HMm60o2Rs6" data-secret="HMm60o2Rs6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There is no prescriptive list of what measures video sharing platforms must use to prevent users being exposed to such content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But there are a number of recommendations &#8212; such as clauses in terms and conditions; functionality like the ability for uploaders to declare if their content contains an ad; and user-friendly mechanisms for viewers to report or flag harmful content, as well as transparent complaints procedures.</p>
<p>Age assurance systems are also recommended, as are the inclusion of parental controls &#8212; as the regulation has the specific aim of protecting under-18s from viewing videos and adverts containing restricted material.</p>
<p>Ofcom is also recommending &#8220;robust&#8221; age-verification for video-sharing platforms that host pornography in order to prevent under 18s from viewing adult material.</p>
<p>A list of video sharing platforms that have notified themselves to Ofcom as under scope of the regulations can be <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/information-for-industry/vsp-regulation/notified-video-sharing-platforms">found here</a>. (As well as the aforementioned platform giants it also includes the likes of OnlyFans, Triller and Recast.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We are recommending providers put in place systematic risk management processes to help providers to identify and implement measures that are practicable and proportionate,&#8221; Ofcom goes on to say in the guidance to video sharing platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we acknowledge that harmful material may not be completely eradicated from a platform, we expect providers to make meaningful efforts to prevent users from encountering it,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The VSP [aka video sharing platform] Regime is about platform’s safety systems and processes, not about regulating individual videos, however evidence of a prevalence of harmful material on a platform may require closer scrutiny.&#8221;</p>
<p>The regulator says it will want to understand measures platforms have in place, as well as their effectiveness at protecting users &#8212; and &#8220;any processes which have informed a provider’s decisions about which protection measures to use&#8221;. So platforms will need to document and be able to justify their decisions if the regulator comes calling, such as following a complaint.</p>
<p>Monitoring tech platforms&#8217; compliance with the new requirements will be a key new Ofcom role &#8212; and a taster of what is to come under incoming and far more broad-brush safety-focused digital regulations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Along with engagement with providers themselves, we expect to inform our understanding of whether users are being effectively protected, for example by monitoring complaints and engaging with interested parties such as charities, NGOs and tech safety groups,&#8221; Ofcom also writes, adding that this engagement will play an important part in supporting its decisions about &#8220;areas of focus&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ofcom&#8217;s role as an Internet content regulator will be fleshed out in the coming years as the government works to pass legislation that will impose a wide-ranging duty of care on digital service providers of all stripes, instructing them to handle user-generated content in a way that prevents people &#8212; and especially children &#8212; from being exposed to illegal and/or harmful stuff.</p>
<p>A key appointment &#8212; the chair of Ofcom &#8212; has been delayed as the government decided to rerun the competition for the role.</p>
<p>Reports have suggested the government wants the former editor of the Daily Mail to take the post but an independent panel involved in the initial selection process <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-57280438">rejected Paul Dacre as an unsuitable candidate</a> earlier this year. (It is unclear whether the government will continue to try to parachute Dacre into the job.)</p>
<p>Ofcom, meanwhile, has been regulating video on-demand services in the UK since 2010.</p>
<p>But the video-sharing framework is a separate regulatory instrument that&#8217;s intended to respond to differences in the level of control as video-sharing platforms provide tools to allow users to upload their own content.</p>
<p>However this newer framework is set to be superseded by new legislation under the incoming online safety regulatory framework.</p>
<p>So these regulations for video sharing platforms are something of a placeholder and a taster as UK lawmakers grapple with laying down more comprehensive online safety rules which will apply much more widely.</p>
<p>Still, in the guidance Ofcom describes the VSP Regime as &#8220;an important precursor to the future Online Safety legislation&#8221;, adding:  &#8220;Given the two regimes’ shared objective to improve user safety by requiring services to protect users through the adoption of appropriate systems and processes, Ofcom considers that compliance with the VSP regime will assist services in preparing for compliance with the online safety regime as described by Government in the draft Online Safety Bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s data protection regulation is also already enforcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code/">a set of &#8216;age appropriate&#8217; design requirements</a> for digital services that are likely to be accessed by children.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Move over, precision agriculture — precision <em>apiculture</em> is what&#8217;s on the minds of all future-focused farmers. BeeHero has been growing fast since its debut and seed round last year, and $19M in new funding means it can scale beyond its initial markets and find more uses for its one-of-a-kind collection of data collected from thousands of active honeybee hives.</p>
<p>The company empowers hives with IoT tech, making it possible to track the movements and health of their bees practically in real time and catch things like mite infestations before they go too far. The result is huge improvements to crop yields, healthier hives, and less trips in the tractor. The ordinary method of placing hives and then driving out to check on them every few weeks is slow and inefficient; a hive may have collapsed during that time, or is pollinating ineffectively, condemning acres of fields to an unproductive season.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way pollination is handled today is challenging,&#8221; BeeHero CEO and co-founder Omer Davidi said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a shortage of hives; you get a box, you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s inside, you just hope for the best. This is not an effective way to strategize your pollination. You need to understand the stressors, the variety of inputs and outputs&#8230; but to do this with older, less data intensive industries is hard.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212826" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212826" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2212826" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg" alt="Beehives illustrated with labels describing problems they might be facing, like mites." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212826" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BeeHero</p></div></p>
<p>Despite the challenges of essentially launching during the initial panicked months of the pandemic, Davidi said that their traction was remarkable once they figured out how to make that connection with farmers, many of whom are slowly but surely adopting modern solutions. They&#8217;re skeptical of the benefits and understandably suspect startup founders offering quick solutions (via video calls and virtual demos, no less) of being charlatans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Originally I said, guys, we have to tell everyone we&#8217;ve increased sunflowers or cashews by a hundred percent! But you have to be careful. They&#8217;ve been doing this the same way for generations. When you come out of nowhere saying &#8216;I&#8217;ve figured it all out,&#8217; you lose credibility immediately,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;So we had to under-promise and over-deliver, and it pushed us to build a lower touch onboarding process. Then once they see the results, they want to do it year after year.&#8221;</p>
<p>The work has paid off, however, and BeeHero is now working with several of the top almond growers in California, which dominates the production of that crop globally. By the end of the year it expects to manage 100,000 hives and be the biggest pollination provider in the U.S. (they&#8217;re currently the fourth largest).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212825" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212825" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2212825" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg" alt="The BeeHero app on a smartphone showing hive health metrics." width="1024" height="673" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg 1929w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg?resize=1536,1009 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212825" class="wp-caption-text">The BeeHero app on a smartphone showing hive health metrics.</p></div></p>
<p>The $15M A round comes from ADM Capital, Rabo Food and Agri Innovation Fund, iAngels, FirstTime, J-Ventures, UpWest, Entrée Capital, Good Company, the Arison Group, and Gaingels. The company has also won $4M in grants from the European Commission, the BIRD Foundation, and the Israel Innovation Authority.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The primary goal of the raise is to expand beyond the U.S. and almonds. The plan is to expand first to berries, avocados, and apples, then to crops like sunflower and soybeans. Even greenhouse crops like tomatoes might be possible. Australia and Europe are both on the list, but it depends on partnerships and other factors, though at least the money&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>Davidi is hoping that the growing bee activity database will prove an invaluable resource in other ways, though he was realistic about the stage they&#8217;re in.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a data scientist, I can tell you: we know nothing,&#8221; he admitted. But &#8220;we&#8221; means the industry in general, and BeeHero is building by far the largest collection of bee-adjacent data out there. Knowing how hives and pollination react to different weather patterns, crops and planting styles, pesticides, invasive species (they&#8217;re watching for murder hornets) and a dozen other factors would be tremendously valuable and the company&#8217;s work is only beginning.</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo embed breakout embed--video" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/431706289" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;For instance, we&#8217;re only just learning this, but bees know about rainfall 30 minutes before it happens,&#8221; Davidi said. Why? How? They have guesses, but whatever the case, it could be a useful data point for farmers — and probably for apiculture generally.</p>
<p>Research partnerships with the World Bee Project and Japan&#8217;s Ministry of Culture, among others in the academic sphere and beyond, show that there is untapped potential in this trove of data. With pollination so important to maintaining the world&#8217;s food supply and bees subject to an increasing number of threats, we&#8217;ll take any insights we can get.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s rare that I find common ground with the head of Instagram, but he is right about this point. Kids and tweens need access to technology that meets their unique needs.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s just dead wrong about the solution.</p>
<p>Instagram Kids is a terrible idea, and, thankfully, plans for the pint-size version of the app have been put on hold. This development comes on the heels of yet another controversy — this one about the effects Instagram has on young people&#8217;s mental health. Instagram’s internal research suggests that the platform can be a toxic place for teens.</p>

	</p>
<p>As a father and the founder of a tech company for kids, I always felt that platforms built on social validation, comparison and FOMO weren&#8217;t appropriate for younger users. And even though Facebook claimed in public that their research suggested a net-positive effect on mental health, behind closed doors, they had evidence that might not be the case.</p>
<p>Despite all this, I know that healthy technology for kids does exist. It&#8217;s possible for companies to build platforms that better support parents, kids and tweens — but it can&#8217;t be done by moving fast and breaking things.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Kids are growing up connected</h2>
<p>Technology is an ever-present part of our lives and the lives of our children. According to <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/the-common-sense-census-media-use-by-kids-age-zero-to-eight-2020">Common Sense Media&#8217;s 2020 census</a> on media use, kids from birth to age 8 have almost two and a half hours of screen time daily.</p>
<p>And that was <em>before</em> COVID-19 shuttered schools and made playdates impossible. Kids have turned to screens for remote learning, entertainment, and socializing with friends and family, and many parents will tell you that this increased screen time is a serious source of anxiety.</p>
<p>I believe that lots of parents inherently see the value in technology, especially when it&#8217;s been a lifeline keeping us connected during a pandemic. But there&#8217;s ambivalence baked in here since there&#8217;s a serious dearth of high-quality, safe environments for kids online. As a result, families turn to platforms that were never designed to meet the needs of children, often at the cost of their peace of mind.</p>
<h2>Retrofitting adult platforms isn&#8217;t the answer</h2>
<p>When you think of popular kids&#8217; apps, what comes to mind? Facebook Messenger Kids? YouTube Kids? These platforms all have something in common: They&#8217;re repackaged versions of adult apps, and they&#8217;ve had safety- and privacy-related scandals. That&#8217;s because adult apps simply don&#8217;t retrofit well for children. There are a few different reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, a lot of adult platforms are designed to be sticky. This is reflected in features like endless feeds, auto-playing content and arbitrary &#8220;streaks.&#8221;</p>
<p>These apps also have a way of using our own psychology against us to keep us scrolling. They exploit our need to belong by quantifying social validation. Because of follower counts, like buttons, comments and shares, we can see exactly how popular we are — and we can compare our metrics to others. Many adults can find these features anxiety inducing, and I don&#8217;t believe they belong in platforms designed for young users with brains that are still developing. They show up again and again in retrofitted apps for children because they&#8217;re at the core of these products.</p>
<p>Second, many tech platforms are wide-open networks. This is not the one-way media that we grew up with. Lots of social and gaming platforms encourage users to amass friends and followers and exchange messages and comments, which can pose serious safety risks for young, inexperienced internet users.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.thorn.org/thorn-research-minors-perspectives-on-disclosing-reporting-and-blocking/">report from Thorn</a> found that scores of children are using adult platforms before they turn 13, and a startling majority of them encounter &#8220;abuse, harassment or sexual solicitation from adults.&#8221;</p>
<p>When companies try to retrofit platforms for kids that eliminate the stranger danger, they&#8217;ve had varied success. Facebook Messenger Kids infamously included a design flaw that allowed children to connect and chat with strangers. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s really difficult to take an open network and work backward to lock it up. When it comes to safety, you really need to start from the ground up.</p>
<p>Finally, retrofitted platforms rarely appeal to kids the same way that their adult counterparts do. Ask any parent: Kids love YouTube. Not so much with YouTube Kids. Children are always in a hurry to grow up. They want to feel empowered, and mini versions of adult apps do the opposite. It&#8217;s the technical version of the kids&#8217; table, so getting buy-in from young users can be a struggle.</p>
<h2>Parental controls can only take you so far</h2>
<p>With all the dangers that exist out there for children online, you might think that parental controls are the obvious answer. That&#8217;s clearly what Facebook is thinking with their plans for Instagram Kids. But if you ask me, no parental control in the world will stop kids from comparing themselves to others. Again, it&#8217;s inherent to the platform.</p>
<p>Parental controls also won&#8217;t stop kids from finding creative workarounds. Children are resourceful when they want to circumvent screen time limits. They&#8217;re often just tiny, motivated hackers. With all that in mind, the best thing parents can do is get involved — like, really involved — with their kids&#8217; digital lives.</p>
<h2>Build a foundation with parental involvement and co-play</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever googled &#8220;screen time recommendations,&#8221; you already know that experts in digital parenting rarely agree on anything. But one thing we hear consistently is that parents need to be involved in their kids&#8217; digital lives.</p>
<p>We need to explore and play together. This gives us the chance to model appropriate behaviors for children and educate them about the big, bad online world. It&#8217;s also a lovely way to spend quality time with your kids. Ask them about the games they like. Get them to teach you how they work. Dedicate one night a week to enjoy screen time together.</p>
<p>When tech companies sell parental controls as the ultimate answer for kids&#8217; apps, they&#8217;re doing us a disservice. Rules and restrictions are obviously important, but what we truly need are opportunities to use technology together with our kids. We need apps that the whole family can enjoy together — not just where parents can toggle a switch, set a limit and leave.</p>
<p>We need to think beyond parental controls if we want to help children develop healthy relationships with technology. We need to talk to them about social validation. We need to make sure they understand their digital footprints. And we need to help them understand what motivates Big Tech companies.</p>
<p>A junior version of Instagram won&#8217;t make the internet a better place for kids or parents. It&#8217;ll just hook &#8217;em young — which is something Facebook is clearly motivated to do.</p>
<p>Thankfully, plans for the new platform have been paused, but I sincerely hope they abandon it altogether. Facebook has a questionable track record, and it’s probably not the right company to develop products for children. And Instagram is definitely the wrong template.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new proposed law would compel businesses in the U.S. to disclose any ransomware payments within 48 hours of the transaction.</p>
<p>The bicameral <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-and-ross-introduce-bill-to-require-disclosures-of-ransomware-payments">Ransom Disclosure Act</a>, drafted by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Deborah Ross, would mandate companies and organizations — though not individuals — to provide the U.S. Department of Homeland Security data on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> payments, including the amount and type of cryptocurrency demanded and the sum that was paid.</p>
<p>The bill aims to bolster the U.S. government&#8217;s understanding of how cybercriminal enterprises operate and help officials develop a fuller picture of the ransomware threat. While ransom payments are typically made in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bitcoin/">bitcoin</a>, security experts say threat actors are increasingly moving towards &#8220;privacy coins,&#8221; such as Monero, which make it harder for investigators to trace where the money goes.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The Ransom Disclosure Act would also require Homeland Security to set up a website for organizations to voluntarily report payment of ransoms, as well as to share information disclosed during the previous year, excluding identifying information about the entities that paid up. Similar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/this-crowdsourced-payments-tracker-wants-to-solve-the-ransomware-visibility-problem/">efforts by security researchers already exist</a>.</p>
<p>Warren says these measures are needed due to the “skyrocketing” number of ransomware attacks; attacks rose by 158% in North America last year, and <a href="http://ct.symplicity.com/t/wrn/074b653b76f3ff9a6a5455e38def601a/4262265609/realurl=https:/www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/heres-how-much-ransomware-attacks-are-costing-the-american-economy.html">victims worldwide paid nearly $350 million</a> in ransom  – a more than 300% increase over 2019, data shows. What&#8217;s more, recent research found that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/ransomware-recovery-can-be-costly-and-not-just-because-of-the-ransom/">ransom payments account for just 20% of the total cost of a ransomware attack</a>, with businesses suffering the majority of their losses through lost productivity and post-attack recovery.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We lack critical data to go after cybercriminals,&#8221; said Warren. &#8220;My bill with [Representative] Ross would set disclosure requirements when ransoms are paid and allow us to learn how much money cybercriminals are siphoning from American entities to finance criminal enterprises &#8212; and help us go after them.&#8221;</p>
<p>It’s not the only tactic the U.S. is employing in a bid to crackdown on ransomware.</p>
<p>Last month, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/us-treasury-sanctions-suex-ransomware/">the Treasury Department issued first of its kind sanctions against cryptocurrency exchange Suex</a> for its role in facilitating ransom payments after finding that over 40% of its total transactions were associated with bad activity. The Treasury also recently warned American companies that they are prohibited from paying threat actors based in countries subject to U.S. sanctions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There are still founders in Latin America that are not benefiting from the funding boom, which implies that there is more capacity to absorb capital there than is currently being taken advantage of.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regions once overlooked by the venture capital industry are racking up impressive investment totals in recent quarters. African startups, for example, were long ignored by the global VC scene, with totals for the continent’s upstart technology companies representing a fraction of a fraction of the funds made available to other regions’ next-generation companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in recent years, investment into African tech companies has surged, and just today, investment company Juven </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/goldman-sachs-spinoff-juven-to-back-african-tech-companies-with-large-checks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced plans to boost its investments in the continent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-sets-up-50m-fund-to-invest-in-african-startups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google set aside $50 million to do the same</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin America’s startup scene is similar to Africa’s in terms of attracting outside interest, but a few years further down the road. Reporting that SoftBank </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/softbank-commits-3b-more-to-investing-in-latin-american-tech-companies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will put another $3 billion in the area’s startups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was news, sure, but not a shocking announcement last month. The Japanese conglomerate and investing powerhouse had already put $5 billion to work in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of Q3 numbers that will update our thinking about the current state of the Latin American startup market, we wanted to dive into the structural forces in the region to better understand the impending numbers. So, The Exchange reached out to investors in Latin America for a little behind-the-numbers digging. We got a hold of Magma’s </span><a href="https://twitter.com/nathanlustig"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nathan Lustig</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Atlantico’s </span><a href="https://twitter.com/JulioCV"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julio Vasconcellos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and ALLVP’s </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Antorojase"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antonia Rojas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to flesh out our thinking.</span></p>

Let’s go!</span></p>
<h2>What is driving the money?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin America boasts 26 unicorns as of August, according to </span><a href="https://www.atlantico.vc/latin-america-digital-transformation-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlantico&#8217;s 2021 digital transformation report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a must-read that serves as a backdrop for today&#8217;s piece. As Vasconcellos clarified for us via email, the number reflects the fact that eight new unicorns were minted in 2021. For comparison, there were only four unicorns in the region in 2018 &#8212; and it wasn&#8217;t necessarily obvious at the time that several Latin American companies would go on to list their shares publicly, both in the U.S. (VTEX, dLocal) and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/as-its-startup-market-accelerates-brazil-could-be-in-for-an-ipo-bonanza/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Brazil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another interesting data point is that the cumulative market cap of Latin American unicorns has already more than doubled. According to Atlantico, their total post-money valuation went from $46 billion in 2020 to $105 billion as of August 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is also reflected in funding tallies: Per </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/crunchbase-unicorn-board-1000-companies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, venture capital funding into the region&#8217;s unicorns reached $10 billion this year to date. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/marceloclaure/status/1445373440006017024"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commenting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the data, SoftBank Group International CEO and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/latin-america-finds-a-champion-in-softbank-international-group-ceo-marcelo-claure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin America champion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Marcelo Claure wrote that &#8220;it ratifies the potential of Latin America and the incredible effect that the SoftBank Latin America fund has had in the region.&#8221; And there&#8217;s more to come: During TechCrunch Disrupt, Claure said that SoftBank can be expected to deploy between $8 billion to $10 billion of capital into Latin America in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps even more interestingly, unicorns are driving a self-reinforcing trend, ALLVP&#8217;s Rojas told TechCrunch. Highlighting </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/uber-to-become-the-sole-owner-of-grocery-delivery-startup-cornershop/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber&#8217;s acquisition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of ALLVP&#8217;s portfolio company Cornershop, she wrote that the deal &#8220;generated a virtuous circle, in which investors all over the world increased their confidence in our region and in the fact that it’s possible to realize amazing returns while changing the way traditional industries operate.&#8221; Vasconcellos concurred, noting that &#8220;the boom in unicorns and IPOs coming from the region … shows that success is possible and attracts more global capital.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But taking a step back, what is driving these cycles is what the Atlantico report refers to as &#8220;the second wave&#8221; of digital transformation. In a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/latin-americas-second-wave-of-digital-transformation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guest post on TechCrunch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vasconcellos explained it as the &#8220;second- and third-order effects of the [COVID-19] crisis,&#8221; which has accelerated the ongoing &#8220;continentwide tech expansion to a pace beyond any projections.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pandemic played the role of an accelerant in digitalization, it also drove structural changes. For instance, the expansion of e-commerce &#8220;required a significant evolution in the quality and scale of the infrastructure provided by logistics, payments and e-commerce platform companies,&#8221; Vasconcellos noted. And on a broader level, the region&#8217;s structural issues have typically represented opportunities for startups leveraging technology to address them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ambitious goal, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">outlined during GM&#8217;s two-day investor event that kicked off Wednesday, will be reached by selling a range of electric vehicles, software-based services and offering technology, including a new version of its hands-free advanced driving assistance system that the automaker claims will work in 95% of all driving scenarios and eventually be used on every paved road in the U.S. and Canada.</span></p>
<p>GM said it aims to hit $280 billion in annual revenues by 2030, which is more than double the $122.5 billion in sales it reported for 2020. The company is basing its revenue goal on a rolling average of about $140 billion, according to a company spokesperson.</p>
<p>GM has already committed billions to reach this new goal. The automaker said back in November that it would spend $27 billion over five years on the development of electric vehicles and automated technology, a 35% increase from its previous plan. GM upped that number again in July, this time to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/">$35 billion through 2025</a>.</p>
<p>That money is already being put to work, notably into Ultium, the underlying EV architecture and accompanying batteries for its next-generation electric vehicles, which includes the upcoming Chevrolet Silverado, a Chevrolet crossover priced around $30,000, Buick crossovers and the Cadillac Lyriq and Celestiq.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at the strong portfolio, the fact that we&#8217;re going to have affordable EVs, really affordable EVs for people and we&#8217;re also working on the ecosystem they need because for a lot of people it&#8217;s going to be their only vehicle — they need to have reliable reliable charging infrastructure,&#8221; Chair and CEO Mary Barra said during a media briefing explaining how the company planned to capture market share. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we believe that we&#8217;re going to attract those customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barra also noted that the company is building on loyalty that customers already have for the company. That, along with its portfolio, existing manufacturing capacity and dealership network are all advantages, she said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of things that we have that when we put our foot on the accelerator pedal, we can really move quite rapidly.&#8221;</p>
<p>To hit that mark, GM said it will dedicate more than 50% of its factories in North America and China to the production of electric vehicles by 2030.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s revenue goal doesn&#8217;t rely entirely on the sale and financing of EVs. In a briefing call with media Wednesday, Barra and GM President Mark Reuss  repeatedly pointed to its plan to roll out digital services through its new Ultifi software platform as well as new businesses like its commercial EV delivery company BrightDrop and OnStar Insurance.</p>
<p>Details about those digital services and its strategy will be outlined Wednesday and Thursday during the investor event. Stay tuned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors laid out its forthcoming EV portfolio at its investor event Wednesday, with the full-size electric pickup Chevrolet Silverado as the centerpiece, as the company seeks to gain market share in the increasingly crowded electric truck market.</p>
<p>While GM had previously announced the electric Silverado, the company confirmed some additional details, like that it would feature a fixed-glass roof for certain models and that the vehicle would debut at the trade show CES in January 2022. It’s joining Ford’s F-150 Lightning and Rivian’s R1T in the burgeoning electric truck segment – a segment that until now has been conspicuously empty, despite the truck being one of the best-selling vehicle types in America.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="E3bQx3chnh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/the-2022-chevrolet-silverado-gets-a-tech-upgrade-hands-free-trailering-and-a-new-zr2-off-road-flagship/">The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado gets a tech upgrade, hands-free trailering and a new ZR2 off-road flagship</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado gets a tech upgrade, hands-free trailering and a new ZR2 off-road flagship&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/the-2022-chevrolet-silverado-gets-a-tech-upgrade-hands-free-trailering-and-a-new-zr2-off-road-flagship/embed/#?secret=E3bQx3chnh" data-secret="E3bQx3chnh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Other details on the truck remain a mystery, however, particularly in relation to how GM plans to market the truck and the customers it anticipates lining up to buy it. “The proof points of who we’re going to target is going to be very evident when you see the truck,” GM’s president Mark Reuss said during a media briefing Wednesday. “If you look at the micro segmentation that&#8217;s happened on pickup trucks over many years, there&#8217;s a lot of different buyers. There&#8217;s not one buyer on the pickup truck [that] we target.”</p>
<p>GM also announced crossovers from its brands Chevy and Buick, in addition to its upcoming GMC Hummer pickup and Cadillac Lyriq crossover. The vehicles are part of the automakers plans to invest $35 billion through 2025 on electrification and autonomous vehicle tech, while also doubling its revenue by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>To what degree the automaker will face an uphill battle to hit these targets is unclear. Like other OEMs, GM reported dismal sales for the third quarter, citing the ongoing semiconductor shortage which disrupted manufacturing and vehicle delivery. In contrast to the legacy automakers, Tesla’s sales were very strong for the quarter, beating expectations on vehicle deliveries and previous delivery highs.</p>
<p>However, GM CEO Mary Barra emphasized that the company will offer affordable EVs – “really affordable EVs for people” – as well as other features to lure some would-be Tesla customers. “We believe that we’re going to attract those customers,” she said. She and Reuss added that GM has other advantages, like customer loyalty, strong manufacturing capacity and a wide dealership network to position it well in the EV market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also betting that it’s Ultium battery electric propulsion platform, which is manufactured in partnership with South Korea-based LG Energy Solutions, will give its forthcoming vehicles a competitive boost. The electric Chevrolet Silverado, for example, will have a range of 400 miles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As competition for creator talent heats up, Snap today <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/spotlight-challenges">introduced</a> a series of new tools, programs, and features that will enable creators on its platform to generate revenue. These include the expansion of a Gifting feature to worldwide creators, the expansion of the Creator Marketplace to include Snap Stars (top creators with verified accounts), the launch of a how-to resource called the Creator Hub, and a new way for Snapchat creators to be rewarded for making short-form video for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">its in-app TikTok rival,</a> known as Spotlight.</p>
<p>The latter, called Spotlight Challenges, will offer cash prizes for top-performing Spotlight content, as directed by Snap itself. This is different from other social apps&#8217; Creator Funds, which pay out based on metrics like views and engagement to anyone who qualifies. Instead, this is a &#8220;chance&#8221; to win cash where each individual challenge will reward an average of 3 to 5 creators as the winners &#8212; though sometimes that figure will be more or less, Snap notes. The minimum prize will be $250. Typically, the total prize pots for individual challenges will range from $1,000 to $25,000, but Snap says it may sometimes offer a larger sum.</p>
<p>The challenges will be designed to encourage the use of specific Lenses, Sounds or #Topics, rather than paying out for any top-performing content. These challenges will be featured on Spotlight&#8217;s &#8220;Trending&#8221; page, which you access by tapping the trending up icon in the top-right of Spotlight&#8217;s main screen in the Snapchat app. Here, users will be able to view the available challenges, read the details about submission details and associated prize, then tap to open the camera and create content.</p>
<p>The addition follows complaints expressed by Snap creators who had earlier this year <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/snapchat-creators-report-frustration-with-spotlight-payments-as-spotlight-u/602906/">grown frustrated</a> with Spotlight payment delays and later, the dwindling amount of money they could earn. While previously, Snap was paying out an incredible $1 million per day to get its TikTok competitor Spotlight off the ground, it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/20/media/snapchat-spotlight/index.html">stopped</a> that program in late May saying it would decrease payments to&#8221;millions&#8221; per month as of June.</p>
<p>But creators who had grown to expect larger paydays were not happy with the change, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/snap-creators-say-theyre-leaving-the-apps-spotlight-feature-as-payments-dry-up.html">some began to look for better opportunities on other apps</a>. Today, there are many options to choose from, as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Twitter are all trying to woo creators in their own ways &#8212; including, in some cases, with direct payments in addition to revenue sharing from ads.</p>
<p>Snap&#8217;s <a href="https://www.snap.com/terms/spotlight-challenges-official-rules">new system</a> of &#8220;challenges&#8221; would seem to offer a bit more transparency around payments, as creators will be able to see in advance what the prizes may be. But on the flip side, and perhaps most importantly, it signals to creators there is no guaranteed payday coming here &#8212; it&#8217;s a &#8220;prize,&#8221; not a paycheck. That means creators could still produce well-performing content and not &#8220;win&#8221; the cash.</p>
<p>However, Snap tells TechCrunch it&#8217;s not replacing creator payouts with prizes. The new feature will be in addition to the millions it distributes per month to the top Spotlight creators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new feature will be rolled out in the U.S. next month on iOS and Android before expanding to more markets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2213477" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Other additions today include a <a href="https://creators.snap.com/">Snapchat Creator Hub</a> that offers information about getting started in Spotlight and other tips and the expansion of the Gifting feature to Snap Stars worldwide (see above). This feature <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/new-tools-and-monetization-opportunities-for-creators">had been announced in May</a> and allows fans to support creators using Snap Tokens through Story Replies. The Snap Stars receive a share of the revenue from the Gifts they receive, as a sort of virtual tip.</p>
<p>Snap is also expanding the<a href="https://creatormarketplace.tiktok.com/"> Creator Marketplace,</a> which was previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/snap-to-launch-a-new-creator-marketplace-this-month-initially-focused-on-lens-creators/">working to connect Lens creators</a>, developers and partners with businesses who wanted to run AR ads with their support.</p>
<p>Now, the marketplace will serve another purpose as well: it will connect businesses with Snap Stars worldwide for brand deals. This is how creator marketplaces across other top social platforms, like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/introducing-brand-collabs-manager">Facebook, Instagram</a>, <a href="https://creatormarketplace.tiktok.com/">TikTok</a>, and <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9385307?hl=en">YouTube</a> already work, so this is a bit of catch-up on Snap&#8217;s part.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2213475" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Related to this move, Snap is also introducing a &#8220;Sponsored by&#8221; tag for businesses with Public Profiles so Snap Stars can tag brands in their sponsored content for transparency. In this case, 100% of the transactions will go directly to creators, Snap says.</p>
<p>Despite the changes to Snap&#8217;s earlier monetization efforts, the company claims the production of Spotlight content is booming. During its second-quarter earnings, Snap said Spotlight submissions more than tripled, daily time spent per user in the U.S. grew over 60% from the prior quarter, and daily active users were up 49%.</p>
<p>To date, Snap has paid out over $130 million to creators, it says. And it has seen &#8220;all-time highs&#8221; in terms of the number of creators posting to Spotlight since the June 1 revamp, the company noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://costcertified.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CostCertified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Canadian startup which provides real-time, interactive residential construction estimates, raised $8.45 million in a seed round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FUSE, a Pacific Northwest venture firm which counts former Microsoft CFO John Connors and Seattle Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner as venture partners, led the round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is also backed by Y Combinator (having participated in the accelerator’s S21 batch), I2BF Global Ventures, Soma Capital and a number of proptech/construction tech founders such as Willy Schlacks, CEO and co-founder of EquipmentShare; Ryan Sutton-Gee, PlanGrid co-founder and former COO; Jonathan Wasserstrum, co-founder and CEO of SquareFoot and Bill Smith, founder and CEO of Landing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raise marks CostCertified’s first external round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, CostCertified today is a price configurator tool for construction, but the Calgary, Alberta-based company’s end goal is to build the “Amazon for construction.” CostCertified allows contractors to send a shoppable interactive estimate to homeowners so that they can choose their selections during a project, and see the effect on price instantly. If you&#8217;ve ever performed a home remodeling project, you understand that this is something that would be incredibly useful considering all the various decisions required around vendors and products. Being able to see your options and how specific choices will impact your end cost in one place can certainly help make the project less stressful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Bignold teamed up with David Vass to start CostCertified in 2017 after running his own construction business and realizing the need for contractors to provide estimates in a more modern way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I ended up booking a pretty large project. And I hired a really great project manager who was really good with construction but not comfortable at all with tech,” Bignold recalls. “And that job ended up getting delayed as a result.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bignold, who did some coding during college, put together a simple prototype of an app that generated a document with an estimate of project costs that was sent out via email to potential customers. Essentially, he had built a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quoting engine that gave contractors a way to provide consumers with “an interactive, shoppable experience” while managing a project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a contractor, I didn’t have the tools to support the price complexity of a large construction project,” Bignold said. “I thought to myself, ‘Why can’t you buy or sell construction services with the convenience of an Amazon-like, or Shopify, experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, he ended up selling his construction business with the intention of spinning out the app he had built into its own company. He teamed up with Vass, who had helped him get that contracting business “to the top of Google.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Vass’s other contracting clients were looking for a system similar to what Bignold had built so the pair got beta customers to use the app, and become early adopters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think I realized the complex problems that I was getting into solving for large construction companies,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair spent several years on R&amp;D, iterating the app “over and over, listening to customers constantly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were big structural problems in the industry that we were trying to solve for,” Bignold said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SaaS platform came out of beta in early 2021, and today, CostCertified has $72 million in annualized GMV, and says it has seen 2,203% YoY growth (albeit it from a small base).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can do things like select their finishes, upgrade, downgrade and build their own renovation or new construction with real-time price changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software also allows built-in financing and payments that CostCertified says automates workflow and, ultimately, reduces the cost and risk for everyone involved in such projects &#8212; from general contractors to subcontractors to the consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We leveraged our capabilities by bringing retailers, the people who sell things like countertops and plumbing fixtures, into the point of sale,” Bignold said. “By bringing all selections to the POS, customers know exactly what they are getting and what it will cost. The contractor can also make more money on upgrades and justify the cost.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, CostCertified has a team of 25 and it plans to use its new capital in part to increase its headcount by over 100 people over the next year and on product development, sales and growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FUSE’s Brendan Wales said his firm was impressed with the CostCertified team’s “deep level of experience within the home renovation market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have lived the pain of being a contractor and built the product for themselves. The product is robust and fully featured for its stage; the product is far greater than seed stage,” he wrote via email. “The customers love the product and that can be seen in the monthly logo growth, which is compounding. Lastly, they are playing within a large global market and there are many ways to monetize this audience than just SaaS fees.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another unique thing about the startup, he said, is that most renovation software vendors often only think about how the contractors will use the product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“CostCertified has put the contractor&#8217;s customer to the forefront,” he wrote. “They enable the end consumers of the renovation services to have a more dynamic and transparent service, more akin to a wonderful e-commerce experience, than a construction purchase.&#8221;</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[This year's Pitch Deck Teardown at TechCrunch Disrupt was full of invaluable advice from an exceptional VC panel about how to capture investors' attention.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">VCs read pitch decks extremely quickly, which means that every detail holds the potential to get them to double down on a startup or just pass altogether. While crafting the high-level narrative is critical, of course, founders can’t skimp on the details either.</p>
<p>That’s why every Disrupt, we host a session we call Pitch Deck Teardown. It’s a convivial workshop where founders in the audience send me their decks, and I walk through a curated set of them live in front of an exceptional VC panel, who critique the deck slide by slide. This year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>, we were joined by Maren Bannon, co-founder and managing partner at <a href="https://www.january.ventures">January Ventures</a>; Vanessa Larco, partner at <a href="https://www.nea.com">NEA</a>; and Ben Ling, founder and general partner of <a href="https://www.blingcap.com">Bling Capital</a>.</p>
<p>We went through two decks — one consumer and one enterprise — covering about 30 slides in total. It’s honestly hard to summarize all the discussions we had on the panel — there were just so many interesting viewpoints that I highly recommend reading the transcript or watching the video included below.</p>
<p>So for this summary, I decided to pick four slides, two from each deck, that provoked our panelists to show how VCs can have radically different views on the same material.</p>
<h2 id="Product slide">Product slide</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2208018" style="width: 1716px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208018" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2208018 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Slide-1.png" alt="" width="1706" height="958" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Slide-1.png 1706w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Slide-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Slide-1.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Slide-1.png?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Slide-1.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Slide-1.png?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Slide-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1706px) 100vw, 1706px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208018" class="wp-caption-text"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Most consumer decks, like this one targeting dog owners, will have some form of product slide that shows exactly what a startup is building. It’s a critical slide, but one that can be easy to get wrong.</span></p></div></p>
<p>Larco liked the design, but suggested offering investors ways to dive deeper:</p>
<blockquote><p>Screenshots are typically great, but if it piques your interest, it would be great if they had a link to a Loom video or something so that if I did want to go deeper and if I was really curious about what the product actually looks like, I could. That said, when it launches automatically into video, I find it typically hard to sift through it unless I am really interested already. So I think screenshots with an option to go deeper is great. But this looks great, the UI is great and clean. It explains the three core components of the app, which is basically what I asked for upfront. So this is pretty well executed. <em><b>(Timestamp: 9:00)</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>The company had an additional slide just like this one with three more product screenshots. Larco felt that this maybe added a bit too much information about the UI.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Next year, The Athletic expects cash consumption of merely $7 million against $119 million in revenue. That seems just fine.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-athletic-burned-through-95-million-between-2019-and-2020?utm_source=sg&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=article_email&amp;utm_content=article-6356">broke some neat news</a> earlier this week about The Athletic, the subscription sports media website that has raised lots of money and, per the report, spent lots of it.</p>
<p>While we have all become inured to a degree regarding losses at quickly growing, venture-backed companies, seeing a media business lose software-style money <a href="https://twitter.com/scottgoodacre/status/1445326454515019776">was</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/fpmarconi/status/1445160886650408962">eyebrow</a>&#8211;<a href="https://twitter.com/TiagoDF/status/1445136214760345610">raising</a>. However, after a quick scan of the numbers, I have to wonder a bit. It kinda looks like The Athletic is doing fine?</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://twitter.com/jtoonkel">Jessica Toonkel&#8217;s</a> reporting, The Athletic burned $54 million in cash in 2019 against revenues of $26 million. That&#8217;s a lot of burn, right! Maybe? It depends whether the site was hiring lots of staff, building out its product, and setting the groundwork for future revenue growth.</p>
<p>So, did the spend work out? Seems like it: The Athletic racked up $47 million in revenues and burned $41 million worth of cash in 2020, according to The Information, despite the pandemic kicking sports in the shins that year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://celonis.com">Celonis</a>, the late-stage processing mining startup with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/celonis-snares-1b-series-d-on-11b-valuation/">a gaudy $11 billion valuation</a>, announced a new partnership today, this one with ServiceNow.</p>
<p>Celonis co-founder and CEO Alexander Rinke says that he and ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott go back a long way, and that working together should provide big benefits for the two companies. &#8220;With ServiceNow, we can both increase the benefits that customers receive, ensure we’re helping businesses modernize their underlying processes and the systems those processes run on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The two companies will be working together to combine the ServiceNow low-code workflow automation tool <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/servicenow-adds-new-no-code-capabilities/">it announced in March</a> with Celonis&#8217; process mining tooling. Dave Wright, chief innovation officer at ServiceNow, says that by bringing together Celonis’ process execution expertise with ServiceNow’s automation, machine learning, robotic process automation and low-code app development capabilities, they can improve workflow for their mutual customers.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is about helping customers more deeply understand how work moves across the enterprise and applying those insights to accelerate digital innovation and predict how to make work better,&#8221; Wright said.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement comes on the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/celonis-announces-significant-partnership-with-ibm-to-sell-its-process-mining-software/">a similar agreement with IBM</a> announced in April, and gives the company another large organization to help it sell its software. Rinke says that the three companies can actually work together.</p>
<p>&#8220;This partnership is designed to benefit all of our customers and strategic partners including IBM Global Business Services (GBS). IBM GBS has experience with both ServiceNow and Celonis and could now combine both platforms to deliver much more rapid and substantial transformation of enterprise processes,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These big companies and investors see something here, and it&#8217;s a company that builds process mining software to help customers understand how work flows through their organizations, and from there how to make it more efficient through automation. Working together with these larger organizations should help drive Celonis&#8217; business growth, while giving these larger public companies access to some sophisticated software that they can combine with software and services they are already offering.</p>
<p>ServiceNow has also been moving into automation in a big way in the last year announcing a number of moves to accelerate this shift. That included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/servicenow-takes-rpa-plunge-by-acquiring-india-based-startup-intellibot/">acquiring RPA vendor Intellibot</a> and announcing no-code workflow building tools in March.</p>
<p>The $11 billion valuation came in June when Celonis <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/celonis-snares-1b-series-d-on-11b-valuation/">announced a $1 billion Series D</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In yet another sign that automakers are determined to get ahead of the supply chain curve, General Motors said Wednesday it had signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with General Electric for the supply of rare earth materials, the kind used to manufacture electric vehicles and clean energy equipment.</p>
<p>The nonbinding agreement is with GE’s clean energy arm, GE Renewable Energy. In addition to rare earth materials, the collaboration will also look at ways to improve supplies of magnets, copper and electrical steel.</p>
<p>Initially, the collaboration will be focused on establishing a supply chain for magnet manufacturing in North American and Europe &#8212; significant, as the main producers of magnets are in countries like China, Brazil and India. The two companies will also explore new supply chains for copper and “eSteel,” a material composed in part of recycled materials, to be used in automotive traction motors and renewable power generation.</p>
<p>The agreement is yet another sign that North American automakers are keen to decrease their reliance on foreign countries for critical minerals. The news is prescient as both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have called for a bolstering of domestic sources of minerals like copper and lithium, in order to stay competitive in the transition to electric-everything.</p>
<p>To that point, the two companies said they would also look to collaborate via public policy, to seek out policies that support the establishment of North American and European-based supply chains for these materials.</p>
<p>&#8220;A secure, sustainable and resilient local supply chain for electric vehicle materials is critical to the execution of GM’s vision of an all-electric future,&#8221; Shilpan Amin, GM’s vice president for global purchasing and supply chain, explained in a statement. &#8220;Motors are one of the most important components of our Ultium Platform, and the heavy and light rare earth materials are an essential ingredient in our motor magnets.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getcopper.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copper Banking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a digital banking service aimed at teens, announced today it has raised a total of $13.3 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/psl-ventures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PSL Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an arm of </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pioneer-square-labs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pioneer Square Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, led a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $4.3 million raise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Seattle-based Copper last year and an additional $9 million this year. Other investors in the fintech startup include Clocktower Ventures, Index Ventures Scout Fund, Launchpad Capital, Financial Venture Studio, Maven Ventures, Fiat Ventures and Arnold Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copper Banking CEO and co-founder </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eddie Behringer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> believes the startup has a few competitive advantages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, Behringer and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFO Stefan Berglund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> previously co-founded Snap! Raise, a youth-oriented crowdfunding platform that has raised over $90 million in venture funding. The pair attribute Snap! Raise’s success to deep grassroots-level relationships in high schools. They are emulating that model to power Copper’s growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We worked with millions of teens and parents in our previous company,” Behringer told TechCrunch. “That playbook is one of the core reasons we’ve seen such great growth so quickly. We’ve gone this route before &#8212; partnering at the community level. That’s something that is typically overlooked in tech models today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Copper Banking has incorporated financial education into its offering so that teens are not just able to spend money, but also better manage it. For example, financial tips built into the app are aimed at helping teens “learn the essential money lessons they’ll need throughout life,” the company says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One really good example of that is that teens have the ability to tell Copper what they want, which we then translate into savings goals that really teaches them,” Behringer added.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DXBd6DnM4P"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/">Which neobanks will rise or fall?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Which neobanks will rise or fall?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/embed/#?secret=DXBd6DnM4P" data-secret="DXBd6DnM4P" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Copper’s strategy seems to be working. The two-year-old startup launched earlier this year, and today has over 350,000 users on its platform. Since its launch, Copper has been seeing about 70% month-over-month growth and about 70% of users are being drawn to the platform through “organic word of mouth,” Behringer said. The average Copper customer is 15 years old and often refers another friend, not including their own siblings, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In emulating Snap! Raise’s model, Copper Banking also relies on a network of youth ambassadors who promote the platform through schools, clubs and sports teams. The result, Behringer adds, is fewer fees for its teen customers. And for Copper, the approach has resulted in customer acquisition costs that it says are drastically lower than those of traditional banks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We realized, when growing Snap! Raise, that very little had been done to prepare this generation to be financially successful,” Behringer told TechCrunch. “One of the first things we noticed is that banks have set the bar extremely low for pre-18 banking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copper Banking provides an FDIC-backed digital bank account linked to 50,000 ATMs. Teens also get a personalized Copper debit card, P2P payments, direct deposit and automatic savings options. Parents must sign up their teens for an account, and can </span><a href="https://getcopper.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057843033-Why-do-I-need-to-link-a-Parent-or-Guardian-to-my-account-"><span style="font-weight: 400;">link their traditional bank accounts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Copper Banking cards to provide an automatic &#8220;teen salary&#8221; allowance. They also receive alerts and smart controls over spending behavior. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copper offers co-parent functionality for separated parents living in different households. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital mostly to continue the development of its banking platform and products as well as to focus on its go-to-market strategy. It also, naturally, is hiring across several departments &#8212; including engineering, compliance, marketing, sales and operations. Copper currently has about 25 employees.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Geoff Entress, managing director and co-founder of lead investor PSL Ventures, said the </span><span class="s1"> Copper management team&#8217;s extensive experience growing early-stage companies really shows in their metrics. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Their adoption, conversion to funded accounts and recommendation metrics beat most DTC metrics you see out there, which speaks to Copper’s incredible resonance with customers,&#8221; he wrote via email. &#8220;As an investor, those are the signals you want to see. We believe Copper Banking is ideally positioned to help set the next generation of Americans on a path to better financial health.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ben Savage, partner at Clocktower Ventures, believes that the teen market is incredibly attractive for neobanks, but that &#8220;teens don’t want one imposed on them by their parents.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Copper has the brand, the product and the go-to-market model to fill that void,&#8221; he said in a written statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copper emphasizes that it is a digital bank. Evolve Bank &amp; Trust provides its banking services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the startup’s focus is on teens, anyone over the age of six can get an account if they have a phone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The landscape for banking services aimed at youth is an increasingly crowded on. In April, Step &#8212; which is also focused on teens &#8212; closed on </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/teen-banking-service-step-raises-100m-series-c-announces-steph-currys-investment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $100 million Series C round of funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Greenlight, a fintech company that pitches parents on kid-friendly bank accounts, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/kids-focused-fintech-greenlight-raises-260m-in-a16z-led-series-d-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-2-3b/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $260 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series D funding round that nearly doubled its valuation to $2.3 billion.</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch&#8217;s venture capital focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. This is our Wednesday show, the time of the week when we niche down to a single topic. Today? Gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> got together to discuss the gaming world from a few perspectives, including those of startups and the largest platform players in tech. Alex is a gamer. Danny is a <em>board</em> gamer. And Natasha isn&#8217;t big on digital games. So, we had a good array of viewpoints. The goal of our episode was to understand why gaming is garnering more interest from Big Tech and startups alike, and how the business model and environment has evolved over the years.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.protocol.com/andreessen-horowitz-gaming-fund">new gaming fund from a16z</a>, and recent venture capital totals, as <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/its-game-on-for-gaming-startups/">compiled by our friends over at Crunchbase News</a>.</li>
<li>Amazon&#8217;s new hit game, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-doesnt-make-videogames-but-its-the-hottest-player-in-gaming-11633147211">Apple&#8217;s epic gaming profits.</a></li>
<li>It appears, by our read, that as the gaming industry has evolved from single-sale titles to games with recurring incomes that studios have become venture-backable; this is testament to both business model evolution and general gaming popularity, as much as it is indicative of how much money it is possible to earn <em>supporting </em>the games industry as a tech shop as well.</li>
<li>Still, we wanted to spend a few minutes on the challenges that await those trying to spin up a game overnight.</li>
<li>After we talked through the context and challenges, we riffed on the why! It includes just what a metaverse is, how NFTs can slot into the conversation and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>All we need now is a release date for <a href="https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Royal_Court">Royal Court</a>, Paradox.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup called <a href="https://getmatter.app/">Matter</a>, which aims to build a better reading app for today&#8217;s internet, is launching out of private beta testing and announcing the close of its $7 million Series A, led by GV (formerly Google Ventures.) The app enters a space where technologies for saving articles to read later, like Instapaper and Pocket, have lagged behind how people are now consuming online reading &#8212; through newsletters, personalized recommendations in other apps or through suggestions from peers on social platforms, for example. And people don&#8217;t only want to consume reading material as text &#8212; they want to listen to articles as audio, highlight key points and discuss with fellow readers.</p>
<p>The frustrations with the current set of reading apps drove Matter co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benspringwater/">Ben Springwater</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-n-mackenzie/">Robert Mackenzie</a> &#8212; who met while working at Nextdoor &#8212; to take on the challenge of building a new tool for online reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were all of these pain points and frictions around reading online, and the media ecosystem was changing &#8212; you have the rise of newsletters, you have the rise of individual creators, alternative media &#8212; and also that there was all this potential around what you could do to e-reading. It&#8217;s still just words on a screen, but there&#8217;s a lot more you can do and overlay to that,&#8221; explains Springwater. &#8220;It just became more and more apparent to us that there was an opportunity to build a better reading product,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The co-founders began the development of Matter in early 2020, after raising an angel round, and later participated in startup accelerator Y Combinator&#8217;s summer 2020 batch.</p>
<p>At the outset, one of Matter&#8217;s larger goals was to help people make better decisions about what to read.</p>
<p>Today, there are many places where people discover new material, from news headlines, to Twitter and other social apps, to newsletters hitting the inbox, and more. But there isn&#8217;t an app that&#8217;s working to create what Matter calls a &#8220;recommendation&#8221; graph, where the best material is filtered, curated and brought to the forefront.</p>
<p>This is what <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/matter-reader/id1501592184">Matter</a> is aiming to do. On the app&#8217;s homepage, you&#8217;ll discover recommended content that comes from a set of articles recommended by a group of &#8220;public thinkers&#8221; on Twitter who often share interesting news and links. From their tweets, Matter&#8217;s team curates their recommendations further, to hand-select the best articles to share in the app. Matter users can also feed in their recommendations to the app, which the team then curates, sending a subset of those suggestions to the homepage, as well.</p>

<p>Like other &#8220;read it later&#8221; apps, like those offered by Pocket or Instapaper, Matter users can install a Chrome extension to build their reading list in the app, or they can make a recommendation directly in the mobile app itself. Users&#8217; reading lists are private by default, but you can choose which articles from the list you want to post publicly to the Matter community.</p>
<p>This sharing feature makes Matter a bit of a social network, as users can also highlight articles as they share, in addition to highlighting privately.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can think of it as like a lightweight way of broadcasting what you&#8217;re reading,&#8221; says Springwater of the highlighting feature.</p>
<p>If someone follows you in Matter, they&#8217;ll see your highlights and annotations overlaid on the article when they read the same article. This sounds similar to what digital publishing platform <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> offers across its own website and app. But Matter makes the option available across all the reading material being shared. These highlights are also saved to users&#8217; profiles, so you can visit someone you follow and see what sort of things they had made note of and shared.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212578" style="width: 372px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212578" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2212578" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Queue.png?w=362" alt="" width="362" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Queue.png 982w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Queue.png?resize=80,150 80w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Queue.png?resize=160,300 160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Queue.png?resize=768,1442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Queue.png?resize=362,680 362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Queue.png?resize=818,1536 818w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Queue.png?resize=27,50 27w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212578" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matter (a user&#8217;s private queue)</p></div></p>
<p>Users on Matter can follow others, in a model similar to social networks like Twitter. This allows you to track the shares from people whose suggestions you generally like. The feature recalls the recently shuttered app Nuzzel, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/">acquired by Twitter when it bought Scroll</a> earlier this year. Nuzzel had a small but devoted following for its Twitter-based reading recommendations. While not entirely based on Twitter, Matter&#8217;s idea to follow people, and what they read and share, feels similar.</p>
<p>A commenting feature enables discussions on shared articles, but to what extent you&#8217;ll see much action here may depend on who you follow. During Matter&#8217;s private beta, moderation hasn&#8217;t been an issue. But it&#8217;s one the company will need to address as it scales to a broader audience.</p>
<p>The app also addresses a number of other pain points associated with online reading and the current crop of reading apps.</p>
<p>It gives you tools to get your newsletters into Matter in a couple of ways, for instance &#8212; either by having you set up filters to forward mail or by using a special email address just for Matter.</p>
<p>It offers a way to listen to individual articles as audio, but in a far less robotic-sounding voice than is available in some other reading apps. It lets you sync other accounts where you collect reading material, like Twitter, Notion and Readwise. It allows you to view and save the full, paywalled content, if you&#8217;re a paid subscriber to a news site or newsletter. And it offers weekly roundups with Staff Picks for those times when you&#8217;ve been too busy to keep up.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212580" style="width: 372px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212580" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2212580" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Audio.png?w=362" alt="" width="362" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Audio.png 982w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Audio.png?resize=80,150 80w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Audio.png?resize=160,300 160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Audio.png?resize=768,1442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Audio.png?resize=362,680 362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Audio.png?resize=818,1536 818w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Audio.png?resize=27,50 27w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212580" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matter (listening to audio)</p></div></p>
<p>In time, Matter also wants to add more personalization to its service, which will involve investing in semantic technology on the back end to understand the topics in articles being shared. But the startup is weighing how exactly to bring this in.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a limit to how heavily we want to lean on personalization because there&#8217;s a balance that needs to be struck between narrowing in on someone&#8217;s interests and giving them more of what they have indicated they want through the signals they&#8217;ve given you, and introducing enough novelty and serendipity,&#8221; explains Springwater. &#8220;People&#8217;s interests evolve and you&#8217;re never going to be able to zero in on them completely,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>As Matter exits private beta, the app will be open to anyone who wants to download it from the App Store.</p>
<p>In addition to GV&#8217;s investment, led by M.G. Siegler, investors in Matter include Outliers, Shrug, James Beshara, Calvin French-Owen and many other angels. And, from its $2 million seed, Stripe co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/patrick-collison">Patrick Collison</a>; former Stripe product manager turned investor Lachy Groom; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/business/julia-hartz-eventbrite-corner-office.html">Eventbrite co-founders</a> Kevin and Julia Hartz invested.</p>
<p>It will also use its Series A funding to invest in further building out the Matter experience and scaling, hiring engineers and designers, and building web and Android clients.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first generation of read-it-later services were amazing, and perhaps no one was a bigger user of them than myself. But they were also built in a different era,&#8221; said Siegler about GV&#8217;s investment. &#8220;The content we now consume in a number of different ways, on a number of different devices, required an updated vessel purpose-built from the ground up,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;On top of that, there&#8217;s more content than ever before to read, and more of it is great than ever before. But we need an effective way to surface that content. This was the initial premise of Matter and having watched Ben and Rob build this from the ground up, to today&#8217;s robust app built by a growing team, has been awesome to watch. So we jumped at the chance to give them more resources to keep at it without slowing down. I&#8217;m excited to see how others will use Matter and how the service will grow with more people powering it forward,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Matter&#8217;s<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/matter-reader/id1501592184"> iOS app</a> is currently free, with plans to monetize via a consumer subscription model in the future. The app is launching into public beta starting today, meaning there will no longer be an invite requirement to try it out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Increasingly, companies are being encouraged by governments to engage in carbon accounting, but of course, only a small number of companies actually do. Even those probably count only 10% of their emissions because they don’t account for the emissions of their supply chain, which, when looked at, probably account for 90% of their total emissions. It’s the equivalent of handing in your financial report on the back of an envelope. But tracking supply chain emissions is fiendishly tricky.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s why <a href="https://normative.io/">Normative</a>, an emissions &#8220;accounting engine&#8221;. which can track supply chain emissions, has now raised €10 million from a clutch of European and U.S. climate tech funds. The round was led by <a href="https://www.2150.vc/">2150</a> and <a href="https://etfpartners.capital/">ETF Partners</a>, but also includes new investors Chris Sacca&#8217;s <a href="https://lowercarboncapital.com/">Lowercarbon Capital</a>, while existing investors ByFounders and Luminar Ventures also participated.</p>
<p>Stockholm-headquartered Normative’s emissions database has made a name for itself by landing partners such as the <a href="https://unfccc.int/climate-action/race-to-zero-campaign">United Nations Race to Zero</a> campaign (which aims to drive change to a decarbonized economy ahead of COP26), the U.K.’s <a href="https://smeclimatehub.org/uk/">SME Climate Hub</a> (through which thousands of U.K. companies have committed to &#8220;net zero&#8221; on their climate emissions) and a free starter plan in collaboration with Google.org for small businesses.</p>
<p>Normative&#8217;s approach is to standardize the often inconsistent, expensive and people-intensive process of carbon accounting.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Kristian Rönn said: &#8220;Ahead of COP26, it is time for everyone and businesses, in particular, to be courageous. We are in a climate emergency and we must take action, real action. But businesses also need to be pragmatic &#8212; and realize that removing carbon inside their operations and their supply chains makes good business sense. The cost of carbon is a huge liability on your balance sheet and you need to act to ensure that your business will survive.” Rönn was previously a global risks analyst at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University.</p>
<p>Jacob Bro, partner and co-founder at 2150, said: “Carbon accounting is the first truly global software vertical in climate tech and we see accelerating demand as millions of companies realize that measuring, reporting and managing their carbon footprint is a necessity to remain competitive and compliant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fabrice Bienfait, a partner at ETF Partners, said: “Businesses know they need to have better, more accurate data on their emissions, both for compliance purposes but also so they can have a credible plan to get to net-zero.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to me over a call Rönn added: “We have built the first emissions accounting engine. Our clients upload all of their accounting data, every single transaction &#8212; invoices for heating offices, invoices for transportation, business travel, specific raw materials &#8212; and then we basically assess the carbon impact of everything that they have ever purchased.”</p>
<p>He says the big difference between it and its competitors is that it “really gets them up to 100% of their carbon accounting. So our competitors still account for emissions in the supply chain, but it all has to be manual. We have seven years&#8217; experience in this space and can process the carbon impact of millions of suppliers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-spotify-audience-network-an-audio-ad-marketplace/">introduced</a> its new audio advertising marketplace, the Spotify Audience Network, which allows advertisers to reach audiences across Spotify&#8217;s ad-supported music and original and exclusive podcast programs, as well as third-party podcasts from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">Megaphone</a> publishers, all in one place. Today, the company is <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-10-06/the-latest-spotify-audience-network-innovations-for-advertisers-and-anchor-creators/">launching</a> access to the Spotify Audience Network to creators who use its Anchor podcast publishing tool in the U.S.</p>
<p>Support for Anchor had been previously announced when Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-spotify-audience-network-an-audio-ad-marketplace/">first unveiled its plans</a> for the Spotify Audience Network back in February during its &#8220;Stream On&#8221; live event. The company described the new platform as a potential game changer for the world of podcast monetization, as it would give advertisers tools to reach the Spotify audience of hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>The news had shortly followed an investigative report by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22241066/spotify-anchor-sponsorships-ad-money-spend-podcasting">The Verge</a>, which found that Anchor was struggling to find sponsors for smaller podcasters, as it had promised to do. Instead, Spotify itself was found to be the main sponsor for Anchor advertising to date. The debut of the Spotify Audience Network, however, put that report into perspective. It seemed that Spotify may have chosen to prioritize the building out of this larger ad marketplace, rather than working on sponsor outreach for smaller shows.</p>
<p>The Spotify Audience Network has already launched in the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia, where it now powers advertising across Spotify&#8217;s shows and other third-party podcasts, like those from The Wall Street Journal and ViacomCBS. Though the company today declined to say how many total podcasts are participating in the marketplace, it said the total has risen by more than 50% since launch, and about 4x more advertisers are now running ads on the network. Many are first-time podcast advertisers, like Saks Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when it added Megaphone inventory to the Spotify Audience Network, it increased advertiser reach by 30%. Megaphone publishers saw fill rates increase by over 10% in June and CPMs increase by over 40%, Spotify claims.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213368" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213368" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2213368" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Spotify-Audience-Network-Oct-2021-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213368" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>With the additional support for Anchor, Spotify notes advertisers will be able to reach a large swath of Spotify&#8217;s podcast catalog as Anchor powers 70% of the podcasts on Spotify. It will also enable advertisers to reach popular shows like &#8220;Alyssa Milano: Sorry Not Sorry,&#8221; &#8220;How Long Gone&#8221; and &#8220;Office Hours live with Tim Heidecker,&#8221; the company noted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead of taking a percentage revenue share from advertiser payments, Anchor creators who are part of the Spotify Audience Network will receive a flat rate RPM (revenue per thousand listeners), the company told TechCrunch. But this detail isn&#8217;t mentioned on the <a href="https://anchor.fm/ads">website</a> which presents the ad options to Anchor creators. Spotify says the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">rate will be visible to participating creators in the money tab of their Anchor dashboard, and at this time the rate is a $13 RPM.</span></p>
<p>Spotify said the expansion is only one way it&#8217;s working to make it easier for advertisers to reach the podcast listener base on its platform.</p>
<p>The company is also soon launching support for podcast ad buying in <a href="https://adstudio.spotify.com/signup/form?lang=en">Spotify Ad Studio</a>, its self-serve channel now live in 26 global markets. Before, advertisers would have needed a direct relationship with the Spotify team and a sizable budget to advertise on its podcast network. But the Ad Studio&#8217;s launch of podcast ad buying will enable smaller advertisers, like universities, independent artists, app developers and others, to now buy ads on podcasts, Spotify says. This launch will take place in the U.S. before rolling out to more markets.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cysk7ZCeBZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/more-thoughts-on-growing-podcasts/">More thoughts on growing podcasts</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;More thoughts on growing podcasts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/more-thoughts-on-growing-podcasts/embed/#?secret=cysk7ZCeBZ" data-secret="cysk7ZCeBZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>An early beta tester of this functionality included Two Men and a Truck, which used the Spotify Ad Studio to test advertising in podcasts for the first time. The business says it will now make podcast advertising a part of its marketing plan going forward, as a result.</p>
<p>Related to today&#8217;s news, Spotify announced it was joining the Global Alliance of Responsible Media (GARM), as the first audio platform member. Here, it will help to set the brand safety standards for the audio industry.</p>
<p>It also announced it would give advertisers tools to exclude sensitive topics from their ad buys, to give them more control over where their messages are heard. And it will offer new controls that will allow advertisers to target ads by context. Spotify offered an example of this by explaining how an animal shelter could target ads at a podcast about pets.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZ_oYxqWL9g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Podcasts <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/the-sell-sider/direct-podcast-monetization-is-challenging-heres-what-publishers-can-do/">historically have struggled to monetize</a> effectively, outside of larger networks that could deliver sizable audiences across their various programs. That&#8217;s why Spotify has been snatching up various networks over the years, like Megaphone, Gimlet, Parcast and The Ringer, for example. But for smaller publishers, it&#8217;s been difficult to compete and capture much, if any, of the potential advertising revenue.</p>
<p>With the expansion of the Spotify Audience Network to Anchor, creators would at least have a better chance at being exposed to more advertisers and campaigns. But as the payouts are still based on their audience size, it won&#8217;t likely dramatically change their fortunes overnight. However, Anchor does offer podcasters a few other ways to monetize, including its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/spotifys-podcasts-subscriptions-service-is-now-open-to-all-u-s-creators/">newer podcast subscriptions</a> and Ambassador ads (which lets creators with over 50 listeners promote Anchor), in addition to the premium sponsorships available to shows with larger audiences.</p>
