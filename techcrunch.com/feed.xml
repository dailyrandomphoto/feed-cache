										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re gazing longingly at new streaming services but can&#8217;t actually afford all of them, <a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo</a> says it can help you choose.</p>
<p>In recent years, the company has been trying to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/tivos-ceo-explains-how-the-company-fully-embraces-streaming/">evolve beyond the DVR business</a> by creating products that make it easier for consumers to navigate the increasingly fragmented TV landscape. Earlier this year, it launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/tivo-enters-the-streaming-market-with-a-50-android-tv-powered-device-tivo-stream-4k/">the Tivo Stream 4K</a>, a $50 Android TV dongle.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.tivo.com">a blog post</a>, TiVo said that its goal is to help you answer questions like, &#8220;Do I need a live TV lineup? If so, what&#8217;s the optimal service and line-up for me? Which streaming services best fit my taste and consumption profile?&#8221; The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tivo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tivo">TiVo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Stream 4K was the first step in that strategy, and today&#8217;s launch of TiVo Match Scores is the second.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea is pretty simple: When you browse different streaming services in the My Services section of the TiVo Stream interface, you&#8217;ll start seeing personalized scores between 1 and 100. The higher the score, the more likely that the service is a good fit for you.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085098" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085098" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2085098" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-7.jpg?w=680" alt="TiVo Match Scores" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-7.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-7.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-7.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-7.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-7.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-7.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085098" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TiVo</p></div></p>
<p>Vice President of Product Chris Thun told me via email that with streaming services becoming increasingly protective of their viewership data, TiVo draws on a variety of data sources to calculate the scores for each viewer — the same data it uses to recommend movies and shows throughout the Tivo Stream experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;With TiVo Stream, we’re utilizing engagement-based personalization alongside the more traditional viewership data (in cases where views are made available to us) to tune our recommendations,&#8221; Thune said. &#8220;Ingredient signals driving engagement-based personalization include titles within TiVo Stream that you engage with, add to your watchlist, or make a partner app selection (strongly implying viewership).&#8221;</p>
<p>Thune said every streaming service that&#8217;s <a href="https://explore.tivo.com/how-to/stream-4k/streaming-apps">integrated with TiVo Stream </a>will be scored. The company plans to roll out Match Scores over the next few days, with full deployment by the end of the week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A collection of states filed a multi-state lawsuit Wednesday accusing <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> of suppressing its competition through monopolistic business practices meant to preserve the company&#8217;s outsized power. Fourty eight attorneys general across 46 states, the territory of Guam and the District of Columbia are behind the lawsuit, with only South Dakota, South Carolina, Alabama and Georgia declining to join.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, which looks at Facebook&#8217;s actions throughout the company&#8217;s history, alleges that the company bought competitors &#8220;illegally&#8221; and in a &#8220;predatory manner.&#8221; The suit cites Facebook&#8217;s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp as prominent examples.</p>
<p>In the suit, the collection of states asks the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to &#8220;restrain Facebook from making further acquisitions valued at or in excess of $10 million&#8221; without notifying the plaintiff states in advance. The lawsuit also asks the court for &#8220;any additional relief it determines is appropriate, including the divestiture or restructuring of illegally acquired companies, or current Facebook assets or business lines.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The suit was led by a committee of attorneys general from California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and the District of Columbia, with New York Attorney General Letitia James spearheading the effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost every state in this nation has joined this bipartisan lawsuit because Facebook’s efforts to dominate the market were as illegal as they were harmful,&#8221; James said. &#8220;Today’s suit should send a clear message to Facebook and every other company that any efforts to stifle competition, reduce innovation, or cut privacy protections will be met with the full force of our offices.&#8221;</p>
<p>The state antitrust action against Facebook materialized the same week the FTC votes on its own antitrust suit against the social media giant. That vote will tie a bow on a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/06/ftc-sue-facebook-antitrust-violations-434810">20-month long investigation</a> into Facebook&#8217;s business, including its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram — two formerly independent apps that were folded into the social giant&#8217;s business.</p>
<p>Facebook has been regularly criticized for its outsized influence and repeatedly been called to testify before Congress on antitrust issues, but the coordinated state antitrust effort marks a challenging new chapter for the company.</p>

<p>Most of the canonical “tech books” (<i>Super Pumped</i>, <i>Hatching Twitter</i>, <i>Bad Blood</i>) are written by men. In <i>No Filter</i>, Sarah Frier finally puts the female gaze on a tech platform, an achievement that mirrors that of my favorite movie of 2020, <em>Portrait of A Lady On Fire</em>. From now-famous street food vendors in São Paulo to a North Korean expat ‘gramming his meals in Pyongyang, Instagram has transformed our lives the same way it transformed our poorly lit iPhone photos.</p>
<p>The book chronicles this transformation, taking us from the Florence study abroad trip where Filippo Brunelleschi’s shift to linear perspective inspired Kevin Systrom to change how the world communicates to the Calabasas mansion where Kylie Jenner first posted about her ‘Kylie’ lip kits.</p>
<p>It takes us through the Great Authentication Wars of 2012: Twitter shutting off its contacts to Instagram, Instagram shutting off its photo integration with Twitter, and reminds you that before they were behemoths testifying in front of Congress, social networks could be Greek God-level dramatic with the smallest feature update. To quote Zuck (or Ozymandias), “If we don’t create the thing that kills Facebook, someone else will. The Internet is not a friendly place. Things that don’t stay relevant don’t even get the luxury of leaving ruins. They disappear.”</p>
<p>It also leaves us in the present. In <i>No Filter</i>, Instagram head Adam Mosseri states during a Q&amp;A that the most important question Instagram faces is, “Are we good for people?” What do you think? Whether you believe in techno determinism or social determinism, this tome about how over one billion people found themselves living, working and playing on a photosharing app is a masterpiece filled with rich detail, Instagram in stark relief.</p>

<p>I like to re-examine how fragile the history of scientific progress is, and how easily humanity has been both derailed (sometimes for centuries) or leapt ahead. Alternatively, sometimes a scientific revolution happens quietly and slowly over a few decades even when it was seemingly derailed — even more interestingly, evolving very differently than its original, ardent proponents imagined.</p>
<p>An example of this case is nanotech, which is why I’ve been re-reading Dr. Eric Drexler’s <i>Radical Abundance</i> – the title is a goal my partners and I hope humanity achieves – and his more technical <i>Nanosystems</i>. Together, these books lay out the case for a nanotech-driven economy without most of today’s economic limits, but from a very “atoms-and-bits”-centric perspective. A well-realized possible outcome of this vision was depicted by Neal Stephenson, the sci-fi writer, in <i>The Diamond Age</i>. I’m not re-reading that now, but I heartily recommend it as part of a “nanotech book triptych”</p>
<p>The reason Drexler’s books merited re-reading this year for me is that many of his prerequisites for a nanotech economy of abundance are being achieved, but through computational and synthetic biology and related life-science breakthroughs. These platforms are getting living cells to do amazing things for humanity’s benefit. Ironically, it’s still his vision of robots following complex instructions in emergent systems, and even robots made of carbon — but not at all what he expected. A good lesson for everyone betting on radical innovation.</p>
<p>There’s still massive promise in “traditional” nanotech, and Deep Tech companies are doing everything from producing flawless slabs of diamond to transform computers and medical devices, to similar atomic-scale breakthroughs in quantum computing and sensor technology. In the end, who knows? Maybe we get both a fully-realized “diamond age” and the apotheosis of the “DNA age” we’re in right now. Humanity wins either way.</p>

<p>Chain convenience stores can feel as expendable and as predictable as the products they sell. Bright lights, pre-packaged food, headache medicine, cold drinks, and coffee — all arranged in the same places, all sold with the same smile. All pretty soulless.</p>
<p>But is it? One person’s banality is another person’s lifeline in this short, quiet, and surreal novel about a woman who works in a convenience store in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Keiko Furukura is both your most ordinary and extraordinary convenience store worker. As precise, practical and methodical as the Japanese aesthetic embodied by the convenience store where she works, Keiko has been in the job for years. And she is disconcertingly content with it, devoid of any of the ambitions or boredoms, or elations or sadness, shared by her friends and family, and likely you and me. Her particular outlook becomes the norm for how we start to see her world.</p>
<p>Like the store, and Keiko herself, Murata’s writing brings a stylized, calm cadence to the world she depicts. Dark comedy is there, but even if you don’t see it, the world goes on. And, because of that cadence, when Keiko’s life takes a turn, the effect is especially jarring — tense, even.</p>
<p>The novel is a fascinating peep into a slice of Tokyo life. And its brief length means you can consume it in one long sitting or over a few days — not a bad thing in a year when so many people have complained that they’ve been unable to read books.</p>
<p>Indeed, in this pandemic period, when our own lives have been reduced down to a small set of routines, <i>Convenience Store Woman</i> is a welcome escape, even as it resonates strongly.</p>

<p>To start, I must reveal my bias which is that Keynes is my favorite economist. Regardless of whether one shares my admiration for Keynes himself or his economic philosophy, <i>The Price of Peace</i> provides an economic history of his ideas and policy experiences which are inextricably linked to the major economic crises of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Keynes is credited as the intellectual architect of fiscal stimulus which felt particularly relevant in 2020 as we are experimenting with stimulus packages of unprecedented scale in the face of the pandemic.</p>
<p>In addition to being a fascinating history of ideas, the book presents a picture of Keynes’s life and relationship with his close circle of friends, the Bloomsbury Group, which included the likes of Bertrand Russell and Virginia Woolf. In American culture, I think we often obsess over individual genius but throughout history there are many groups of artists, writers and intellectuals who profoundly impacted one another’s works. Hoping to stumble on some such interdisciplinary salons in San Francisco when we open up again…</p>

<p>While we’re all thinking about the future of work, the only reason we have all the work we do <i>today</i> is because of government. All of tech exists, in part, because government-funded scientific research and business picked up the mantle. Today, as we’re struggling with how to get many places in America back to work, the best hope for &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/placing-bets-beyond-the-venture-hubs-of-new-york-and-silicon-valley/">comeback cities</a>&#8221; might be getting the band back together: government funding the science that business turns into the innovations of our daily lives.</p>
<p><i>Jump-Starting America</i> presents a plan to get places around America growing again — by boosting public funding in scientific research and development.</p>
<p>Gruber and Johnson argue we should place new research and technology hubs in places with the need for growth. They point to dozens of cities in the U.S. that have the preconditions for success: a large pool of educated workers, high-quality universities, and a low cost of living. All those places lack is the scientific infrastructure to become new centers of innovation, and the private sector ignores them. &#8220;What these places need is a jump start.&#8221;</p>

<p>Imagine 40-something you sitting in the back of a New York City cab and seeing your 20-something self walking down the street. That’s the way <i>You Again</i>, a novel by Debra Jo Immergut opens. Abigail Ward is a woman in her mid-40s with a comfortable job, a seemingly good marriage, two teen sons and a house in Brooklyn, but something is missing in her life and it begins to manifest itself in her visions of her younger self.</p>
<p>Whether these visions are real or not is beside the point. Ward, who was a talented young artist in her 20s, has skeletons long locked away in her mind’s closet and she begins behaving in odd ways. While her son becomes involved in antifa, she starts down a path of increasingly risky behaviors putting her ideal suburban life at considerable risk.</p>
<p>While we search with the author for reasons for this increasingly odd behavior, Immergut slowly reveals more information about why Ward appears to be unraveling.</p>
<p>It is safe to reveal that the protagonist was a promising artist, that she was admired by her teachers and her classmates for her budding talent, and that she had a gift for color. Her early paintings, completed at around the age she starts seeing herself, were getting noticed in the New York art community.</p>
<p>We learn that she let all of that slip away for the comforts and mundane realities of suburban living — having children, paying bills, buying groceries and living her life. She spends her days in a cubicle designing ad campaigns for a pharmaceutical company. It’s a considerable step down from the artistic vision she had of who she was and where she would end up at 45.</p>
<p>The story catapults along, a mystery wrapped in this woman’s behavioral enigma as these meetings reveal more information. While the book brings together a compelling plot line involving lost dreams of youth, personified by these visits with her younger self, I’m not sure it completely succeeds in carrying it through to a satisfying conclusion.</p>
<p>You will have to read it to reveal the details and the reason behind all of this, but I was left wondering, even when Ward’s motives are ultimately revealed, if I believed that this woman, this character as defined in these pages, would have behaved this way. I still admit to being riveted, to wanting to find the answers to these questions, I’m just not sure I was satisfied with the answers.</p>

<p>In a year of radical change and uncertainty at almost every turn, reading <i>Principles</i> kept me grounded through the turbulence of 2020. In his book, author Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, shares insights on life, investing, and much more.</p>
<p>Bridgewater, the world’s largest hedge fund with $130 billion in assets under management, was built upon a set of principles that serve as a cornerstone of the firm’s success. Those principles and decision-making frameworks, articulated in the book, have been profoundly impactful on our own leadership team at 645 Ventures. They have been especially valuable as we closed our largest fund to date and seek to build the firm through and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In the early days of building our fund, we’ve seen first-hand how important it is to distinguish luck from success, especially as it relates to intrinsic performance. Dalio emphasizes that the optimal frame of mind for great leaders is to be humble and open-minded in order to develop the strong mental maps that guide decision-making. This principle stands the test of time and repeatedly drives success, as do several others that Dailio introduces, such as “The who is more important than the what” in hiring, and the importance of self-reflection and owning your “ego and blind spots.”</p>
<p>The wisdom of <i>Principles</i> is universal enough to serve a range of purposes and people, and it is an especially important reference guide for this generation of founders daring to build iconic businesses. We aspire to live these principles in our own firm, and we often see them in the founding teams of our most successful portfolio companies.</p>

<p>I have to admit that the main reason I picked up Sophie Ward’s debut novel, <i>Love and Other Thought Experiments</i>, is because she was one of my favorite actors when I was a kid. If you grew up in the 1980s, you might remember Ward from movies like <i>Young Sherlock Holmes</i> and <i>Return to Oz</i>.</p>
<p>While continuing to act, Ward launched a writing career, too, publishing essays, short stories and the 2014 book “A Marriage Proposal; the importance of equal marriage and what it means for all of us.” She also somehow found time to complete a PhD at Goldsmiths, University of London, that focused on the use of narrative in philosophy of the mind.</p>
<p>All those paths converge in <i>Love and Other Thought Experiments</i>, which was long-listed for this year’s Booker Prize. The novel centers around Rachel and Eliza, a couple whose bond becomes fraught when Rachel is convinced an ant has crawled in her eye and started living in her head. Eliza, a scientist, quietly struggles to understand and sympathize with Rachel, even as the two embark on parenthood.</p>
<p>Each chapter of the book is based on a well-known thought experiment (theoretical scenarios that help people understand philosophical principles), and told from the perspective of different characters as they find their way, and each other, through alternative timelines.</p>
<p>Honestly, the book is hard to describe. You might assume that a book based on philosophical thought experiments would make for onerous reading, but Ward’s genre-crossing narrative is so deft and engaging that it was a surprise to realize I had reached the last few pages.</p>
<p>2020 has often felt surreal. I know I’m not the only person who has started experiencing time differently — days, weeks and months feel like an interminable slough, yet there is too much happening at once for our brains to fully comprehend. <i>Love and Other Thought Experiments</i> was comforting, reminding me that when almost everything feels unmoored, there are always fundamental truths to find and hold onto, in our beliefs and our relationships.</p>

<p>By now many of us have read <i>The Three Body Problem</i>, an incredible work of science-fiction and human imagination. Until this year, however, I hadn’t thought of reading the second and third books in the trilogy.</p>
<p>I was robbing myself of joy and didn’t know it.</p>
<p>Over the summer, during a week off, I powered through the sequel to <i>The Three Body Problem</i>, <i>The Dark Forest</i> and found it incredibly interesting. To avoid spoilers, I’ll just say that it made me rethink my lifelong desire to get off the planet and go somewhere else, and for humans to keep our outward push not only to the edges of our backyard — the Solar System — but also into the further reaches of our celestial neighborhood.</p>
<p>And then I read the next book, <i>Death’s End</i>. It’s long. There were a few moments when I was a little tired. But I cannot recall reading any other book in my life that was as consistently inventive and brilliant. It was so good, so surprising, so deep, so long and vivid, and so fundamentally human, that I even wound up reading a follow-up by a different author that started life as fanfic that was later made crypto-cannon. That was a first.</p>
<p><i>Death’s End</i> is the book I want you to read, but you can’t read it alone. You need prior context to fully juice it. But as you deserve the adventure, the expanse, the ring of hope and loss, and the contemplation of our species that it will bring you, the work required will be entirely worth it.</p>
<p>The book is imperfect. Anyone who has read Cixin Liu knows that he has weaknesses. These are perfectly illustrated in a prequel of sorts to <i>The Three Body Problem</i> trilogy, <i>Ball Lightning</i>, that I recently finished. He’s not great at writing female characters. And his protagonists can, at times, seem to have overlapping personality traits and origin stories.</p>
<p>But those mistakes are merely human, while the distances that <i>Death’s End</i> took me too were much more; they were cosmic. I want to tell you more but spoiling even a page would be a damned waste, so go re-read <i>The Three Body Problem</i> — which I did not do before digging into <i>The Dark Forest</i>, and it was an error — and then move through the trilogy. Please.</p>
<p>(And if those two books do ring your bell, <i>Anathem</i>, <i>The Mote In God’s Eye</i>, and <i>Fire Upon the Deep</i> should be on your list as well.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following several reports of a toxic workplace and abuse this year, Twitch today <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2020/12/09/introducing-our-new-hateful-conduct-harassment-policy/">announced</a> the introduction of a new hateful content and harassment <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/harassment/20210122/">policy</a> for its streamer community that will go into effect on Jan. 22, 2021. Under the updated guidelines, Twitch&#8217;s Safety team will change the way it evaluates potentially violating content. The company says it will now focus less on the perceived intent of a streamer&#8217;s statements or actions, and more on the content itself as well as its impact. Twitch also expanded, clarified, and toughened the guidelines around hateful conduct and harassment, including sexual harassment, which now has its own section.</p>
<p>As Twitch notes in a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2020/12/09/introducing-our-new-hateful-conduct-harassment-policy/">blog post detailing</a> the new policy, &#8220;words and actions have meaning and impact, even if your intent is not meant to be hurtful or cause harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company explains that even if the streamer and the target of the harassment isn&#8217;t bothered by what took place, others in the Twitch community may be. So Twitch will evaluate streamer&#8217;s behavior based on whether it&#8217;s abusive and in violation of the company&#8217;s guidelines, rather than only on the intent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitch says it may also take into consideration other factors when making determinations of punitive actions, including the reports from the targeted user or a mod team as well as other indications a behavior was unwanted, like a channel time-out or ban, as needed.</p>
<p>The new policy additionally makes clearer that certain behaviors are considered harassment and are prohibited. This includes claiming that the victim of a well-documented violent tragedy is a crisis actor or lying; encouraging others to DDoS, hack, doxx or swat another person; and inciting malicious raids of another person&#8217;s social media accounts. This means that even off-platform behavior is being wrapped into these new guidelines.</p>
<p>Twitch is also adding &#8220;caste,&#8221; &#8220;color&#8221; and &#8220;immigration status&#8221; to its list of identity characteristics it uses to determine what&#8217;s considered hateful content. The list already includes protected characteristics like race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, serious medical condition, and veteran status.</p>
<p>And while hate speech and symbols were already banned on Twitch, the guidelines now explicitly ban hate groups, membership in hate groups, and the sharing of hate group propaganda. It&#8217;s also banning black/brown/yellow/redface, unless being shown in an &#8220;explicitly educational context.&#8221; (This is not meant to be a new change, but rather the language here has been made clearer, Twitch says.)</p>
<p>In another notable change, displaying the Confederate flag is now prohibited given its &#8220;historic and symbolic association with slavery and white supremacist groups in the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sometimes, harassment may not be as obvious, so the new policy looks for ways users try to get away with abuse by using emotes instead of text. Under the updated policy, the way combinations of emotes are used will also be considered when the Safety team is reviewing malicious content &#8212; even if no text was involved.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, following complaints from the community about being too lax on sexual harassment, the new policy will now also break out sexual harassment under its own section and lower the bar as to what&#8217;s considered objectifying or harassing behavior.</p>
<p>New changes of note here include repeatedly commenting on someone&#8217;s perceived attractiveness &#8212; even if this is intended as a compliment &#8212; if the commenter has been given an indication that it&#8217;s unwelcome. This could mean the commenter has already been asked to stop, timed-out or channel-banned. Twitch will also prohibit making lewd or explicit comments about anyone&#8217;s sexuality or physical appearance &#8212; with no exception for public figures. Sending unwanted or unsolicited links to nude images and videos is also prohibited.</p>
<p>Twitch says it will soon offer three live sessions on different dates before the policy goes into effect, where it will walk creators through the various changes and give them a chance to ask questions. These will be later available on demand, too. The first is at 10 AM on 12/11 on  <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/creatorcamp">/CreatorCamp</a>, followed by a 10 AM session on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/twitch">/twitch</a> on 12/16, then a 12 PM session on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/creatorcamp">/CreatorCamp</a> on Jan. 1, 2021.</p>
<p>The company is not necessarily changing the penalties associated with various behaviors. But, because the policy is more detailed, Twitch believes it will be able to better tailor a punitive action to the appropriate level with regard to the severity of the violation. For instance, lower severity violations may receive a warning or a lighter suspension, while the most severe actions will result in indefinite suspensions, even on a first offense.</p>
<p>The blog post answers other questions about the rollout of the policy, like how older content is handled or how Twitch will handle harassment when reports aren&#8217;t filed, for example, among other things. (The policy will only apply to new content created on or after Jan. 22; reports from someone are needed for Twitch to take action, as it wants to avoid punishing users win situations where banter or trash talk was welcome).</p>
<p>Of course, many may wonder how well Twitch will be able to properly enforce its new guidelines, given that its own corporate culture has been called out in the recent past as being toxic and abusive.</p>
<p><a href="https://gamedaily.biz/article/1782/a-wave-of-abuse-allegations-sweeps-the-games-industry">Several</a> <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-10-08-twitch-staff-call-the-company-out-on-sexual-assault-racism-more">reports</a> <a href="https://gamedaily.biz/article/1899/twitch-hit-with-a-new-wave-of-abuse-allegations">from</a> former and current Twitch employees have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303185/twitch-sexual-harassment-assault-permanent-bans-streamers">documented</a> Twitch executives and staff engaging in or ignoring issues like sexism, racism, harassment and other abuse both in the workplace and in the broader Twitch community. That raises the question as to how well can a company &#8212; a place where men allegedly referred to women streamers as &#8220;boob streamers,&#8221; for example, or assaulted their coworkers &#8212;  properly enforce a sexual harassment policy? At Twitch, when a coworker called a colleague the c-word and spat on her, a manager asked what she did to deserve it, one report claimed. Many women <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-10-08-twitch-staff-call-the-company-out-on-sexual-assault-racism-more">also described sexual assault</a> in the workplace, including groping, forced kisses and unwanted massages.</p>
<p>Twitch has a history of making bad choices in other areas, too &#8212; like featuring a Black Lives Matter support video where only one line was spoken by a Black streamer; a Pride celebration video where Twitch said the &#8220;G&#8221; also stood for &#8220;gamer;&#8221; and the release of Hispanic Heritage Month emotes that allowed users to add sombreros or maracas to their emotes, as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-10-08-twitch-staff-call-the-company-out-on-sexual-assault-racism-more">reported</a> by Gamesindustry.biz.</p>
<p>The company says the policy rewrite had been underway since the beginning of the year, but the recent conversations with the community, including those about the sexual misconduct allegations, &#8220;absolutely informed&#8221; the changes.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Twitch CEO Emmett Shear <a href="https://twitter.com/eshear/status/1275234049070526464">publicly posted a memo to staff</a> that promised people&#8217;s voices had been heard on these matters, and that the company aimed to make changes. This policy is one step in that direction but Twitch still has a lot more to prove.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cruise" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cruise">Cruise <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Automation, the autonomous vehicle subsidiary of GM that also has backing from SoftBank Vision Fund, Honda and T. Rowe Price &amp; Associates, has started testing what it describes as fully driverless vehicles on public roads in San Francisco, the first milestone required to secure a permit to launch a shared, commercial service that can charge for rides.</p>
<p>Cruise CEO Dan Ammann, who took one of the company&#8217;s first driverless ride on public streets in San Francisco&#8217;s Sunset neighborhood, called it &#8220;wildly boring&#8221; and &#8220;a humble step&#8221; towards a commercial service.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ride itself was extremely natural and predictable, so it was kind of boring, but in all the right ways,&#8221; Ammann said in a call with reporters Wednesday. &#8220;And our goal is to make that same experience available to as many people as possible as soon and as safely as we can; and that could either be by taking a ride, or by getting say a self-driving delivery.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company released Wednesday a video of its first ride — with no human safety driver behind the wheel — in the Sunset neighborhood in San Francisco. There was a human safety operator in the vehicle, sitting in the passenger seat, the video shows.</p>
<p>Cruise&#8217;s testing of fully autonomous vehicles is in limited geographic area and in arguably one of San Francisco&#8217;s simpler environments; the video below shows the testing was conducted at night in a less congested part of San Francisco. However, it still marks progress by the company that had once aimed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/cruise-will-launch-a-commercial-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco-but-not-in-2019/">launch a commercial service by the end of 2019</a>.</p>
<p>For some in the industry, the caveats of having a safety operator in the passenger seat and launching in an &#8220;easier&#8221; and small geofenced area matter. Cruise says this is just the beginning and that it will eventually expand its driverless testing area, adding in more complicated environments over time, as well as removing the safety operator from the vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recognize this is both a trust race as well as a tech race,&#8221; Cruise spokesperson Milin Mehta said in an email. &#8220;Given that, during the beginning of our use of this permit, we will maintain a safety operator in the passenger seat. The safety operator has the ability to bring the vehicle to a stop in the event of an emergency, but does not have access to standard driver controls. Eventually, this safety operator will be fully removed.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pa7xU7PW-oM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Cruise started driverless testing in November with a dedicated fleet of five autonomous vehicles. The rest of Cruise&#8217;s fleet will be used to perform its regular testing with a human safety driver, some of which are used to deliver goods to area food banks.</p>
<p>The California DMV, the agency that regulates autonomous vehicle testing in the state, issued Cruise a permit in October that allows the company to test five autonomous vehicles without a driver behind the wheel on specified streets within San Francisco. Cruise has had a permit to test autonomous vehicles with safety drivers behind the wheel since 2015.</p>
<p>In February, Cruise received a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission allowing it to transport passengers in its autonomous vehicles in the state. However, it wasn&#8217;t until November that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/robotaxi-companies-get-the-green-light-to-charge-for-rides-in-california/">CPUC modified its regulations</a> to allow properly permitted companies the ability to charge for shared driverless rides. The bar to secure the permit is higher than it was before and includes a new government approval process that some in the industry have argued adds unnecessary bureaucracy that could delay deployments by more than two years.</p>
<p>Government process aside, Cruise has to show data that it tested driverless rides for a <a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=6442457808">30-day period</a> before it can qualify for the CPUC permit, according to information <a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=6442457808">on the CPUC website</a>.</p>
<p>AutoX, Nuro, Waymo and Zoox also have driverless testing permits. Waymo has tested what it describes as fully autonomous mode on public roads without a human safety driver behind the wheel, but it has yet to remove the operator from the vehicle altogether.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Does the United States have a startup visa? If not, what are the best visas for startup founders? </strong></p>
<p><strong>If my friend is a Dreamer in the U.S. who is undocumented but wants to found a startup, is it possible?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—Cheerful in Chile</strong></p>
<p>Hello Cheerful!</p>
<p>Much to be cheerful about for your friend today as DACA is back! DACA is “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals” and it provides work permits for people who were brought to the U.S. as children. Some of the basics to see if your friend might qualify for DACA are if they were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012; if they came to the U.S. before they turned 16; and if they have lived in the U.S. since June 15, 2007. <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/news/alerts/deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals-response-to-december-4-2020-order-in-batalla-vidal-et-al-v">USCIS announced</a> that it is accepting first-time DACA applications, renewals and advance parole documents to travel in two-year increments. This is great news for many folks for whom the U.S. is truly home, who have been educated here or served in the armed forces, and who want to further contribute to the tech ecosystem and economy.</p>
<p>Besides DACA, what other options are there for founders to move to the U.S. in 2021?</p>
<p>To be clear: The U.S. does not currently have a startup visa (you can read more about it in <a href="https://timesofsandiego.com/opinion/2020/12/04/bring-in-entrepreneurial-immigrants-to-create-more-jobs-for-americans/">my op-ed in the Times of San Diego</a>). According to the <a href="https://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/International-Experience-of-Startup-Visas.NFAP-Policy-Brief.July-2020.pdf">National Foundation for American Policy</a>, if the U.S. had established a startup visa in 2016, it would have created 1 million to 3.2 million jobs over 10 years. I’m doing all I personally can to contribute to the creation of the U.S. Startup Visa or possibly the resurrection of <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/international-entrepreneur-rule/hope-for-founders-even-without-international-entrepreneur-rule/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> as we look ahead to the Biden/Harris administration.</p>
<p>That being said, we have solutions, advanced information and creative options, some of which I can share here with you. Check out <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/044-7-of-the-most-startup-friendly-visas-explained/">7 of the Most Startup-Friendly Visas Explained</a>. Coming out of COVID in 2021, here are the most common visas and green cards that work for many founders. As immigration law is very nuanced, often people contact me to find specific alternative strategies that better suit their long-term goals.</p>
<h2>B-1 visa for business visitors</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/b-1-visa-visitors-business/">B-1</a> is a nonimmigrant (temporary) visa that enables entrepreneurs to explore the U.S. market. Under a B-1 visa, a founder or entrepreneur cannot be employed in the U.S., but can come for a business trip. This means you should not do any paid or unpaid work for a U.S. entity on your trip. However, some activities for founders are OK, such as meeting with investors, negotiating contracts, interviewing and hiring staff, and establishing an office. A B-1 visa typically allows for a maximum stay of one year — six months under the initial application and a six-month extension. It’s usually best to spend less than half the time in the U.S. on B status to ease future entries.</p>
<p>Founders who are citizens of designated countries, including Chile, can qualify for the <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/">ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization) visa waiver program</a>, allowing them to travel to the U.S. for business for 90 days or less without first obtaining a visa. ESTA cannot typically be extended or changed once you are in the United States.</p>
<h2>L-1A visa for intracompany transferee managers and executives<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Better late than never. So it might be said of the Boston- and New York-based seed-stage firm <a href="https://www.flybridge.com/">Flybridge Capital Partners</a>, which is today announcing that Anna Palmer has been promoted to general partner.</p>
<p>She is the first woman to hold the title at the 19-year-old firm.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice distinction to have and Palmer sounds enthusiastic excited about the role, but she also suggests that as a longtime member of Flybridge&#8217;s community, the transition to a full-time position with the firm should be relatively seamless.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Boston-based Harvard Law grad first met Flybridge cofounder Jeff Bussgang a decade ago as a student at the university, where Bussgang teaches on entrepreneurship. Flybridge later funded the second of two companies she has cofounded: <a href="https://www.joindough.com/">Dough Collective</a>, a membership community to discover, buy and save on products made by women. (Palmer previously co-founder Fashion Project, which collected online designer clothing donations, then delivered the proceeds from their sale to thousands of organizations before it ultimately <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/inno/stories/profiles/2016/04/08/the-fashion-project-is-closing-up-shop.html">sold itself </a>in 2016.)</p>
<p>By 2017, Palmer was cofounding the seed-stage firm <a href="https://www.xfactor.ventures/">XFactor Ventures</a> with another of Flybridge&#8217;s cofounders, Chip Hazard. At its launch, the organization featured nine partners altogether. Now it has 22 partners across six different cities who have collectively made 57 investments across two funds. Except for Hazard, all are women who run their own companies. They manage a collective $12 million in assets; Flybridge is among their limited partners.</p>
<p>XFactor&#8217;s overarching goal is to provide seed funding to other startups that are led entirely or in part by women founders. But it was also founded with the belief that &#8220;if we as women founders wanted to change things, we need more women VCs, and as women get experience [on both sides of the table] they will become general partners at other firms,&#8221; says Palmer.</p>
<p>That thesis seems to be paying off. Earlier this year, Aubrie Pagano, an XFactor investor whose online customizable shirt company Bow &amp; Drape was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2019/11/05/bow--drape-is-latest-brand-snapped-up-by-an-e-commerce-holding-company/?sh=7ef2b5e9611f">acquired</a> last year by a holding company, was brought into the New York venture firm <a href="https://alpaca.vc/">Alpaca</a> as a general partner. Palmer is the second proof point.</p>
<p>As for what she&#8217;ll be funding, Palmer told us in an interview earlier this week that she&#8217;ll be invest in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer companies and that her specific interest ties right now to &#8220;startups that have some sort of community-driven thesis, including commerce 3.0, marketplaces, and the future of everything economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>One area she&#8217;s is drilling into, for example, is &#8220;large marketplaces for local&#8221; given the opportunity she&#8217;s seeing. As she puts it, &#8220;Why is it easier for me to a Christmas ornament from Amazon than a store in Boston that&#8217;s five miles away?&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if deal-making is as frantic in Boston as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/technology/this-is-insanity-start-ups-end-year-in-a-deal-frenzy.html">elsewhere</a>, Palmer says it &#8220;absolutely&#8221; is owing to startups that are no longer limited by geography when it comes to fundraising. In the the Zoom era, a partner at every investment firm in the world is just a click away, and Flybridge is seeing it time and again in its portfolio. Indeed, she points to one <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">mobile gaming company funded by Flybridge that &#8220;ended up having gaming-specific funds interested from various geographies in just two to three days.&#8221; Last year, she notes, that wouldn&#8217;t be possible.</span></p>
<p>Because of the hyper-speed at which deals are moving, we wonder if it&#8217;s a tricky time to be diving in as a full-time VC, but Patterson doesn&#8217;t sound daunted. &#8220;You&#8217;re leaning on expertise, which is easier to do in markets that you know incredibly well and patterns you&#8217;ve seen before. Between founding two companies and XFactors, I&#8217;ve had time to develop those theses about where I think the world is going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flybridge is currently investing a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1752573/000175257418000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">sub-$100 million fund</a> that it closed in early 2019. Palmer says the firm &#8212; which prefers to lead seed rounds, whose first checks range from $500,000 to $2.5 million, and whose biggest win to date may be the database software company MongoDB (its market cap is $16.8 billion on Nasdaq) &#8212; is likely to fundraise again next summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As competition in the streaming service market heats up, services are looking for ways to differentiate their offerings. One area of increased interest &#8212; especially in light of fierce competition from newcomer Disney+ &#8212; is how to make their services more family-friendly. On this front, Netflix today announced the rollout of new features for families, the Kids Activity Report and Family Profiles, while CBS All Access added a Kids Mode and other updates aimed at families.</p>
<p>Streamers for years have marketed their services towards families with children, not only because these customers will often pay for higher-priced tiers offering more simultaneous logins, but also because strong kids&#8217; entertainment offerings helps to keep subscribers loyal.</p>
<p>Netflix has led on this front with investments in children&#8217;s programming and long time support for parental controls, a &#8220;Kids&#8221; profile, and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, the company says it&#8217;s testing new features to better improve the Netflix experience.</p>
<p>One is a new Kids Activity Report that provides parents with information about what their kids are streaming on Netflix.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084952" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084952" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2084952" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-gif-small.gif?w=400" alt="" width="400" height="571" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084952" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>This includes information about the child&#8217;s recently watched shows and interests, as well as suggested conversation topics and activities &#8212; like coloring pages or jokes &#8212;  that parents can use to engage kids further. This could help those families where parents may not be clued in as to how kids&#8217; are spending their time on Netflix &#8212; like those where the kids often watch independently or on their own device, for example.</p>
<p>It also arrives at a time when families are stuck at home due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has limited the options for kids&#8217; entertainment, leading to increased screen time. A feature that turns something parents worry about &#8212; too much screen time &#8212; into offline activities for family engagement could help this increased Netflix usage been seen in a more positive light.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2084956" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Netflix says the report, which is sent via email, is being tested globally in select markets.</p>
<p>Another test involves a Family Profile, that focuses on helping family members find programming they can all watch together. Like other profiles, the Family Profile would be accessed from the main screen with its own icon and maintain its own recommendations and watch lists, separate from an individual&#8217;s own profile.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2084957" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_1.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Unlike a kids&#8217; user profile, which has a specific age range depending on the settings, the Family Profile would feature a selection of titles that extend up to PG-13 for movies TV-14 for shows.</p>
<p>This content can still be surprisingly hard to find these days, as much of what some streamers consider &#8220;family&#8221; viewing are titles that are actually aimed at little kids &#8211;titles that are often painful for full-grown adults to sit through, that is. Family-friendly profiles could instead include less of this preschool fare, perhaps, and more of <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/enola_holmes">popular</a> family titles like the recent hit, &#8220;Enola Holmes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Netflix suggested you also might find titles like the upcoming animated short &#8220;<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81332733">Canvas</a>,&#8221; animated special &#8220;<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81010807">A Trash Truck Christmas</a>,&#8221; or live action family movie &#8220;<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80994666">We Can Be Heroes,&#8221;</a> on a Family profile.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084958" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084958" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2084958" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084958" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>This test is also running globally, but only on the TV, Netflix says.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163863/netflix-family-profile-kids-activity-report-data-movies-tv-shows-individual">The Verge</a> first reported on the tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re always looking for new ways to improve the Netflix experience for members of all ages,&#8221; a Netflix spokesperson told TechCrunch about its new features. &#8220;We run these tests in different countries and for different periods of time &#8211; and only make them broadly available if people find them useful,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>Of course, new family features could also help Netflix overcome some of the customer backlash against its service following the &#8220;Cuties&#8221; scandal earlier this year.</p>
<p>The French film and award winner, was meant to be social commentary on the hypersexualization of children, but was condemned for exploiting children instead, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/10/20/netflix-tiny-subscriber-growth-pegged-cuties-scandal/5991684002/">possibly even denting Netflix subscriber growth.</a> (The controversy was heavily tied to the<a href="https://adage.com/article/digital/how-netflixs-shocking-movie-poster-landed-it-middle-qanons-child-crusade/2275891"> QAnon #SavetheChildren conspiracy</a>, too, though not all customers objecting to the film knew they were participating in the broader movement driven by QAnon.)</p>
<p>Netflix was not the only streamer to launch family-friendly features today.</p>
<p>In addition, CBS All Access today announced the roll out of new family-friendly features of its own. However, it&#8217;s playing catch-up with other streamers with its launches.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084951" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084951" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2084951" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="361" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg?resize=680,361 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg?resize=1536,815 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084951" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CBS All Access</p></div></p>
<p>The company says it will add a new feature that allows families to create up to 6 profiles per account and manage those using a &#8220;Kids Mode&#8221; option. This allows parents to create profiles that limit content to younger and older children based on content ratings. In addition, the service&#8217;s existing parental controls (the PIN-based controls) will also be available across these new profiles.</p>
<p>The features arrived alongside the addition of nearly 800 more episodes of kids&#8217; content, including Nick Jr. favorites like <em>Paw Patrol, Blaze and the Monster Machines, Blue&#8217;s Clues, Bubble Guppies, Dora the Explorer, Shimmer and Shine</em>, and others. The service already had over 1,000 episodes of children&#8217;s programming before the new shows arrived, including <em>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Danger Mouse, Lassie, George of the Jungle,</em> and <em>Mr. Magoo.</em> A SpongeBob spinoff, <em>Kamp Koral</em>, will arrive next year, along with <em>The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run. </em></p>
<p>In related news, a top streaming platform, Fire TV, is also looking to better serve multi-person households and families with its latest changes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084950" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084950" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2084950" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084950" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Fire TV today offers a platform for engaging with streaming apps, games and other content, but organizes this into an interface complete with tailored recommendations and other features. Its redesign, first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/amazon-redesigns-fire-tv-introduces-new-fire-tv-stick-and-low-cost-fire-tv-stick-lite/">announced in September</a>, rolls out starting today.</p>
<p>The update brings a brand-new look-and-feel to Fire TV, which now reorganizes the navigation and improves how it makes recommendations. But one of the bigger changes is that Fire TV users &#8212; including kids &#8212; will now each get their own profile for a more personalized experience.</p>
<p>All the updates are rolling out starting today. Netflix&#8217;s tests, however, won&#8217;t reach all users at this time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/getaccepts-workflow-and-e-signature-platform-for-sales-secures-7m-series-a-funding/">Last year</a> all-in-one digital sales platform <a href="http://GetAccept.com">GetAccept</a> raised a $7 million Series A funding. The platform, which wraps-in video, live chat, proposal design, document tracking and e-signatures, has now raised $20 million in Series B funding, led by Bessemer Venture Partners, as the company expands its platform aimed at SMBs. The funding comes as the pandemic means SMBs have largely shifted to remote and so has their digital sales process.</p>
<p>Last year the funding was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dn-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dn-capital">DN Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from BootstrapLabs, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and a number of Spotify&#8217;s early investors. This round brings GetAccept&#8217;s total financing raised to $30M. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/getaccept" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="getaccept">GetAccept <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> competes with several separate tools, including well-financed solutions like DocSend, PandaDoc,  Showpad, Highspot, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/docusign" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="docusign">DocuSign <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Adobe Sign.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015 by Swedish entrepreneurs and Y Combinator alumni Samir Smajic, Mathias Thulin, Jonas Blanck, and Carl Carell, GetAccept has expanded from 30 to now 100+ employees over the last 18 months with offices across US and EU countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Smajic said: “We believe in the power of relationships and want to bring personalized and engaging interactions back to the online sales process. We saw this digital sales shift and change in behavior back in 2015, which is why we founded GetAccept in the first place. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated and forced B2B buyers and sellers to go digital, which has placed digital sales models high up on the company agendas. We aim to be the online place where every B2B business happens, in a personal way.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Twitter and Facebook scrambled to institute <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/twitter-contested-election-misinformation-policy-trump/">new policies for the 2020 election</a>, YouTube was&#8230; mostly quiet. The platform didn&#8217;t make any flashy announcements about a crackdown on election-related misinformation, nor did it really fully grapple with its massive role in distributing information during what was widely regarded as an extremely volatile time for American democracy.</p>
<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden won the presidential election on November 7, but <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/youtube" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="youtube">YouTube <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> decided to <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election/">wait until the &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; deadline</a>, when audits and recounts must be wrapped up at the state level, to enforce a set of rules against election misinformation.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election/">a new blog post</a> out Wednesday, the world&#8217;s second biggest social network explained itself — sort of:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yesterday was the safe harbor deadline for the U.S. Presidential election and enough states have certified their election results to determine a President-elect. Given that, we will start removing any piece of content uploaded today (or anytime after) that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, in line with our approach towards historical U.S. Presidential elections. For example, we will remove videos claiming that a Presidential candidate won the election due to widespread software glitches or counting errors. We will begin enforcing this policy today, and will ramp up in the weeks to come.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>YouTube clarified that while its users were allowed to spread misinformation about an undecided election, content claiming that &#8220;widespread fraud or errors&#8221; influenced the result of a <em>past</em> election will not be allowed. And from YouTube&#8217;s perspective, which accommodated the Trump administration&#8217;s many empty challenges to the results, the election was only decided yesterday.</p>
<p>The four days between November 3 and November 7 were fraught, plagued by false victory claims from President Trump and his supporters and concerns about political violence as online misinformation, already a pervasive threat, kicked into overdrive. Rather than wading into all that as Twitter and even the ever reluctant-to-act Facebook did, YouTube mostly opted to sit back and wait for history to take its course. The company was more comfortable universally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/youtube-voting-misinformation-election/">pointing users toward real information</a> than making tough calls and actively purging false claims from its platform.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Close US election results plunge social media into nightmare misinformation scenario&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/trump-election-2020-premature-victory-facebook-twitter/embed/#?secret=vXZwy7k1ZH" data-secret="vXZwy7k1ZH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>YouTube doesn&#8217;t go to great lengths to explain itself these days, much less make realtime platform policy decisions in a transparent way. Twitter has pioneered that approach, and while its choices aren&#8217;t always clear or decisive, its transparency and open communication is admirable. If Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/twitter-new-york-post/">doesn&#8217;t always get it right</a>, YouTube fails to even step up to the plate, making few real efforts to adapt to the rapidly mutating threats posed by misinformation online.</p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s opaque decision making process is compounded by the also opaque nature of online video, which is vastly more difficult for journalists to search and index than text-based platforms. The result is that YouTube had largely gotten away with relatively little scrutiny compared to its stature in the social media world. It&#8217;s bizarre to see Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey called before the Senate Judiciary Committee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/dorsey-zuckerberg-hearing-senate-judiciary-election/">without even a passing thought</a> to bringing in YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki as well. In spite of its massive influence and two billion users, the social video behemoth is barely on the radar for lawmakers.</p>
<p>If YouTube&#8217;s strategy is that communicating less attracts less attention, unfortunately it appears to be working. The company is bound to be anxious about getting dragged into federal and state-level antitrust investigations, particularly with state lawsuits that could try to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/08/facebook-ftc-states-antitrust-lawsuit/">force Facebook and Instagram apart</a>.</p>
<p>The Justice Department is already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/">targeting Google with a historic antitrust suit</a> focused on its search business, but that doesn&#8217;t preclude other antitrust actions from taking aim at YouTube. Keeping its head down may have worked for YouTube during four years of Trump, but President-Elect Biden is more interested in inoculating people against misinformation rather than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/trump-flu-covid-misinformation-facebook-and-twitter/">super-spreading it</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://getsquire.com/">Squire</a>, a startup that sells software to barbershops, has raised $59 million in a round led by Iconiq Capital. The raise is $45 million in equity capital, and $15 million in debt financing.</p>
<p>The round comes just months after <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/squir-technologies-4" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="squir-technologies-4">Squire <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> closed its $34 million Series B, led by CRV. With the new financing, Squire has nearly tripled its valuation, up from $85 million in June to $250 million today. Other investors in the company include Tiger Global and Trinity Ventures.</p>
<p>What happened? Squire’s revenue went from zero in March, when all barber shops closed, to between $10 million to $20 million in ARR just 10 months later, TechCrunch has learned. The growth indicates how the next wave of barbershops will be built atop digital technology, instead of offline processes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We just took off like a lightning bolt,” co-founder Dave Salvant tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Salvant and Squire’s other co-founder, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/songe-laron" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="songe-laron">Songe LaRon, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> began the business as a back-end barbershop management tool for independent businesses in 2016. Squire lets businesses schedule appointments, offer loyalty programs and install contactless and cashless payment. The team claims that barbershop operations are more complex than many other types of small businesses because there are multiple parties transacting, plus customers might check out different services from different barbers all within one service.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CqqJyz3k02"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/squire-haircuts-coronavirus-crv-34-million-series-b/">Squire balances clean fades with the coronavirus</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Squire balances clean fades with the coronavirus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/squire-haircuts-coronavirus-crv-34-million-series-b/embed/#?secret=CqqJyz3k02" data-secret="CqqJyz3k02" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That’s where Squire comes in — to be a point of sale to manage those confusing transactions.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has threatened the livelihoods of small and medium-sized business owners, making it harder for them to secure loans or financing to undergo tricky times. Salvant says that Squire took on $15 million in debt financing to create a banking-as-a-service feature for these business owners.</p>
<p>“This market is underserved by traditional financial institutions,” Salvant said. “And we think there&#8217;s opportunities to help these owners with financial tools.”</p>
<p>Going forward, Squire plans to expand into new markets, including Australia, Canada, and the U.K. The majority of capital raised will go toward hiring new sales and marketing professionals.</p>
<p>Squire’s total staff is currently 100 people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Haters gonna hate, IPOs gonna pop.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the story today as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/how-doordash-and-c3-ai-can-defend-their-red-hot-ipo-valuatons/">richly valued DoorDash and C3.ai</a>, two American technology unicorns, saw their values skyrocket after they began trading today.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="doordash">DoorDash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> shares are up just under 83% to $186.51. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/doordash-ipo-pricing/">priced its IPO at $102 per share</a> last night, ahead of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/doordash-amps-its-ipo-range-ahead-of-blockbuster-ipo/">raised IPO range of $90 to $95 per share</a>.</p>
<p>And as I write to you, shares of C3.ai are up an even sharper 151% to $105.58, after pricing at $42 per share earlier today. The company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/the-ipo-market-looks-hot-as-airbnb-and-c3-ai-raise-price-targets/">raised its IPO range from $31 to $34 per share to $36 to $38 per share</a>.</p>
<p>It appears that public investors are, again, more exuberant about the growth and profit prospects of select late-stage unicorns than private investors. Earlier this year DoorDash <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/after-ipo-delays-doordash-confirms-400m-raise/">raised $400 million at a valuation of around $16 billion</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Today on a <em>non-diluted </em>basis, the company is worth around $59 billion. That figure rises sharply if you include shares that could be created from the exercise of options and other forms of compensation.</p>

<p>TechCrunch is speaking with DoorDash&#8217;s CFO and the CEO of C3.ai later today.</p>
<p>For a passel of companies coming next, the day&#8217;s tidings are more than welcome. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="airbnb">Airbnb <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> may be able to secure a higher per-share price when it prices later today. And with Affirm and Upstart and Roblox and Wish quickly approaching their final IPO prices, the explosive early trading of today&#8217;s debuts could provide them with a boost as well.</p>
<p>Why are the two companies up so sharply? Your guess is as good as mine, but factors could include &#8212; as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/how-doordash-and-c3-ai-can-defend-their-red-hot-ipo-valuatons/">noted this morning</a> &#8212; a boom in retail trading and a possibly constrained float, among other factors. Regardless, for both firms it has been a dream week, first raising more money than they likely anticipated, then receiving a rapturous welcome from public investors.</p>
<p>How should we understand the new valuations? It&#8217;s too soon to fully grok what is going on. More trading with more shares in motion will help clarify the two companies&#8217; more stable value.</p>
<p>Until then we&#8217;re going to sit back and watch Yahoo Finance.</p>

<p>The Chrome team also today announced that it will launch <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/">Manifest V3</a> in mid-January, when Chrome 88 hits the stable channel. That&#8217;s something a lot of extension developers &#8212; especially those working on ad blockers &#8212; have been dreading. Manifest V3 introduces new limits for extension developers that are meant to prevent them from accessing too much data from their users, but it also puts relatively severe limits on how extensions can interact with a web page. Google now says it has made some changes to V3 based on the feedback it has received, but this is probably not the last we&#8217;ve heard of this.</p>
<p>Overall, however, if you&#8217;re a user, the most welcome news from today&#8217;s event may be that, after working to reduce the overall memory footprint of the browser with a couple of updates earlier this year, the team is now tackling the V8 JavaScript engine and reducing its memory footprint as well. In addition, the team found some new ways to speed up V8 and eliminate any parsing pauses by loading a site&#8217;s JavaScript files in parallel to make sure they can be used the moment a page wants to execute them.</p>
<p>The team also continues to work on new ways to speed up the browsing experience, too. The team is doing this by actually changing the way it compiles Chrome, something it first talked about this summer, when these changes arrived in the Chrome beta channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on looking at the usage patterns of Chrome, we asked ourselves &#8212; with insights of how users are actually using Chrome &#8212; are there things we could do in how we compile chrome itself that would make it more efficient? And we found that the answer is yes,&#8221; Google&#8217;s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ben-galbraith" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ben-galbraith">Ben Galbraith <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> told me. &#8220;[&#8230;] We call it profile-guided optimization and in [certain] scenarios, we found up to 10 percent faster page loads due to these task-specific compiler optimizations.&#8221; Most of the scenarios are in the 2 to 5 percent range, but given how mature most browser engines are now, even that&#8217;s a significant difference.</p>
<p>The team is also recently worked on <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/11/tab-throttling-and-more-performance.html">improving tab throttling</a> and how it allocates resources to foreground and background tasks. Galbraith noted that the plan is to do more work along these lines moving forward.</p>
<p>Developers, too, will get some new tools to improve the performance of their web apps as part of Google&#8217;s <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/">Web Vital initiative</a>, which aims to provide developers with the right performance metrics to help them understand how users experience their web apps. Google Search will use some of these core metrics in its rankings, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/11/timing-for-page-experience">starting May 2021</a>. Google already highlights this data in the Chrome Experience Report, in its Search Console and elsewhere, but today it is also launching an open-source <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-vitals-report">Web Vitals Report</a> tool to help developers create custom visualization based on the Web Vitals data they&#8217;ve sent to Google Analytics. Google Analytics doesn&#8217;t currently surface this data in the context of Web Vitals, so developers can now run these reports using Google&#8217;s own <a href="https://web-vitals-report.web.app/">hosted tool</a> or fork the code and run them on their own infrastructure.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you look at the different metrics, we&#8217;re focused on the things that we understand the most: loading metrics, visual stability and the like, and interaction &#8212; so when you click on something, something actually happens. The mission for these metrics is to be able to really understand the quality of the experience that you&#8217;ve got.,&#8221; Google&#8217;s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/dion-almaer" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="dion-almaer">Dion Almaer <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> explained.</p>
<p>And there is more. On the privacy front, Google continues to iterate on its Privacy Sandbox model. It&#8217;s adding two new experiments here with the <a href="https://web.dev/conversion-measurement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.dev/conversion-measurement/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1607620334082000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGflcW9zqrh4dPi8O7GtOzzKCR8EQ">Click Conversion Measurement API</a> to measures ad conversions without using cross-site identifiers and the new <a href="https://web.dev/trust-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.dev/trust-tokens/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1607620334082000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6VwWDlb284wMtOZiFg6YYef_vpw">Trust Token APIs</a> that allow a site to issue a cryptographic token to a user it trusts. The idea behind this token is that the browser can then use this token in another context as well to evaluate that a user is who they say they are &#8212; and not a bot or an impostor with malicious intent.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also new features for developers who want to write PWAs, updates to how developers can accept payments in Chrome and more.</p>

<p>The draft Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act are due to be unveiled by the Commission next week, though the EU lawmaking process means it&#8217;ll likely be years before either becomes law.</p>
<p>The Commission has said the legislative proposals will set clear responsibilities for how platforms must handle illegal and harmful content, as well as applying a set of additional responsibilities on the most powerful players which are intended to foster competition in digital markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It also plans to legislate around political ads transparency &#8212; under a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">Democracy Action Plan</a> &#8212; but not til Q3 next year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe to limit how big tech can push its own services and use third-party data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/europe-to-limit-how-big-tech-can-push-its-own-services-and-use-third-party-data/embed/#?secret=qc60e0fHNA" data-secret="qc60e0fHNA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On the challenge of regulating digital content without damaging vibrant online expression they advocate for a more nuanced approach to &#8220;legal-but-harmful&#8221; content &#8212; pressing a &#8216;freedom of speech is not freedom of reach&#8217; position by urging EU lawmakers not to limit their policy options to binary takedowns (which they suggest would benefit the most powerful platforms).</p>
<p>Instead they suggest tackling problem (but legal) speech by focusing on content visibility as key and ensuring consumers have genuine choice in what they see &#8212; implying support for regulation to require that users have meaningful controls over algorithmic feeds (such as the ability to switch off AI curation entirely).</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, the present conversation is too often framed through the prism of content removal alone, where success is judged solely in terms of ever-more content removal in ever-shorter periods of time. Without question, illegal content &#8212; including terrorist content and child sexual abuse material &#8212; must be removed expeditiously. Indeed, many creative self-regulatory initiatives proposed by the European Commission have demonstrated the effectiveness of an EU-wide approach,&#8221; they write.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet by limiting policy options to a solely stay up-come down binary, we forgo promising alternatives that could better address the spread and impact of problematic content while safeguarding rights and the potential for smaller companies to compete. Indeed, removing content cannot be the sole paradigm of Internet policy, particularly when concerned with the phenomenon of ‘legal-but-harmful’ content. Such an approach would benefit only the very largest companies in our industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We therefore encourage a content moderation discussion that emphasises the difference between illegal and harmful content and highlights the potential of interventions that address how content is surfaced and discovered. Included in this is how consumers are offered real choice in the curation of their online environment.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On illegal hate speech, EU lawmakers eye binding transparency for platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/on-illegal-hate-speech-eu-lawmakers-eye-binding-transparency-for-platforms/embed/#?secret=YjLdOZ7F9M" data-secret="YjLdOZ7F9M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Twitter does already let users switch between a chronological content view or &#8216;top tweets&#8217; (aka, its algorithmically curated feed) &#8212; so arguably it already offers users &#8220;real choice&#8221; on that front. That said, its platform can also inject some (non-advertising) content into a user&#8217;s feed regardless of whether a person has elected to see it &#8212; if its algorithms believe it&#8217;ll be of interest. So not quite 100% real choice then.</p>
<p>Another example is Facebook &#8212; which does offer a switch to turn off algorithmic curation of its News Feed. But it&#8217;s so buried in settings most normal users are unlikely to discover it. (Underlying the importance of default settings in this context; algorithmic defaults with buried user choice do already exist on mainstream platforms &#8212; and don&#8217;t sum to meaningful user control over what they&#8217;re exposed to.)</p>
<p>In the letter, the companies go on to write that they support &#8220;measures towards algorithmic transparency and control, setting limits to the discoverability of harmful content, further exploring community moderation, and providing meaningful user choice&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that it’s both more sustainable and more holistically effective to focus on limiting the number of people who encounter harmful content. This can be achieved by placing a technological emphasis on visibility over prevalence,&#8221; they suggest, adding: &#8220;The tactics will vary from service to service but the underlying approach will be familiar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission has signalled that algorithmic transparency will be a key plank of the policy package &#8212; saying in October that the proposals will include requirements for the biggest platforms to provide information on the way their algorithms work when regulators ask for it.</p>
<p>Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said then that the aim is to &#8220;give more power to users &#8212; so algorithms don’t have the last word about what we get to see, and what we don’t get to see&#8221; &#8212; suggesting requirements to offer a certain level of user control could be coming down the pipe for the tech industry&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/01/wtf-is-dark-pattern-design/">dark patterns</a>.</p>

<p>In their letter, the four companies also express support for harmonizing notice-and-action rules for responding to illegal content, to clarify obligations and provide legal certainty, as well as calling for such mechanisms to &#8220;include measures proportionate to the nature and impact of the illegal content in question&#8221;.</p>
<p>The four are also keen for EU lawmakers to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach for regulating digital players and markets. Although given the DSA/DMA split that looks unlikely; there will at least be two sizes involved in Europe&#8217;s rebooted rules, and most likely a lot more nuance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recommend a tech-neutral and human rights-based approach to ensure legislation transcends individual companies and technological cycles,&#8221; they go on, adding a little dig over the controversial <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">EU Copyright directive</a> &#8212; which they describe as a reminder there are &#8220;major drawbacks in prescribing generalised compliance solutions&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our rules must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate and allow for the harnessing of sectoral shifts, such as the rise of decentralised hosting of content and data,&#8221; they go on, arguing a &#8220;far-sighted approach&#8221; can be ensured by developing regulatory proposals that &#8220;optimise for effective collaboration and meaningful transparency between three core groups: companies, regulators and civil society&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here the call is for &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">co-regulatory oversight grounded in regional and global norms&#8221;, as they put it, to ensure Europe&#8217;s rebooted digital rules are &#8220;effective, durable, and protective of individuals’ rights&#8221;.  </span></p>
<p>The joint push for collaboration that includes civic society contrasts with Google&#8217;s public response to the Commission&#8217;s DSA/DMA consultation &#8212; which mostly focused on trying to lobby against ex ante rules for gatekeepers (like Google will surely be designated).</p>
<p>Though on liability for illegal content front the tech giant also lobbied for clear delineating lines between how illegal material must be handled and what’s “lawful-but-harmful.”</p>
<p>The full official detail of the DSA and DMA proposals are expected next week.</p>
<p>A Commission spokesperson declined to comment on the specific positions set out by Twitter et al today, adding that the regulatory proposals will be unveiled &#8220;soon&#8221;. (<a href="https://twitter.com/vestager/status/1334186227327700992">December 15 is the slated date</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">Last week</a> &#8212; setting out the bloc&#8217;s strategy towards handling politically charged information and disinformation online &#8212; values and transparency commissioner, Vera Jourova, confirmed the forthcoming DSA will not set specific rules for the removal of &#8220;disputed content&#8221;.</p>
<p>Instead, she said there will be a beefed up code of practice for tackling disinformation &#8212; extending the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/tech-and-ad-giants-sign-up-to-europes-first-weak-bite-at-fake-news/">current voluntary arrangement</a> with additional requirements. She said these will include algorithmic accountability and better standards for platforms to cooperate with third-party fact-checkers. Tackling bots and fake accounts and clear rules for researchers to access data are also on the (non-legally-binding) cards.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not want to create a ministry of truth. Freedom of speech is essential and I will not support any solution that undermines it,&#8221; said Jourova. &#8220;But we also cannot have our societies manipulated if there are organized structures aimed at sewing mistrust, undermining democratic stability and so we would be naive to let this happen. And we need to respond with resolve.”</p>

<p>If you have not yet secured your seat on the space-race express, do so now while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_source=&amp;promo=1weekleftpost&amp;display=true">late-registration prices</a> remain in play — prices go up December 15. You’ll also find <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_source=&amp;promo=1weekleftpost&amp;display=true">discounts for groups</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_source=&amp;promo=1weekleftpost&amp;display=true">students</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_source=&amp;promo=1weekleftpost&amp;display=true">active military/government employees</a>.</p>
<p>Ready to place your early-stage startup in orbit with industry movers and shakers — and pitch your startup to attendees during the event? Buy a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_source=&amp;promo=1weekleftpost&amp;display=true">Space Startup Exhibitor Pass</a>. We even offer a super budget-friendly, expo-only pass for $25 (<strong>Note:</strong> This does not include networking, access to the main-stage programming or the free Extra Crunch membership).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Not all virtual conferences are created equal. Michael McCarthy, the CEO of Repositax, found unexpected benefits:</p>
<blockquote><p>The online experience was far more efficient than I anticipated, and the video on demand was a huge benefit. I could attend without disrupting my customer work by moving between the main stage and breakout presentations knowing I could catch anything I missed later.</p></blockquote>
<p>The two-day <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_source=&amp;promo=1weekleftpost&amp;display=#2f65e915-5963-4a04-be6a-667c01da1e6d">event agenda</a> practically vibrates with opportunity. Let’s look at just a few of the many sessions waiting for you:</p>

You’ll find six of these breakout sessions spanning the two days. Check the agenda for exact days and times and plan your schedule accordingly. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to find money, um, fast.</li>
<li><strong>Founders in Focus Series:</strong> TechCrunch editors will sit down and talk with four different founders poised to be the next big disruptors in the space industry. Don’t miss this four-part series with Araz Feyzi, co-founder of Kayhan Space; Will Edwards, CEO of Firehawk Aerospace; Pawan Chandana, co-founder of Skyroot; and Yotam Ariel, co-founder of Bluefield Technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Pitch Feedback Session:</strong> Join us for a pitch feedback session open to all startups exhibiting at TC Sessions: Space 2020 and moderated by TechCrunch staff.</li>
</ul>
<p>This may be our first foray into space technology, but we’ve hosted many TC Sessions. Here’s what Karin Maake, senior director of communications at FlashParking, told us about her experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>TC Sessions isn&#8217;t just an educational opportunity, it&#8217;s a real networking opportunity. Everyone was passionate and open to creating pilot programs or other partnerships. That was the most exciting part. And now — thanks to a conference connection — we’re talking with Goodyear&#8217;s Innovation Lab.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Nutanix.com">Nutanix</a> announced today that it was bringing in former VMware executive Rajiv Ramaswami as president and CEO. Ramaswami replaces co-founder Dheeraj Pandey, who announced his plans to retire in August.</p>
<p>The new CEO brings 30 years of industry experience to the position, including stints with Broadcom, Cisco, Nortel and IBM &#8212; in addition to his most recent gig at VMware as chief operating officer of Products and Cloud Services.</p>
<p>At his position at VMware, Ramaswami had the opportunity to see <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nutanix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nutanix">Nutanix <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> up close as a key competitor, and he now has the opportunity to lead the company into its next phase. &#8220;I have long admired Nutanix as a formidable competitor, a pioneer in hyperconverged infrastructure solutions and a leader in cloud software,&#8221; he said in a statement. He hopes to build on his industry knowledge to continue growing the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nutanix up 131% on first day of trading&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/30/nutanix-up-131-on-first-day-of-trading/embed/#?secret=fOsHgRWVEf" data-secret="fOsHgRWVEf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Sohaib Abbasi, lead independent director of Nutanix, says that as a candidate, Ramaswami&#8217;s experience really stood out. &#8220;Rajiv distinguished himself among the CEO candidates with his rare combination of operational discipline, business acumen, technology vision and inclusive leadership skills,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says the hiring makes a lot of sense, as VMware is quickly becoming the company&#8217;s primary competitor. &#8220;Nutanix and VMware want to be the same in the future &#8212; the virtualization and workload portability Switzerland across cloud and on premise compute infrastructures,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, it allows Nutanix to grab a talented executive. &#8220;So hiring Ramaswami brings both an expert for multi-cloud to the Nutanix helm, as well as weakening a key competitor from a talent perspective,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Nutanix was founded in 2009. It raised more than $600 million from firms like Khosla Ventures, Lightspeed Ventures, Sapphire Ventures, Fidelity and Wellington Management, according to Crunchbase data. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/30/nutanix-up-131-on-first-day-of-trading/">company went public in 2016</a>. Investors seem pleased by the announcement, with the company stock price up 1.29% as of publication.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sweden’s <a href="https://www.mtg.com">MTG</a> is making a significant acquisition in the mobile gaming industry. The company is acquiring <a href="https://www.hutch.io">Hutch Games</a>, the London-based game studio behind popular mobile racing games such as Rebel Racing, F1 Manager and Top Drives.</p>
<p>The acquisition is an important one for MTG as the company is spending $275 million right away and setting aside another $100 million for performance-based payments.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with MTG, you probably know its portfolio companies. Over the past few years, MTG has acquired ESL and DreamHack to become an esports leader.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MTG has also acquired InnoGames and Kongregate for their popular web-based and mobile games. And it sounds like MTG isn’t done just yet, as the company plans to acquire more companies in the near future.</p>
<p>MTG explains why the acquisition makes sense in its <a href="https://www.mtg.com/press-releases/mtg-acquires-hutch-a-leading-developer-and-publisher-of-mobile-racing-games/">announcement</a>. Hutch Games isn’t focused on a single game. It has built a portfolio of successful games, which is always a good sign for future growth.</p>
<p>The game studio has also licensed some well-known brands, such as F1. And MTG believes that F1 Manager, Top Drives and Rebel Racing still have a lot of growth potential. Free-to-play mobile games have become games-as-a-service, so you want to keep them popular over the long run.</p>
<p>When it comes to long-term potential, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hutch" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hutch">Hutch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Games also has more games in the pipeline for 2021 and 2022. Finally, it’s a cost-effective studio, as most employees are developers.</p>
<p>During the first nine months of 2020, Hutch Games generated $56.3 million in revenue and $13.3 million in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Hutch Games investors included Backed VC, Index Ventures, Initial Capital and angel investor Chris Lee.</p>
<p>As you can see, free-to-play games can be lucrative. That’s why there will be some consolidation in the future. Some companies will use their deep pockets or take advantage of debt to build out big portfolios and the real estate of your home screen, one game at a time.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/powerplatform/2020/12/09/automating-automation-with-rpa-and-process-mining-available-for-power-automate/">real news</a> today, though, is that the team is also launching a new tool, the Process Advisor, which is now in preview as part of the Power Automate platform. This new process mining tool provides users with a new collaborative environment where developers and business users can work together to create new automations.</p>
<p>The idea here is that business users are the ones who know exactly how a certain process works. With Process Advisor, they can now submit recordings of how they process a refund, for example, and then submit that to the developers, who are typically not experts in how these processes usually work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s maybe just as important is that a system like this can identify bottlenecks in existing processes where automation can help speed up existing workflows.</p>

<p>&#8220;This goes back to one of the things that we always talk about for Power Platform, which, it&#8217;s a corny thing, but it&#8217;s that development is a team sport,&#8221; Charles Lamanna, Microsoft&#8217;s corporate VP for its Low Code Application Platform, told me. &#8220;That&#8217;s one of our big focuses: how to bring people to collaborate and work together who normally don&#8217;t. This is great because it actually brings together the business users who live the process each and every day with a specialist who can build the robot and do the automation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way this works in the backend is that Power Automate&#8217;s tools capture exactly what the users do and click on. All this information is then uploaded to the cloud and &#8212; with just five or six recordings &#8212; Power Automate&#8217;s systems can map how the process works. For more complex workflows, or those that have a lot of branches for different edge cases, you likely want more recordings to build out these processes, though.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084823" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084823" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2084823" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2084823" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>As Lamanna noted, building out these workflows and process maps can also help businesses better understand the ROI of these automations. &#8220;This kind of map is great to go build an automation on top of it, but it&#8217;s also great because it helps you capture the ROI of each automation you do because you&#8217;ll know for each step how long it took you,&#8221; Lamanna said. &#8220;We think that this concept of Process Advisor is probably going to be one of the most important engines of adoption for all these low-code/no-code technologies that are coming out. Basically, it can help guide you to where it&#8217;s worth spending the energy, where it&#8217;s worth training people, where it&#8217;s worth building an app, or using AI, or building a robot with our RPA like Power Automate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lamanna likened this to the advent of digital advertising, which for the first time helped marketers quantify the ROI of advertising.</p>
<p>The new process mining capabilities in Power Automate are now available in preview.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coronavirus outbreak, elections and Zoom meetings were on the minds of U.S. consumers this year, according to Google&#8217;s list of the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/US/">U.S. top trending searches in 2020</a>, released this morning. These search trends don&#8217;t reflect the most-searched for words and phrases across Google, but rather those that saw high spikes in traffic over a sustained period of time during the year, as compared with 2019. This paints a more accurate picture of consumers&#8217; changing interests during the year than Google&#8217;s top searches would.</p>
<p>The lists of <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/GLOBAL/">top Global search trends</a> had a similar set of results.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Election results was the No. 1 top trending search, followed by Coronavirus.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The PlayStation 5, Zoom and the names of several celebrities we tragically lost in 2020 also made the list.</p>
<p>In order, the top trending searches of 2020 were: Election results, Coronavirus, Kobe Bryant, Coronavirus update, Coronavirus symptoms, Zoom, who is winning the election, Chadwick Boseman and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>The top trending News searches reflected similar trends, with Elections, the pandemic and other related impacts making the list. There was a lot of bad news in 2020, including natural disasters and the largest stock market crash since 1929 (the Coronavirus Crash), which made the list, too.</p>
<p>In order, the top trending News searches were: Election results, Coronavirus, Stimulus checks, Unemployment, Iran, Hurricane Laura, Super Tuesday, Stock Market, Murder hornet and Australia fires.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s year-end search trends also highlighted top people, actors, politicians, athletes, musicians and losses of the year, with the U.S. No. 1s going to Joe Biden (top people search trend and politician search trend), Tom Hanks (who got COVID in 2020), Ryan Newman, Shakira and Kobe Bryant.</p>
<p>The year-end review also broke out other topics, <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/sweet-streams-2020s-top-trending-tv-shows-and-movies/">like top trending</a> TV shows, sports teams, songs, movies, games and more.</p>
<p>The No.1s across these lists, in order, included the Netflix viral hit, &#8220;Tiger King,&#8221; the Boston Celtics, &#8220;WAP,&#8221; &#8220;Parasite&#8221; and Among Us.</p>
<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/GLOBAL/">Globally</a>, many of the top trends remained the same, with Coronavirus, Election results, Kobe Bryant, Zoom and IPL as top search trends. Meanwhile, the Coronavirus, Election results, Iran, Beirut and Hantavirus were top trending News searches.</p>
<p>There were other similarities across subtopics, too, like No. 1s which included Tom Hanks, Ryan Newman, Among Us, &#8220;WAP,&#8221; &#8220;Parasite,&#8221; Joe Biden, &#8220;Tiger King,&#8221; and more.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rokGy0huYEA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Beyond the terms themselves, Google says there were <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/2020-year-in-search/?">other apparent trends</a> that emerged from its data. This year, people continued to use Google to ask &#8220;why&#8221; to learn about the world. Although, this year, many of our &#8220;why&#8221; queries were related to COVID &#8212; like where to buy toilet paper, face masks and hand sanitizer, and top &#8220;where to buy&#8221; search trends. We also looked for nearby places like covid testing and early voting centers, as well as protests in our &#8220;Near Me&#8221; searches.</p>
<p>And, despite everything, people remained optimistic as Google users searched for ways to spend time in coronavirus lockdowns. Searches for &#8220;sourdough bread recipe&#8221; hit an all-time high, for example. Other popular food searches included whipped coffee (thanks TikTok!), Disney churro, Dole whip and others. Top trends in &#8220;how to&#8221; searches reflected a world <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/2020-lifestyle-trends">where we learned to stay at home, doing things for ourselves</a> &#8212; like how to cut hair, or cut bangs, or color hair at home, as well as work from home, take virtual field trips, go on virtual dates and more.</p>
<p>Searches for Black Lives Matter increased five-fold over 2019, as well.</p>
<p>These searches and those for other supported markets can be <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/GLOBAL/">viewed on Google Trends</a>.</p>
