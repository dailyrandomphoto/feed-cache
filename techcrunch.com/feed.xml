					<description><![CDATA[It's software records a process with movement and clicks, then converts all of that into a step-by-step guide with screenshots and text that is editable and shareable.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Employees come and go, often taking their knowledge with them. There are also times when just a handful of employees know how to do something and don’t have time to provide a mass tutorial.</p>
<p>That’s where <a href="http://scribehow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scribe</a> comes in. Its software records movement and clicks and converts them into a step-by-step guide in less than a minute with screenshots and text that is editable and shareable. The information can be recorded from a Chrome extension or desktop app and also live in a repository until it is needed.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Jennifer Smith, formerly of McKinsey &amp; Company and Greylock Partners, formed the San Francisco-based company a couple of years ago with entrepreneur and former Google engineer Aaron Podolny after seeing a knowledge gap in how operational work was done.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219064" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Smith’s background is in organization and operations work. She talked to more than 1,200 founders about how software was bought and sold, and what they wished existed &#8212; and learned that not much had changed in this area in a decade.</p>
<p>“The process is still being done manually,” she told TechCrunch. “There is not a standard way to communicate how to do something. With Scribe, it is a standard. You can click the record button, do the task and it auto generates step-by-step instructions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Scribe has been heads-down since it was founded, but the software is now being used by over 10,000 organizations globally as a way to share with others how to do something. These include use cases by organizations outside of those initially targeted by Smith and Podolny, like governments and schools.</p>
<p>Today, the company launched with $30 million in venture capital, including a new $22 million round of Series A funding that was led by Tiger Global Management. A group of existing investors also participated in the investment, including Amplify Partners, which led Scribe’s $8 million seed round at the beginning of 2021, Haystack Ventures, XYZ Venture Capital, AME Cloud Ventures, Morado Ventures and SEV.</p>
<p>Angel investors involved include former Microsoft chairman John Thompson, Adobe chief product officer Scott Belsky, Gainsight CEO Nick Mehta and Opendoor CEO Eric Wu. As part of the investment, Amplify Partners general partner Mike Dauber joins Scribe’s board of directors.</p>
<p>Scribe is the latest company to attract venture capital for efforts to capture and share digital processes. For example, in August, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tango-dances-in-with-5-7m-to-making-employee-onboarding-easier/">Tango raised $5.7 million</a> for its Chrome extension that auto-captures workflow best practices so that teams can learn from their top performers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tango dances in with $5.7M, making employee onboarding easier&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tango-dances-in-with-5-7m-to-making-employee-onboarding-easier/embed/#?secret=FSFJoKEJLT" data-secret="FSFJoKEJLT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ross Fubini, managing director of XYZ, said Scribe was building a company that makes something complex look easy. He credits Smith for helping many marquee startups ramp up their enterprise selling during her time at Greylock and believes that she and her team are creating a product that is doing the same: showing them how to do their job better.</p>
<p>“And companies will pay for that,” he added. “This is just the first part of the journey. When we talk to companies describing problems on creating documentation, we see that bottom-up part. We are here to put in yet more money into the company so that Jennifer and her team can keep doing the work, build the go-to-market and get paid for that value.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Scribe has both a free version and pro/enterprise plans, and averages nearly 50% reduction in non-productive time spent learning how to do a process.</p>
<p>Smith intends to use the new funding to scale the team to respond to customer demand that is coming from startups all the way to Fortune 500 companies. The company’s 20-person employee base is a majority of women and underrepresented minorities, something Smith is proud of as she focuses on building an inclusive, culture- and talent-first organization, she added. She will also invest in R&amp;D and product development that is coming down the pipeline.</p>
<p>“We want Scribe to be the new common standard for sharing how to do something,” Smith added. “We take inspiration from Zoom and Slack, which have both become standard and lexicon. It’s really about driving that reach and distribution with colleagues and customers.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">At its HHTD21 event, Foxconn unveiled three electric vehicle prototypes including two sedans and an electric bus, according to a <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Foxconn-aims-to-turn-EVs-into-a-35bn-business-in-five-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Nikkei</em></a> report and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGukbUZgoKI" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">YouTube video</a>. The company said it is &#8220;no longer the new kid in town&#8221; when it comes to EVs, and aims to develop a business worth up to $NT 1 trillion, or around $36 billion per year.</p>
<p>Foxconn developed the EV prototypes under the Foxtron brand in collaboration with Taiwan&#8217;s Yulon Motor. The latter has its own brand (Luxgen) and manufactures Nissan and Mitsubishi vehicles for the local market. The prototypes include a luxury sedan, SUV and transit bus, labeled the Model E, Model C and Model T, respectively.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UGukbUZgoKI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219327" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The vehicles are based on Foxconn&#8217;s open software and hardware platform, MIH Consortium. They&#8217;re essentially designed as kits, serving as reference designs that EV brands can mass produce to their own specifications.</p>
<p>The Model T bus could hit roads as early as next year (hopefully under a different name), with a projected range of 400 km and top speed of 120 km/h (75 MPH). It also includes technology like pedestrian warnings, advanced temperature management and high crashworthiness, according to <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4318102" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>Taiwan News</em></a>.</p>
<p>Foxtron&#8217;s Model C is an electric SUV that will be available in Taiwan by 2023 with high efficiency and zippy 3.8 second 0-to-62 MPH speeds. It&#8217;s expected to cost below $NT 1 million ($35,700), said Foxconn chairperson Young Liu. The Model E, a luxury performance sedan designed in partnership with Pininfarina, will enter the market at a later, unspecified date. It will offer 750 horsepower and deliver a 0-62 MPH time of 2.8 seconds, along with a 750 km range. Yulon will be among the first EV makers to use the designs, said chairperson Lilian Chen.</p>
<p>Foxtron said it aims to capitalize on a trend of producing EVs close to the markets where they&#8217;re sold in order to keep costs down. The company plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/foxconn-electric-vehicle-factories-us-thailand-141124688.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">build EV factories</a> in the US, and recently <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a37851210/lordstown-selling-plant-to-foxconn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">announced</a> that it would acquire <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-232701777.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">troubled</a> Lordstown&#8217;s Ohio manufacturing plant. It aims to manufacture Lordstown&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-endurance-race-truck-214135593.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">Endurance pickup truck</a> at the plant, and build Fisker EVs in the complex by late 2023. Foxconn said it would announce details of its EV production plans for Europe soon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Leashes, you say? No leashes here, pal. No, Apple is apparently going <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/apple-is-going-unleashed-for-an-october-18-event/">fully off-leash</a> for today’s big presser. Today at <strong>10AM PT/1PM ET</strong>, it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/16/what-to-expect-from-apple-google-and-samsungs-big-events/">kicking off a big week of hardware news</a>, as part of a final industry push ahead of the holidays.</p>
<p>It was just over a month ago that the company unveiled a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-event-this-morning/">whole bunch of new devices</a>, including iPhones, iPads and the latest Apple Watch. So, what’s left? Macs, obviously. As Apple makes a line-wide transition to first-party silicon, we expect a number of new products, including (potentially) a new MacBook, Mac Mini and a larger iMac, all powered by the latest M1X chip.</p>
<p>Given that this is (likely) a last hurrah for the year, other products may well be on-tap, including a new version of Apple’s entry-level AirPods. Matthew and Darrell will be on hand, bringing you the news as it breaks. All of the information for watching the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-unleashed-macbook-pro-keynote-livestream/">livestream can be found here</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://n26.com">N26</a> has raised a $900 million Series E round at a $9 billion valuation. That represents a big jump from the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/n26-raises-another-100-million-in-series-d-extension/">Series D</a> valuation of $3.5 billion. The Berlin-based startup operates a digital bank with 7 million clients across 25 countries.</p>
<p>Third Point Ventures and Coatue Management are leading today’s round. Dragoneer Investment Group and some of N26’s existing investors are also participating.</p>
<p>“It gives us a lot of time over the next three to four years to line up for an IPO,” co-founder and CEO Valentin Stalf told me earlier today. N26 also plans to hire 1,000 people “as soon as possible.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219319" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>N26 offers bank accounts and debit cards that you can control from a mobile app. Opening a bank account is quite easy as you don’t need to go to a branch and fill out lengthy paperwork. After that, N26 users get a bank account with their own account numbers and a virtual card that they can add to Apple Pay or Google Pay.</p>
<p>Users can then send and receive money from their account, spend and withdraw money using their card. On top of that, the company has launched several financial products, starting with premium subscriptions.</p>
<p>If you want to use N26 as your main bank account, you might be tempted to subscribe to N26 Smart, N26 You or N26 Metal. Those subscriptions let you create more sub-accounts, get higher limits and access more card designs. N26 You and N26 Metal users also get insurance products as part of their subscriptions.</p>
<p>In addition to premium subscriptions, N26 users can access first-party or third-party products, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/challenger-bank-n26-to-offer-insurance-products/">phone and electronics insurance</a>, credit products, overdraft capabilities, etc.</p>

<h2>Doubling-down on Europe</h2>
<p>Like many tech startups, the coronavirus pandemic affected N26’s roadmap. N26 tweaked its product offering to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/fintech-startups-are-increasingly-focusing-on-profitability/">optimize for profitability</a> and long-term financial sustainability. After some impressive growth across multiple markets, the startup has refocused on its core market (Europe) and its core products (revenue from card transactions, subscriptions and banking products).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fintech startups are increasingly focusing on profitability&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/fintech-startups-are-increasingly-focusing-on-profitability/embed/#?secret=DfRUDc86qE" data-secret="DfRUDc86qE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In particular, Valentin Stalf told me several times that the company’s focus is now Europe. First, there’s still a lot of room for growth in its strongest markets. “If you look at the penetration that we have — in Paris, we have 5 to 7% of the population. In Berlin, it’s 5 to 7% of the population as well,” he said.</p>
<p>“So the market is still huge so it makes a lot of sense to deepen our investments in those markets,” he added.</p>
<p>In addition to central Europe, N26 now plans to expand aggressively to Eastern Europe throughout 2022. This is a significant shift in the company’s international strategy. According to the company’s website, N26 still <a href="https://n26.com/en-br">plans to launch</a> N26 in Brazil — but there&#8217;s no launch date. In the U.S., people can’t sign up directly, they have to <a href="https://n26.com/en-us">join a waitlist first</a>.</p>
<p>But N26 wants to be a market leader. And let’s be honest, there are <em>a ton</em> of fintech startups around the world these days. In Brazil, <a href="https://nubank.com.br/en/">Nubank</a> has tens of millions of clients. In the U.S., <a href="https://www.chime.com">Chime</a> is also well-positioned to become a dominant player.</p>
<p>“We’re currently dominating in central Europe and then you have Revolut doing the U.K. and Eastern Europe mainly,” Stalf said. That’s why N26 wants to increase the size of the cake in central Europe and expand to Eastern Europe where there’s still room for some competition. N26 plans to open an office in Belgrade, Serbia.</p>
<h2>Building a grown-up company</h2>
<p>Startups tend to move fast and break things, as Facebook’s old motto <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook,_Inc.#History">used to say</a>. And N26 is now trying to move away from this reputation of unpredictability.</p>
<p>While the company has a full-fledged banking license in Germany, the German banking regulator is keeping a close eye on N26. In 2019, BaFin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/n26-faces-banking-regulator-order-about-fraudulent-transactions/">criticized</a> N26 for some of its internal processes. Earlier this year, BaFin also imposed a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e9b57f9f-ee90-4124-af82-15976d701ab9">$4.9 million fine</a> (€4.25 million).</p>
<p>“The fine that we got is a fine for 50 cases that we forwarded to the regulator too late — not within 72 hours,” Stalf told me. He’s not debating the fine and says N26 has to pay it. However, according to Stalf, the company has improved its internal processes since those cases occurred.</p>
<p>“We have invested a lot on regulatory topics over the last 18 months,” Stalf said. We’ll find out soon enough if that’s true as N26 and the German regulator have decided to temporarily limit new signups to a maximum of 50,000 to 70,000 new customers per month. If the German regulator thinks N26 is doing a good job when it comes to anti-money laundering, know-your-customer policies and more, those restrictions will be lifted in a few months.</p>
<p>Similarly, Sifted <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/fintech-equity-packages-europe/">criticized</a> N26 for its equity incentive plans for employees. Stalf admitted that it has been too restrictive until now. So the company plans to expand its employee equity pool. 100% of employees will participate in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). N26 employees will learn more about the terms of the plan later this week.</p>
<p>When you look at all these points of friction, it’s clear that N26 is looking for long-term solutions as it wants to remain an independent company. The long-term goal is an initial public offering.</p>
<p>“From today’s perspective there’s no need to raise more. It’s definitely an option that this will be the last round before a public listing,” Stalf said. He doesn’t want to rule out completely that another funding round is never going to happen, but it’s not the goal.</p>
<p>With that much money on the company’s bank account, N26 can also start working on long-term projects. For instance, the company wants to do more when it comes to investment and trading. In addition to day-to-day banking, investment and trading also represent a lot of opportunities when it comes to recurring interactions, revenue per customer and total transaction volume.</p>
<p>N26 is on track to process $90 billion in transaction volume in 2021. Now that it owns the customer relationship with its loyal user base, the company can add more products and greatly increase that metric.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">College is time for learning, and sometimes the best type of learning is hands-on where you come to understand a trade by doing it. Emory University students wanted to learn about venture investing, while figuring out a way to get funds to underrepresented startup founders. They are managing to do both in a new venture capital fund called <a href="https://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/entrepreneurship-innovation/programs/venture-fund">Peachtree Minority Venture Fund</a>, which will be introduced next spring as part of a class that students who run the fund will be taking.</p>
<p>The idea for the project had its genesis in some research at the Emory University Goizueta Business School. Willie Sullivan and his fellow students Kristen Little, Chis Anen and Alan Quigley were doing research on the experience of underrepresented entrepreneurs in the Atlanta area where the university is located.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we conducted interviews, one of the main things that came up, which always comes up, is how large of a problem access to capital is still for Black entrepreneurs. And so we were coming up with our recommendations. It was really &#8216;okay how can we as a university address this issue,'&#8221; Sullivan told me.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218896" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Sullivan says that the research team understood that this was an age-old issue, one that there hasn&#8217;t been a great answer for. He also knew that students had been running venture funds for a couple of decades at other schools, so he began to explore the idea of starting one at Emory with the goal of finding a way to fund some of these companies while teaching students how to be VCs.</p>
<p>The team concluded that a student-run venture fund was a missing component in Emory&#8217;s business education, one that could be a great experiential learning opportunity for students to deal with real money making investments in real companies and conducting all of the due diligence and analysis that they would as a venture capitalist or investor at any company.</p>
<p>But Sullivan said the idea was to do more than that. They also wanted to help close the capital gap they found with their research by funding those startups that typically have a hard time accessing capital, looking not only at Black founders, but also Native American and Latinx founders.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218906" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218906" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2218906 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Founding-Team-Photo-.jpg" alt="Emory University Peachtree Minority Venture Fund founding team." width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Founding-Team-Photo-.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Founding-Team-Photo-.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Founding-Team-Photo-.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Founding-Team-Photo-.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Founding-Team-Photo-.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Founding-Team-Photo-.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218906" class="wp-caption-text">Founding team: Kristen Little, Willie Sullivan, Chis Anen, Alan Quigley.

<p>&#8220;[We decided to] start the first student-run fund where we&#8217;re focusing on multiple things. First of all we&#8217;ll be making equity investments into these underrepresented minorities, but our goal is also to create multiple classes of investors of all different racial and ethnic backgrounds that have been super engaged with this type of entrepreneur while they were at Goizueta Business School,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He believes if the school can produce a new generation of investors used to looking at a more diverse group of businesses than the typical venture firms, they can bring these learnings with them when they go out into the world and join these companies.</p>
<p>But before they could form a venture fund, they needed money. Sullivan said he spoke to around a dozen other school venture funds and most of those had been funded by rich alums, an option he said that he didn&#8217;t really have. But when he pitched his idea to the Goizueta interim dean, Karen Sedatole, he said that she loved the idea and decided to allocate $1 million from the school&#8217;s endowment as seed capital for the fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s already really supported a lot of racial equity and racial justice things that we&#8217;ve done at the school. And once we laid out all our plans and how we were going to set this up, she basically said, &#8216;I want to allocate money from our endowment to set this up,'&#8221; Sullivan said.</p>
<p>The research and analysis will take place under the supervision of a Goizueta Business School professor as part of a class the student investors will be taking to be a part of this group. The course will teach students about the technical aspects of investing, such as understanding what a cap table is, as well as how to create a financial model. It will also examine the diversity and inclusion side of investing and how to avoid unconscious bias in investment decisions.</p>
<p>The fund is also in the process of setting up an advisory board of Atlanta area groups that includes The Russell Center for Innovation, Atlanta Tech Village and Venture Atlanta. And while the deal sourcing and final decisions will rest with the students, they will be able to lean on this advisory board whenever they have specific questions where they could benefit from the wisdom of a more experienced investor.</p>
<p>The venture fund will be run by three students who will serve as managing partners and do the bulk of organizing and deal sourcing. These students will also serve as teaching assistants for the professors teaching related coursework, and they will supervise the other students who will have titles like senior associates and analysts, just as you do at other firms. As the managing partners graduate, new managing partners would be selected from the staff from the previous year in order to create a level of continuity in the program.</p>
<p>The firm intends to make a couple of investments in the $20,000-$25,000 range each year, and also set up a micro investment fund with another four or five checks for around $10,000 per year to jump-start some companies with underrepresented owners who might not get the attention of traditional investors or banks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other half of what we&#8217;re looking to do is to help those people who are right at the beginning, somebody that has a great idea, maybe they built out their product a little bit, maybe they even have some revenue, but what they really need is [a small check to get them going]&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The fund is still in the formation stage, but the first course is expected to begin in January with the first investments coming in March. Sullivan and his team has created a database of between 100 and 150 companies as a starting point for the class.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing a lot of that [setup] right now, really getting familiar with people who are out there and things like that so that once those students are trained and we can get started, we can just hit the ground running and hopefully make those first investments in March,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stellantis, the automaker formed through a merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Groupe PSA, has reached a preliminary deal with LG Energy Solution to produce battery cells and modules in North America.</p>
<p>The deal, which still must be approved by regulators, is part of Stellantis&#8217; plan to invest 30 billion euros ($34.8B) in electrification and software through 2025 in a bid to offer EV options for every model it produces in the U.S. and to reach specific sales goals for the region. The company has said it wants EVs to make up more than 40% of its U.S. sales by 2030. The facility will help Stellantis achieve a total minimum of 260 gigawatt hours of capacity by 2030, according to CEO Carlos Tavares.</p>
<p>The news comes the same day as Toyota announced its own plans <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/36193702.html">build a battery factory</a> in the United States. Toyota Motor North America and Toyota Tsusho announced plans to build an automotive battery plant with the aim of starting production in 2025. The project includes an investment of about $1.29 billion until 2031, Toyota said. Toyota said it will invest about $3.4 billion in automotive batteries in the U.S. through 2030.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219290" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Under the joint venture, Stellantis and LG Energy will build a new factory with an annual capacity of 40 gigawatt hours that will be up and running by the first quarter of 2024. To put that into perspective, that capacity puts it on par with the massive Panasonic-Tesla gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada. Tesla and Panasonic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/panasonic-to-expand-battery-capacity-at-tesla-gigafactory/">initially planned for the Gigafactory</a> to have the capacity to produce 35 gigawatt hours of batteries each year.</p>
<p>The companies didn&#8217;t disclose the total cost of the factory or where it will be located. The location is under review and will be announced at a future date. Stellantis and LG Energy expect to break ground at the site in the second quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Batteries produced at the factory will be supplied to Stellantis and used in the production of plug-in hybrids to full battery electric vehicles at the automaker&#8217;s assembly plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>The companies have worked together since 2014 when LG Energy began supplying FCA lithium-ion battery pack system and controls for the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Up to 60% of consumers are often new users of a shopping or media site, so that “cold start” can be a problem in terms of recommendations.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most of our media and shopping worlds involve the little boxes below what we are looking at that offer up other shows to watch or items to buy that are either similar or that other people also bought.</p>
<p>Consumers also have expectations that websites will be more personalized, which means that websites need to know something about you in order to show you things you want to see.</p>
<p>CEO Alexandre Robicquet, along with an all-star founding team of Emile Contal and Google X founder and Stanford professor Sebastian Thrun, started <a href="https://www.crossingminds.com/">Crossing Minds</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/startup-battlefield-competition-hai-by-crossing-minds-disrupt-sf-2018/">launched in 2018 at TechCrunch’s Disrupt Battlefield</a> as a consumer-focused app called Hai, which provided users with entertainment recommendations like books, music, shows, video games and restaurants.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218995" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Two years later, the company had thousands of active users and some big organizations as customers, but there were some challenges to recommendations, which led the company to pause and pivot to business-to-business.</p>
<p>“Personalization is everywhere, even the next evolution of search will be filtered,” Robicquet told TechCrunch. “It is not a matter of building a recommendation engine for one business or API, but to do something that could scale and service a bunch of businesses.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startup Battlefield Competition &#8211; Hai by Crossing Minds | Disrupt SF 2018&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/video/startup-battlefield-competition-hai-by-crossing-minds-disrupt-sf-2018/embed/#?secret=E0Z4aOulJE" data-secret="E0Z4aOulJE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Robicquet says up to 60% of consumers are often new users of a site, so that “cold start” can be a problem. Add in other barriers, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/in-a-post-cookie-world-rtb-is-key-to-effective-digital-marketing/">third-party cookie depreciation</a>, stricter privacy laws and difficulty linking present and past web sessions in real time, and there is almost no way to know who it is that is visiting the site, he added.</p>
<p>Crossing Minds is taking on that challenge and has developed a way to provide recommendations using on-site actions so that customers can more easily discover and engage with businesses, but without needing personal identifiable information.</p>
<p>The company connects with its customers’ databases and is able to build out a model in about two weeks based on key performance indicators. Its SaaS model then charges a per-recommendation fee.</p>
<p>On Monday, Crossing Minds announced $10 million in a Series A financing round led by Radical Ventures. Existing investors Index Ventures, Partech and Lerer Hippeau also participated. Robicquet expects to infuse the new capital into its engineering team, product development and customer base and to round out its leadership team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Crossing Minds is working with a handful of companies, including Penguin Random House, Danone and Inkbox. He estimates that the company has helped its customers increase sales on average by 93% and click-through rates by 120%.</p>
<p>Tomi Poutanen, co-founder of Radical Ventures, says companies like Inkbox were able “to cross the Rubicon when they partnered with Crossing Minds” and the metrics they are seeing with conversion, repeat sales and churn are what drive the economic formula, he said.</p>
<p>For example, Inkbox began working with Crossing Minds in February and is already seeing metrics, including a 250% increase in email click-through rates, 348% increase in adds to cart and 68.6% increase in on-site conversions for brand new users, according to Crossing Minds.</p>
<p>“Alexandre, Emile and Sebastian have something unique,” Poutanen said. “The foundation of the pedigree and degree of mathematics and deep-tech is not easily found elsewhere. They deeply understand product inventory and how to work with it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more people continue to work remotely, organizations globally have had to adjust &#8212; particularly when it comes to onboarding new employees and figuring out how to pay them, in some cases, across borders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, </span><a href="http://www.letsdeel.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212;  a San Francisco-based startup which provides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payroll, compliance tools and other services to help businesses hire remotely &#8212; has seen a massive surge in demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now almost exactly six months after </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/remote-hiring-startup-deel-raises-156m-at-a-1-25b-valuation-after-20x-growth-in-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising $156 million at a $1.25 billion valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the startup is announcing it has raised $425 million in a Series D funding round that gives it a valuation of $5.5 billion. (The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/coatue-expected-to-invest-in-remote-hiring-startup-deel-at-5-5-billion-valuation">had reported</a> in late September that the deal was in the works).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219045" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coatue led the latest financing, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with partners Rahul Kishore and Lucas Swisher leading the deal. Several new and existing backers also participated in this round, including Altimeter Capital, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Neo, Spark Capital and the YC Continuity Fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just since April, Deel has seen its global customer base jump from 1,800 to over 4,500, according to CEO and co-founder </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Bouaziz. Customers include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinbase, Dropbox and Shopify, among others. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">During that same time frame, employee headcount has grown from 115 to 400.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only in September of 2020 that Deel </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/deel-nabs-30m-more-for-payroll-compliance-and-other-tools-to-run-global-workforces/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $30 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series B funding round led by Spark Capital. At that time, it touted 500 customers. So that means it has effectively 9xed its number of customers in 13 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deel claims to allow businesses to hire in less than 5 minutes employees and contractors without needing a local entity. It also says that it gives companies the ability to pay teams in more than 120 currencies with “just a click.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past six months, the startup has launched a number of products, including: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deel Premium, Deel app for employees, an EOR dashboard for employees, stock options and global health insurance with three paid plans. Deel has also added integrations with NetSuite, Ashby and BambooHR to automate more of the entire HR workflow, from onboarding new candidates to managing a global team, Bouaziz said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest financing, Deel has now raised a total of $631 million in equity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was not “actively seeking” more capital after its Series C, according to Bouaziz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coatue approached us with an exciting proposition that allows us to continue providing an unmatched global hiring experience for teams around the world,” he told TechCrunch via email. “The business was already in a strong position, but with this new funding we’ll be able to scale faster, open more entities and keep transforming how companies hire across borders.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital will mainly go toward “further strengthening employee and contractor experience” in Deel’s new and existing markets, Bouaziz said. Looking ahead, he added that the company is eyeing potential acquisitions and will continue to hire across multiple locations &#8212; practicing what it preaches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have an office there” is no longer a valid excuse, the company claims, for not hiring people remotely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way people work is fundamentally changing,” Bouaziz said. “And it’s never going back.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The necessity of animal testing is a sad one for the process of drug discovery, but there&#8217;s seemingly no good alternative to mice, even though they&#8217;re not particularly accurate human analogues. Quris claims to have the first real option in its combination of AI with data from a &#8220;patient on a chip&#8221; that provides remarkably robust testing and automation, all at a considerably lower cost — no mouse required.</p>
<p>The company has raised a $9M seed round to go from pilot to production, and an all-star team of backers and advisors are a promising indicator that the approach has fundamental merit.</p>
<p>The basic idea makes perfect sense: build a better small-scale simulation of a human body and use it to gather data that a machine learning system can easily interpret. It&#8217;s easier said than done, of course, but no sooner did researchers say it than Quris started doing it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218354" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Israel-based company&#8217;s approach builds on a major study at Harvard concerning the use of so-called &#8220;organs on a chip.&#8221; These systems, still relatively new but established in the field, use a small amount of stem cell-derived tissue (&#8220;organoids&#8221;) as a test bed for drugs or treatments — providing a good idea of how, for example, a human liver might respond to a combination of substances.</p>
<p>What the Harvard researchers found is that by linking multiple organ-on-a-chip systems together (like liver to kidney to heart cells), you end up with a surprisingly effective simulation of the human body. There&#8217;s nothing like the real thing, of course, but this serial organoid system or &#8220;patient on a chip&#8221; could be a real alternative to mouse testing; that&#8217;s still the most common way of seeing how a treatment affects a complete organ system, despite the fact that substances that pass the mouse phase only succeed in human tests about ten percent of the time.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Isaac Bentwich said that as soon as that study came out, he and his colleagues recognized the potential and started working on what needed to be done in terms of engineering and AI in order to turn this from an experimental system to a scalable product. It&#8217;s not just a mouse replacement, either — it&#8217;s a (relatively) inexpensive method to do limited human testing without the humans, and without the uncertainty of mice.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219183" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/quris-render.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219183" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2219183" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/quris-render.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/quris-render.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/quris-render.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/quris-render.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/quris-render.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/quris-render.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/quris-render.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/quris-render.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2219183" class="wp-caption-text">A rendering of how the full scale automated &#8220;chip on chip&#8221; device will look.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Say you&#8217;re a pharma company,&#8221; said Bentwich in an interview. &#8220;Do you want to wait until you&#8217;re at the brink of going to clinical testing to find out whether a molecule that looks good on paper is actually effective? You can make all the genomics discoveries you want, but it won&#8217;t get you past mice experiments, where it fails 90 percent of the time. This lets you pick the winning horse before you go to the race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Considering drug candidates can cost hundreds of millions to get to the clinical stage, it&#8217;s more than worth spending even a small fortune (think tens of millions) to weed out a few destined for failure. If the technique is accurate — and indications are that it is — then the risk is practically nil and it will pay for itself if even a single expensive dead end is avoided. In other words, Bentwich put it, this brings the &#8220;fail early, fail cheap&#8221; mentality of software to a domain where neither was really an option.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Quris system uses what it calls a chip-on-chip technique, in other words multiple organoid systems (chips) in sequence (on another chip), but smaller and more efficient than state of the art lab systems by an order of magnitude. It would cost millions to run a hundred simulated humans the way Harvard&#8217;s researchers did it, but thousands to do so on Quris&#8217;s system, which uses less raw biological material, can be automated, and is accompanied by a well-trained machine learning model.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the other aspect that Quris is playing up: that this unique set of data will drive a unique AI that understands and can help run and interpret the experiments. The AI is already being trained with existing and some upcoming drugs, learning what signals from the various sensors mean for the safety of the substance. That allows effective testing to be done with a handful of chips rather than, say, 500 mice.</p>
<p>The chips themselves aren&#8217;t all the same, either. By manipulating and selecting the stem cells and tissues carefully, different types of people and different conditions or phenotypes can be tested for. If a company has a drug that works well but causes side effects 10 percent of the time and they don&#8217;t know why, testing against different genetic predispositions or complicating factors in an automated setting may be able to find out what genetic factors lead to those side effects.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219184" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/QurisTeam.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219184" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2219184" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/QurisTeam.jpg" alt="Members of the Quris team work in a lab." width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/QurisTeam.jpg 2040w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/QurisTeam.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/QurisTeam.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/QurisTeam.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/QurisTeam.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/QurisTeam.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/QurisTeam.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2219184" class="wp-caption-text">Members of the Quris team work in a lab.</p></div></p>
<p>Since the AI is aware of and cataloguing all this, it should get quite good at telling from a relatively small number of automated tests (think dozens, not thousands, and at a cost of thousands, not millions) whether a drug is a good candidate for human testing or not. Without the AI interpreting it, the data suddenly becomes a multi-PhD type of problem. But Bentwich was quick to note that they in no way anticipate eliminating the biological side and relying only on the AI. &#8220;It&#8217;s part of our philosophical and biological understanding that the AI has to work with a biological counterpart,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Robert Langer, co-founder of Moderna, is on the scientific advisory board, and told TechCrunch in the same interview that he concurred, and expects this technique to be adopted quickly, but not necessarily by the naturally conservative larger pharma companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;This does seem to be a very big opportunity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had similar ideas in other areas of chemistry, that you can use AI to make these predictions. It certainly won&#8217;t replace testing but it narrows the possibilities, and my view is it would speed things up tremendously.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s nice to have someone like Langer on your side (along with Nobel laureate Aaron Ciechanover), but Bentwich said that they&#8217;re relying more on their patent portfolio and first mover advantage to get a foot in the door. An agreement with the NY Stem Cell Foundation gives them special access to that organization&#8217;s stem cell workflow.</p>
<p>There are two prongs to the business model. One is providing the service to a pharma company of screening their drug candidates, with payment contingent on the results proving to be accurate — for example, a drug cleared by the system makes it to a given testing milestone as predicted. The other is to work on their own drugs; right now the company has a treatment for the Autism-linked Fragile X condition that it will be taking to clinical testing next year.</p>
<p>Bentwich pointed out that despite the proliferation of and investment in AI-powered drug discovery, few companies can claim to have a molecule resulting from their work entering clinical trials. This isn&#8217;t because they aren&#8217;t doing what they claim, for instance identifying molecules with certain bioreactivity or a method to manufacture them efficiently, but rather because there are so many other steps in the long discovery, testing, and approval process that the chance of making it through, while higher than it once was, is still very low.</p>
<p>The $9M seed round &#8220;funds us very well to finish the productization of the setup that we have, making it more efficient and automated, and testing the first hundred or thousand initial drugs to train the AI,&#8221; Bentwich said. The round was led by &#8220;Dr. Judith Richter and Dr. Kobi Richter, pioneers of cardiovascular intervention therapeutics, with participation from Moshe Yanai, a disruptive data-storage technology leader, and strategic angel investors,&#8221; as the press release puts it. A distinct lack of institutional capital — draw your own conclusions there.</p>
<p>Bentwich&#8217;s vision for the company is part of his general vision of &#8220;completely personalized medicine.&#8221; If the cost of stem cells continues to drop (already it has gone from millions to thousands), it would open up entirely new markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll no longer be just doing expensive experiments for pharma companies. In 5-10 years time this may well be what hundreds of millions of people are doing. If you think about it, it&#8217;s actually kind of barbaric how we&#8217;re living now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You go to the pharmacist and they list the possible side effects, but you don&#8217;t know for sure. What, are you the guinea pig? The answer is: yes, we&#8217;re all guinea pigs. But this is a first step away from that.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five members of the Congressional Committee have accused Amazon’s top executives of either misleading or blatantly lying to it about its business practices and said they are considering an investigation <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">following publication of two damning reports last week. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/">Reuters</a> and the <a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products">Markup</a> reported last week that Amazon uses the data of third-party sellers on its platform to inform and create its private-label products. Both the outlets also noted that Amazon then gives preference to its own portfolio over those of the rivals when customers look up for products.</p>
<p>The letter, addressed to Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy, says the committee is considering whether it would be appropriate to refer the Department of Justice to launch a criminal investigation into the subject.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219267" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We strongly encourage you to make use of this opportunity to correct the record and provide the Committee with sworn, truthful, and accurate responses to this request as we consider whether a referral of this matter to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation is appropriate,” reads the letter, which was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/members-of-congressional-committee-question-if-amazon-executives-misled-congress-11634551201">first reported by WSJ</a>.</p>
<p>In the letter &#8212; signed by Pramila Jayapal, David Cicilline, Ken Buck, Jerrold Nadler and Matt Gaetz &#8212; lawmakers have said that recent reporting in several outlets “directly contradicts the sworn testimony and representations of Amazon’s top executives &#8212; including former CEO Jeffrey Bezos.”</p>
<p>Last year, Bezos didn’t give a specific answer during his antitrust hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>
<p>“Here is what I can tell you. We do have certain safeguards in place. We do train people and we expect people to follow that policy as they would any other,” he said at the time, adding, however, that he couldn’t “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/bezos-cant-guarantee-no-anti-competitive-activity-as-congress-catches-him-flat-footed/">guarantee you that policy has never been violated</a>.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon, grappling with way too many controversies to document at this point, said it has not “mislead the committee, and we have denied and sought to correct the record on the inaccurate media articles in question.”</p>
<p>Despite the company’s denials, too many people through their actions have suggested that they don’t believe the company. Last week, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren called for breaking up Amazon.</p>
<p>The Reuters report, which relies on thousands of internal Amazon documents, states that Amazon “ran a systematic campaign of creating knockoffs and manipulating search results to boost its own private brands in India.”</p>
<p>The report adds that the move was part of a formal strategy at Amazon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The decentralized reality of office work after the COVID-19 pandemic continues to drive plenty of startup activity. To wit: <a href="https://www.officernd.com/">OfficeRnD</a>, which makes workplace management software that&#8217;s increasingly geared toward helping businesses provide a &#8216;hybrid office&#8217; model &#8212; meaning they&#8217;re offering flexible work spaces to staff who want to spend some of their time working out of a shared physical location, not just dial in and work remotely from home.</p>
<p>The startup has just closed a $10 million Series A to continue building out its workplace management SaaS for landlords and office managers &#8212; which offers features like resource scheduling (booking meeting rooms etc), employee/co-working space member engagement, and financial management tools through web and mobile applications.</p>
<p>The Series A funding is led by Runa Capital with Flashpoint Venture Capital and LAUNCHub Ventures also participating.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219238" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The financing will be used to dial up OfficeRnD&#8217;s marketing with the aim of expanding market share, including by growing its partnerships.</p>
<p>At this stage OfficeRnD has more than 1,000 customers using its tools to manage more than 2,000 flexible spaces and offer what it describes as a “work from anywhere” experience that currently touches &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of tenants and more than 300,000 employees.</p>
<p>It says its tools for co-working spaces &#8220;fully automate the tenant/customer lifecycle&#8221; &#8212; from preparing a contract and e-signing it, to putting it on auto-billing, automatically invite employees to the space app and the online portal, allowing them to book spaces and interact with other areas, providing them with credits to use for booking meeting spaces, as well as giving them <span class="il">office</span> access through the access management system, WiFi, document printing, etc.</p>
<p>Currently, OfficeRnD&#8217;s customers are spread across more than 90 countries &#8212; but its best market is the US which accounts for 45% of its customers, followed by circa 15% in the UK; 15% in the EU; 15% in APAC and 10% elsewhere.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The London-based startup was actually founded back in 2015, launching the first version of its product in 2016 &#8212; so years before the COVID-19 pandemic struck and triggered a temporary shuttering of physical offices everywhere, followed by a slow and (still) partial reopening.</p>
<p>So while its original focus was helping co-working spaces and commercial real estate better manage the use of their shared work locations, since the pandemic struck the startup says it&#8217;s seen a big surge in demand from companies looking for tools to help them switch to a more flexible and hybrid <span class="il">office</span> routine.</p>
<p>Hence while its typical customers remain co-working and &#8220;flex spaces&#8221; (it says it has about 800), followed by landlords (~100) &#8212; it also now has around 50 mid-size companies (with between 100-1,000 employees) also using its tools to reconfigure their approach to office-based work.</p>
<p>A recently launched product &#8212; called &#8216;OfficeRnD Hybrid&#8217; &#8212; is geared towards these corporate customers to help them move away from the traditional &#8220;all-hands 9-5&#8221; routine to a flexible, hybrid office model.</p>
<p>The new funding will be skewed towards investing &#8220;heavily&#8221; in this Hybrid work management offering, it says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see a huge traction there as most companies now want to let their teams work in a hybrid way which in essence means flexible working or co-working,&#8221; says OfficeRnD, adding: &#8220;We see a great opportunity to transfer our knowledge from co-working spaces to corporate customers and help them utilize their workspaces in the best possible way giving their employees full flexibility to work as they want.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;What happened throughout COVID-19 is that flexible work became a clear &#8216;future of work&#8217;,&#8221; the startup also tells TechCrunch, saying the shift opened up two new markets for its product: Firstly, landlords who it says were looking to &#8220;provide flexibility and better experience to their tenants&#8221;; and, secondly, the aforementioned corporates wanting to be able to offer what it bills as a &#8220;flexibility and better work experience&#8221; to their own staff.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Essentially, we now offer products for everyone who wants to be able to manage a flex space and provide great workspace experience to people, whether it’s a co-working space, a landlord or a corporation,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology has been on a steady path of enabling flexible work for over a decade and COVID-19 has only served to accelerate the process,&#8221; argues Miroslav Miroslavov, co-founder and CEO, <span class="il">in a statement</span>. &#8220;Our platform allows landlords, flex workspace operators, and companies to engage people and manage their workplace on a flexible-first principle.&#8221;</p>
<p>“<span class="il">OfficeRnD</span> has become extremely relevant for the industry that is largely shifting to a hybrid work model having tested it during the pandemic”, adds Dmitry Chikhachev, general partner at Runa Capital, in another supporting statement. “A lot of companies we know have grown yet kept the same lease on their <span class="il">office</span> and now realize they want to use it differently and provide more opportunities to their employees”.</p>
<p>On the competitive front, OfficeRnD names the likes of <a href="https://www.nexudus.com/">Nexudus</a>, <a href="https://essensys.tech/">Essensys</a> and <a href="https://www.yardi.com/products/property-management-software/">Yardi</a> as its main competitors in the co-working spaces market, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/envoy-protect-workers-return-to-the-office/">Envoy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/robin-picks-up-20-million-series-b-to-optimize-the-office/">Robin</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/19/condeco/">Condeco</a> in the corporate space market.</p>
<p>&#8220;What sets us apart from everyone in terms of the feature set and customer benefits is the ease of use and the depth of our workspace (employee/member) apps and the level of our integrations &amp; automations,&#8221; it argues. &#8220;Other than these, it’s the quality of customer service we strive to provide. We are a customer-obsessed team and we try to always go above and beyond.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious about the name, the &#8216;RnD&#8217; bit doesn&#8217;t stand for research and development &#8212; rather it&#8217;s a stand in for &#8216;rooms and desks&#8217; &#8212; so OfficeRnD is going after an AirBnB-style naming vibe.</p>

<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Before we jump in, let&#8217;s turn to Los Angeles and the coming wave of eVTOL companies hoping to take flight there. Aria Alamalhodaei took a deep dive into Urban Movement Labs, a non-profit organization that spun out of LA Mayor Eric Garcetti’s office, and what it&#8217;s doing to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/how-los-angeles-is-preparing-for-the-air-taxi-takeoff/">prepare the city for eVTOLS</a>. If we have learned anything from ride-hailing and scooters, cities can&#8217;t start thinking about future forms of transportation too soon.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219128" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>This week, I sat down with <strong>Mike Radenbaugh</strong>, CEO of <strong>Rad Power Bikes</strong>, as part of an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/rad-power-bikes-founder-mike-randenbaugh-on-fueling-the-e-bike-revolution/">ongoing TechCrunch+ series</a> picking the brains of transportation founders. Radenbaugh started his company when he was only 15, throwing together parts he ordered from Radio Shack and eBay to create the earliest versions of what are now wildly popular e-bikes.</p>
<p>We talked about how to navigate logistics in these tricky times, how to make a bike that people actually want to ride and what it takes to power the e-bike revolution. The interview is behind a paywall, so here&#8217;s a quick excerpt (but you should definitely subscribe to get the full content):</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>The mission-driven nature of business is that this stuff is in my blood. It flows through everyone in this organization; we are all here on that same mission. There are a lot of new entrants into the space that are trying to replicate what Rad does at a much smaller scale, or are in it for more mercenary reasons, and it&#8217;s a very different business. It&#8217;s just the way we think about building something that really can solve the climate disaster.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Bird</strong> had a busy week. The micromobility startup officially launched its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/bird-vehicles-can-now-accurately-detect-sidewalk-riding-and-slow-riders-to-a-stop/"> sidewalk riding detection technology</a> in Milwaukee and San Diego and has plans to expand it to Madrid by early next year, followed by more cities. The tech, which is co-developed by wireless semiconductors and high-precision positioning module producer u-blox, will be on all new vehicles coming off the assembly line.</p>
<p>This development makes Bird the latest of shared operators to announce the addition of what I like to call scooter advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that can detect poor rider behavior and correct it in real time by bringing the rider to a stop. <strong>Superpedestrian</strong> recently acquired <strong>Navmatic</strong> to integrate a similar technology, which relies on hyper-accurate positioning and sensor fusion to determine sidewalk riding, whereas other companies like <strong>Spin</strong>, <strong>Voi</strong> and <strong>Helbiz</strong> are attaching cameras to their scooters for a more computer vision-based approach.</p>
<p>In other Bird news, the company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/bird-nabs-150m-up-from-40m-in-vehicle-financing-from-apollo-investment-corp/">nabbed $150 million</a>, up from $40 million, in a financing credit facility from <strong>Apollo Investment Corporation</strong> (Disclaimer: Apollo acquired Verizon Media Group, which owned TechCrunch. The company is now called Yahoo Inc.). This upsize will go into effect once Bird&#8217;s SPAC merger with Switchback II Corporation officially closes. The shareholder meeting to approve and confirm the deal is happening on November 2. The extra funds will help Bird purchase more vehicles this winter so it can further expand its footprint, giving it time to earn revenue in spring and summer which it will use to pay Apollo back, according to the company.</p>
<hr />
<p>Speaking of expanding footprints, Russian tech giant <strong>Yandex</strong> is developing more of a presence in Israel with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/russian-tech-giant-yandex-expands-israeli-footprint-with-acquisition-of-winds-tel-aviv-operations/">recent acquisition</a> of shared e-scooter company <strong>Wind&#8217;s</strong> Israeli operations, which includes 10,000 Wind scooters. Yandex only recently launched an e-scooter sharing service in its home market, but only has about 5,000 scooters on the ground, so this will significantly increase the company&#8217;s fleet size. The Russian company is already operating or testing out other mobility platforms in Israel; it has a ride-hailing and last-mile delivery service Yango and an express grocery delivery service Yango Deli on the ground, and is testing out autonomous delivery robots and self-driving cars.</p>
<p><strong>Dott</strong> is joining the multi-modal game with its launch of an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/dott-launches-bike-sharing-service-in-paris/">e-bike-sharing service in Paris</a>. The bikes will join Dott&#8217;s fleet of e-scooters in the City of Love, along with <strong>Lime</strong> and <strong>Tier</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Gogoro</strong>, the Taiwanese e-scooter maker, officially launched its popular <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/gogoro-launches-battery-swapping-stations-in-china/">battery swapping service</a> in China with 45 stations in Hangzhou. The company is targeting 80 stations by the end of the year before expanding into other major cities with its partners Yadea and Dachangjiang Group (DCJ).</p>
<p><strong>Swft</strong>, a budding mobility startup that started late last year selling electric hoverboards and has since launched three e-bikes and an e-moped, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/e-mobility-startup-swft-raises-10m-seed-round-to-expand-light-duty-vehicle-lineup/">raised $10 million in seed funding</a>. The company plans to use the money to expand its light-duty vehicle offerings, adding to its lineup a couple of electric motorcyles, a four-wheeler, a three-wheeler and a scooter over the next couple of years. Swft operates on a D2C model but says it&#8217;s bikes are also being sold through Best Buy.</p>
<p><strong>VanMoof</strong> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/vanmoof-teases-new-high-speed-electric-bike/">teased its new high-speed bike</a>, the VanMoof V, via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7ymwpXFxtg">live YouTube video</a>. The plan is to release the bike, which should cost about $3,598, by the end of 2022. The company says the bike will be able reach a top speed of 37 miles per hour. That doesn&#8217;t mean riders will be able to accelerate up to 37 mph, since speed restrictions in Europe, and elsewhere, fall well below that. Maybe VanMoof will force transport authorities to take another look at the current regulations for what does and does not maketh a bike.</p>
<p><strong>Populus</strong> could probably help with that. The company&#8217;s platform pulls data from fleets of shared vehicles and delivers that info to cities to help planners understand and manage how streets are used. Populus is now <a href="https://www.populus.ai/latest-news/populus-usdot-safety-2021">beginning Phase II</a> of a U.S. Department of Transportation-funded initiative to work with micromobility operators and leverage data from over 80 million trips to help public agencies create safer streets. Over 15 cities are participating, including Cleveland, Washington D.C. area cities, Bay Area cities, Lexington, and Charlottesville, among others. Maybe they&#8217;ll come to the conclusion that we&#8217;ve known all along &#8212; find ways to take more space from cars and create more protected bike lanes&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;so that sweet scooters like the new Blizwheel can ride safely! The <strong>Blizwheel</strong> is a portable, foldable wee thing, weighing under nine pounds and only 15.6 inches in length. Despite its size, it is mighty, with a top speed of 12 miles per hour. The eight-mile range leaves something to be desired, but presumably, if it makes it to market, that&#8217;s something the company can work on. Blizwheel has so far been funded over 1033% via kickstarter with around $109,000 in funding.</p>
<p>Finally, let&#8217;s wrap with this fun and fresh news. <strong>MoonBikes</strong>, the maker of electric snowbikes (!!!) has announced the<a href="https://moonbikes.com/"> close of a $5 million seed round</a>. The MoonBike created by engineer Nicolas Muron, who was born and raised in the French Alps, actually looks like an e-bike and a snowmobile had a baby, with a light frame, one ski in the front and a track in the back. The target rider for this contraption is a resident of an icy tundra who wants a cool way to commute, or a mountain person who wants something three times lighter than a snowmobile. It can climb groomed slopes with a 40% steepness grade, has a top speed of 26 miles per hour and a range of up to three hours with the optional dual battery.</p>

<p><strong>Vroom</strong>, the online used car marketplace that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/popping-the-hood-on-vrooms-ipo-filing/">filed to go public in 2020</a> and is now listed on the Nasdaq exchange under the VRM ticker, is using its access to capital to swoop up other companies as it seeks out new ways to generate revenue.</p>
<p>This time, Vroom has agreed to acquire auto financing company <strong>United Auto Credit Corporation</strong> for $300 million in cash. The financial terms are subject to adjustment based upon UACC’s closing book value. This is the third acquisition by Vroom, which is financing the purchase price through cash on hand.</p>
<p>This is Vroom&#8217;s second acquisition in less than a year. The company acquired CarStory, an analytics and auto retail services company, in December 2020. And way back in 2015, when online used car marketplaces were a favorite investor hangout, Vroom <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/12/16/vroom-raises-95-million/">acquired Texas Direct Auto</a>.</p>
<p>UACC is going to become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vroom and will continue to operate under the UACC name. Vroom noted that following the closing, &#8220;the acquisition is expected to immediately be <em>accretive</em> to Vroom&#8217;s earnings.&#8221;</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to close either late in the fourth quarter of 2021 or early in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>BMW Group</strong> has invested, through its venture capital fund, in Lilac Solutions, a U.S. startup that has developed and patented a process designed to improve efficiency, costs and sustainability by extracting lithium from brine resources, which are natural deposits of salt water. The investment was not disclosed.</p>
<p><strong>CarDekho</strong>, an Indian search and e-commerce platform for new and used cars, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/cardekho-becomes-unicorn-with-250-million-fundraise/">raised $250 million</a> in debt and equity in its Series E financing round. The round, which valued the Jaipur-headquartered firm at $1.2 billion, was led by LeapFrog Investments. Canyon Partners, Mirae Asset, Franklin Templeton, Harbor Spring Capital as well as existing investors Sequoia Capital India and Sunley House also participated in what CarDekho has described as its pre-IPO round.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner.</p>
<p><strong>President Joe Biden</strong> is reportedly facing pressure to pass the bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and the Democrat-crafted $3.5 trillion budget bill before the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland at the end of the month, <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/575976-biden-faces-pressure-to-pass-infrastructure-bills-before-climate">The Hill reported</a>. The budget bill in particular contains a number of spending provisions aimed at driving down the country&#8217;s carbon emissions, like a clean energy tax credit and a methane emissions fee for the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p>But there are still a few major sticking points. Beyond the sheer size of the budget bill &#8212; which has both conservative Democrats and Republicans leery &#8212; there are a few provisions that are still facing major opposition. Last month I wrote about how automakers like <strong>Honda</strong>, <strong>Toyota</strong> and <strong>Tesla</strong> are opposing a section that would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/toyota-honda-urge-congress-to-reject-expanded-tax-incentive-that-would-benefit-ford-gm-stellantis/">expand tax incentives</a> by as much as $4,500 for electric vehicles that were manufactured in union shops in the United States.</p>
<p>It seems that the fight is far from over. <strong>Governor Brian Kemp</strong> of Georgia &#8212; a state home to a single auto assembly plant by Kia &#8212; sent a letter to Georgia&#8217;s congressional delegation urging them to oppose the additional incentive. He <a href="https://gov.georgia.gov/press-releases/2021-10-08/gov-kemp-urges-federal-delegation-support-georgia-jobs-and-oppose-budget">said in a statement</a> that limiting the tax incentive &#8220;puts Georgia workers at a severe disadvantage.&#8221; South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster sent his own letter urging the removal of the provision. South Carolina is home to three assembly plants, respectively owned by BMW, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz.</p>
<p>Lobbying by automakers has already increased so far this year compared to the same period last year, according to spending transparency platform OpenSecrets. <strong>Toyota</strong> spent $3.3 million in the first half of this year, compared to $2.9 million for the same period of 2020; both <strong>Ford</strong> and <strong>General Motors</strong> have also spent more on lobbying this year compared to last.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was also interested in this small piece of news out of Colorado, where the state&#8217;s largest investor-owned utility, <strong>Xcel Energy</strong>, is commencing a new pilot plant with six automakers to study how to best match <a href="https://ev.xcelenergy.com/Charging-Perks">EV charging times</a> with times of day when renewable energy is plentiful.</p>
<p>The Charging Perks pilot is open to 600 drivers of BMW, Chevy, Ford, Honda or Tesla EVs. Without getting too far in the weeds, the pilot will use day-ahead forecasts of renewable energy availability and pair that with drivers&#8217; charging needs to create a customized charging schedule.</p>
<p>This caught my eye because it&#8217;s well and good to say you want a million EVs on the road by 2030 &#8212; which is Colorado&#8217;s stated goal &#8212; but without proper planning it&#8217;s hard to see how we&#8217;ll get there without overwhelming the electric grid. Electric utilities are going to be key players in ensuring any kind of transition to electric mobility, so I&#8217;ll be eager to see the results of this pilot (or if it scales in the future).</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, <strong>Kodiak Robotics</strong> revealed details about its fourth-generation autonomous truck system and announced it was expanding its own fleet by 15 PACCAR Class 8 trucks. (They have 10 trucks in the field today)</p>
<p>The tl;dr: the fourth-gen truck has a modular sensor suite that includes a center pod on the front roofline of the truck as well as pods integrated into both of the side mirrors. I caught up with co-founder and CEO <strong>Don Burnette</strong>, at the time, to learn more about what one of the last smaller AV developers is doing as is goes up against better funded and larger companies also trying to commercialize self-driving trucks.</p>
<p>The first thing on my mind was why should I care about this new generation truck? And what does it mean for Kodiak? My assumption, and likely yours as well, is that this new truck is an improvement over the previous version. But I wanted to know exactly what improved. Burnette said one of the primary goals was stability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of the challenge in self driving is that you have hardware, sensors, computers, network switches, cables and power systems — and decisions that need to be made, all the time, 10 times a second or even 100 times a second. And computers are finicky, these components and bits are finicky. The more we can improve our systems to deal with errors and handle errors is great, but actually building more reliable hardware — in the first place — and building more reliable architectures — in the first place — really helps improve the stability of the overall system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burnette said that, in turn, accelerates development of software and ultimately allows the company to show better performance on the commercial side. The upshot: this new generation is more &#8220;stable&#8221; and &#8220;rugged.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other significant &#8220;improvement&#8221; or change at this stage is that Kodiak is able to start to showcasing where they&#8217;re going in the future. Previous generations were a bit more &#8220;prototype-y&#8221; (Burnette&#8217;s word, not mine). This generation is more integrated, has more redundancy, is more sophisticated and is pushing into the industrial design phase of Kodiak&#8217;s development program. Importantly, he said &#8220;we really wanted to put a stake in the ground and make a statement about how we envision the use case of this technology in the long run.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burnette said that trucking fleets care a lot about downtime. And as he began to think through what deploying an AV fleet at scale might look like, he imagined there would be a need for specialized technicians throughout the country, ready to diagnose an issue and repair a sensor. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s a high bar — that&#8217;s a lot of burden to place on the maintenance infrastructure network of various fleets, and so we wanted to create a design that was particularly modular so that in the field, if there&#8217;s an issue, you can just pull off the modular system and put on a new one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously, that means these systems have to be robust, easy to install and sensors have to be calibrated correctly and in advance. Without getting too deep in the weeds, Burnette said that&#8217;s exactly what they&#8217;re doing. And he mentioned they&#8217;ve already tested swapping out one modular system after one of the mirrors on a truck was damaged (while parked btw). The change worked and the truck was back testing the following day. &#8220;We think we can get that time down considerably and at scale for real commercial deployment.&#8221;</p>

<h3>ADAS (meaning drivers still must take over)</h3>
<p><strong>AAA</strong> <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2021/10/rained-out-vehicle-safety-systems-struggle-to-see-in-bad-weather/">found in a new study</a> that advanced driver-assistance technology is significantly reduced by moderate and heavy rain, especially auto emergency braking and lane-keeping systems.</p>
<p>During closed course testing, AAA simulated rainfall and found that test vehicles equipped with automatic emergency braking traveling at 35 mph collided with a stopped vehicle 33% of the time. Lane keeping assistance didn&#8217;t fare any better with test vehicles departing their lane 69% of the time, according to the study. AAA pointed to the results as another reason that testing standards should incorporate real-world conditions that drivers normally encounter.</p>
<p>The <strong>U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/us-regulator-targets-tesla-on-ndas-over-the-air-software-updates/">sent a pair of letters</a> to <strong>Tesla</strong> targeting the company&#8217;s use of non-disclosure agreements for owners who gain early access to its &#8220;full self-driving&#8221; software beta as well as its decision to use an over-the-air software update to fix an issue that regulators say should have been a recall.</p>
<p>The letters signal NHTSA&#8217;s increasing scrutiny of Tesla and its practices related to over-the-air software updates and automated driving features within its Autopilot advanced driver assistance system.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles (no driver? no problem)</h3>
<p><strong>Waymo</strong> vehicles in San Francisco got a bit of extra attention from a local TV network, which then spread like wildfire on social media, when the AVs kept going down the same dead end street, where they would be forced to make three-point turns. I asked Waymo about this. Here&#8217;s their statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;We continually adjust to dynamic San Francisco road rules. In this case, cars traveling North of California on 15th Ave have to take a u-turn due to the presence of Slow Streets signage on Lake. So, the <span class="il">Waymo</span> Driver was obeying the same road rules that any car is required to follow. “</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t really answer my question as to why the cars kept going down the street, especially since the &#8220;slow streets&#8221; designation had been in place for some time. Apparently, this was a street that Waymo wanted to drive on and learn from and  that the vehicles are now being limited in that area.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Electric Last Mile Solutions</strong>, commercial electric vehicle company, said it will open a new tech hub in San Francisco. The &#8220;urban mobility lab&#8221; will focus on advanced in-vehicle technology, edge-to-cloud architecture, data-intensive applications and machine learning.</p>
<p><strong>General Motors</strong> started shipping to dealers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/gm-has-started-shipping-replacement-battery-modules-for-recalled-chevy-bolt-evs/">replacement battery modules</a> for recalled Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles after delays caused by shutdowns at multiple manufacturing plants as a result of the widespread shortage of semiconductors. Meanwhile, LG Electronics agreed to reimburse GM up to $1.9 billion to pay for the recall and repairs to thousands of Bolts. The issue isn&#8217;t totally resolved yet; GM says it <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/10/13/gm-chevy-bolt-production-restart-orion-assembly/8434747002/">will idle the Orion Assembly plant</a> where Bolts are produced until November 1 so it can focus on repairing the EVs that already exist before it makes any new ones.</p>
<p><strong>National Grid</strong> in New England used aThomas Built Buses Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley electric school bus equipped with a Proterra battery system to send electricity back into the regional grid over 30 events this summer, an example vehicle-to-grid technology.</p>
<p><strong>Porsche&#8217;s</strong> electric Taycan outsold its iconic internal combustion-powered 911 sports car in the first nine months of the year, a milestone for the EV that was introduced in late 2019. Sales overall <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/porsches-all-electric-taycan-outsells-its-flagship-911-sports-car/">were up 13%</a> compared to the same 9-month period last year, an increase driven by a nearly threefold increase in Taycan deliveries as well as growth by its popular gas-powered Macan vehicle. Porsche delivered 28,640 Taycan vehicles in the January-to-September period and 27,972 of its 911 sports cars, which also grew compared to last year.</p>
<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p><strong>Hyundai Motor</strong> is the latest automaker to announce plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/hyundai-motor-plans-to-develop-its-own-chips/">develop its own semiconductor chips</a> in order to reduce reliance on chipmakers.</p>
<p><strong>Spotify&#8217;s</strong> in-car entertainment system &#8220;Car Thing,&#8221; which launched this spring on an invite-only basis, is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/spotify-expands-access-to-its-in-car-entertainment-device-car-thing/">becoming more broadly available</a>, TechCrunch&#8217;s Sarah Perez reported. Car Thing will become available to U.S. users who want to purchase the $79.99 device.</p>
<p><strong>Volvo</strong> is working with a company called BreezoMeter, which uses a network of about 47,000 sensors and satellites to detect and report on air quality. The company delivers micro-local environmental intelligence (within 5 meters of the driver) through the vehicle&#8217;s HMI (human-machine interface). The information is available on all new 90 and 60 Series Volvo models.</p>
<h3>Misc. stuff</h3>
<p><strong>AB Volvo</strong>, the construction truck arm of Sweden&#8217;s Volvo Group, unveiled a new vehicle made with a majority of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/volvo-group-unveils-vehicle-made-with-3000-kilos-of-fossil-free-steel/">&#8220;fossil-free&#8221; steel</a>. The company plans to begin smaller-scale series production using the new material as early as 2022. The prototype vehicle, a fully electric and autonomous load carrier for use in mining and quarries, is composed of over 3,000 kilograms (6,600 pounds) of the new steel. Volvo said it targeted construction trucks first because, on average, around 70% of the vehicle weight comes from steel and cast iron.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Times</strong> digs into the flaws of Biden&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0eb86078-34a0-4b3d-8e66-92f2c2896237">&#8220;open all hours&#8221;</a> ports strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Luminar</strong> has hired two new executives, Debra Poppas as its quality leader, who previously was a vp of quality at PACCAR, and Sameer Ladiwala as chief accounting officer. Ladiwala held a similar position at the semiconductor and software design company Arm.</p>
<p><strong>Swvl</strong>, <strong>Treepz</strong>, <strong>Jatri</strong>, <strong>SafeBoda</strong>, <strong>Urbvan</strong>, <strong>Chalo</strong> and <strong>Buser</strong> are some of the startups that have popped up in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America in recent years, all with a focus on providing on-demand access to transportation. Not only are these startups products of the emerging markets, but because mobility is so essential to a thriving economy, they&#8217;re actually driving development. Rebecca Bellan gives us an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/meet-the-startups-changing-mobility-for-emerging-middle-classes/">introduction into these startups</a> and how they are driving growth in this sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, Limbix, a company creating digital therapeutics for adolescents, released data from a trial on its new product: SparkRx. SparkRx is a self-guided therapy program for teens run entirely on a phone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limbix was founded in 2016, and has about 30 employees, with plans to add 30 more by the second quarter of 2022. So far the company has raised $9 million in Series A funding, which closed in May 2020. That round was led by by GSR Ventures, with participation from existing investors Sequoia Capital, Storm Ventures, NextGen Venture Partners, and BIXINK Therapeutics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SparkRx, which is designed to help teens manage depression, is the company’s first product to be clinically evaluated. The app encourages teens to take note of their feelings, and schedule activities that leave them feeling better. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218744" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re only really intended to spend a few minutes a day with it,” says Benjamin Alouf, Limbix’s chief medical officer. “[Teens use it] to schedule, to plan, to set the stage and then to go out and do this activity. Then they report back as to how it went.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limbix recently unveiled the results of a clinical trial at the 2021 American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference and Exhibition Virtual Experience. It has not been published in a journal, but TechCrunch reviewed the company&#8217;s poster presentation (a dense, data-rich synopsis format used at scientific conferences) from the event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the study, 160 adolescents aged 13-22 were assigned to use SparkRx or another app providing mental health education. Each group had mild to severe depression symptoms, which were evaluated using a classic questionnaire in depression research, called the PHQ-8. (Essentially,</span><a href="https://www.selfmanagementresource.com/docs/pdfs/English_-_phq.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the questionnaire asks teens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to estimate how often they feel they have little interest in doing things, have a loss of appetite, or regularly feel like a failure, to evaluate depression symptoms.) The higher the score, the worse symptoms are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SparkRx was associated with a decline in PHQ-8 scores among teenagers –  those scores dropped about five points, a decrease study refers to as clinical meaningful. However, that reduction wasn’t statistically significant compared to a control group who just got mental health education. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where SparkRx made a meaningful difference was when the team looked specifically at teenagers who actually filled out PHQ-8 questionnaires every week (not everyone in the treatment group did so). In the people who actually completed the program, the app outperformed the control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After five weeks, 21 percent of teens who adhered to study guidelines were in remission from depression, compared to four percent of the control group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SparkRx is actually available right now to teens who get a referral from their healthcare provider. That’s made possible through </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/136939/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pandemic-era FDA guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stipulating the agency wouldn’t object to the release of digital therapy programs – provided they’re not marketed towards people who are grappling with suicidal ideation, or used on their own to make clinical diagnosis or treatment decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alouf says the majority of users, however, have so far come through clinical trials, not through real-world usage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s plenty of background research suggesting people can benefit from using mental health apps – particularly people with </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00386-8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anxiety and depression</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though effects tend to be small, </span><a href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2020/5/e17458"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one 2020 review paper notes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  But one major barrier appears to be retention. As one review paper in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPJ Digital Medicine </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">notes the median 15-day retention rate for mental health apps tends to be about 3.9 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SparkRx’s trial does show higher retention numbers. Forty-two percent of teens used the app every day (compared to 19.5 percent seen in other &#8220;research depression apps,&#8221; the study notes). They completed about 63.5 percent of the program on average.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of increasing retention comes down to shaping a mental health app for the teen audience. Alouf says SparkRx has specifically been tweaked to address teen-specific mental health issues and barriers that stop them from seeking treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have found through our studies, and it&#8217;s also been published, that adolescents prefer a self-guided, somewhat autonomous and very very discrete methods of therapy. They like to do it on their own time, at their own convenience and at their own pace,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34609034/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 meta-analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of eight studies evaluated some of the major barriers standing between teens and therapy. Autonomy was the primary theme that emerged across studies. </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20650512/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has shown the need for autonomy is a “strong barrier” preventing teenagers from seeking mental healthcare. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alouf’s argument is SparkRx is designed with autonomy (and discretion – stigma is also a barrier to engagement with therapy) in mind. The app is self-guided, and though it needs a referral from a healthcare provider to get started. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also important to mention this app is not intended for teens who have suicidal ideation. The app wasn’t evaluated on teens who indicated they had struggled with thoughts of self-harm (the PHQ-8, the form used to track depression symptoms in the study, specifically does not include a question on this). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, SparkRx intends to submit for FDA approval of its digital therapy program. The company, says Alouf, is aiming to have SparkRx become a prescription-based digital therapeutic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Getting the FDA stamp of approval will just show there&#8217;s not just internal but external confidence in the quality and validity of the product,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not SparkRX will gain FDA approval will likely hinge on the results of another pivotal trial the company is planning right now.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alouf was hesitant to provide a timeline, but added the company is “working diligently” on launching that trial “as soon as we can.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vegan meal delivery startup <a href="https://allplants.com/">Allplants</a> has nabbed £38 million (~$52M) in Series B funding led by Draper Esprit to serve up more tasty plant-based, heat-at-home meals direct to UK consumers.</p>
<p>The round is being touted as the biggest ever Series B by a plant-based food company in Europe.</p>
<p>Earlier, the London-based startup raised a $7.5M Series A (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/19/allplants/">back in 2018</a>) &#8212; as well as taking in funding through the equity crowdfunding platform Seedrs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219201" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It says its revenues have been more than doubling every year since its launch in 2017.</p>
<p>Other new investors in Allplants&#8217; Series B include purpose driven consumer packaged goods fund The Craftory, Silicon Valley-based TriplePoint Capital, along with international England footballers Chris Smalling and Kieran Gibbs, and Cassandra Stavrou MBE, founder of UK independent snack company Proper Snacks.</p>
<p>Existing investors Felix Capital &#8212; the VC behind oat-based milk alternative, Oatly &#8212; and Octopus Ventures, also participated.</p>
<p>Rising concern over the climate impact attached to meat production has been driving interest in plant-based alternatives across the Western world in recent years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Startups have been responding by developing a growing range of convenient alternatives to eating meat, including direct to consumer meal delivery options like Allplants and plant-based meat alternative products themselves, such as the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/heuras-plant-based-chicken-hits-uk-shops/">Heura</a> &#8212; and the latter type of products could end up as ingredients in an Allplants meal.</p>
<p>Alplants credits its growth to a rapidly growing ‘plant-curious’, or flexitarian, consumer market &#8212; which it says is now worth £10BN in the UK alone, and an annual £100BN in developed markets. And while the startup is UK-only for now its <a href="https://help.allplants.com/en/articles/77-delivery-help-information">website</a> notes that its got its sights on going global.</p>
<p>It says the new funds will go on expanding its plant-based kitchen in Walthamstow, North London &#8212; to 6x its current size so that it can meet surging domestic demand.</p>
<p>Currently it employs 140 chefs in its kitchens working 24 hours a day to prepare the meals that are delivered frozen to consumers for convenience &#8212; meaning they require reheating before consuming, either in an oven or microwave, much like a traditional microwave meal.</p>
<p>Its current range of dishes cover breakfast, lunch, snack, treat and dinner, with the startup offering multiple types of world cuisine &#8212; from curries and chillis to pasta and risotto and plenty more &#8212; which contain vegan protein sources, such as vegan cheese, tofu, beans or meat alternatives like vegan chorizo.</p>
<p>Customers build a box of six meals, picking from its selection of dishes for home delivery and choosing a portion size that&#8217;s either for one or two people.</p>
<p>It also sells a variety of bundles &#8212; such as all/only &#8216;meat substitute&#8217; meals (for people who are used to always having hunks of meat on their plate) or a selection of &#8216;cheesiest&#8217; dishes (still with 100% vegan cheese) &#8212; to cater to different tastes.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s pitch points out that switching meat-based meals for plant-based alternatives is one of the most impactful ways that people can reduce their environmental footprint &#8212; suggesting that just one additional day of plant-based eating per week reduces the average UK consumer’s total annual food carbon footprint by more than 10%.</p>
<p>In additional plans for its Series B, Allplants says it will be building scalable capacity for rapid distribution into other channels &#8212; so it&#8217;s potentially eyeing a multichannel distribution over the longer term, which might include retail outlets like supermarkets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The funding will also be used for a significant expansion of its team &#8212; with the startup set to hire across the entire stack of the business, from additional culinary-school-trained chefs through to operations, innovation, marketing, and technology.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Other plans for the Series B include further expansion of the meals range to meet more tastes and preferences among a growing customer base, in addition to developing a broader range of product categories.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Jonathan Petrides, founder and CEO of allplants, said: <em>&#8220;</em>In the five years that we have been cooking, we’ve seen the demand for plant-based food explode. We’ve got a tonne of exciting plans to bring the movement to even more people’s kitchens, and this investment will allow us to do just that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Food choices are deeply personal, so quality and taste will always come first for us &#8212; it’s the driver of everything we do, and what makes it so easy for our customers to include more plants in their diets without the compromise,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We can now imagine, create and serve up many more delicious recipes and products, to ultimately accelerate the transformative impact that plant-based living will have on the future of our planet.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In a supporting statement, Nicola McClafferty, partner at Draper Esprit, said: <em>“</em>This is an extremely exciting investment for Draper Esprit. Allplants is uniquely positioned at the intersection of some of the fastest growing areas in food consumption today: high quality, plant-based meals that deliver on taste, sustainability and nutrition in an incredibly convenient way for consumers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“JP and the team have established a stellar brand with very clear values, incredibly strong growth and a loyal customer base. Allplants has real potential to scale its direct-to-consumer business while expanding into new channels both in the UK and beyond. We believe it can be a global brand, bringing nutrition, taste and convenience to the plant-curious consumer and we are delighted to be supporting the team as they grow and thrive.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot of activity going on with social commerce in Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp holding the keys to the marketplace-facing side of things to fintech companies like Paystack and Flutterwave bringing value with their storefronts capabilities, small and medium-sized merchants have more reach to their customers than ever before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, the majority of these small businesses still struggle to deliver their products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">efficiently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a mix of technology and offline methods, <a href="https://sendbox.co/">Sendbox</a> presents merchants with a more reliable platform and has raised $1.8 million seed to help them with their e-commerce fulfilment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4DX Ventures, Enza Capital, FJLabs, and Golden Palm Investments invested in the round while Flexport and Y Combinator participated (Sendbox was part of YC&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/most-african-yc-backed-startups-in-todays-batch-are-focused-on-fintech/">2021 winter batch</a>)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the pre-seed raised from Microtraction and 4DX Ventures three years ago, Sendbox&#8217;s total investment is a little over $2 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219161" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The journey of Sendbox started nine years ago when founder and CEO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/emotu">Emotu Balogun</a> was running his previous startup Traclist. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The now-defunct company was a fashion marketplace in Nigeria that helped small merchants sell their products online</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Before shutting down, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traclist ran into scaling issues as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> most of its merchants could not get their fulfilment done despite the presence of a few logistics companies in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t a solution that allowed us to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> service providers onto a platform and integrate them into our marketplace, said Balogun to TechCrunch over a call</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;And if it existed, it would have given us the ability to decentralize the operations of our marketplace and scale it up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later Balogun figured other marketplaces had this same problem. Once these platforms got customers to buy products,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the next puzzle was how to help out with logistics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Seeing as no logistics provider was efficient enough to help Traclist with its fulfilment needs, Balogun started building Sendbox in 2016 with Olusegun Afolahan; the pair fully launched the company two years later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Sendbox has made </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adjustments to its model and interaction with merchants and customers, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">its core remains</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide e-commerce fulfilment for African merchants, starting from Nigeria. &#8220;Sendbox wants to help small e-commerce merchants who sell </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to customers through their own online and offline channels with fulfilment,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; said the chief executive giving a one-line pitch of the company.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2219207" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219207" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2219207" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?w=680" alt="Sendbox" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sendbox.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219207" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sendbox</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small merchants who use providers such as DHL to move local and international shipments might not command discounted delivery rates because they move little volume</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But Sendbox, aggregating a lot of providers, is proposing to offer these discounted rates to merchants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the thing that attracts a lot of merchants to us. Because what happens is, they&#8217;re able to start small and actually grow their business because we are giving them favourable rates,&#8221; said Balogun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These rates help merchants save on average 30-40% per item and eliminates the need to work with separate logistics providers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Sendbox&#8217;s generated revenue </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is shared</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the logistics providers as a reward for chasing a symbiotic relationship</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sendbox makes local deliveries within Nigeria and international deliveries to over 200 countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt and Ibadan are the most favoured destinations for local deliveries, while Canada, the U.S., and the U.K. hold top spots for the latter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to that, Balogun says Sendbox offers next day delivery for orders within Lagos, three to five days for nationwide deliveries and five to seven days for international deliveries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What merchants have moved the most are clothing, fashion, lifestyle, beauty, and self-care products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sendbox is available to users via iOS, Android, web, Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram, other e-commerce platforms and developer APIs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The three-year-old company has reached over 10,000 merchants through these channels and claims to have made more than 200,000 deliveries since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, of which 35%-40% are international.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Balogun tells TechCrunch that Sendbox&#8217;s revenue and transactions have grown 300% year over year in the last three years. And t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o continue that exponential growth, Sendbox will expand its product capabilities and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">geographical presence as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For us, our vision </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to become the e-commerce operating system for African merchants and logistics is the first entry point for the company,&#8221; said Balogun</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next entry is financing and payments &#8212; an identical play to what other platforms such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/backed-by-greycroft-klasha-gets-2-4m-to-improve-cross-border-commerce-in-africa/">Klasha</a> operate by combining three worlds of e-commerce, logistics, and payments.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in the works for Sendbox is a few e-commerce and marketplace integrations and a move to other countries in West and East Africa, the CEO added. The company hopes to bring these plans, including hiring new talent, to fruition with this investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;African e-commerce is accelerating faster than anybody could have imagined a decade ago and it needs smart solutions to ensure that logistics and fulfilment capacity doesn&#8217;t lag behind,&#8221; Walter Baddoo, the co-founder and general partner at 4DX Ventures, said of the seed round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not only were we impressed by Sendbox&#8217;s 300% year-on-year growth since launch, but we&#8217;re seeing the market potential balloon with over 40 million Nigerian SMEs and a projected industry value for social and e-commerce reaching $45 billion on the continent by 2025</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa&#8217;s e-commerce market is expected to be worth $75 billion by 2025. And with merchants&#8217; need for e-commerce fulfilment growing by the day, we should expect new companies to spring forth in the coming years. It will be interesting to see how the market shapes up from competition between them and the likes of Sendbox and Egypt&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/bosta-raises-6-7m-to-expand-e-commerce-delivery-business-across-africa-and-mena/">Bosta</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/egyptian-startup-flextock-closes-3-25m-in-the-largest-pre-seed-yet-in-mena/">Flextock</a> (another YC-backed winter 2021 company), young but established companies that have raised VC money this year to scale in different markets across the continent.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is testing Pool Chance, a feature that lets riders heading in the same direction share the cost of the journey, in Kenya, with plans to roll out the low-cost service to Ghana and Nigeria. </span>TechCrunch discovered the option when booking a car in Nairobi, Kenya. An Uber spokesperson later confirmed it was part of a pilot (beta version) of the service that it plans to roll out more widely, pending the outcome of the smaller test.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new service, being introduced for the first time in Africa, is similar to UberPool </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/uberpool-launch-for-real/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched in the San Francisco Bay Area </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2014 and later introduced in multiple cities across the world. The low-cost popular service remains </span><a href="https://help.uber.com/riders/article/uberpool-temporarily-unavailable?nodeId=1bbcee42-8f54-4a99-a237-e365911fec7d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suspended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in many regions including the US and Canada due to Covid-19 restrictions, but it seems the technology firm is slowly bringing it back in some markets and introducing it where it was unavailable before. Uber said the two products share a similar concept but are not identical, without offering further details.</span></p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.uberpeople.net/threads/pool-chance.439391/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this thread</a> in an Uber drivers&#8217; forum describes the difference like this. Pool Chance is just that: you have a chance of getting a discounted ride if the driver picks up other riders; otherwise you pay the regular fees you&#8217;d pay for an individual ride. UberPool negotiates a specific carpool rate for the rider regardless of who else gets into the vehicle.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219124" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pool Chance trip option is available on the </span><a href="https://www.uber.com/en-KE/blog/introducing-pool-chance-in-nairobi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget service, Chap Chap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Nairobi; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the populous </span><a href="https://www.uber.com/en-NG/blog/introducing-pool-chance-in-accra-and-lagos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian city of Lagos and Ghana’s capital Accra</span></a>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">it will be accessible on the UberX category. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are currently trialling a new Uber ride, Pool Chance, which will cut costs for riders in Nairobi (Kenya) when they share their ride with others heading in the same direction,&#8221; Uber’s head of communications for East &amp; West Africa, Lorraine Ondoru, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We use this approach when introducing something new and we want to ensure the marketplace remains healthy and balanced. We will share more details once this has been officially launched,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, Uber launched Pool Chance in Auckland, New Zealand after introducing it in Kyiv, Ukraine in October last year. They also <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-AU/newsroom/sydpool/">switched back on</a> the low-cost rideshare service in Australia&#8217;s Sydney and Perth cities earlier in the year, and thereafter launched Pool Chance in Adelaide.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber says on the app that Pool Chance will bring the cost of rides down by up to 30%, further making its trips more affordable to riders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordable shared rides can mean more riders using the app, which can lead to more trips, less downtime, and more overall earnings for you,” Uber said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">about the new service, in a message to its drivers, in the three African countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is available in eight </span><a href="https://www.uber.com/global/en/cities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">markets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across Africa including Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, and Morocco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the continent, it has over the last few months expanded and introduced new products in its new strategy to retain its customers and attract new ones amidst growing competition from rivals like Bolt, the Estonian-based ride hailing firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Uber expanded to two additional cities in Nigeria &#8211; Ibadan and Port Harcourt &#8211; bringing into the regions a service that is already available in three other cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In South Africa, it also expanded its reach by nine cities this year and introduced its premium service dubbed Uber Comfort to be offered alongside UberX, UberBlack and the budget service, UberGo. It also added a feature that allows booking of a trip a month in advance in August, a service that was already available in other markets across the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber’s plan to introduce the fare-splitting service in markets across Africa comes after it said in a recent </span><a href="https://d1nyezh1ys8wfo.cloudfront.net/static/PDFs/Transit+Horizons+vF.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “ride-sharing will likely play an increasingly important role within the public transportation mix in the next 3-5 years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company added that while bus and rail transportation will remain core to public transportation due to their ability to transport large numbers of people, they will be complemented by microtransit, ride-sharing and micro-mobility means. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The addition of new modes with a variable cost structure like ride-sharing and the proliferation of on-demand services will unlock new optimums of efficiency and lower cost structures for public transportation agencies,” said Uber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, it said, will go towards ensuring and improving “the equity, accessibility, resilience, and flexibility of their networks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through Uber Transit, a division serving public transportation, and Routematch, a company they bought last year that provides software to transit agencies, it said in the report that it&#8217;s providing new tools to help agencies to operate more efficiently and offer support to its riders too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the establishment of Uber Transit in 2015, the tech firm has rolled out services in regions across the world that go towards making public transport seamless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early 2019, it launched an Uber in-app service that enables riders in Denver to plan their journeys and purchase tickets, and offered software to power public transportation after partnering with Marin Transit, in California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September last year it launched in some markets “Uber and Transit”, an in-app feature that makes it possible for riders to use the ride-hailing service to combine trips with other public transportation means like trains and buses. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is set to announce new hardware today. The company is holding a (virtual) keynote at <strong>10 AM PT (1 PM in New York, 6 PM in London, 7 PM in Paris)</strong>. And you’ll be able to watch the event right here as the company is streaming it live.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/exM1uajp--A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/16/what-to-expect-from-apple-google-and-samsungs-big-events/">Rumor has it</a> that the company is set to announce some new Macs. Over the past year, Apple has updated its entry-level computers with new custom-designed M1 chips. And now, the company could bring its own chips to higher-end computers, such as a 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, a new Mac Mini and a 27-inch iMac.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple could use this opportunity to redesign its laptops from the ground up with new display technologies, a new array of ports and a new form factor in general. But that’s not all. Apple has also been working on an updated version of its entry-level AirPods.</p>
<p>You can watch the livestream directly on this page, as Apple is streaming its conference on YouTube.</p>
<p>If you have an Apple TV, you can open the TV app and look for the ‘Apple Special Event’ section. It lets you stream today’s event and rewatch old ones.</p>
<p>And if you don’t have an Apple TV and don’t want to use YouTube, the company also lets you livestream the event from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events section</a> on its website. This video feed now works in all major browsers — Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.</p>
<p>We’ll be covering the event and you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/live-from-apples-unleashed-event/">follow our liveblog</a> for live commentary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic forced the legal profession to cobble together remote work strategies, often through a combination of video conferencing and emails. Founded in Melbourne, <a href="https://www.immediation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immediation</a> provides a tailor-made solution with digital courtrooms and mediation tools. It has been adopted by Australian federal courts and New Zealand government agencies, and is now expanding in the United States and European markets after raising $3.6 million AUD (about $2.7 million USD). Investors include Thorney Investment Group and its founder and chair, Alex Waislitz.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 and launched in 2019, Immediation’s users include the Federal Court of Australia, the Victorial Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT), and New Zealand agencies like the Ministry of Justice, Sport New Zealand and Domain Name Commission NZ. The startup says over the past 12 months, its revenue has increased 6x year-over-year and its user growth has jumped 2,000%. Immediation currently has about 40 employees in five countries, and a panel of more than 100 mediators and arbitrators. Its new funding brings Immediation’s total raised to $10 million AUD.</p>
<p>In addition to Australia and New Zealand, Immediation also has users in Southeast Asian markets, and will spend the next 12 months focused on growing in the U.S. and European markets.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218588" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before starting Immediation as a mediation platform (it also now supports law firms, tribunals and resolution bodies), founder and managing director Laura Keily worked for two decades as a corporate lawyer and barrister. She told TechCrunch in an email that she wanted to create an online mediation platform because “I saw firsthand that people were locked out of being able to access justice effectively. The legal system is complex, lengthy and expensive. It’s an old system regimented by ancient rules and processes, which are not scalable and are inefficient.”</p>

<p>Before using Immediation, many of its clients only had the option of face-to-face meetings in a mediation center or courtroom. Immediation launched its platform publicly in September 2019, a few months before the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>“The onset of COVID-19 was a turning point,” Keily said. “As industries were forced to move online overnight, our team pivoted quickly to address the immediate concerns of the legal industry and provide a blueprint for a seamless transition online.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In 2020,</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"> Immediation saw a 2,200% increase in users across more than 2020, including a 500-person hearing over five days for the first ever Willem C. Vis International Arbitration Moot, a moot competition attended by hundreds of law schools.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218589" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218589" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2218589 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Laura-Keily-Immediation-2021-2.jpg?w=200" alt="A photo of Immediation founder and managing director Laura Keily" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Laura-Keily-Immediation-2021-2.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Laura-Keily-Immediation-2021-2.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Laura-Keily-Immediation-2021-2.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Laura-Keily-Immediation-2021-2.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Laura-Keily-Immediation-2021-2.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Laura-Keily-Immediation-2021-2.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218589" class="wp-caption-text">Immediation founder and managing director Laura Keily</p></div></p>
<p>Keily said Immediation was created by lawyers to replicate physical courtrooms, mediation suites, legal client floors and dispute resolution environments. Its tools include the ability to record hearings, share and manage documents, co-draft and execute contracts, enable confidential communication between lawyers and clients during proceedings and set up secure, private rooms for different parties. Judicial officers and mediators retain control participants in a private room, so they can move or remove them as necessary.</p>
<p>Maintaining lawyer-client confidentiality is essential. Immediation built secure chat and party rooms so “client-lawyer teams can communicate in complete confidence with their own team, even when proceedings are in full flight, knowing that no one else, by design, can see those messages or enter the party room,” said Keily.</p>
<p>Immediation also announced today that it has appointed Christine Christian, the chair of Auctus Investment Group and Tamara Credit Partners, as its new chair, and Rachael Neumann and Greg Wildisen to its board. It added Afterpay chair Elena Rubin and Rampersand VC founding partner Jim Cassidy to its advisory board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the gating factors for getting more homeowners to make the switch to solar energy has been that solar, as a business, is hard one to get right, with <a href="https://okcredit.in/blog/why-do-many-solar-energy-startups-fail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many a company failing</a> when they&#8217;ve been unable to strike the right balance between the technology working as it should, provisioning services in a cost-effective way, providing good customer service, and handling their own overhead. Today, a startup that believes it has squared some of these problems away is announcing a big funding round as it gears up for growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.enpal.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enpal</a> &#8212; a solar startup out of Berlin, Germany, that uses AI for provisioning and installing services, and then a subscription-style model for homeowners to pay for it (you might even call it a SaaS model: solar-as-a-service) &#8212; has raised €150 million ($174 million) from SoftBank Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>The funding closes out its Series C at €250 million ($290 million), including €100 million that Enpal raised earlier this year from investors that included HV Capital and SolarCity co-founder Peter Rive. The investment values Enpal at €950 million ($1.1 billion) post-money, the company has confirmed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219152" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To date, Enpal has raised around $360 million in equity, with another $406 million in debt.</p>
<p>The company has some 10,000 customers in Germany, and the plan will be to continue growing in its home market, as well as make its first efforts to expand to new ones. Ultimately Enpal&#8217;s goal, CEO Mario Kohle said, is to make using renewable energy a realistic option for everyone and everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our plan is to go beyond Germany because the climate crisis goes beyond our boarders,&#8221; Kohle said in an interview. &#8220;We also think that this small thing that we invented could also expand into e-mobility and community-based energy distribution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 with Viktor Wingert and Jochen Ziervogel, Kohle said the original idea was to build a new startup that could be more proactive about the climate crisis. His previous company, a sales lead-generation startup that he sold to PE firm General Atlantic, happened to have a number of customers that came from the solar market. Kohle liked what they were trying to do, but he saw them fail time and time again. He started to do some research into why, and found that it wasn&#8217;t the solar technology per se, but all of the hurdles in selling and provisioning it efficiently. The business model just didn&#8217;t add up for most of them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So this is where Enpal &#8212; which is a portmanteau of &#8220;energy&#8221; and &#8220;pal&#8221;, Kohle said &#8212; put all of its focus.</p>
<p>It first built an AI-based algorithm that lets users take pictures of their roofs, and then uses computer vision and other techniques to determine the size and positioning of the installation required. The whole provisioning part of the installation is done remotely, with technicians only visiting the house at the point of installation, meaning a faster service at a lower cost.</p>
<p>From there, customers use an IoT app to measure their energy gathering, storage (on <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">lithium iron phosphate cells also supplied by Enpal)</span> and consumption, and to pay for services. Customers do not pay for the energy they use, but they pay rent on the solar panels and for the all-round service &#8212; which include installation, maintenance, repair if necessary, and insurance. Users sign on for 20-year contracts and are able to purchase their panels for 1 euro at the end of that period.</p>
<p>While a number of energy-focused green-tech companies in the market today are focused on innovations in how to generate energy or consume less of it, or with a smaller impact on our environment, Enpal is part of an emerging group that are leaning on those innovations, but are themselves more focused on how to make scaling those solutions more practical and profitable.</p>
<p>Another startup called Aurora Solar is tackling this as a B2B2C problem: in May, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/aurora-solar-aims-to-power-the-growing-solar-industry-with-a-250m-round-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a $250 million Series C of its own</a> earlier this year for technology that also uses computer vision (along with satellite mapping and other data), which it sells to solar companies to help them automate home installation designs and cost estimates, thereby also reducing the huge costs associated with that.</p>
<p>Moonshots, of course, come with risks. Aurora&#8217;s focus on selling software to the solar industry means that it doesn&#8217;t control the full business model and its success is predicated on its customers continuing to grow (and not failing because of the many other challenges in running a solar business).</p>
<p>Enpal has a different kind of challenge, which is that it needs to make sure it doesn&#8217;t find itself over-leveraged with the number of solar installations it has out in the market subsidized by Enpal itself, with perhaps those customers not buying as much solar energy as they&#8217;d been projected to buy. And while you might argue that there are hundreds of tech companies that essentially follow similar principles &#8212; any company that supplies a device to a customer so that the customer pays for a service on that device &#8212; at an estimated cost of between $15,000 and $40,000 for a solar power system for a 2,000 square-foot house, this hardware is typically two orders of magnitude more expensive than, say, a set-top box. That basic model subsidizing panels is one reason the company has taken on so much debt.</p>
<p>Kohle believes the chances of that playing out in a tough way for the company are low simply because the model so compelling. The company is not yet profitable, but &#8220;We have a positive contribution margin from the beginning&#8221; because of the SaaS model, he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s something the customers are paying, and it means we are cash flow positive from the beginning. And what customers like is that they are paying less and getting a solar system for free.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investors also seem to agree.</p>
<p>“Rising electricity prices and increasing demand mean renewable energy adoption is rapidly becoming mainstream,” said Yanni Pipilis, managing partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “We believe Enpal offers customers an all-in-one solar solution, lowering the barriers to entry for consumers. It’s great to be working with Mario and the Enpal team to make more households energy independent.”</p>
<p><em>Updated to correct how customers pay for the service: it&#8217;s a flat rental fee per month, not based on usage.</em></p>
