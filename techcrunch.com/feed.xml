										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today <a href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/search-on-2021/">introduced</a> new ways to shop through its platform, including both online and via its Google Search mobile app. In an update coming soon to the Google Search app for iPhone, the company will begin to leverage a new machine learning model using on-device processing to recognize the products found in images on a website to make them instantly &#8220;shoppable.&#8221; It will also make it easier for online shoppers to browse for clothing and accessories from the search results and check for in-stock items at local stores.</p>
<p>On the Google mobile app for iOS, users will soon see a new button that turns the images on a website into shoppable products through Google Lens. That means, if you&#8217;re browsing a website and something catches your eye in a photograph, you can click to see where to buy the item in question. This sort of feature is an expansion of the existing Google Lens technology, which can already identify products in images. It&#8217;s just adding it to a new context.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210082" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210082" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210082" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Search_On_Lens_Mode.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210082" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google Lens will also come to Chrome on the desktop, Google says, allowing users to select the images, video, and text content on a website with Lens to see the search results in the same tab.</p>
<p>In another update, when you&#8217;re browsing for clothing, shoes, and accessories on mobile, Google will make it easier to shop from its Search results.</p>
<p>Here, it will display a visual feed of products matching your query &#8212; like &#8220;cropped jackets,&#8221; for example &#8212; in multiple colors and styles. And it will show you style guides, videos, and details on where you can buy the items locally. You can also filter the results by style, department, brand, and more, plus check ratings, reviews, and compare prices.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210092" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210092" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2210092" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/E918_Search_On_storyboards_Browsy_Shopping_nl_1.gif?w=680" alt="" width="544" height="544" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210092" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google notes this experience is powered by its &#8220;Shopping Graph,&#8221; a real-time dataset of product inventory that today consists of over 24 billion listings.</p>
<p>This will also help shoppers when they&#8217;re looking to buy in-person, as you can select an &#8220;in stock&#8221; filter to see which nearby stores have your item available right now. This could be particularly useful ahead of the busy holiday shopping season to help people shop for gifts and children&#8217;s toys.</p>
<p>The updates were announced today at Google&#8217;s Search On event, where the company also detailed other product updates to Maps, Lens, and Search, including those that leverage new A.I. enhancements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is making a change to its search results with the goal of improving the media literacy of online users. The company is expanding the capabilities of its &#8220;About this Result&#8221; feature, launched earlier this year, to also now include information about the source itself, including its description from Wikipedia and what the site says about itself, as well as news, reviews, and other context that can help people better evaluate unfamiliar or new sources. It will also point users to other information about the same topic, to point users to other sources of information that may be related to the user&#8217;s original query.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/google-now-gives-you-more-information-about-the-sites-in-your-search-results/">introduced</a> &#8220;About this Result&#8221; in February to its search results in English in the U.S., with a short description pulled from Wikipedia, if available, when the site first came online, and if your connection to the website was secure, among other things.</p>
<p>It will soon update this panel with more details. Instead of just a description of the site from Wikipedia, it will now also include what a website says about itself, in its own words. This information is pulled directly from the website, when available. Often, a site includes details about its authors, publishers or its purpose in an &#8220;about section&#8221; that introduces the website to new visitors. This information will now be extracted to enhance the &#8220;About the Source&#8221; panel with more details.</p>
<p>Below this, Google will display when the site first came online &#8212; a piece of information that could help users to identify websites that have sustained themselves over a longer period of time, versus newcomers that may have popped up more recently as part of recent misinformation or propaganda campaign.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="372" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2210071" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg 2822w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=768,420 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=680,372 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=1536,840 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1121 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Google will also connect users to more information about the source itself, as indexed across the web. Here, people can analyze what others are saying about the site in question, whether that&#8217;s news outlets, reviews, trusted organizations like the Better Business Bureau, and more. This could help people learn what sort of reputation the website has online, as documented by other sources.</p>
<p>The company clarifies this section of &#8220;others&#8221; will be based on Google Results from the open web, which identify pages that may give you context about the website. Google also attempts to prioritize the helpful results which are not created or controlled by the source website in order to provide independent perspectives, it says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition, Google will add an &#8220;About the Topic&#8221; feature that will point web searchers to more information about their original query, including top news coverage or other search results about that same subject. This could help people to learn more about something they&#8217;re interested in. But it could also potentially prevent people from isolating themselves inside a so-called &#8220;filter bubble&#8221; &#8212; something that has become a significant complication of the social media era, where people aren&#8217;t exposed to other sources of information as their preferred social platforms learn their preferences, then feeds them more of the same to boost engagement.</p>
<p>The updates were announced today by Danielle Romain, Google&#8217;s VP of Trust, who was speaking today at Google&#8217;s Search On live event.</p>
<p>The feature is not immediately available but will roll out in the &#8220;coming weeks&#8221; in English in the United States. Google says it working to bring &#8220;About this Result&#8221; to more countries in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has updates for a handful of tools aimed at helping people use Maps for more, or get on them in the first place. The company is improving wildfire tracking, expanding a tool for calculating tree canopy cover in cities, and further automating virtual address creation with Plus Codes.</p>
<p>The wildfires will be of the most immediate use to most users, since the once rare disaster has evolved into its own recurring season. Google put out <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/mapping-wildfires-with-satellite-data/">a wildfire tracking tool last year</a> for people searching for those fires — so when you looked for &#8220;camp fire&#8221; or the like, it wouldn&#8217;t just serve news but a frequently updated info center complete with fire authorities&#8217; best guess at a live outline.</p>
<p>Now that information is coming to the Maps app as a layer like traffic or bike paths. When you turn it on, any nearby fires will be marked on the map, and tapping one will bring up its live outline as of an hour or so ago. Areas at risk are also marked, so you know if somewhere is safe to drive through or stay in. Helpful stuff, considering wildfires are so numerous and dangerous that it&#8217;s hard to keep track of them now.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209691" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/treecanopytool.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209691" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2209691" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/treecanopytool.png" alt="Map of Denver with an overlay showing areas with high and low tree cover." width="1024" height="636" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/treecanopytool.png 1404w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/treecanopytool.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/treecanopytool.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/treecanopytool.png?resize=768,477 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/treecanopytool.png?resize=680,422 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/treecanopytool.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209691" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In cities, Google has provided its &#8220;<a href="https://insights.sustainability.google/labs/treecanopy">Environmental Insights Explorer Tree Canopy tool</a>&#8221; to 15 U.S. cities, using aerial imagery to identify heat islands and other risk areas. Municipalities can use this to plan where to plant new trees or otherwise dedicate resources. First tested in LA, the tool will now expand to 100 cities around the globe, including Guadalajara, London, Sydney, Toronto, and Tokyo.</p>
<p>Another kind of data municipal authorities sometimes don&#8217;t have, especially in sparsely populated rural or fast-changing urban environments, is addresses. It sounds odd that a place might just not have an address, but streets and numbers do after all have to be assigned, registered, tracked, and used in order for things like mail and deliveries to arrive. Poorer and rural areas are often at risk of having to just use a nearby official address and rely on extra instructions or a knowledgeable delivery person to get mail reliably.</p>
<p>Several years back Google introduced &#8220;Plus Codes,&#8221; which are basically GPS coordinates tied to a short series of letters and numbers that can be entered into lots of online address services, including of course Google Maps. Even if you don&#8217;t have an actual street address, you can have a Plus Code and it ought to be enough to get someone to your door.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209689" style="width: 897px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209689" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2209689" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg" alt="A remote cabin with a popup above it showing a Google &quot;plus code&quot; that acts as an address." width="887" height="612" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg 887w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg?resize=768,530 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg?resize=680,469 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 887px) 100vw, 887px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209689" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now they&#8217;ve partnered with several local governments struggling to assign addresses in a regular way, integrating Plus Codes with the official machinery of governance. In The Gambia and Kenya, for instance, the Plus Codes will work for national ID cards and other purposes that would normally require a government-verified address. To be clear, the information is owned and administrated by the government, not Google, which just helps generate the codes and integrate them with existing online infrastructure. (There&#8217;s a new <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/addressmaker/">bulk creation tool</a> that helps generate street directions as well.)</p>
<p>All these tools emphasize Google&#8217;s interest in public-private partnerships — a cynic may think that they simply want to get their hooks in every aspect of life, but really the company, despite its advertising and surveillance business model, has always pushed projects like this. It genuinely hopes to transform industries and governments, and occasionally has some success doing it. At the very least these projects seem to lack much in the way of self-interest and could be quite useful to people around the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google announced today it will be applying A.I. advancements, including a new technology called <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/introducing-MUM/">Multitask Unified Model (MUM)</a> to improve Google Search. At the company&#8217;s <a href="https://searchon.withgoogle.com/live/">Search On</a> event, the company demonstrated new features, including those that leverage MUM, to better connect web searchers to the content they&#8217;re looking for, while also making web search feel more natural and intuitive.</p>
<p>One of the features being launched is called &#8220;Things to know,&#8221; which will focus on making it easier for people to understand new topics they&#8217;re searching for. This feature understands how people typically explore various topics and then shows web searchers the aspects of the topic people are most likely to look at first.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209223" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209223" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209223" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Search-On-Things-to-Know.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209223" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>For example, Google explained, if you were searching for &#8220;acrylic painting,&#8221; it may suggest &#8220;Things to know&#8221; like how to get started with painting, step-by-step, or the different styles of acrylic painting, tips about acrylic painting, how to clean acrylic paint, and more. In this example, Google is able to identify over 350 different topics related to acrylic painting, it notes.</p>
<p>This feature will launch in the coming months, but Google notes it will also be expanded in the future by using MUM to help web users unlock even deeper insights into the topic beyond what they may have thought to look for &#8212; like &#8220;how to make acrylic paintings with household items.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209221" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209221" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209221" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Search-On-Visual-Ideas.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209221" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The company is also developing new ways to help web users both refine and broaden their searches without having to start over with a new query.</p>
<p>To continue the acrylic painting example, Google may offer to connect you to information about specific painting techniques, like puddle pouring, or art classes you could take. You could then zoom into one of those other topics in order to see a visually rich page of search results and ideas from across the web, including articles, images, videos, and more.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2210054" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="388" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg 2806w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=768,438 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=680,388 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=1536,876 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1168 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>These pages are meant to better compete with Pinterest, it seems, as they&#8217;re also able to help people become inspired by searches &#8212; similar to how Pinterest&#8217;s image-heavy pinboard aims to turn people&#8217;s visual inspiration into action &#8212; like visiting a website or making an online purchase.</p>
<p>Google says the pages will be useful for searches where users are &#8220;looking for inspiration,&#8221; like &#8220;Halloween decorating ideas&#8221; or &#8220;indoor vertical garden ideas&#8221; or other ideas to try. This feature can be tried out today on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Google is also upgrading video search. Already, the company uses A.I. to identify key moments inside a video. Now, it will take things further with the launch of a feature that will identify the topics in a video &#8212; even if the topic isn&#8217;t explicitly mentioned in the video &#8212; then provide links that allow users to dig deeper and learn more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209224" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209224" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209224" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Search-On-Related-Topics-in-Videos.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209224" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>That means when you&#8217;re watching a YouTube video, MUM will be used to understand what the video is about and make suggestions. In an example, a video about Macaroni penguins may point users to a range of related videos, like those that talk about how Macaroni penguins find their family members and navigate predators. MUM can identify these terms to search for, even if they&#8217;re not explicitly said in the video.</p>
<p>This feature will roll out in an initial version on YouTube Search in the weeks ahead, and will be updated to include more visual enhancements in the coming months, says Google.</p>
<p>This change could also help to drive increased search traffic to Google, by leveraging YouTube&#8217;s sizable reach. Many Gen Z users already search for online content differently than older generations, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-gen-z-searches-for-content">studies have found</a>. They tend to use multiple social media channels, have a mobile-first mindset, and are engaged with video content. <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/video/gen-z-and-youtube/">A &#8220;Think with Google&#8221; study,</a> for instance, found that 85% of Gen Z teenagers would use YouTube regularly to find content, while 80% said YouTube videos had successfully taught them something. Other data had <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/gen-z-stats">demonstrated</a> that Gen Z prefers to learn about new ideas and products through video as well, not text, native ads, or other content formats.</p>
<p>For Google, this sort of addition may be necessary because the shift to mobile is impacting its search dominance. Today, many mobile shopping searches today <a href="https://britewire.com/amazon-beats-google-in-product-searches/">now start directly</a> on Amazon. Plus, when iPhone users need to do something specific on their phone, they often turn to Siri, Spotlight, the App Store, or a native app to get help.</p>
<p>Google also today <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/google-introduces-a-new-way-to-search-that-combines-images-and-text-into-one-query">unveiled</a> how it&#8217;s using MUM technology to improve visual searches using Google Lens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, at Google&#8217;s I/O annual developer conference, the company <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/introducing-MUM/">introduced</a> a new A.I. milestone called Multitask Unified Model, or MUM. This technology can simultaneously understand information across a wide range of formats, including text, images, and videos, and draw insights and connections between topics, concepts, and ideas. Today, Google announced one of the ways it&#8217;s planning to put MUM to work in its own products with an update to its Google Lens visual search.</p>
<p><a href="https://lens.google/">Google Lens</a> is the company&#8217;s image recognition technology which lets you use the phone&#8217;s camera to perform a variety of tasks, like real-time translation, identifying plants and animals, copying and pasting from photos, finding items similar items to what&#8217;s in the camera&#8217;s viewfinder, getting help with math problems, and much more.</p>
<p>Soon, Google says it will leverage MUM&#8217;s capabilities to upgrade Google Lens with the ability to add text to visual searches in order to allow users to ask questions about what they see.</p>
<p>In practice, this is how such a feature could work. You could pull up a photo of a shirt you like in Google Search, then tap on the Lens icon and ask Google to find you the same pattern &#8212; but on a pair of socks. By typing in something like &#8220;socks with this pattern,&#8221; you could direct Google to find relevant queries in a way that may have been more difficult to do if you had only used text input alone.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209102" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209102" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209102" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Search-On-MUM-x-Lens-Shirt-Example.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209102" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>This could be particularly useful for the type of queries that Google today struggles with &#8212; where there&#8217;s a visual component to what you&#8217;re looking for that is either hard to describe using words alone or that could be described in different ways. By combining the image and the words into one query, Google may have a better shot at delivering relevant search results.</p>
<p>In another example, a part of your bike has been broken and you need to search on Google for repair tips. However, you don&#8217;t know what the piece is called. Instead of delving into repair manuals, you could point Google Lens at the broken part of your bike, then type in &#8220;how to fix.&#8221; This could connect you directly with the exact moment in a video that could help.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209100" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209100" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209100" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Search-On-MUM-x-Lens-Bike-Example.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209100" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The company sees these A.I.-driven initiatives as ways to make its products &#8220;more helpful&#8221; to end-users by enabling new ways to search. By making use of the phone&#8217;s camera as part of Search, Google is aiming to stay relevant in a market where many of its core use cases are starting to shift to other properties. For instance, many shopping searches today <a href="https://britewire.com/amazon-beats-google-in-product-searches/">now start directly</a> on Amazon. And when iPhone users need to do something specific on their phone, they often just turn to Siri, Spotlight, the App Store, or a native app to get help. And Apple is<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/28/apple-steps-up-effort-to-build-google-search-alternative.html"> developing</a> its own alternative to Google Search as well. You could see the beginnings of this work in the iOS 15 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-spotlight/">update to Spotlight search</a>, which now directly connects users to the information they need without the need for a Google query.</p>
<p>Google says it&#8217;s also putting MUM to work in other ways across Google Search and video searches, the company announced at its Search On live event today.</p>
<p>The Google Lens update will roll out in the months ahead, noting that it still needs to go through &#8220;rigorous testing and evaluation,&#8221; which is a part of every new AI model that its deploys.</p>

	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Speaking about the historical trajectory of significant movements, Gandhi once said, “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.” For startup founders, these words aptly describe the road ahead.</p>
<p>Successful startups will inevitably draw the attention of powerful incumbents in their industry. They will fight you, but if you are positioned well for the challenge there has never been a better time to prevail.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Your advantage is that you can add value to your core technology and get it into the hands of customers faster than an existing large corporation usually can.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In recent years, we’ve seen startups overcome seemingly insurmountable odds to redefine industries that had been stagnant for decades. Three key factors are tilting the balance in favor of emerging players:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cycle of creative destruction is shorter than ever. Gone are the days of five-year plans; they’ve been replaced by 12-18 month roadmaps that favor the agile.</li>
<li>Customer loyalty has waned. Even the most entrenched businesses and industries are willing to try something new to stay competitive.</li>
<li>Portability and the cloud have permanently altered user expectations of their technology providers. Vendor lock-in is no longer an option.</li>
</ul>
<p>What separates the successful from the rest is understanding how to compete with established companies that seem to have major advantages at every turn. The success of startups in recent years, particularly during the uncertainty of the pandemic, is testimony to this. We can learn a lot from companies like Twilio, Snowflake and Zoom about how asking the right questions and developing a competitive plan can lead to success.</p>
<h2>Are you an improver or a disrupter?</h2>
<p>Most startups follow one of two paths, and the first step is to determine which one you’re on. The first path is traveled by improvers — those who see an opportunity to make an existing dynamic better. The other is traveled by disruptors, startups that believe the current way of doing things should fundamentally change. Established companies have playbooks for battling both, but knowing who you are and what you’re about will allow you to stay on the offensive in the right way.</p>
<p>The immediate challenge for improvers is to find relevance in an established market. Not only do you have to be exponentially better than the competition, you have to find a way to prove it. For disruptors, it’s about convincing prospects that they’re going about things the wrong way — and doing so without being confrontational. Beyond that, the playbook for taking on your industry&#8217;s giants is similar.</p>
<p>Here’s how it will play out:</p>
<p><strong>What to expect:</strong> At the outset, the big vendors will ignore you. They will tell their customers that you provide an unnecessary service – if they recognize you at all. Getting a foot in the door here is the first major obstacle. Your challenge is to find someone within the organization willing to take a chance on what you have to offer, and to demonstrate an improvement they can’t ignore.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the greatest challenges for farmers today is the increasingly volatility in the climate, leading to unpredictable weather patterns, making growing conditions challenging. If farmers can’t grow crops, then our food security is as risk. Gradually, the field of AgTech is attempting to address this issue.</p>
<p>There are increasing numbers of FaaS or ‘Farming as a Service’ startups that are looking to help farmers manage crop yields and plug into IOt sensors or data such as weather platforms. Sencrop from France has raised $12M, Augmenta (Greece) is a yield boosting platform that has raised  $11.2M and Ekylibre (France) is an open-source ERP for farmers which has raised an undisclosed Series A.</p>
<p>Coming out of Vancouver, Canada is <a href="https://semios.com/">Semios</a>, a “precision-farming” startup and one of the world’s largest independent agtech platforms. It has now raised $100 million in funding led by Morningside Group, a Boston-based private equity, and impact VC firm.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Gilbert, CEO of Semios, said:“Semios is on a mission to simplify the grower’s experience, leveraging big data analytics and machine learning to help them mitigate crop risk so they can focus on growing more food, more sustainably. We have seen first hand the challenges our customers are facing in the field – from severe drought and devastating fires, to frost, reduced profitability, and an increasing regulatory burden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if he thought there were competitors to his platform, Gilbert said: &#8220;There are numerous companies that provide elements of our comprehensive solution but we&#8217;re unaware of anyone who&#8217;s currently offering an integrated end-to-end solution that addresses the gamut of farmers&#8217; crop production requirements including annual planning, insect and disease control, water management through to regulatory reporting and compliance tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>Semios has now raised a total of over $225 million in external capital to date, after a $100 million round, also led by Morningside Group, back in February 2020. This allowed it to go on an acquisition spree, rolling-up other third-party agricultural solutions into its crop management platform, including Altrac, Centricity, and Agworld in 2021.</p>
<p>Mick Sawka, Morningside Investment Manager, commented: &#8220;Morningside invests in companies committed to tackling pressing global challenges head on. The ability to not only maintain but also enhance the sustainability of our food systems amid the complex dynamics of a changing climate is one of the world’s most pressing needs of our time.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Semios now has customers in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and South Africa.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of…no, hold on, hold on. It’s not time to watch your favorite soap opera. It’s time to stop procrastinating and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=3dayslefttosavepost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=3dayslefttosavepost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy your pass</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=3dayslefttosavepost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=3dayslefttosavepost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> before the early-bird price expires promptly on <strong>October 1 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>. That’s in just three days, people.</p>
<p>Action earns rewards, and if you beat the deadline, guess what? You get to keep $100 in your wallet. Save money <em>and</em> learn ways to build a better startup. Cool.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Take advantage of the early-bird group discount. Buy four or more passes before the deadline expires and pay just $45 each. We also have student passes available for $35 right up to the day of the event.</p>
<p>SaaS savants from around the world will hold forth on the latest tech and investment trends, demo innovative, boundary-breaking SaaS tech and connect with founders, investors, engineers and entrepreneurs. Oh, and don’t forget the tech journalists who will be searching for great stories to tell. Will yours be one of them?</p>
<p>TC Sessions are famous for outstanding programming with industry leaders, movers and shakers, and you can expect the same with our first SaaS Session. Here are just three of the presentations we have teed up. Check <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">the event agenda</a> and start planning your day. We’ll be adding more content in the run-up to game day.</p>
<p><strong>Survival of the Fittest — Investing in Today’s SaaS Market:</strong> The venture capital world is faster and more competitive than ever. Things are even crazier for investors hoping to get into the hottest SaaS deal. With non-traditional money pouring into the sector, remote dealmaking now the norm and an increasingly global market for software startups, venture capitalists have been forced to shake up their own operations and expectations. TechCrunch sits down with three leading investors — Casey Aylward (Costanoa Ventures), Kobie Fuller (Upfront Ventures) and Sarah Guo (Greylock) — to discuss how they’re fighting for allocation in hot deals, what they’ve changed in their own processes and what today’s best founders demand.</p>
<p><strong>Automation&#8217;s Moment Is Now:</strong> One thing we learned during the pandemic is the importance of automation, and that’s only likely to become more pronounced as we move forward. We’ll talk with UiPath CEO Daniel Dines, Laela Sturdy, an investor at CapitalG, and Dave Wright from ServiceNow about why this is automation’s moment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>What Happens After Your Startup Is Acquired:</strong> During this panel, we’ll speak to three founders — Jyoti Bansal (AppDynamics), Jewel Burks Solomon (Partpic) and Nick Mehta (GainSight) — about the emotional upheaval of being acquired and what happens after the check clears and the sale closes.</p>
<p>We’re less than one month away from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=3dayslefttosavepost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=3dayslefttosavepost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a>, but your chance to save $100 on the price of admission disappears in just three days. Stop procrastinating, beat the deadline and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#tickets">purchase your pass</a> <strong>before the early-bird price expires on October 1 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Read Dashboard sits in virtual meetings to measure engagement, performance and sentiment among participants.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meetings can go one of two ways&#8230; either be productive, or be ineffective. <a href="https://www.read.ai/">Read AI</a> wants all meeting goers to be engaged and feel productive, and it has developed a real-time shared dashboard to alert meeting participants when things are going well or not so well.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based company emerged from stealth mode Wednesday with its first financing, a $10 million seed round, led by Madrona Venture Group, and joined by PSL Ventures and a group of angel investors, including former Placed board member David Joerg, Verishop CEO Imran Khan, AI2 CEO Oren Etzioni, Qumulo CEO Bill Richter, Wunderman CEO Shane Atchison, Divvy founder Brian Ma, Snapchat product VP Peter Sellis and Snapchat engineering VP Nima Khajehnouri.</p>
<p>Read was co-founded in May by a team that has known each other for the past 20 years: CEO David Shim, former CEO of Foursquare, vice president of engineering Rob Williams and vice president of data science Elliott Waldron. The trio previously worked together at location analytics startup Placed, where Shim was also CEO. The company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/snapchat-placed/">acquired by Snapchat in 2017</a>, and spun out into Foursquare in 2019.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209764" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209764" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209764" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209764" class="wp-caption-text">Read Dashboard</p></div></p>
<p>The company’s first product, Read Dashboard, is a dashboard for virtual meetings that leverages artificial intelligence, computer vision and natural language processing to measure engagement, performance and sentiment among participants.</p>
<p>“Read Dashboard is like ‘Waze for meetings,’ ” Shim told TechCrunch. “We want to make collaboration easier, so it gives you analytics on how the meeting is going.”</p>
<p>Instead of checking each two-inch video box to read a participant&#8217;s emotions, Read provides real-time graphs and meters that show if one or more people are dominating the conversation, if people seem bored, not paying attention or if people seem happy or sad about what is being said. For example, on a sales call, Read can show if what is being said is trending negatively quickly so you can either stop talking or pivot to another topic, Shim said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, the dashboard is available as a free service on Zoom through Google Calendar integration. It notifies attendees when it is activated and can also be removed. As different use cases are supported, there will be additional features added that can be accessed for a fee, he added.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Matt McIlwain, managing director at Madrona Venture Group, is joining Read’s board of directors.</p>
<p>McIlwain also worked with Shim when they were both at Farecast, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/04/17/microsoft-acquires-farecast-for-115m/">bought by Microsoft in 2008</a>. They stayed in contact, and McIlwain was also a seed investor in Placed.</p>
<p>He regards Shim as someone who “has a good eye for having transparency and for creating products that are valuable to all constituents.” With Placed and Foursquare, McIlwain said he could see that Shim was “very hungry to make an impact and make a difference for the world.”</p>
<p>Now with Real, he says the co-founder team has complementary skills and are building something that will live on now that companies are operating in a digital-first world where it will be important to know if someone is not engaged enough, talking too much or not enough, he added.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Virtual meeting platform Vowel raises $13.5M, aims to cure meeting fatigue&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/virtual-meeting-platform-vowel-raises-13-5m-aims-to-cure-meeting-fatigue/embed/#?secret=4JLCPpxtx2" data-secret="4JLCPpxtx2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Read decided to go after seed funding for a couple of reasons: one, the <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-conferencing-market">global video conferencing market</a> is big — valued at $4.2 billion in 2020 — and two, the company is seeing massive adoption, Shim said. It is also seeing additional use cases like weekly stand ups where it was difficult to get a good read on people because there are so many on the video.</p>
<p>“We could have gone slower and built out over a few years, but we could see the need right now,” he added. “Half of all meetings are considered unproductive. We used to spend 30 or 60 minutes in meetings, and now it is hours a day in virtual conferences.”</p>
<p>In less than five months, Read has grown to 15 employees, something Shim said was a different experience while at Placed, where it took 15 months to reach the same milestone.</p>
<p>The new funding will go toward adding even more staff. The company will also add platforms in the future, like WebEx, Teams and Google Meet. It will also eventually provide integrations with other areas of the digital world, including Facebook and Apply Glass, Shim said.</p>
<p>“There is a huge opportunity for someone to get hints,” he added. “The more we can facilitate the ability to help people with social cues, the better the interactions will be.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/managing-harmful-vaccine-content-youtube/">expanded</a> its medical misinformation policies today to include <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11161123">new guidelines</a> that ban vaccine misinformation. The Google-owned video platform had previously <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9891785">banned</a> over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/youtube-has-removed-1-million-videos-for-dangerous-covid-19-misinformation/">1 million videos</a> spreading dangerous COVID-19 misinformation. Now, YouTube says it will also remove content that spreads misinformation about vaccine safety, the efficacy of vaccines and ingredients in vaccines. The platform previously banned misinformation specific to coronavirus vaccines, but now, its policies are being updated to also block misinformation about routine immunizations, like those for measles and Hepatitis B, as well as general false statements about vaccines that are confirmed safe by local health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>This change in policy comes as COVID-19 vaccination rates slow &#8212; in the U.S., about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/27/experts-hope-60-80-percent-americans-vaccinated-by-year-end/">55% of people</a> are fully vaccinated, but these percentages are larger in countries like Canada and the United Kingdom, which have vaccinated <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/29/youtube-ban-joseph-mercola/">71% and 67%</a> of people against COVID-19, respectively. But President Biden has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/19/biden-facebook-misinformation/">pointed to social media</a> platforms as a place where vaccine misinformation spreads. The White House has even enlisted <a href="https://apnews.com/article/olivia-rodrigo-visits-white-house-vaccines-07aeaeb169aa7daed999dd48d57e06a0">the help of rising superstars</a> like Olivia Rodrigo to encourage Americans to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>With these new guidelines, YouTube is following the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/facebook-vaccine-misinformation-policy/">footsteps of Facebook</a>, which expanded <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/#removing-more-false-claims">the criteria it uses</a> to take down false vaccine information in February. Twitter also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/twitter-vaccine-misinformation-labels-strike-system/">bans</a> the spread of misleading COVID-19 information and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/twitter-vaccine-misinformation-labels-strike-system/">labels tweets</a> that might be misleading by using a combination of AI and human efforts. Twitter even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/marjorie-taylor-greene-mjt-twitter-suspension/">suspended</a> Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene after she falsely claimed that vaccines and masks do not reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Some examples of content that violates YouTube&#8217;s <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11161123">new guidelines</a> include videos that claim vaccines cause chronic side-effects like cancer or diabetes; videos that claim vaccines contain devices that can track those who are inoculated; or videos asserting that vaccines are part of a depopulation agenda. If a user posts content that violates these guidelines, YouTube will remove the content and let the uploader know why their video was removed. If it&#8217;s a user&#8217;s first time violating community guidelines, YouTube says that they will likely get a warning with no penalty. If not, the user&#8217;s channel will receive a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032">strike</a>; if a channel gets three strikes in 90 days, the channel is terminated. YouTube will also take down several channels associated with high-profile anti-vaccine figures like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/24/technology/joseph-mercola-coronavirus-misinformation-online.html">Joseph Mercola</a> and <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/05/how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-became-anti-vaxxer-icon-nightmare">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;There are important exceptions to our new guidelines,&#8221; YouTube wrote in a <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/managing-harmful-vaccine-content-youtube/">blog post</a>. &#8220;Given the importance of public discussion and debate to the scientific process, we will continue to allow content about vaccine policies, new vaccine trials, and historical vaccine successes or failures on YouTube.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform will also allow users to discuss their personal experiences with vaccines, so long as the content doesn&#8217;t violate other guidelines &#8212; but if a channel shows a pattern of promoting vaccine hesitancy, YouTube may remove the content. These guidelines will be enforced starting today, but YouTube wrote that, as with any new policy, it will take time to &#8220;fully ramp up enforcement.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After launching into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/in-growing-battle-with-tiktok-facebook-to-test-facebook-reels-in-the-u-s/">beta tests just last month</a>, Facebook today is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-in-us/">rolling out</a> Reels to all Facebook users in the U.S. on both iOS and Android. The feature, Facebook&#8217;s response to TikTok, allows creators to make and share short-form video content using a variety of editing tools, including those for music and audio, AR effects, using timers and countdowns and more. With the public launch, creators will be able to create their Reels directly on Facebook as well as share their exiting Instagram Reels to Facebook in order to help them build a following across both apps.</p>
<p>In addition, Facebook is now sharing more details about how it plans to fuel Reels&#8217; creation.</p>
<p>The company is introducing a new bonus program that will pay creators when people view their Reels. The program will be funded as part of Facebook&#8217;s larger <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/investing-1-billion-dollars-in-creators/">commitment</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/">invest over $1 billion in creators</a> through 2022, which is also paying creators to run certain types of ads, for receiving payments through Stars (virtual tips) and more.</p>
<p>The Reels Play bonus program, which expands on Instagram&#8217;s Reels Summer bonus, will pay eligible creators based on the performance of their Reels across Facebook and Instagram, and will pay out on Reels that get at least 1,000 views over a 30-day period. (Facebook did not say how large the payments would be, however.)</p>
<p>The new program will be open to U.S. creators only and will be <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/tools/mta">invite-only</a> for the time being. It will eventually expand to more global markets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2209940" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Facebook-Reels-Experience.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="289" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Facebook-Reels-Experience.png 2504w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Facebook-Reels-Experience.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Facebook-Reels-Experience.png?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Facebook-Reels-Experience.png?resize=768,326 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Facebook-Reels-Experience.png?resize=680,289 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Facebook-Reels-Experience.png?resize=1536,653 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Facebook-Reels-Experience.png?resize=2048,870 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Facebook-Reels-Experience.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Facebook says it&#8217;s also working to develop other ways for creators to make money from their Reels, and plans to test new ad formats, including Sticker Ads and Banner Ads in Reels. It&#8217;s also looking into integrating Stars, its virtual tipping system, into Reels, which would allow fans to pay their favorite Reels creators directly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also plans to monetize Reels as a product by testing full-screen and immersive ads that appear in between Reels, similar to ads on TikTok. These ads will allow users to connect with brands and other small businesses, Facebook says. And like the Reels themselves, viewers can comment, like, view, save, share or skip these ads, which are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/instagrams-tiktok-rival-reels-rolls-out-ads-worldwide/">already appearing on Instagram Reels.</a></p>

<p>There are several places Facebook users can create Reels, including from a &#8220;Create&#8221; button in the new Reels section that appears as you scroll the News Feed, while watching Reels, or by tapping on &#8220;Reels&#8221; at the top of the News Feed. Meanwhile, users can view Reels from the News Feed (where they&#8217;ll be joined by Reels shared from Instagram), and in select Pages and Groups.</p>
<p>Reels first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/">launched to global audiences just over a year ago</a>, as little more than a TikTok clone. The product today offers a similar feature set to TikTok, which includes access to a large catalog of audio and music, tools to edit videos using things like timers, countdowns and AR effects, and other tools for speed adjustments and stitching clips together. While Reels&#8217; lineup of editing tools, particularly its AR effects, isn&#8217;t nearly as large as TikTok&#8217;s, the company also makes it simple for creators to directly upload to Reels their videos created in third-party editing apps. And while Reels that display the TikTok watermark <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLFMSunBRX1/">will be downranked by the algorithm,</a> the company is not currently penalizing content that&#8217;s cross-posted to multiple services.</p>

<p>Facebook has been very transparent that it sees the rise of TikTok as a threat to its business. While some companies don&#8217;t address their competition directly, Instagram head Adam Mosseri in June <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/facebook-tests-changes-to-instagram-would-make-it-more-like-tiktok.html">specifically highlighted </a>TikTok as one of the reasons why Instagram was evolving to include more video. He even warned users, &#8220;we&#8217;re no longer a photo-sharing app or a square photo-sharing app.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, TikTok&#8217;s growth has been substantial. It was the most <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">downloaded</a> app of 2020. In July, it became the first non-Facebook app to reach <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion">3 billion global downloads.</a> And just this week TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/">announced</a> it&#8217;s now seeing 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, Facebook&#8217;s family of apps <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/facebook-reports-second-quarter-2021-results/default.aspx">now sees</a> 3.51 billion monthly active users.</p>
<p>Reels on Facebook is rolling out today to U.S. users on the Facebook mobile app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Satellite servicing company Starfish Space has closed $7 million in funding to accelerate the development of a space tug vehicle that can extend the life of spacecraft and get rid of orbital debris.</p>
<p>Servicing satellites used to be nigh impossible, due to the extreme costs associated with going to orbit. Essentially, once a spacecraft was launched, well &#8212; God’s speed. The handful of successful servicing missions have historically been conducted by government entities like NASA, and the repairs were conducted by astronauts &#8212; for example, when NASA launched five crewed Space Shuttle missions to repair or replace systems on the Hubble Telescope in the 1990s.</p>
<p>But like everything else in the space industry, private industry has largely started taking up the problem of in-orbit servicing. Enter Starfish Space. The Kent, Washington-based startup was founded in 2019 by Austin Link and Trevor Bennett, two former Blue Origin engineers. Starfish is developing what it calls the Otter space tug, a small spacecraft that the company says will be capable of capturing and moving objects in orbit.</p>
<p>Chiefly, the startup says this capability could be used to dispose of space junk and extend the useful life of large spacecraft in geostationary orbit. However, Starfish also says that the space tug tech could eventually be used as autonomous in-orbit robots for a whole range of purposes related to the future space economy, including mining, manufacturing and recycling.</p>
<p>In addition to the space tug, Starfish is also developing an autonomous software system, Cephalopod, to perform rendezvous, proximity operations and docking. The company is testing the Cephalopod software in conjunction with a demonstration of a thruster system by Benchmark Space Systems, on Orbit Fab’s Tanker-001 Tenzing demo refueling satellite. (Orbit Fab was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/orbit-fab-gas-stations-in-space-seed-funding/">finalist in our TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield</a> in 2019.)</p>

<p>The funding comes just one month after Starfish won a $1.7 million Phase II SBIR contract from the U.S. Space Force for the continued development of the Cephalopod software. This latest round was co-led by NFX and MaC Venture Capital, with participation from PSL Ventures, Boost VC, Liquid2 Ventures and Hypothesis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Platforms for dentists are booming right now as many governments gradually make it harder to access dentistry via social care, especially in the U.K. But the most lucrative market is cosmetic dentistry, and this is where startups are often playing, such as aggregating private clinics under a simple booking platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.toothfairyapp.co.uk/">Toothfairy</a> is a U.K. startup that has a variation on this approach. It’s now raised a £3 million seed funding round led by impact VC ADA Ventures and Slingshot, with participation from Seedcamp, All Iron, Haatch Ventures, as well as angels from the Atomico Angel Programme, and Angel Investor of the Year Deepali and ex-(Transfer)Wise Joe Cross.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As a general rule, I refuse to worry about how much money bankers make. They have historically done just fine, and I presume will continue to do so. In a similar manner, I don&#8217;t worry about how much money venture capitalists earn. Not really. Sure, it&#8217;s nice to figure out deal-specific returns here and there, but frankly, I care precisely not at all about any particular VC&#8217;s take-home.</p>
<p>But today we have to care a little bit about <em>both,</em> because we need to talk about direct listings, IPOs and how to price private companies. Yes, we&#8217;re talking about Amplitude&#8217;s recent public-market debut.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>What follows is a dive into the IPO pricing issue and how startups are looking to get around the matter through alternative listing mechanisms. We&#8217;ll close with notes from an interview with Amplitude CEO Spenser Skates about the same matter. If you care about the value of private companies and how they are priced, this is for you. If you do not, please read <em>anything</em> else; you are going to be bored out of your socks.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>The problem with IPOs</h2>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/can-direct-listings-really-fix-the-ipo-pricing-problem/">we asked</a> if direct listings would be able to solve the IPO pricing issue. Or, more simply: Could direct listings coupled to last-minute private-market fundraising help startups dodge first-day IPO pops?</p>
<p>An IPO pop is what happens when a company prices its initial public offering at a lower price point than where it begins to trade. A little pop is generally considered healthy. A large pop is considered an error.</p>
<p>In more concrete terms, if a company prices at $45 per share in an IPO and kicks off its trading life worth $46, good job. Hell, even $48 would be uncontroversial. But when a company prices at $30 and opens at $45, it doesn&#8217;t matter if its shares later come back to Earth. A sin has been committed, at least in the eyes of the company and its private-market backers.</p>
<p>There are two issues with IPO pops that annoy startups and their investors:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, they imply that the debuting company could have raised more money, or the same amount of capital, with less dilution. That makes sense.</li>
<li>Second, private companies and their partial owners (VCs) do not like it when free money is handed out to others, as when bankers price an IPO too low while securing fat allocation in the deal for their own customers; watching bankers that just showed up distribute upside for little work irks founders (reasonable) and venture investors (less reasonable).</li>
</ul>
<p>The IPO pop issue has become more acute in recent years as some big-ticket public offerings have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">posted insane first-day results</a>, opening to trade or closing their first day as public companies worth far more than they were expected to be when compared to their formal public-offering price.</p>
<p>One way to dodge an IPO pop is to direct list. In a direct listing, a company simply begins to trade. A reference price is set, but that&#8217;s largely a made-up number that folks ignore. It doesn&#8217;t matter much. And because the company in question isn&#8217;t setting a formal price for itself, it cannot suffer from a mispriced IPO. Huzzah; we&#8217;ve solved the problem.</p>
<p>Except we haven&#8217;t. IPOs have some good elements to them that everyone can agree on, chief of which is that they raise primary capital. By that we mean the company looking to list its shares in a traditional manner sells stock in the transaction. That&#8217;s why it has to set a price; it has to name a number at which it sells primary equity in its IPO.</p>
<p>With a direct listing, you do away with the pricing matter altogether, but it can be a bit baby-with-the-bathwater if a company wants to also raise capital to fund its operations, growth or whatever else. So, unicorns have come up with a neat compromise that appears to be a fix: raise a huge, final private round of capital and then quickly direct list. Doing so decouples pricing the company and it starting to trade.</p>
<p>Amplitude did just that earlier this week. It raised a multipart close Series F at $32.0199 per share a few months back &#8212; and then direct listed.</p>
<p>However, there are issues.</p>

The company has <a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=23144&amp;mid=" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">confirmed</a> the Grand Cherokee 4xe will arrive in North American dealers in early 2022, and will sport more capabilities than you might have expected. The estimated 25 miles of all-electric driving (440 miles total) won&#8217;t necessarily cover your entire commute, but Jeep is promising a rough-and-ready PHEV that can climb hills without touching the 2.0L turbo gas engine. You can also drive in a full hybrid mode for peak performance and an &#8220;eSave&#8221; mode to preserve the 17kWh battery for later.</p>
<p>You can also expect new technology inside, such as 10-inch front and rear passenger displays with built-in Fire TV — your kids can stream Prime Video in the backseat. The driver, meanwhile, gets a 10-inch display with a much faster Uconnect 5 platform that supports over-the-air updates.</p>
<p>The 4xe and its regular counterparts are improved off-roaders with semi-active damping for air suspension as well as a front-axle disconnect when the SUV senses it doesn&#8217;t need all-wheel drive. You&#8217;ll also get semi-autonomous help through an optional Active Driving Assist system that takes over so long as your hands are on the wheel and your eyes are on the road. Jeep is promising a 6,000lbs maximum towing capacity.</p>
<p>Jeep hasn&#8217;t divulged pricing for the Grand Cherokee 4xe, although it will be available in increasingly loaded Limited, Trailhawk, Overland, Summit and Summit Reserve editions. It&#8217;s already safe to say this is an important vehicle for the brand, though. Parent company Stellantis is racing to catch up with rivals in electrifying its vehicles, with plans for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeep-4xe-2025-plan-200527710.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">fully electric version of every SUV</a> by 2025. The plug-in hybrid is a critical first step in that direction.</p>

Sure, we&#8217;ve riffed on the ups and downs at Luckin, and we&#8217;ve spent more time talking about WeWork&#8217;s implosion than we want to admit. But that&#8217;s not the most recent stuff. There&#8217;s been a raft of fraud lately which caught our eye. The heart of today&#8217;s episode is a question about fraud, and what <em>more</em> of it might mean: Does more fraud indicate that we&#8217;re in a growing bubble, or that we&#8217;re in the later stages of a bubble about to burst?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into to help us understand our question:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/opensea-admits-incident-as-top-exec-is-accused-of-trading-nfts-on-insider-information/">OpenSea admits incident as top exec is accused of trading NFTs on insider information</a> &#8212; NFTs are good fun until the market for them is bent in the favor of insiders!</li>

This!</li>
<li>Turning to historical examples, we also brought up Nikola and Luckin and Theranos to help us draw a line around what its fraud, and what is not.</li>
<li>With definitions out of the way, we ended this episode by trying to answer our complex, core question. We won&#8217;t spoil the eventual conclusion, but here&#8217;s a hint: checks are flying fast into startups with minimal due diligence, and it looks like there&#8217;s much more money coming.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When engineers are building software, they often run into issues around testing it without using actual customer data. Creating a meaningful test set can be time-consuming and challenging. <a href="http://tonic.ai">Tonic.ai</a>, a startup that helps engineers create synthetic data sets, is trying to fix that, and today the company announced a $35 million Series B.</p>
<p>Insight Partners led the round with participation from GGV Capital, Bloomberg Beta, William Smith from Octave, Heavybit and Silicon Valley CISO Investments. The company has now raised a total of $45 million, according to Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tonic-ai">data</a>.</p>
<p>Company CEO and co-founder Ian Coe says the goal of the company is to provide production-like data for developers that keeps governance and compliance folks inside an organization happy. &#8220;Tonic is a data transformation company that leverages synthetic data, differential privacy and distributed computing. We de-identify sensitive data, while preserving all the value of that data so that developers can use it for building and testing software,&#8221; Coe explained to me.</p>
<p>What they do is create these &#8220;fake&#8221; data sets from the actual data, so that it is very much like the information sitting in the database. But the solution involves more than simply anonymizing some names to comply with legal and ethical standards. It often involves extremely complex connections that move across data repositories and complex databases.</p>
<p>He says that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s not something someone can easily mimic or do themselves. There is a lot going on under the hood to make this happen. As one example, making sure that if you change a name in one place, it changes it consistently across every point in the application production process where that name might occur without any leakage of actual data.</p>

<p>For now at least, they are going to concentrate on developers as primary target customers, even though the product could have utility for other roles like data scientists. The company launched in 2019 and while they see other startups like <a href="http://gretel.ai/">Gretel</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/synthetaic-seed-funding/">Synthetaic</a> trying to solve parts of this problem, Coe says that he hasn&#8217;t seen competitive solutions that really attack the complex range of the enterprise set of issues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We see some other startups that are sort of contemporaries with us, and generally what we see is that they&#8217;re not really solving the enterprise data side of the problem, a lot of that really annoying data infrastructure work and really making it possible to integrate with the CI/CD pipeline, and I do see that as a big differentiator for Tonic,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company has around 40 employees at the moment. As they make a push to hire more people with this new influx of capital, they hope to reach at least a 100 in 2022. To help make that happen, they recently hired a new head of people and talent, and it&#8217;s part of her job to ensure that the company is building a diverse employee base.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our head of talent is doing some special recruiting initiatives this year to reach out [to historically underrepresented groups] and we&#8217;re using some different services that I know specialize in diverse recruiting,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Employee leave benefits are a complicated web of company and government policies, and <a href="http://www.meetcocoon.com/">Cocoon</a> is out to bring clarity and simplicity to both the employer and employee experience.</p>
<p>The platform launched Wednesday across all 50 states and is designed for any type of employee leave, like parental, medical, caregiver or bereavement. It factors in all company government and insurance benefits and manages all facets of the leave from compliance to claims management to payroll calculations.</p>
<p>In addition to the launch, the San Francisco-based company announced it raised a $20 million Series A funding led by Index Ventures, with participation from First Round Capital, SemperVirens, XYZ, Magnify Ventures and a group of individual investors. This brings the company’s total funding to $26 million, co-founder and CEO Mahima Chawla told TechCrunch. This includes a $5.5 million seed round with Index and First Round in December 2020.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Oyster snaps up $20M for its HR platform aimed at distributed workforces&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/oyster-snaps-up-20m-for-its-hr-platform-aimed-at-distributed-workforces/embed/#?secret=aDaJ95UvF6" data-secret="aDaJ95UvF6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Chawla, Lauren Dai and Amber Feng founded the company in June 2020. The idea for the company stemmed from a conversation Chawla and Dai had with co-workers and friends about leave benefits. They thought, at the time, that leave was similar to putting an out-of-office on your calendar, but as they learned that it was more about navigating company, government and insurance laws, especially around how it worked at a particular company, who pays during a leave and how it works, they saw a need to simplify the experience.</p>
<p>“Even extremely benefit-friendly companies are having a hard time,” Chawla said. “We talked to hundreds of employees and HR managers across all industries, and to everyone, it is a nightmare. We thought it shouldn’t be hard for someone to take care of themselves. This impacts everyone, but there is not something to make it easier, so we saw a big opportunity to make an impact.”</p>
<p>Cocoon’s platform has areas for both employers and employees. On the employer side, it handles compliance and payroll complexities so that the company knows what its payroll responsibilities are, but takes all of that work off of the employer’s plate. The employee will go on Cocoon and design a leave from beginning to end via an automated process that Chawla said can be done in under 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Since its launch in January, the platform has collected a rich set of data, including how employees are using their leave benefits and what they are taking it for to create insights for employers to understand how better to craft their benefits.</p>
<p>Cocoon is already working with large employers, like Carta, and Chawla sees its responsibility as taking the pain out of leave. Other companies in the benefits space are coming at the problem of leave in a more piecemeal way, while Cocoon is taking a holistic approach and applying software and automation to reduce the amount of back-and-forth both employers and employees have to do when managing leave.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will be used for hiring, particularly in engineering, sales and customer success and building out additional products.</p>
<p>“We are seeing massive inbound inquiries through customer referrals and broker relations,” Chawla said. “Next year, it will not just be about expanding the base of employers, but also moving into different industries and employers of different sizes.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Mark Goldberg, partner at Index Ventures, has joined the company’s board of directors. He says this investment was a personal one for him as he was finishing up a paternal leave and helped write the leave policy for the firm. In fact, one of his colleagues spent over 25 hours on the phone with California’s Employment Development Department during the initial part of her maternity leave trying to navigate a clerical error that threatened her job.</p>
<p>Goldberg has known the Cocoon team for a while, following the co-founders from their previous respective positions at Square and Stripe.</p>
<p>“When Mahima called me and said the band was coming together, I wanted to get involved,” he added. “We are looking for that core talent vortex. If you can get the DNA in the first 10 employees, the next 100 will be top-notch. It’s similar to what we saw in the early Plaid team.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Russian authorities have arrested and detained Ilya Sachkov, the co-founder and chief executive of Group-IB — one of the biggest cybersecurity companies in the country — on charges of treason.</p>
<p>Details about Sachkov&#8217;s detention remain unclear but it was reported by Russian media as authorities searched the company&#8217;s offices, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/moscow-office-group-ib-cybersecurity-firm-searched-by-police-company-2021-09-29/">reports Reuters</a>. State news agency Tass said Sachkov, who was arrested on Tuesday, was charged with allegedly transferring classified information to an unnamed foreign government, claims that Sachkov denied, according <a href="https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/12533055">to the report</a>.</p>
<p>Group-IB confirmed the arrest of its CEO, but a spokesperson for Group-IB did not comment beyond a statement on the company&#8217;s website, which said the company is examining the Moscow court&#8217;s decision and that it is &#8220;confident&#8221; in Sachkov&#8217;s innocence.</p>
<p>In the statement, Group-IB said that co-founder Dmitry Volkov will run the company in Sachkov&#8217;s absence, who will be detained for at least two months per the court&#8217;s order. &#8220;All of Group-IB’s divisions will continue operating as usual,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>The spokesperson did not comment on the claims made in the Tass news report. A treason conviction can be punishable by up to 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Sachkov, 35, founded Group-IB in 2003. The company, now headquartered in Singapore, helps companies and governments investigate cyberattacks and online fraud, and has customers ranging from Interpol to Russian banks and defense companies.</p>
<p>In 2018, Group-IB moved its headquarters to Singapore after the U.S. government accused Moscow of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/justice-department-charges-fancy-bear-hacking/">meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election</a>. Sachkov said at the time the company would <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cyber-group-ib/russian-cybersecurity-firm-group-ib-to-open-global-hq-in-singapore-ceo-idUSKCN1NH0IT">invest $30 million</a> in the new headquarters and bring on 90 new employees. Sachkov has been critical of the Russian government <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-13/a-russian-cyber-guru-finds-ways-to-distance-company-from-kremlin">in the past</a>, and said moving to Singapore is part of the company&#8217;s efforts to grow its business and remain independent.</p>
<p>Last year, the U.S. Justice Department unsealed <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/group-ib-nikita-kislitsin-indicted-formspring-nikulin/">a 2014 indictment</a> of Nikita Kislitsin, which alleged he was involved in a conspiracy to sell credentials stolen from Formspring in 2012 before joining Group-IB&#8217;s as its head of network security. U.S. prosecutors did not accuse Group-IB of foul play, but the company defended Kislitsin saying that it had &#8220;no findings&#8221; that he had engaged in wrongdoing.</p>
