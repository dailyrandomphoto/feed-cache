										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>We&#8217;re becoming a newsletter soon! Please sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">to get Actuator in your inbox</a> as soon as the first issue hit!</em></p>
<p>One of the most fascinating aspects of Boston Dynamics’ transition into a commercial organization is watching the company &#8212; and its partners &#8212; figure out real-world jobs for Spot. There’s no question that the tech is impressive, but there’s always been the broader subject of usefulness beyond the company’s initial purpose of serving as off-road pack mules.</p>
<p>We’ve seen some interesting examples since Spot first went on sale, including inspection for constructions sites and potentially dangerous settings &#8212; from nuclear power plants to off-shore oil rigs. There have also been some, shall we say, more controversial gigs, including Spot’s time as an electronic K9 for the NYPD.</p>
<p>But maybe finding the perfect job for Spot entails thinking both outside the box and Earth’s gravitational pull. NASA’s JPL in California has been working with the quadrupedal robot for a couple of years now, first as part of a DARPA challenge and now as a potential way to explore extraterrestrial caves. For this week’s installment of Actuator, we spoke to JPL NeBula Autonomy Project lead Ali Agha about the partnership.</p>
<p><strong>How long has NASA been working with Spot?</strong></p>
<p>We have been working with the SPOT robots for about two years now. We initially integrated our NeBula autonomy and AI solutions on the Spot robot as one of our robots participating in the DARPA Subterranean challenge competition. However, since then we have extended the application of these robots and JPL’s NeBula autonomy solution to planetary cave exploration and surface exploration as well as terrestrial disaster response and mining efforts.</p>
<p><strong>What is the advantage of using legs (as opposed to wheels) on the Martian surface?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Imagine a no-road terrain on Earth. The ability to walk will allow traversing different elements of such a terrain much better than a typical wheeled vehicle. Similarly, legged locomotion can potentially enable totally new missions when exploring extreme and challenging terrains on planetary bodies in the solar system beyond our home planet.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_HpWIhFFD54?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How closely does NASA/JPL work with a company like Boston Dynamics on a project like this?</strong></p>
<p>We have had an amazing collaboration with Boston Dynamics and work closely with them. On our project, JPL and Boston Dynamics’ efforts are highly synergistic. At JPL, we develop autonomy and AI solutions (called NeBula) acting as the robot brain to enable fully autonomous exploration of extreme and challenging environments with very minimal (to none) prior information about the terrain or environmental conditions.</p>
<p>NeBula is agnostic to the choice of robotic platform and can be used on wheeled rovers, legged platforms, as well as drones. On the other hand, Boston Dynamics is developing cutting-edge incredible robotic locomotion systems that can maintain the stability of the system over extreme environments. As a result, the combination of an autonomy solution like NeBula with a capable locomotion system like Boston Dynamics’ Spot opens up avenues for totally new classes of planetary and terrestrial missions.</p>
<p><strong>I know autonomy is a big piece of this. Do the robots need to be able to function with no human intervention?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, autonomy is the main focus of our project. In planetary exploration, specifically, when exploring underground caves, there is no, or very minimal, prior information about the environment. Further, when robots enter the cave, they typically lose communication with the surface and are on their own to accomplish the mission objectives.</p>
<p>As a result, autonomy is a crucial capability to enable such missions to accomplish mission goals with no human intervention when the robot is out of communication exploring previously unseen terrains and environments. To this end, JPL has been developing autonomy and AI solutions (called NeBula) acting as the robot brain, which is now being paired with Boston Dynamics Spot robots as the robot body.</p>

<p>A bit closer to Earth (as in, roughly 100 to 150 feet above our heads), Alphabet’s Wing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/wing-approaches-100000-drone-deliveries-two-years-after-logan-australia-launch/">announced this week</a> that it’s approaching 100,000 drone deliveries two years after launching in the Brisbane-adjacent city of Logan, Australia. The announcement follows recent insight into Amazon’s struggles in the drone delivery space.</p>
<p>The company told TechCrunch,” I think we’ll launch new services in Australia, Finland and the United States in the next six months. The capabilities of the technology are probably ahead of the regulatory permissions right now.”</p>

<p>A closer look at some of those 100,000 deliveries:</p>
<ul>
<li>10,000 cups of coffee</li>
<li>1,700 children’s snack packs</li>
<li>1,200 hot chooks (roasted chicken, in Australian)</li>
<li>2,700 sushi rolls</li>
<li>1,000 loaves of bread</li>
</ul>

<p>Speaking of food, LA-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/last-mile-robotic-delivery-firm-coco-raises-36m/">Coco just raised $36 million</a> for its delivery robots. The round brings its total funding up to $43 million. The UCLA spinout is currently piloting its 50-pound, remote-piloted robots in a variety of Los Angeles neighborhoods. The company tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are currently operating in Santa Monica and in five different L.A neighborhoods. Later this year we are expanding into a number of other major U.S. cities. We have partnered with national restaurant brands like SBE (Umami Burger) and are actively scaling across many locations, and we are serving a wide range of family operated restaurants like Bangkok West Thai in Santa Monica and San Pedro Brewing Company in Los Angeles. We are out of the pilot phase and are launching with dozens of new merchants every day.</p></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, California-based fast casual salad chain Sweetgreens <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/salad-chain-sweetgreen-buys-kitchen-robotics-startup-spyce/">just acquired Spyce</a>. Built by MIT alums, the company develops kitchen robotics, which it has rolled out in a pair of Boston-based restaurants. Sweetgreens eventually plans to implement these in some of its 120+ locations, though no timeline has been given as of yet.</p>

<p>In this week’s small-ray-of-sunshine-in-an-otherwise-horrifying-situation news, a team of young women roboticists <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/25/americas/afghanistan-women-robotics-team-intl-scli/index.html">managed to evacuate Kabul</a> amid the Taliban takeover. The team has found refuge in Mexico on a 180-day humanitarian visa, with an option to extend their stay.</p>
<p>“From now on forward we will have opportunities for many more achievements in our lives, and thus be part of the fight for a better life,&#8221; team member Fatemah Qaderyan said at a press conference on their arrival in the country. &#8220;Although we are far from our homes, we will always be united and thanks to your help we will achieve it, thank you very much, we really appreciate having all our things here in Mexico with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team also <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/12/trump-afghan-girls-robots-240474">made international headlines in 2017</a>, as they entered the U.S. on a 10-day “parole,” in spite of the Trump administration’s executive order banning entry from predominately Muslim countries.</p>

<p>Before we go, a thought on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/musk-the-tesla-bot-is-coming/">Tesla robot</a>. Or, rather, a story. A few years ago, I was asked to be on a panel discussing robots for a group of people who weren’t really familiar with the field. That’s fine. There’s a lot to be said for getting outside your comfort zone. At the end, we opened things up to Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>As is nearly always the case with these things, the first question &#8212; well, it wasn’t a question really. It was more of a laundry list of things the asker would like to see a robot do. She went on to describe a small drone that flies from surface to surface, cleaning different parts of the house. I told her it sounded great, and I’d love to see her invent it.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PY33aGVHq2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/musk-the-tesla-bot-is-coming/">Musk: The Tesla Bot is coming</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Musk: The Tesla Bot is coming&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/musk-the-tesla-bot-is-coming/embed/#?secret=PY33aGVHq2" data-secret="PY33aGVHq2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Point is, I think the vast majority of people outside of robotics have an entirely unrealistic idea of what’s possible with technology today. There’s a reason iRobot spent the better part of a decade banging its head against the wall, working out a robot that can vacuum floors. There’s also a reason that the Roomba is really the only semi-ubiquitous home robot. Always be wary of robots announced onstage as a press event.</p>
<p>I’m not saying a Tesla robot is impossible. I’m just saying we have to temper our expectations of what is. Sometimes you go in expecting a robot and get someone in a spandex onesie doing the Dougie:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today is launching a new program that will allow subscription news organizations that participate in the Apple News app and meet certain requirements to lower their commission rate to 15% on qualifying in-app purchases taking place inside their apps on the App Store. Typically, Apple&#8217;s model for subscription-based apps involves a standard 30% commission during their first year on the App Store which then drops to 15% in year two. But the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/news-partner/">Apple News Partner Program</a>, announced today, will now make 15% the commission rate for participants starting on day one.</p>
<p>There are a few caveats to this condition, and they benefit Apple. To qualify, the news publisher must maintain a presence on Apple News and they have to provide their content in the Apple News Format (ANF). The latter is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_news/apple_news_format">the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format</a> that&#8217;s used to create articles for Apple News which are optimized for Mac, iPhone and other Apple mobile devices. Typically, this involves a bit of setup to translate news articles from a publisher&#8217;s website or from their CMS (content management system) to the supported JSON format. For WordPress and other popular CMS&#8217;s, there are also plugins available to make this process easier.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for publishers headquartered outside one of the four existing Apple News markets &#8212; the U.S., U.K., Australia, or Canada &#8212; they can instead satisfy the program&#8217;s obligations by providing Apple with an RSS feed.</p>
<p>On the App Store, the partner app qualifying for the 15% commission must be used to deliver &#8220;original, professionally authored&#8221; news content, and they must offer their auto-renewable subscriptions using Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase system.</p>
<p>While there is some initial work involved in establishing the publisher&#8217;s connection to Apple News, it&#8217;s worth noting that most major publishers already participate on Apple&#8217;s platform. That means they won&#8217;t have to do any additional work beyond what they&#8217;re already doing in order to transition over to the reduced commission for their apps. However, the program also serves as a way to push news organizations to continue to participate in the Apple News ecosystem, as it will make more financial sense to do so across their broader business.</p>
<p>That will likely be an area of contention for publishers, who would probably prefer that the reduced App Store commission didn&#8217;t come with strings attached.</p>
<p>Some publishers already worry that they&#8217;re giving up too much control over their business by tying themselves to the Apple News ecosystem. Last year, for example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/technology/new-york-times-apple-news-app.html">The New York Times announced</a> it would exit its partnership with Apple News, saying that Apple didn&#8217;t allow it to have as direct a relationship with readers as it wanted, and it would rather drive readers to its own app and website.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple, however, would argue that it doesn&#8217;t stand in the way of publishers&#8217; businesses &#8212; it lets them paywall their content and keep 100% of the ad revenue from the ads they sell. (If they can&#8217;t sell it all or would prefer Apple to do so on their behalf, they then split the commission with Apple, keeping 70% of revenues instead.) In addition, for the company&#8217;s Apple News+ subscription service &#8212; where the subscription revenue split is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/publishers-chafe-at-apples-terms-for-subscription-news-service-11549998416">much higher</a> &#8212; it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18281465/apple-news-wall-street-journal-deal">could be argued</a> that it&#8217;s &#8220;found money.&#8221; That is, Apple markets the service to customers the publisher hadn&#8217;t been able to attract on its own anyway.</p>
<p>The launch of the new Apple News Partner program comes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">amid</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/08/technology/antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html">regulatory</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/apple-app-store-european-union-antitrust.html">scrutiny</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">over</a> how Apple manages its App Store business and more recently, proposed legislation aiming to address alleged anticompetitive issues<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/open-app-markets-act-app-stores-apple-google/"> both in the U.S.</a> and in major App Store markets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/final-vote-delayed-for-koreas-plan-to-ban-google-and-apple-in-app-payment-rules/">like South Korea</a>.</p>

<p>Sensing this shift in the market, Apple had already been working to provide itself cover from antitrust complaints and lawsuits &#8212; like the one underway now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_v._Apple">with Epic Games</a> &#8212; by adjusting its App Store commissions. Last year, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">launched the App Store Small Business Program</a>, which also lowered commissions on in-app purchases from 30% to 15% &#8212; but only for developers earning up to $1 million in revenues.</p>
<p>This program may have <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/11/apple-is-reducing-the-cut-it-takes-from-most-news-publishers-subscriptions/">helped smaller publishers</a>, but it was clear some major publishers still weren&#8217;t satisfied. After the reduced commissions for small businesses were announced in November, the publisher trade organization <a href="https://digitalcontentnext.org/">Digital Content Next</a> (DCN) &#8212; a representative for the AP, The New York Times, NPR, ESPN, Vox, The Washington Post, Meredith, Bloomberg, NBCU, The Financial Times, and others &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/major-u-s-news-publishers-join-the-coalition-for-app-fairness-advocacy-group-to-fight-the-apple-tax/?tpcc=ECTW2020">joined the advocacy group</a> and lobbying organization the <a href="https://appfairness.org/">Coalition for App Fairness</a> (CAF) the very next month.</p>
<p>These publishers, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/news-publishers-join-fight-against-apple-over-app-store-terms-11597949300">who had previously written to Apple CEO Tim Cook</a> to demand lower commissions &#8212; had other complaints about the revenue share beyond just the size of the split. They also didn&#8217;t want to be required to use Apple&#8217;s services for in-app purchases for their subscriptions, saying this &#8220;Apple tax&#8221; forces them to raise their prices for consumers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Fh3tWEoDgb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/major-u-s-news-publishers-join-the-coalition-for-app-fairness-advocacy-group-to-fight-the-apple-tax/">Major US news publishers join the Coalition for App Fairness advocacy group to fight the &#8216;Apple tax&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It remains to be seen how these publishers will now react to the launch of the Apple News Partner program.</p>
<p>While it gives them a way to lower their App Store fees, it doesn&#8217;t address their broader complaints against Apple&#8217;s platform and its rules. If anything, it ties the lower fees to a program that locks them in further to the Apple ecosystem.</p>
<p>Apple, in a gesture of goodwill, also said today it would recommit <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/03/apple-teams-with-media-literacy-programs-in-the-us-and-europe/">support</a> to three leading media non-profits, Common Sense Media, the News Literacy Project, and Osservatorio Permanente Giovani-Editori. These non-profits offer nonpartisan, independent media literacy programs, which Apple views as key to its larger mission to empower people to become smart and active news readers. Apple also said it would later announce further media literacy projects from other organizations. The company would not disclose the size of its commitment from a financial standpoint however, or discuss how much it has sent such organizations in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;Providing Apple News customers with access to trusted information from our publishing partners has been our priority from day one,&#8221; said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services, in a statement. &#8220;For more than a decade, Apple has offered our customers many ways to access and enjoy news content across our products and services. We have hundreds of news apps from dozens of countries around the world available in the App Store, and created Apple News Format to offer publishers a tool to showcase their content and provide a great experience for millions of Apple News users,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>More details about the program and the application form will be available at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/news-partner/">News Partner Program website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.brightlive.com/">Bright</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/live-video-platform-bright-lets-you-zoom-with-your-favorite-creators/">a live video platform</a> that lets fans engage in live conversations with their favorite creators and celebs, has raised $15 million in new funding, the company announced today. The round was co-led by co-founder and <a href="https://variety.com/2020/music/news/guy-oseary-madonna-u2-manager-maverick-1234618275/">talent manager</a> Guy Oseary&#8217;s Sound Ventures, the fund he founded with Ashton Kutcher. RIT Capital and Regah Ventures also co-led.</p>
<p>Other investors in the new round include Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures, Globo Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Shawn Mendes &amp; Manager Andrew Gertler&#8217;s AG Ventures, as well as Jeff Lawson, CEO and co-founder of Twilio.</p>
<p>In addition, a number of artists, performers, actors and other celebrities also invested, Bright says, including Rachel Zoe, Drew and Jonathan Scott, Judd Apatow, Ashton Kutcher, Amy Schumer, Bethenny Frankel and Ryan Tedder. Meanwhile, Jessica Alba, Kane Brown and Maria Sharapova are joining the company as advisors.</p>
<p>Bright, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/live-video-platform-bright-lets-you-zoom-with-your-favorite-creators/">which first debuted in May</a>, was co-founded by Madonna and U2 talent manager Guy Oseary along with early YouTube product manager Michael Powers, who had previously launched the YouTube Channels feature while at Google. The startup&#8217;s premise is to tap into the growing creator economy in a way that allows creators to better monetize their success outside of ad-supported networks, like YouTube, so they can grow their own business.</p>

<p>The platform itself is built on top of Zoom &#8212; a choice that not only saves Bright from starting from scratch for its real-time video technology, but also one that leverages the broad adoption Zoom has since seen due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>At launch, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/live-video-platform-bright-lets-you-zoom-with-your-favorite-creators/">Bright announced a lineup</a> that included over 200 prominent creators who were set to host ticketed online events where they share their stories or expertise, engage in interviews, offer advice and more. Today, Bright says now over 320 notable names have joined the service to engage with fans and continue to build their brand. The list includes Madonna, Naomi Campbell, D-Nice, the D’Amelio Sisters, Laura Dern, Deepak Chopra, Lindsey Vonn, Diego Boneta, Jason Bolden, Yris Palmer, Cat &amp; Nat, Ronnie2K and Chef Ludo Lefebvre. Even more are on board to host future sessions, with Bright now on track to double the number of creators on board by year-end.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike social media creator tools, Bright is focused on knowledge-sharing rather than just gaining likes or follows. For example, one the first sessions featured actor Laura Dern speaking about personal growth, while another featured streamer and online creator Ronnie2K hosting a series about building a career in gaming. In other words, Bright doesn&#8217;t only showcase Hollywood entertainment or top artists &#8212; it&#8217;s open to anyone whose fan base would be willing to pay to hear them talk.</p>
<p>Today, there are sessions across a variety of interests and topics, organized into areas like craft, home, money, culture, body and mind.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146982" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146982" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2146982" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?w=381" alt="" width="381" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg 909w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=168,300 168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=768,1371 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=381,680 381w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=860,1536 860w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Session-Card-Laura-Dern.jpg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146982" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bright session example</p></div></p>
<p>Bright itself generates revenue by taking a 20% commission on creator revenue, which is somewhat lower than the traditional marketplace split of 30/70 (platform/creator) but higher than some of the newer platforms available today, like Clubhouse and its commission-free direct <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/clubhouse-rolls-out-payments-to-over-60k-creators-following-initial-test">payments</a>.</p>
<p>The startup says the funding is being used to help roll out Creator Studio, a new suite of creator tools for managing learning sessions, audience communication and revenue performance. These sorts of analytics and tools are aimed at serving creators who are working to build a business through live sessions, in addition to growing their fan base.</p>
<p>Initially, creators in September will gain access to a sessions list tool for managing announcements of upcoming sessions, and placing sessions for sale with tickets and pricing. Later in the year, it will be expanded to include analytics, connections for messaging participants directly, and a wallet feature for tracking revenue, Bright says.</p>
<p>The funds will also help Bright to add new interactive features, like instant polls and the ability to share learning materials with attendees, as well as to onboard the influx of new talent.</p>

<p>These features could potentially help Bright stand out from a growing number of competitors looking to serve online creators, which today includes major tech companies like YouTube, Facebook, TikTok and Twitter. However, Oseary&#8217;s ability to leverage his personal network to pull in big names is, for now, the more notable differentiator.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a believer in lifelong learning, I&#8217;m proud to be investing in a platform like Bright, offering audiences the unique opportunity to learn directly from the artists and experts they admire the most,&#8221; said new investor, director and producer, Judd Apatow, in a statement. &#8220;Through Bright, I can directly connect and share my knowledge with fellow writers, aspiring directors and lovers of comedy,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Bright declined to share details as to its revenue, but did tell TechCrunch that its seeing ticket prices range from $25 to $150 per 1 to 2 hour sessions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s inspiring to have the support of incredible investors as well as these notable artists and entrepreneurs. All our partners share Bright’s vision that people want to level up their lives by learning directly from those they admire,&#8221; Bright CEO Michael Powers said, in an announcement. &#8220;Through Bright, talent can better engage authentically with audiences by sharing their own knowledge and bringing their many interests and passions to the foreground. We are excited to roll out our new features to continue elevating our platform and mission&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Voice skins” have become a very popular feature for AI-based voice assistants, to help personalize some of the more anodyne aspects of helpful, yet also kind of bland and robotic, speaking voices you get on services like Alexa. Now a startup that is building voice skins for different companies to use across their services, and for third parties to create and apply as well, is raising some funding to fuel its growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lovo.ai/">LOVO</a>, the Berkeley, California-based artificial intelligence (AI) voice &amp; synthetic speech tool developer, this week closed a $4.5 million pre-Series A round led by South Korean Kakao Entertainment along with Kakao Investment and LG CNS, an IT solution affiliate of LG Group.</p>
<p>Its previous investor SkyDeck Fund and a private investor, vice president of finance at DoorDash Michael Kim, also joined the funding.</p>
<p>The proceeds will be used to propel its research and development in artificial intelligence and synthetic speech and grow the team.</p>
<p>“We plan on hiring heavily across all functions, from machine learning, artificial intelligence and product development to marketing and business development. The fund will also be allocated to securing resources such as GPUs and CPUs,&#8221; co-founder and chief operating officer Tom Lee told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>LOVO, founded in November 2019, has 17 people including both co-founders, chief executive office Charlie Choi and COO Lee.</p>
<p>The company plans to double down on improving LOVO’s AI model, enhance its AI voices and develop a better product that surpasses any that exists in the current market, Lee said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our goal is to be a global leader in providing AI voices that touches people’s hearts and emotions. We want to democratize limitations of content production. We want to be the platform for all things voice-related,” Lee said.</p>
<p>With the mission, LOVO allows enterprises and individual content creators to generate voiceover content for using in marketing, e-learning, customer support, movies, games, chatbots and augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).</p>

<p>“Since our launch a little over a year ago, users have created over 5 million voice content on our platform,” co-founder and CEO Choi said.</p>
<p>LOVO launched its first product LOVO Studio last year, which provides an easy-to-use application for individuals and businesses to find the voice they want, produce, and publish their voiceover content. Developers can utilize LOVO’s Voiceover API to turn text into speeches in real-time, integrated into their applications. Users also can create their own AI voices by simply reading 15 minutes of script via LOVO’s DIY Voice Cloning service.</p>
<p>LOVO owns more than 200 voice skins that provide users with voices categorized by language, style, and situation suited for their various needs.</p>
<p>The global text to speech (TTS) market is estimated at $3 billions, with the global voiceover market at around $10 billion, according to Lee. The Global TTS market is projected to increase $5.61 billion by 2028 from $1.94 billion in 2020, based on <a href="https://researchinterviewer.com/2021/08/22/text-to-speech-market-size-and-forecast/">Research Interviewer’s report published in August 2021</a>.</p>
<p>LOVO already secured 50,000 users and more than 50 enterprise customers including the US-based J.B. Hunt, Bouncer, CPA Canada, LG CNS, and South Korea’s Shinhan Bank, Lee mentioned.</p>
<p>LOVO’s four core markets are marketing, education, movies and games in entertainment and AR/VR, Lee said. The movie Spiral, the latest film of the Saw Series, features LOVO’s voice in the film, he noted.</p>
<p>It is expected that LOVO will create additional synergies in the entertainment industry in the wake of the latest funding from a South Korean entertainment.</p>
<p>VP of CEO Vision Office at Kakao Entertainment J.H. Ryu said, “I’m excited for LOVO’s synergies with Kakao Entertainment’s future endeavors in the entertainment vertical, especially with web novels and music,” Ryu also added, “AI technology is opening the doors to a new market for audio content, and we expect a future a where an individual’s voice will be utilized effectively as an intellectual property and as an asset.”</p>
<p>Founding Partner at SkyDeck Fund Chon Tang said, “Audio is uniquely engaging as a form of information but also difficult to produce, especially at scale. LOVO’s artificial intelligence-based synthesis platform has consistently out-performed other cloud-based solutions in quality and cost.”</p>
<p>LOVO is also preparing to penetrate further to international market, “We have a strong presence in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and are getting signals from the rest of Europe, South America and Asia,” Lee said. LOVO has an office in South Korea and is looking to expand into Europe soon, Lee added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech giants <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> have pledged billions to bolster U.S. cybersecurity following a meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The meeting, which also included attendees from the financial and education sectors, was held following months of high-profile cyberattacks against critical infrastructure and several U.S. government agencies, along with a glaring cybersecurity skills gap; according to data from <a href="https://www.cyberseek.org/heatmap.html">CyberSeek</a>, there are currently almost 500,000 cybersecurity jobs across the U.S that remain unfilled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of our critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, and the federal government can&#8217;t meet this challenge alone,&#8221; Biden said at the start of the meeting. &#8220;I&#8217;ve invited you all here today because you have the power, the capacity and the responsibility, I believe, to raise the bar on cybersecurity.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to help the U.S. in its fight against a growing number of cyberattacks, Big Tech pledged to invest billions of dollars to strengthen cybersecurity defenses and to train skilled cybersecurity workers.</p>
<p>Apple has vowed to work with its 9,000-plus suppliers in the U.S. to drive “mass adoption” of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a> and security training, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/25/fact-sheet-biden-administration-and-private-sector-leaders-announce-ambitious-initiatives-to-bolster-the-nations-cybersecurity/">according to the White House</a>, as well as to establish a new program to drive continuous security improvements throughout the technology supply chain.</p>
<p>Google said it will invest more than $10 billion over the next five years to expand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/zero-trust/">zero-trust</a> programs, help secure the software supply chain, and to enhance open source security. The search and ads giant has also pledged to train 100,000 Americans in fields like IT support and data analytics, learning in-demand skills including data privacy and security.</p>
<p>“Robust cybersecurity ultimately depends on having the people to implement it,” said Kent Walker, Google&#8217;s global affairs chief. “That includes people with digital skills capable of designing and executing cybersecurity solutions, as well as promoting awareness of cybersecurity risks and protocols among the broader population.”</p>
<p>And, Microsoft said it&#8217;s committing $20 billion to integrate cybersecurity by design and deliver &#8220;advanced security solutions.&#8221; It also announced that it will immediately make available $150 million in technical services to help federal, state, and local governments with upgrading security protection, and will expand partnerships with community colleges and non-profits for cybersecurity training.</p>
<p>Other attendees included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws/">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS), Amazon’s cloud computing arm, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ibm/">IBM</a>. The former has said it will make its security awareness training available to the public and equip all AWS customers with hardware multi-factor authentication devices, while IBM said it will help to train more than 150,000 people in cybersecurity skills over the next five years.</p>
<p>While many have welcomed Big Tech’s commitments, David Carroll, managing director at Nominet Cyber, told TechCrunch that these latest initiatives set a “powerful precedent” and show “the gloves are well and truly off” — some within the cybersecurity industry remain skeptical.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">Following the announcement, some <a href="https://twitter.com/hacks4pancakes/status/1430737810055651331?s=21">infosec veterans</a> noted that</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> many of the vacant cybersecurity jobs the U.S. is looking to fill <a href="https://twitter.com/ki_twyce_/status/1430717877569654785">fall behind</a> on competitive salaries and few, if any, benefits.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So 500,000 open cybersecurity jobs and almost that same amount or more looking for jobs,&#8221; said Khalilah Scott, founder of <a href="https://www.techsecchix.com/about-techsecchix">TechSecChix</a>, a foundation for supporting women in technology, <a href="https://twitter.com/ki_twyce_/status/1430717877569654785">in a tweet</a>. &#8220;Make it make sense.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lordstown Motors has hired Daniel A. Ninivaggi, a longtime automotive executive and former head of Carl C. Icahn&#8217;s holding company, as CEO and a board member. The appointment follows months of tumult at Lordstown, which became publicly traded via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company.</p>
<p>In June, founder and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/lordstown-motors-ceo-and-cfo-resign-amidst-production-woes/">CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez resigned</a> following a disappointing first-quarter earnings that revealed the company was consuming more capital than expected and unable to reach previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">forecasted production numbers</a> for its electric Endurance pickup truck. The resignations were also tied to a board committee investigation that found inaccuracies in some of the company&#8217;s disclosures on its truck preorders.</p>
<p>The resignations were just one of several problems, including allegations of fraud and separate investigations by the Department of Justice and the SEC, that has put the two-year-old company at risk of failing. Lordstown did receive a lifeline in August when hedge fund YA II PN purchased 35.1 million shares, or about 19.9% of outstanding shares. The sale provided much-needed capital required to produce its first electric vehicle at the former GM Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio.</p>
<p>Ninivaggi has the background to bring order to Lordstown&#8217;s business. He is also bullish on the company&#8217;s product, noting in a statement that the demand for full-size electric pickup trucks will be strong and that Lordstown&#8217;s Endurance truck has the opportunity to capture a meaningful share of the market.</p>
<p>The former CEO of Icahn Enterprises, has served in a variety of senior leadership positions in the automotive and transportation industries, beginning at Lear Corporation, where he eventually became executive vice president. He was later coo-chairman and co-CEO of automotive components supplier Federal Mogul Holdings Corporation ahead of its sale to Tenneco.</p>
<p>While with Icahn Enterprises, Ninivaggi also oversaw the company&#8217;s automotive aftermarket service network and parts distribution businesses. He also has a long history directing public companies, including Motorola Mobility (prior to its sale to Google), Navistar International, Hertz Global Holdings and CVR Energy.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Peter Thiel&#8217;s AI company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/palantir" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="11" data-v9y="1">Palantir</a>, whose clients have included the CIA and US immigration agency <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-03-feds-are-using-palantirs-tech-to-root-out-immigrants.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="12" data-v9y="1">ICE</a>, is back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. A new report claims a glitch in its secretive software program used by the FBI allowed unauthorized personnel to access private data for more than a year. According to <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/25/fbi-palantir-glitch-allowed-unauthorized-access-to-private-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="13" data-v9y="1"><em>The New York Post</em></a>, the mishap was revealed in a letter by prosecutors in the Manhattan federal court case against accused hacker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-01-crypto-expert-arrested-over-north-korea-sanctions.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="1">Virgil Griffith</a>. Palantir denied the claims in a statement and said the fault was caused by the FBI&#8217;s incorrect use of the software.</p>
<p>Griffith was arrested in 2019 for allegedly providing North Korea with information on how cryptocurrency and blockchain tech could help it to evade US sanctions. The incident in question revolves around the alleged hacker&#8217;s social media data, obtained through a federal search warrant in March 2020. According to the letter, the Twitter and Facebook information was uploaded to Palantir&#8217;s program through the default settings, effectively allowing unauthorized FBI employees to access it</p>
<p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>Between May 2020 to August 2021, the material was accessed four times by three analysts and an agent. The FBI case agent assigned to Griffith&#8217;s case was alerted to the issue by a colleague earlier this month, according to the letter. Those who accessed the info reportedly told prosecutors that they did not recall using it in their investigations.</p>
<p>“An FBI analyst, in the course of conducting a separate investigation, had identified communications between the defendant and the subject of that other investigation by means of searches on the Platform that accessed the Search Warrant Returns,” the letter noted.</p>
<p>Palantir is trying to distance itself from the issue. &#8220;There was no glitch in the software,&#8221; it told <em>The New York Post</em> in a statement, adding that the &#8220;customer&#8221; did not follow the &#8220;rigorous protocols established to protect search warrant returns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amid increasing growth, the last thing Palantir needs is a major PR crisis involving flaws in its software. Since going public last fall, the company has seen its revenues <a href="https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir-Reports-49-Revenue-Growth-US-Commercial-Revenue-Up-90-YY" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">surge</a>, though it&#8217;s operational losses are also increasing. Palantir&#8217;s customers now span government agencies, tech stalwarts like<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-02-08-IBM-and-Palantir-Partner-to-Help-Businesses-Easily-Deploy-Powerful-and-Open-AI-Applications-Unlock-Valuable-Data-Across-Hybrid-Cloud-Environments" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1"> IBM</a>and even mining group <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005373/en/Palantir-Technologies-and-Rio-Tinto-Sign-Multi-Year-Enterprise-Partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Rio Tinto</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Porsche Cars North America has added its entire U.S. inventory of new cars to its online marketplace as the company seeks to keep up with customer demands and the industry&#8217;s shift to digital commerce.</p>
<p>When the online marketplace Porsche Finder launched in May 2020, customers were only able to search for pre-owned and certified pre-owned vehicles using the tool. That platform, which lets customers search by vehicle model and generation as well as price, equipment, packages and colors, now includes all new vehicle inventory from its 193 U.S. dealerships.</p>
<p>The platform, which was developed by automaker&#8217;s Porsche Digital subsidiary and PCNA, also includes features that let customers estimate a trade-in value and a payment calculator to compare leasing and financing options from Porsche Financial Services.</p>
<p>Online platforms that allow customers to search for products are not new. As customers shift their shopping to online — a trend that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic — digital platforms have become a critical tool for companies.</p>
<p>Established automakers like Porsche, however, have had to balance the demand of its customers and dealership network. Porsche doesn&#8217;t have a direct sales model like Tesla and new entrants Lucid Group and Rivian.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dealership is still at the center of everything we do,&#8221; PCNA President and CEO Kjell Gruner said in a recent interview. &#8220;At the dealership, we believe very much in personal interaction — in looking somebody in the eye, reading their body language. And, of course, our products are very physical.&#8221;</p>
<p>While all 193 dealers are participating in the Porsche Finder tool, Gruner acknowledged that this large group includes those who have been more cautious about the move toward digital commerce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;You always have some more innovative people, some more cautious,&#8221; he said. &#8220;COVID &#8230; really prompted a willingness to go digital and to use those tools for their own advantage.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.breezometer.com/">BreezoMeter</a> has been on a mission to make environmental health hazards accessible to as many people as possible. Through its <a href="https://blog.breezometer.com/breezometers-air-quality-index">air quality index (AQI) calculations</a>, the Israel-based company can now identify the quality of air down to a few meters in dozens of countries. A partnership with Apple to include its data into the iOS Weather app along with its own popular apps delivers those metrics to hundreds of millions of users, and an API product allows companies to tap into its dataset for their own purposes.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/breezometer-the-iphone-tool-that-measures-air-quality-raises-a-30m-series-c/">Right on the heels of a $30 million Series C round a few weeks ago</a>, the company is radially expanding its product from air quality into the real-time detection of wildfire perimeters with its new product, Wildfire Tracker.</p>
<p>The new product will take advantage of the company’s fusion of sensor data, satellite imagery, and local eyewitness reports to be able to identify the edges of wildfires in real-time. “People expect accurate wildfire information just as they expect accurate weather or humidity data,” Ran Korber, CEO and co-founder, said. “It has an immediate effect on their life.” He added further that BreezoMeter wants to “try to connect the dots between climate tech and human health.”</p>
<p>Fire danger zones will be indicated with polygonal boundaries marked in red, and as always, air quality data will be viewable in these zones and in surrounding areas.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192952" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192952" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2192952" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/smoke-travel-US_BreezoMeter.gif?w=600" alt="" width="600" height="337" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192952" class="wp-caption-text">BreezoMeter&#8217;s air quality maps can show the spread of wildfire pollution easily. Image Credits: BreezoMeter.</p></div></p>
<p>Korber emphasized that getting these perimeters accurate across dozens of countries was no easy feat. Sensors can be sparse, particularly in the forests where wildfires ignite. Meanwhile, satellite data that focuses on thermal imaging can be fooled. “We’re looking for abnormalities … many of the times you have these false positives,” Korber said. He gave an example of a large solar panel array which can look very hot with thermal sensors but obviously isn’t a fire.</p>
<p>The identified fire perimeters will be available for free to consumers on <a href="https://www.breezometer.com/air-quality-map/air-quality/">BreezoMeter’s air quality map website</a>, and will shortly come to the company’s apps as well. Later this year, these perimeters will be available from the company’s APIs for commercial customers. Korber hopes the API endpoints will give companies like car manufacturers the ability to forewarn drivers that they are approaching a conflagration.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new feature is just a continuation of BreezoMeter’s long-time expansion of its product. “When we started, it was just air quality … and only forecasting air pollution in Israel,” Korber said. “Almost every year since then, we expanded the product portfolio to new environmental hazards.” He pointed to the addition of pollen in 2018 and the increasingly global nature of the app.</p>
<p>Wildfire detection is an, ahem, hot area these days for VC investors. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/cornea-eyes-in-on-fighting-wildfires-using-better-data/">Cornea is a startup focused on helping firefighters identify and mitigate blazes</a>, while Perimeter wants to help identify boundaries of wildfires and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/when-wildfires-rage-close-perimeter-wants-to-tell-you-where-to-go/">give explicit evacuation instructions complete with maps</a>. As Silicon Valley’s home state of California and much of the world increasingly become a tinderbox for fires, expect more investment and products to enter this area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Finding the right learning platform can be difficult, especially as companies look to upskill and reskill their talent to meet demand for certain technological capabilities, like data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence roles.</p>
<p><a href="http://workera.ai/">Workera.ai</a>’s approach is to personalize learning plans with targeted resources — both technical and nontechnical roles — based on the current level of a person’s proficiency, thereby closing the skills gap.</p>
<p>The Palo Alto-based company secured $16 million in Series A funding, led by New Enterprise Associates, and including existing investors Owl Ventures and AI Fund, as well as individual investors in the AI field like Richard Socher, Pieter Abbeel, Lake Dai and Mehran Sahami.</p>
<p>Kian Katanforoosh, Workera’s co-founder and CEO, says not every team is structured or feels supported in their learning journey, so the company comes at the solution from several angles with an assessment on technical skills, where the employee wants to go in their career and what skills they need for that, and then Workera will connect those dots from where the employee is in their skillset to where they want to go. Its library has more than 3,000 micro-skills and personalized learning plans.</p>
<p>“It is what we call precision upskilling,” he told TechCrunch. “The skills data then can go to the organization to determine who are the people that can work together best and have a complementary skill set.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mapping out one edtech company’s $200M bet on lifelong learning&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/mapping-out-one-edtech-companys-200m-bet-on-lifelong-learning/embed/#?secret=U9Rwn2ErLI" data-secret="U9Rwn2ErLI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Workera was founded in 2020 by Katanforoosh and James Lee, COO, after working with Andrew Ng, Coursera co-founder and Workera’s chairman. When Lee first connected with Katanforoosh, he knew the company would be able to solve the problem around content and basic fundamentals of upskilling.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It raised a $5 million seed round last October to give the company a total of $21 million raised to date. This latest round was driven by the company’s go-to-market strategy and customer traction after having acquired over 30 customers in 12 countries.</p>
<p>Over the past few quarters, the company began working with Fortune 500 companies, including Siemens Energy, across industries like professional services, medical devices and energy, Lee said. As <a href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/are-we-losing-jobs-effect-of-artificial-intelligence-in-workforce/">spending on AI skills</a> is expected to exceed $79 billion by 2022, he says Workera will assist in closing the gap.</p>
<p>“We are seeing a need to measure skills,” he added. “The size of the engagements are a sign as is the interest for tech and non-tech teams to develop AI literacy, which is a more pressing need.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ATuBM4qOvi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/there-is-no-cybersecurity-skills-gap-but-cisos-must-think-creatively/">There is no cybersecurity skills gap, but CISOs must think creatively</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As a result, it was time to increase the engineering and science teams, Katanforoosh said. He plans to use the new funding to invest in more talent in those areas and to build out new products. In addition, there are a lot of natural language processes going on behind the scenes, and he wants the company to better understand it at a granular level so that the company can assess people more precisely.</p>
<p>Carmen Chang, general partner and head of Asia at NEA, said she is a limited partner in Ng’s AI fund and in Coursera, and has looked at a lot of his companies.</p>
<p>She said she is “very excited” to lead the round and about Workera’s concept. The company has a good understanding of the employee skill set, and with the tailored learning program, will be able to grow with company needs, Chang added.</p>
<p>“You can go out and hire anyone, but investing in the people that you have, educating and training them, will give you a look at the totality of your employees,” Chang said. “Workera is able to go in and test with AI and machine learning and map out the skill sets within a company so they will be able to know what they have, and that is valuable, especially in this environment.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tuna is on a mission to "fine tune" the payments space in Latin America.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tuna is on a mission to &#8220;fine tune&#8221; the payments space in Latin America and has raised two seed rounds totaling $3 million, led by Canary and by Atlantico.</p>
<p>Alex Tabor, Paul Ascher and Juan Pascual met each other on the engineering team of Peixe Urbano, a company Tabor co-founded and he referred to as a “Groupon for Brazil.” While there, they came up with a way to use A/B testing to create a way of dealing with payments in different markets.</p>
<p>They eventually left Peixe Urbano and started Tuna in 2019 to make their own payment product which enables merchants to use A/B testing of credit card processors and anti-fraud providers to optimize their payments processing with one integration and a no-code interface.</p>
<p>Tabor explained that the e-commerce landscape in Latin America was consolidated, meaning few banks controlled more of the market. The address verification system merchants use to verify a purchaser is who they say they are, involves sending information to a bank that is returned to the merchant with a score of whether that match is legitimate.</p>
<p>“In the U.S., that score is used to determine if the purchaser is legit, but they didn’t implement that in Latin America,” he added. “Instead, merchants in Latam have to tap into other organizations that have that data.”</p>
<p>That process involves manual analysis and constant adjusting due to fraud. Instead, Tuna’s A/B tests between processors and anti-fraud providers in real time and provides a guarantee that a decision to swap providers is based on objective data that considers all components of performance, like approval rates, and not just fees.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the company added 12 customers and saw its revenue increase 15%. It boasts a customer list that includes the large Brazilian fashion chain Riachuelo, and its platform integrates with others including VTEX, Magento and WooCommerce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/445865/e-commerce-share-of-retail-sales-in-latam/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20e%2Dcommerce%20sales,surpassing%20seven%20percent%20by%202023.">share of e-commerce in overall retail</a> is less than 10 percent in Latin America. Marcos Toledo, Canary’s managing partner, said via email that e-commerce in Latam is currently at an inflexion point: not only has the global pandemic driven more online purchases, but also fintech innovation that has occurred in recent years.</p>
<p>In Brazil alone, e-commerce sales grew 73.88% in 2020, but Toledo said there was much room for improvement. What Tuna is building will help companies navigate the situation and make it easier for more customers to buy online.</p>
<p>Toledo met the Tuna team from his partner, Julio Vasconcellos, who was one of the co-founders of Peixe Urbano. When the firm heard that the other Tuna co-founders were starting a business that was applying some of the optimization methods they had created at Peixe Urbano, but for every company, they saw it as an opportunity to get involved.</p>
<p>“The vast tech expertise that Alex, Paul and Juan bring to a very technical business is something that we really admire, as well as their vision to create a solution that can impact companies throughout Latin America,” Toledo said. “The no-code solution that Tuna is building is exciting because it is scalable and can help companies not only get better margins, but also drive their developers to other efforts — and developers have been a very scarce workforce in the region.”</p>
<p>To meet demand for an <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/quarterly-online-sales/">e-commerce industry that surpassed $200 billion in 2020</a>, Tuna plans to use the new funding to build out its team and grow outbound customer success and R&amp;D, Tabor said.</p>
<p>Up next, he wants to be able to show traction in payments optimization and facilitators in Brazil before moving on to other countries. He has identified Mexico, Colombia and Argentina as potential new markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wildfires are burning in countries all around the world. California is dealing with some of the worst wildfires in its history (a superlative that I use essentially every year now) with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/us/caldor-fire-updates.html">Caldor fire</a> and others blazing in the state’s north. Meanwhile, Greece and other Mediterranean nations have been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-business-fires-environment-and-nature-greece-45f2b0b79269afdc65d5e1ed43b9df80">fighting fires for weeks to bring a number of massive blazes under control</a>.</p>
<p>With the climate increasingly warming, millions of home just in the United States alone are sitting in zones at high risk for wildfires. Insurance companies and governments are putting acute pressure on homeowners to invest more in defending their homes in what is typically dubbed “hardening,” or ensuring that if fires do arrive, a home has the best chance to survive and not spread the disaster further.</p>
<p>SF-based <a href="https://www.firemaps.co">Firemaps</a> has a bold vision for rapidly scaling up and solving the problem of home hardening by making a complicated and time-consuming process as simple as possible.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded just a few months ago in March, sends out a crew with a drone to survey a homeowner’s house and property if it is in a high-risk fire zone. Within 20 minutes, the team will have generated a high-resolution 3D model of the property down to the centimeter. From there, hardening options are identified and bids are sent out to trade contractors to perform the work on the company’s marketplace.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192981" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192981" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2192981" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="314" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?resize=768,355 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?resize=680,314 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?resize=1536,710 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?resize=2048,946 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192981" class="wp-caption-text">Once the drone scans a house, Firemaps can create a full CAD model of the structure and the nearby property.

<p>While early, it’s already gotten traction. In addition to hundreds of homeowners who have signed up on its website and a few dozen that have been scanned, Andrew Chen of A16Z has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1861156/000186115621000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">led a $5.5 million seed round</a> into the business (the Form D <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1861156/000186115621000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">places the round sometime around April</a>). Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Addition’s Lee Fixel also participated.</p>
<p>Firemaps is led by Jahan Khanna, who co-founded it along with his brother, who has a long-time background in civil engineering, and Rob Moran. Khanna was co-founder and CTO of early ride-sharing startup Sidecar, where Moran joined as one of the company’s first employees. The trio spent cycles exploring how to work on climate problems, while staying focused on helping people in the here and now. “We have crossed certain thresholds [with the climate] and we need to get this problem under control,” Khanna said. “We are one part of the solution.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the past few years Khanna and his brother explored opening a solar farm or a solar-powered home in California. “What was wild, whenever we talked to someone, is they said you cannot build anything in California since it will burn down,” Khanna said. “What is kind of the endgame of this?” As they explored fire hardening, they realized that millions of homeowners needed faster and cheaper options, and they needed them sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>While there are dozens of options to harden a home to fire, some popular options include constructing an ember-free zone within a few feet of a home, often by placing gravel made of granite on the ground, as well as ensuring that attic vents, gutters, and siding are fireproof and can withstand high temperatures. These options can vary widely in cost, although some local and state governments have created reimbursement programs to allow homeowners to recoup at least some of the expenses of these improvements.</p>

<p>The company’s business model is simple: vetted contractors pay Firemaps to be listed as an option on its platform. Khanna believes that because its drone offers a comprehensive model of a home, contractors will be able to bid for contracts without doing their own site visits. “These contractors are getting these shovel-ready projects, and their acquisition costs are basically zero,” Khanna said.</p>
<p>Long-term, “our operating hypothesis is that building a platform and building these models of homes is inherently valuable,” Khanna said. Right now, the company is launched in California, and the goal for the next year is to “get this model repeatable and scalable and that means doing hundreds of homes per week,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cloud security startup Monad, which offers a platform for extracting and connecting data from various security tools, has launched from stealth with $17 million in Series A funding led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/index-ventures/">Index Ventures</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Monad was founded on the belief that enterprise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> is a growing data management challenge, as organizations try to understand and interpret the masses of information that&#8217;s siloed within disconnected logs and databases. Once an organization has extracted data from their security tools, Monad&#8217;s <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Security Data Platform </span>enables them to centralize that data within a data warehouse of choice, and normalize and enrich the data so that security teams have the insights they need to secure their systems and data effectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Security is fundamentally a big data problem,” said Christian Almenar, CEO and co-founder of Monad. “Customers are often unable to access their security data in the streamlined manner that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/devops/">DevOps</a> and cloud engineering teams need to build their apps quickly while also addressing their most pressing security and compliance challenges. We founded Monad to solve this security data challenge and liberate customers’ security data from siloed tools to make it accessible via any data warehouse of choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup’s Series A funding round, which was also backed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sequoia-capital/">Sequoia Capital</a>, brings its total amount of investment raised to  $19 million and comes 12 months after its Sequoia-led seed round. The funds will enable Monad to scale its development efforts for its security data cloud platform, the startup said.</p>
<p>Monad was founded in May 2020 by security veterans Christian Almenar and Jacolon Walker. Almenar previously co-founded serverless security startup Intrinsic which was acquired by VMware in 2019, while Walker served as CISO and security engineer at OpenDoor, Collective Health, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/palantir/">Palantir</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The idea for the company was driven by Missouri almost closing its one abortion clinic.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more states pass some type of abortion ban, <a href="https://www.heyjane.co/">Hey Jane</a>, a virtual clinic startup offering telemedicine abortion care, announced Thursday that it raised $2.2 million in an oversubscribed round from a group of investors, including Koa Lab, Gaingels and Foursight Capital Partners.</p>
<p>The idea for the remote-first company stemmed from a conversation in 2019 that founder and CEO Kiki Freedman had with some friends regarding Missouri being one of six states that has one abortion clinic left. Freedman, who goes by a nickname to avoid violence against abortion providers, explained that, in fact, the clinic was slated for closure that summer, which would have meant Missouri was the first state to not have any abortion care. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/29/ruling-saves-missouri-abortion-clinic/">The clinic was ultimately able to stay open</a>.</p>
<p>“At the time, many of the emerging telemedicine clinics I saw were focused on men’s wellness and didn’t talk about women’s health,” Freedman told TechCrunch. “I thought this virtual model could be used for safe and discreet abortion care.”</p>
<p>One of Hey Jane’s investors, who wished to remain publicly anonymous, &#8220;was excited to invest in Freedman and Hey Jane&#8221; because he agreed — women&#8217;s health was an underserved category. Unlike men&#8217;s healthcare, abortion care is segregated from women&#8217;s health care. This stemmed from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/30/us/reagan-bars-mention-of-abortion-at-clinics-receiving-us-money.html">Reagan&#8217;s mandates separating abortion care from hospitals</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-pacific-southwest/blog/1-in-4-american-women-will-have-an-abortion-by-age-45">One in four women will have an abortion</a> by age 45, according to Planned Parenthood. However, just in 2021, over 90 abortion restrictions were enacted in the United States, and there are 1,320 restrictions in total, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2021/07/state-policy-trends-midyear-2021-already-worst-legislative-year-ever-us-abortion">according to The Guttmacher Institute</a>, a nonprofit research and policy organization committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights. Currently, Arkansas and Oklahoma have near-total abortion bans except when a patient’s life is endangered. Meanwhile, Idaho, South Carolina and Texas ban abortion at either six weeks or with very limited exceptions.</p>

<p>In July 2020, a federal judge <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/federal-judge-rules-women-can-get-abortion-pill-without-doctor-visits">granted approval</a> for women to obtain abortion medication without having to see a doctor, which opened the door for companies, like Hey Jane and others, to begin offering “no touch” services for people who were less than 10 weeks pregnant.</p>
<p>The $249 treatment includes screening by a medical doctor, FDA-approved medication prescribed and shipped overnight to the person’s house, follow-up virtual visits and the ability to chat with a doctor during the entire process. The Hey Jane team also checks in frequently with the patient via text message.</p>
<p>The company said removing financial barriers is “a huge priority for us.” Though the company does not accept insurance yet, it is offering financial assistance through a nonprofit abortion fund partner, Reprocare. This organization subsidizes up to $110 of the $249 treatment so that patients can pay as little as $139 for treatment.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable Hey Jane to expand into new states and add to its team of seven to build out the product and automated process and for legal research so the company can stay abreast of telemedicine laws and telemedicine abortion laws for each state.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are several regulatory requirements Hey Jane must follow in each state, including ensuring that clinicians only provide care to patients in states in which they’re licensed. For this reason, the company has clinicians licensed in each state in which it operates who are ready to prescribe medication when appropriate. It also has on-demand experts for emotional relief.</p>
<p>Hey Jane just launched across California this week and is also in New York and Washington. This means that Hey Jane’s service areas now cover up to 34% of all abortions performed annually in the United States, Freedman said. Those states were chosen first because California and New York have the<a href="https://data.guttmacher.org/states/table?topics=66+65&amp;dataset=data&amp;state=AL+AK+AZ+AR+CA+CO+CT+DE+DC+FL+GA+HI+ID+IL+IN+IA+KS+KY+LA+ME+MD+MA+MI+MN+MS+MO+MT+NE+NV+NH+NJ+NM+NY+NC+ND+OH+OK+OR+PA+RI+SC+SD+TN+TX+UT+VT+VA+WA+WV+WI+WY"> highest number of abortions performed annually</a>, she added.</p>
<p>“Although people in those states may have easier access to clinics, they could still strongly benefit from treatment with Hey Jane since it’s as safe and effective and half the price of in-clinic care,” Freedman said. “It doesn’t require costs, or time for travel or child care, ensures privacy and discretion and provides additional layers of emotional support.”</p>

<p>Freedman expects to be in 10 states by the end of the year and plans to be able to offer treatment in all 50 states in coming years. However, there are regulatory barriers <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/medication-abortion">limiting access to telemedicine abortion in 19 states</a>. Hey Jane is partnering with the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health research group out of the University of California at San Francisco to gather information to this end.</p>
<p>“We are working with leading researchers to expand the ample existing evidence that this modality of care is safe, effective and preferred by patients,” she added. “We hope this research can further advance discussions in more restrictive states, ultimately leading to much needed, patient-centric updates to outdated regulations. Existing data on the safety and effectiveness of telemedicine abortion paints a very clear picture that this is the future of abortion care.”</p>
<p>The company is currently seeing 250% quarterly growth in the number of patients using the service. As it has grown, it is focusing more on additional tools for coordinated care and new products.</p>
<p>Abortions are often kept secret due to<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0226417"> worries of judgment and discrimination</a>, and Hey Jane will provide a much-needed outlet for patients to discreetly share their experiences and emotion, Freedman said.</p>
<p>“We are focusing on convenience and privacy,” she added. “Two-thirds of women don’t want to talk about their experience, so we want to provide a space for them.”</p>
<p><em>Matters of women&#8217;s health are highly personal. If you or someone you know is struggling with a private women&#8217;s health concern, please contact your primary care physician or secular community health clinic for more information.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sugarliving.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that aims to turn apartment buildings into “interactive communities,” has closed on $2.5 million in seed funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slew of investors participated in the financing, including MetaProp, Agya Ventures, Concrete Rose, Debut Capital, The Community Fund, Consonance Capital, Lightspeed Scout Fund and Jason Calacanis&#8217; LAUNCH syndicate. Also participating were angel investors such as SquareFoot CEO Jonathan Wasserstrum, Ben Zises, Diran Otegbade, Oleksiy Ignatyev and Zillow board member Claire Cormier Thielke, also of Sequoia Scout Fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mali-born Fatima Dicko founded Los Angeles-based Sugar in March 2020. As people began quarantining due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Dicko saw an opportunity to help make it easier for people living in apartments and residential communities to “engage with one another in a safe and efficient way.” So she partnered with real estate investment groups and property management companies to build an app for residents of apartments and those communities who might be feeling isolated and disconnected from their neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most residential apps are clunky, outdated and a pain to use. Tasks as simple as paying rent, communicating with your property manager or unlocking doors are cumbersome and tedious,” Dicko said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194197" style="width: 259px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194197" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2194197 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FatimaHeadshot-1.jpg?w=228" alt="" width="249" height="328" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FatimaHeadshot-1.jpg 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FatimaHeadshot-1.jpg?resize=114,150 114w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FatimaHeadshot-1.jpg?resize=228,300 228w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FatimaHeadshot-1.jpg?resize=768,1010 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FatimaHeadshot-1.jpg?resize=517,680 517w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FatimaHeadshot-1.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194197" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CEO and founder Fatima Dicko / Sugar</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, feeling isolated and disconnected from neighbors can also contribute to resident turnover, negative online reviews and, ultimately, decreased revenue for building owners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Dicko set about creating an app that not only gives residents a way to interact with other residents, but also do things like unlock doors without keys, submit maintenance requests and pay their rent. The platform has since grown beyond a pandemic-related use case. Today, the startup has clients globally, including residential communities of varying sizes, real estate investment groups, Airbnb rentals, hotels and other types of residential properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugar&#8217;s product has two components. One is a mobile app for residents and the other is a web-based dashboard for building owners and managers. The mobile app is sold directly to building owners and/or managers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property managers also have access to the management dashboard to monitor resident engagement metrics and track online ratings and reviews of properties within their portfolios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to closing the seed round, Sugar achieved “consistent” month-over-month growth resulting in six-figure ARR (annual recurring revenue) just four months after launch, according to Dicko. As of now, Sugar has begun rollout to certain properties within the portfolios of early customers, such as Equilibrium Real Estate Investment Group, CGI Investment group and Apartment Management Consultants (AMC). Combined, the firms manage over 655 properties and 150,000 active doors in 22 states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugar has also secured 90-day pilots with major property management companies such as Bozzuto, which manages over 78,000 residences and is seeking to boost resident engagement, Dicko said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its ability to integrate keyless entry hardware products into a community engagement dashboard is a point of differentiation for Sugar, according to Dicko. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our consumer app is sticky, which benefits users and owners. Sugar believes that access control is the most important feature in order to increase usage of the platform,” she said. “Because the product can plug into hardware and enable users to unlock doors and share digital keys from inside the app, this will enable increased product adoption leading to more engagement inside the community portal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said another big differentiator is the ability to integrate into a building’s current hardware or software stack. Prior to attending Stanford Business School, Dicko spent several years as a senior product engineer at Procter &amp; Gamble. It was there that she says she got excited about the idea of creating new solutions to solve old problems.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Michael Chernow is already known as a restaurateur, chef, television host and entrepreneur, but now he can also add lifestyle and wellness guru to that list.</p>
<p>Chernow raised $2.2 million to launch <a href="https://kreaturesofhabit.com">Kreatures of Habit</a>, a lifestyle and wellness brand, with the goal of helping people establish healthy habits.</p>
<p>Seasoned entrepreneur and investor Gary Vaynerchuk led the funding round and was joined by a group of entrepreneurs, media executives and professional sports figures, including Sports 1 Marketing co-founder David Meltzer, Elevator Studio founder Dan Fleyshman, author Dean Graziosi, angel investor Josh Bezoni, author Joel Marion, “Entrepreneurs on Fire” host John Lee Dumas, LA Dodgers player Justin Turner, Philadelphia Eagles general manager Howie Roseman and Evan Yurman.</p>
<p>The idea for Kreatures of Habit stemmed from Chernow’s own life, celebrating 17 years of sobriety. He said he adopted positive habits that enabled him to replace alcohol with nutrition and fitness.</p>
<p>It is the latest venture for Chermow, who also founded The Meatball Shop and Seamore’s in New York. The brand originally started out as a café concept, but Chermow pivoted to the consumer goods space when the global pandemic hit.</p>
<p>“I had put a plan together in 2019, was away for a few weeks when the news of COVID hit,” he told TechCrunch. “I called up my investors and said ‘I am not going to invest in this and neither should you. I’m going to reassess and get back to you.’ However, through my journey of scaling restaurants, I didn’t love doing it because I went from being a culture entrepreneur to a project manager. It was a far cry from connecting to human beings around a brand.”</p>
<p>He started with breakfast — his favorite meal of the day — and began looking at his sustenance of choice: oatmeal, protein and vitamins. Now he is targeting the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/02/17/1985687/0/en/Oatmeal-Market-to-Reach-USD-3-32-Billion-by-2026-Launch-of-Innovative-and-Flavorful-Variants-of-Breakfast-Cereals-to-Contribute-Positive-Revenue-says-Fortune-Business-Insights.html">$3.3 billion pre-packed oats market</a> with his first product, a direct-to-consumer instant oatmeal called The PrOATagonist.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194139" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194139" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2194139" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194139" class="wp-caption-text">Kreatures of Habit oatmeal. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kreatures of Habit</p></div></p>
<p>It is a plant-based, gluten and allergen-free meal that has his three favorite breakfast go-tos — oats, protein and vitamins, plus minerals and Omega-3 fatty acids. Chernow spent over a year testing the formula, which comes in three flavors, including chocolate, blueberry-banana and vanilla.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To help Chernow tap into the industry, he brought on former RX Bar chief marketing officer Victor Lee to lead the brand’s go-to-market strategy. The PrOATagonist comes in a box of seven for $34, and can be obtained via a monthly subscription of $33.</p>

<p>He is also working with one of his investors, Elevator Studios’ Fleyshman, who Chernow referred to as “the best marketer today.”</p>
<p>Fleyshman said he was eager to invest after getting off of a Zoom call with Vaynerchuk.</p>
<p>“The combination of Michael’s resume and passion to build a business with Gary’s passion for building a brand had its advantages as did the cool factor of making a brand with a physical product,” he added. “Gary got 30 people together on the call and almost half had committed within the week.”</p>
<p>In addition to funneling much of the new funding into marketing, it will also be used on product development.</p>
<p>“We have a pipeline of products that will live in the beginning of the day and snack space, several that are in development right now,” Chernow added. “We will always have a capsule collection drop three times a year, a seasonal line and full suite of SKUs over the next three to five years.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/how-to-hire-is-the-new-how-to-conserve-runway/">It isn’t only tech giants that are struggling to fill open roles with talented individuals</a>, it’s your local Jamba Juice, too.</p>
<p>Since 2017, San Francisco-based<a href="https://www.workstream.us/"> Workstream</a> has been working on an answer to recruitment for the hourly worker. The subset of employees are in high demand right now by employers <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/hire-hourly-workers-turnover-rises.aspx#:~:text=Respondents%20reported%20the%20annual%20turnover,increase%20in%20turnover%20for%20managers.">managing high turnover, </a>as the labor market evolves amid the pandemic. These tailwinds in mind, Workstream announced today that it has landed a new round of financing to scale its recruitment efforts.</p>
<p>Workstream has raised $48 million in a Series B round co-led by Mary Meeker’s BOND and Coatue, with notable investors including Zoom CEO Eric Yuan and DoorDash CEO Tony Xu. Jay Simons, a GP at BOND and former president of Atlassian, joined Workstream’s board of directors. The raise comes a little over one year since<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/workstream-a-platform-for-deskless-work-raises-10-million-to-serve-local-businesses/"> Workstream raised $10 million in a Series A </a>led by Founders Fund.</p>
<p>Per CEO and co-founder Desmond Lim, Workstream landed 12 term sheets in 9 days. He chalked up the interest to investors appreciating his startup&#8217;s differentiation among the flurries of other recruiting tools out there.</p>
<p>Even in the crowded world of recruitment software, Workstream has been able to carve out some attention for itself by focusing on text-based recruiting. Front-line and deskless workers are often the most disconnected members of the global job force due to a lack of access to company-issued e-mail addresses. Thus, by Workstream communicating with candidates over text, it is able to give workers on the go some real-time updates. This differentiation of mobile-based recruitment has helped bring down the time to hire for employers too, by bringing candidates in by going to where they already are.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2194277 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile.jpeg" alt="" width="494" height="879" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile.jpeg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile.jpeg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile.jpeg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile.jpeg?resize=382,680 382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile.jpeg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" /></p>
<p>Lim, who grew up in Singapore with parents who both spent their days as hourly workers, sees this strategy working. In July, his company filled more than 18,000 jobs. Down the road, Workstream wants to serve hourly workers in healthcare and retail.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There’s a football field [of software] for hiring software engineers,” Lim said. “But if you think about hiring for this space, there’s very few of us &#8211; and I think that has really helped us to go far from a team point of view, client sales, and even trying to raise funding.</p>
<p>While Workstream didn’t disclose specifics on revenue, it said that it has experienced “10X” ARR in the past year. One signal that it’s doing ok? The company has 1,500 customers across 10,000 different stores, which include the likes of McDonalds, Subway, and of course, Jamba Juice. Lim claims that Workstream has 20% market share in the top 20 brands.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2194276 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="503" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg 1559w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg?resize=768,377 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg?resize=680,334 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg?resize=1536,755 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Workstream views itself as an end-to-end recruitment tool for the hourly worker, but its distribution is still tied to the some 25,000 job boards that it partners with to post listings. Lim said that his company is more focused on the “recruitment and engagement” bit of hiring, “helping to push people through the funnel very fast” versus trying to get them in the funnel in the first place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data is the new oil, as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Humby" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying goes</a>, and today a startup that is helping companies mine for it is announcing a major funding round to expand its business on the back of strong growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atheneum.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atheneum</a>, which provides a platform for companies to conduct and analyze research sourced through virtual interviews and surveys with stakeholders (that is, research solutions that include qualitative expert consultations, quantitative surveys, and big data products to parse the results), has closed $150 million in funding.</p>
<p>CEO Mathias Wengeler said it plans to use the funds to continue expanding geographically, hiring more people for its teams, and building out its technology. Today Atheneum is used by some 500 large enterprises &#8212; with customers spanning verticals like life sciences, strategic consulting firms, investment services, and telecoms, media and tech firms &#8212; covering a network of some 680,000 experts and so-called opinion leaders and hundreds of thousands of surveys and interviews.</p>
<p>The startup was founded in Berlin a little over a decade ago and now has a second base in New York, and notably, it is already profitable. This funding &#8212; led by <a href="https://guidepostgrowth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://guidepostgrowth.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630047588848000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFbBDJDIBna40bE4TMWHu2pStcDLw">Guidepost Growth Equity</a> with participation from unnamed limited partners; existing investors <a href="https://www.crosslantic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.crosslantic.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630047588848000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFPX3wFp8uM-Bn72Gw5tk8JG8At0w">Crosslantic Capital Management</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelbrehm/?originalSubdomain=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelbrehm/?originalSubdomain%3Dde&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630047588848000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEo_AgVTkoiw_7xCz5cvvpU8eL_CA">Michael Brehm</a>, <a href="https://www.vogel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vogel.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630047588848000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEensiF2cdSb0M6XoAb0TBuGdBlEg">Vogel Communications Group</a>; and Atheneum&#8217;s founding management team &#8212; thus is coming opportunistically to jump on what has been strong growth for the startup, especially in the last year: in 2020 the company grew nearly 50%, Wengeler said, and this year growth has bumped up to 80%.</p>
<p>Atheneum&#8217;s growth is coming on the back of two trends in the world of enterprise.</p>
<p>The first is a bigger shift to digital transformation that we&#8217;ve been witnessing, spurred by the enforced remote working practices that came out of Covid-19. Specifically, companies need tools to let them continue carrying out work in more virtualised formats, and Atheneum has created a framework for those that have typically sourced data through live interactions to keep doing that using tools like Zoom, online surveys, and cloud-based analytics to &#8220;read&#8221; and better understand all the resulting data.</p>
<p>The second trend is that companies making strategic decisions based on data and feedback from the field are increasingly wanting to tap into innovations in data science and technology overall to increase their access to more data and insights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This second trend has been growing for years and predates the pandemic, which is also one of the reasons investors have been knocking: these are trends that go beyond circumstantial ones that might evolve when/if we return back to our more traditional work patterns). Wengeler and his co-founders Ammad Ahmad and Marta Margolis (pictured above) all previously worked in management consulting, and Wengeler said that he was moved to start Atheneum to more directly address that opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Primary and raw data were out there already,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but their importance is increasing. What a doctor sees [firsthand] has a major impact on how a pharmaceutical company plans its strategy for commercialization and more, and that is different in every country. I felt that the world was getting more internationalized and we needed more raw data, we needed more market research. We see Atheneum as a platform for knowledge, based on being a one-stop-shop for primary research.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roshen Menon, who led the investment for Guidepost, also notes that is also a reflection of how companies themselves have evolved to build more specialized products.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the fundamental shift has been from a reliance on secondary to primary research,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Companies want to do their research directly. The second shift in the broader research tech space has the long and broad research approach. Things have gotten more specialized. &#8216;Let&#8217;s take a survey and understand this specific problem.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;In life sciences, we have seen a shift from blockbuster drugs to specialized research and medicine and treatments for so-called orphan diseases. And there is much more of that across all industries. Services like Atheneum&#8217;s really allow customers to get access and insights from a sea of data.&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of this, presenting this platform as a SaaS-style cloud service, which combines both technology and human interaction to better tailor it to the needs of the clients as needed &#8212; and of course alongside the humans who are providing the raw data in the first place &#8212; fits in with how a lot of businesses want to engage with technology and IT services these days.</p>
<p>That will mean an increasing number of competitors to Atheneum that will be looking to leverage their own reach and tools to dive deeper into the &#8216;research as a service&#8217; space. That could include more activity from survey and direct marketing companies like SurveyMonkey or MailChimp, or even companies like Saleforce or Microsoft&#8217;s LinkedIn that want to build an ever-bigger set of tools to help people do business more efficiently.</p>
<p>Or even companies like Google, which up to now have focused surveys more on consumer responses that are sold as advertising units (you may have come across these on sites like YouTube), but obviously have a big opportunity to build more cloud-based services to cater to their growing roster of business customers that might better leverage their in-house big data and AI capabilities. Wengeler said that up to now, LinkedIn has been one of the more active and interesting players in building new tools that might most directly compete with what it builds.</p>
<p>It is nonetheless a big opportunity: Atheneum cites figures from Deloitte that estimate the data and intelligence market is worth some $22 billion currently.</p>
<p>Atheneum, partly as a result of raising relatively little money previously and partly a result of focusing just on its growth and client business, has been somewhat under the radar until now. To that end, it is not disclosing its valuation today. But as an indicator of where it might be, Wengeler confirmed that the startup had raised less than $20 million previously, and that this latest investment gives new backers a minority stake with the founders remaining the biggest shareholders in the company.</p>
<p>Menon, who is taking a board seat with this round, added in an interview that Atheneum is making &#8220;well north&#8221; of $50 million in revenue annually.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The acquisition of GrocerKey, which brings on board the company’s front-end consumer-facing sales engine and predictive analytics, puts the data and brand recognition back in the retailer’s hands. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Point Pickup Technologies, a last-mile delivery service, has acquired white label e-commerce platform GrocerKey for $42 million, according to the company. With the acquisition, Point Pickup now allows retailers to offer same-day delivery, from purchase to fulfillment to delivery, under their own brand name, rather than under third parties like Instacart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instacart made a killing delivering groceries and goods for retailers during the coronavirus pandemic, with a</span><a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/instacart-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generated revenue of $1.5 billion in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and $35 billion worth of sales. The company has an estimated 9.6 million active users and over 500,000 “shoppers” who pick up and deliver goods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New entrants to the same-day delivery space are cropping up, which aligns with the expected growth of the industry to $20.36 billion by 2027, </span><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/07/2242542/0/en/Same-Day-Delivery-Market-to-Garner-20-36-Billion-by-2027-Says-Allied-Market-Research.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Allied Market Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But companies like Amazon and Instacart that perform this service and host a delivery marketplace get far more than sales revenues – they also get all the customer data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Fiorita, founder and CEO of Point Pickup, says retailers should have a right to own that data themselves. The acquisition of GrocerKey, which brings on board the company’s front-end consumer-facing sales engine and predictive analytics, puts the data and brand recognition back in the retailer’s hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you are a customer of Instacart, you pay them a subscription, they own your buying habits, your credit cards, your data,” Fiorita told TechCrunch. “Instacart was a big thing during COVID because no one had delivery. So now retailers woke up and said, ‘Oh my god, I can’t just have an Instacart-like marketplace be selling my goods. I don’t know who my customers are, I don’t have their credit cards or data.’ And you know data runs the world now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another recent, if not smaller, entrant to the space is Canadian startup <a href="https://www.tyltgo.com/">Tyltgo</a>, which operates under a similar model to what Point Pickup is now offering via GrocerKey’s technology. In both cases, the buyer goes directly onto the merchant’s platform and places the order through them, so it feels like they’re interacting with the brand they purchased from. And on Tuesday,</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/walmart-announces-golocal-a-last-mile-delivery-service-for-other-retailers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Walmart also announced a new white-label delivery service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would allow other merchants to tap into its own delivery platform to get orders to their customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiorita founded Point Pickup in 2015 as a reaction to Amazon’s increased omnipotence with the noble, if not naive, mission to “save local America.” Walmart and Kroger, two of the largest grocery retailers in the U.S., are Point Pickup’s top customers, alongside other nationwide retailers like Albertsons, Giant Eagle and more. But Fiorita believes the service his company is offering will be even more impactful when it starts to work its way down to the mid-sized and small- to medium-sized businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We built this not only to survive against Amazon or Instacart, but because these small businesses need this for their survival,” Fiorita said. “These companies will no longer survive if they continue to allow other companies to sell their merchandise and to own their customer, including the data, the advertising, the CPG dollars and everything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Point Pickup offers deliveries of everything from grocery to general merchandise, pharmacy and oversized delivery. It has a network of 350,000 gig economy drivers across 25,000 ZIP codes in all 50 states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the company’s network of drivers, who often pick and pack the products for the customer as well as deliver the goods, comprises all gig workers with their own vehicles, Point Pickup doesn’t have a clear picture of the percentage of its fleet that’s electric or hybrid. Fiorita speculates it’s probably on par with nationwide rates, if not higher. </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/03/electric-vehicles-get-mixed-reception-from-american-consumers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent Pew Research report found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 7% of Americans say they own an EV or hybrid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiorita said that the type of car drivers own is taken into account during recruitment and that the company is looking for ways to incentivize drivers to buy less polluting vehicles. He also said Point Pickup is a vehicle-agnostic platform, meaning it’s piloting other delivery vessels like drones and autonomous robots.</span></p>
<p>To compete with the big dogs in the space like Amazon and Walmart, both of which are either testing or already have in place electric delivery vans, Point Pickup will have to also make efforts to beef up its strategy in the carbon emissions space.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> After a few holds, Blue Origin successfully launched the New Shepard rocket at around 10:30 AM ET / 7:30 AM PT, with a landing of the first stage at around 10:38 and the capsule at 10:40.</p>
<p>Blue Origin&#8217;s last launch was its landmark first human flight, carrying Jeff Bezos, his brother, Wally Funk and Oliver Daemen to suborbital space. Today, it&#8217;s flying New Shepard again — without any people on board, this time, but with a key payload from NASA that will test technologies the agency is using to develop a human landing system for future missions to the Moon.</p>
<p>The NS-17 launch (which stands for New Shepard 17, since it&#8217;s the 17th time Blue Origin&#8217;s fully reusable suborbital rocket will be taking off) is set to take place at 9:35 AM EDT (6:35 AM PDT) from the company&#8217;s launch site in West Texas. The NASA payload on board will test technologies including a Doppler Lidar sensor array that should help future lunar landing craft get a very detailed picture of the details of the landing zone they&#8217;re targeting, and a Descent Landing Computer that handles processing of the sensor data. Blue Origin flew elements of this system once before, last October, and improvements have already been made based on that test that are integrated into this version.</p>
<p>The Blue Origin capsule also carries a number of other experiments, both form NASA and from academic institutions including the University of Florida. The launch plan includes a take-off, separation of the capsule, a controlled return powered landing for the booster, and a parachute-assisted landing for the capsule after a few minutes spent in suborbital space.</p>
<p>You can watch the livestream above, kicking off around 30 minutes prior to the target lift-off time.</p>
