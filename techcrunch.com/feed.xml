										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> has always differentiated itself as a communications tool by its ability to run applications inside of Slack and avoid dreaded context switching. At the Frontiers Conference today, <a href="https://slack.com/blog/transformation/new-slack-platform-digital-hq">the company is announcing</a> a twist on app integrations with new building blocks &#8212; components that developers can build and string together into pre-packaged kinds of workflows.</p>
<p>Steve Wood, senior vice president of product management at Slack, says that the new approach actually required redesigning the entire platform with the idea of accommodating these reusable building blocks. Whereas in the past, a developer might build an app in Slack, and it did what the developer wants, these building blocks put the end user in control, and it should make the entire platform more accessible and customizable.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this new world, we&#8217;re actually making [the platform] remixable going forward, so when you install an app, you [can access these] building blocks, and you can link them together, and they can actually talk to each other in channels. You can wire them together to [build] the workflows that you need for the kind of work you are trying to do,&#8221; Wood explained.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234518" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2234713" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234713" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2234713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/drag-n-drop-workflow.png?w=680" alt="Slack drag and drop worklfow building concept illustration." width="680" height="507" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/drag-n-drop-workflow.png 6381w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/drag-n-drop-workflow.png?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/drag-n-drop-workflow.png?resize=300,223 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/drag-n-drop-workflow.png?resize=768,572 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/drag-n-drop-workflow.png?resize=680,507 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/drag-n-drop-workflow.png?resize=1536,1144 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/drag-n-drop-workflow.png?resize=2048,1525 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/drag-n-drop-workflow.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234713" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Slack</p></div></p>
<p>He says that the motivation behind this approach is that employees typically need to use an increasing number of apps to do their jobs, and this will provide a way to a string them together and choose appropriate tasks inside these workflows built in Slack. Instead of forcing the user to jump between apps, in Slack or not, the software is doing the work for them.</p>
<p>He uses the example of a Zendesk help desk ticket delivered inside of Slack related to an outage. That could trigger an automated emergency response workflow where a PagerDuty alert goes out, a Zoom meeting is automatically initiated with a group of key people, the emergency response checklist gets pulled from Box, and a document is opened in Google Docs to track notes about the incident.</p>
<p>The tool itself is an interface for developers to build functions and triggers, which developers can create in a new Slack command line interface (CLI). The trigger starts a function that gets the work flowing. These can then be saved as an individual app or block, or developers can string multiple blocks together.</p>
<p>Angela Ashenden, an analyst at CCS Insight who covers workflow transformation, says companies already using Slack integrations in conjunction with the Workflow Builder tool in Slack should like this update.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The new capabilities are designed to accelerate the app and workflow creation process, closing the gaps between the different parts of the process, and making it easier for everyone &#8212; both tech and non-tech users &#8212; to build workflows, and also to make it easier to share and consume those workflows day-to-day. The goal is to allow employees to use workflows in ad hoc or personal processes, as well as in more well-defined team processes,&#8221; Ashenden explained.</p>
<p>Wayne Kurtzman, an analyst at IDC who watches the social and collaboration space, says that while the building block concept isn&#8217;t necessarily new, it could make Slack more broadly appealing as a place to process workflows inside an organization and allows it to move beyond pure communication.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slack has always had [integration] functionality, and the trick was making it as easy as building blocks. Pair the ease of use and reuse with people&#8217;s increased understanding of automation, and I expect that this feature will be widely used,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Woods says they are just launching in private beta this week, but eventually there will be a distribution system like a blocks library or marketplace. That is still being considered. There will also be an update to Slack&#8217;s Workflow Builder down the road where non-technical end users can string together these pre-built building blocks into meaningful templated workflows.</p>
<p>The tools will be released at some point next year, but if these building blocks work as described, Slack could become less about pure communication, and more about workflow and process automation, something that could be important as it becomes more deeply integrated into Salesforce, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">which bought the company</a> at the end of last year for over $27 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Audio processing startup Mimi promises to make a personalized hearing profile for you, meaning that you can hear well without having to crank the volume up too loudly. This both helps prevent hearing loss, and it helps people who&#8217;ve already suffered some hearing loss to be able to hear their content better without having to incur additional damage to their hearing.</p>
<p>In theory, as a science project, that sounds pretty rad, but as a company, there&#8217;s an obvious problem: Unless the technology makes its way to the products we use to listen, it&#8217;s all a bit academic. You can&#8217;t help people unless the technology is available in products. This week, Mimi announced it has a big-name breakthrough on that front, and announced some major partnerships. The company&#8217;s tech making its way into household name audio products is a huge win for the company &#8212; and for our collective hearing health.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/06/mimi-launch/">Mimi was on the TechCrunch Distrupt stage in New York back in 2014</a> &#8212; and they&#8217;ve come a long way since the product was essentially a bright idea seven years ago. These days, it&#8217;s an operating company with a number of successes under its belt. And with the newly announced partnerships with Skullcandy, Cleer and Beyerdynamic, the technology is about to be available in a lot of ears near you.</p>
<p>“Skullcandy is dedicated to creating accessible products with meaningful technology for our fans. Supporting individually tuned and healthy listening habits with Mimi will have a positive, lifelong impact on our fans&#8217; enjoyment and well-being,” said Jason Hodell, Skullcandy CEO. “Partnering with Mimi is a wonderful example of this core mission coming to life.”</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to introduce Mimi Sound Personalization into our newest earphones and headphones available through the Cleer+app,” said Patrick Huang, president of Cleer Audio. “The inclusion of hearing optimization and wellness features in our products will certainly bring added value to our products and customers.”</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>&#8220;The auditory system has a frequency resolution. You can think of that like pixels on the screen. If you have good hearing you have a high pixel count, but even then, if two different bits of information get into one pixel and the dominant information is going to dominate. That&#8217;s kind of the basis of mp3: because of the limited resolution of a healthy ear, we can throw away tons of this information and get these massive reductions in file size,&#8221; explains Nick Clark, co-founder and head of R&amp;D at Mimi. &#8220;The unique piece of knowledge that Mimi rolls with is we have individual profiles. So if someone has slightly more compromised hearing, you can compare that with them having larger pixels &#8212; they have fewer pixels. And there&#8217;s nothing that Mimi you can do about that pixel count because that&#8217;s related to the actual hearing of the person. What we can do is that we can process the sound to fit that a little bit better. We can amplify something selectively, and decrease something else selectively to kind of get the most information through. If you do that you give someone a rich experience.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2233468" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/csv-mimi.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233468" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2233468" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/csv-mimi.png" alt="" width="1024" height="418" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/csv-mimi.png 1138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/csv-mimi.png?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/csv-mimi.png?resize=300,122 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/csv-mimi.png?resize=768,313 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/csv-mimi.png?resize=680,277 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/csv-mimi.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2233468" class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s hardly the most riveting illustration I&#8217;ve ever added to a review, but it&#8217;s fascinating to see the data that Mimi captures about my hearing. From the app, you can request a CSV export. It seems like the data captured mostly covers at which frequency and volume level I start and stop hearing the beeping sound.</p></div></p>
<p>I had a chance to try Mimi&#8217;s technology on three different devices; Skullcandy&#8217;s $99 <a href="https://www.skullcandy.com/grind-fuel-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grind Fuel True Wireless Earbuds</a>, Cleer Audio&#8217;s $130 <a href="https://www.skullcandy.com/grind-fuel-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ally Plus II Wireless Earbuds</a> and Beyerdynamic&#8217;s $300 <a href="https://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/lagoon-anc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lagoon ANC headphones</a>. The setup process is pretty similar on all three devices: You download the respective manufacturer&#8217;s app, then go through the process to create a hearing profile.</p>
<p>The creation of a profile is pretty straightforward; tell it your birth year, and you&#8217;re ready to start the test. The hearing test itself is pretty odd &#8212; it sounds like they locked a swarm of electronic crickets in a box, and then play a beeping sound over the top. The beeping fades up, and when you can hear the sound, you hold down a button. This makes the beeping sound fade back down, and when you can&#8217;t hear the beeping anymore you let go. The beeping happens at various frequencies, and the app uses your input to create a personalized profile. Once you have your profile, you can create a Mimi account and save it &#8212; which means you can use your personalized profile on any device that supports Mimi&#8217;s tech. Super neat, and it means you don&#8217;t have to become too intimately familiar with the box&#8217;o&#8217;crickets sound &#8212; it isn&#8217;t exactly a pleasant noise.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232402" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/personal.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232402" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2232402" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/personal.png" alt="" width="1024" height="442" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/personal.png 2583w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/personal.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/personal.png?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/personal.png?resize=768,332 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/personal.png?resize=680,294 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/personal.png?resize=1536,663 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/personal.png?resize=2048,884 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/personal.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2232402" class="wp-caption-text">My personalization results from the Cleer app (left) were pretty different from those from the Skullcandy app (middle and right). The two Skullcandy results were almost identical, which would indicate that there is at least consistency between the measurements. Image: Screenshots.</p></div></p>
<p>The hearing testing component of this product is wildly successful and in wide use. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-hearing-test/id932496645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The company has the No. 1 hearing test app in the App Store</a>, and the company claims that around 50,000 people are testing their hearing using their app every month. From the app&#8217;s reviews, it seems as if the users are finding that the tests are consistent with professional hearing tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same technology as our hearing test app is available as an SDK that our partners can build into their companion apps,&#8221; explains Philipp Skribanowitz, CEO at Mimi.</p>
<p>The magic in Mimi, then, is applying the results of the hearing test to a personalized profile, and then running this as a signal processor as close as possible to the user&#8217;s ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Our software] can be anywhere where the digital audio passes through. After we have created your hearing ID, you then somehow need to transfer to the processing algorithm to adjust the audio stream before it reaches your ears,&#8221; Skribanowitz explains. &#8220;We have multiple components and processing algorithms. On headphones, they run on the Bluetooth chip, on a TV they run on the audio chip. But we have also partners in public broadcast testing and streaming applications, along with scientific and smartphone partners.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Does it make the listening experience better?</h2>
<p>The question is: Does it work? Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a little hard to tell, and it varied a lot on the devices I tried out.</p>

From left to right: Skullcandy&#8217;s Grind Fuel, Beyerdynamic&#8217;s Lagoon ANC, and Cleer&#8217;s Ally Plus II. Photo: Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The Cleer earbuds had a curious hiss in them whenever they were turned on and in my ears &#8212; even when no audio was playing. When I was playing music, I wasn&#8217;t really able to tell the difference between the sound when my personalization was turned on or off. On the bright side, I was able to use the Cleer earbuds to create a profile and a Mimi account, saving my profile. This means that I could, in theory, be able to use it on other devices.</p>
<p>I spoke with the president of Cleer, who assures me that the hissing/buzzing noise is extremely unusual. They sent me out a second set of earbuds, but unfortunately, this set of earbuds also had the same issue. It&#8217;s possible that I just got extraordinarily unlucky, but it&#8217;s more likely that the company has some work to do before the earbuds are ready for public consumption.</p>
<p>Skullcandy was also having a bad run &#8211; the Skullcandy app kept crashing every time after I set up the sound personalization, failing to save my results every time. I wasn&#8217;t able to hear the personalization in action. For some reason, Skullcandy also didn&#8217;t have the option to log in to Mimi and to use my saved Mimi profile &#8212; I had to create a new one. Between the app failing to save my profile, and not being able to use a Mimi profile I had made on another device, it means that I was never able to hear the personalized audio on the Skullcandy earbuds. I talked with Skullcandy&#8217;s chief product officer about the issues with the app.</p>
<p>“Skullcandy takes the quality of our products very seriously. The Skullcandy mobile app was rigorously tested using various combinations of mobile devices and operating systems available at the time,&#8221; said Jeff Hutchings, chief product officer at Skullcandy. &#8220;Since that time, we have discovered that some users are experiencing issues with the brand new Pixel 6/6 Pro running on Android 12. Skullcandy is actively working on an updated release to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.”</p>

Photo: Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>On the Beyerdynamic Lagoon ANC headphones, it was a very different story. Of course, this is a different type of headphone; over-ear, and with a much beefier price tag. With the Beyerdynamic headphones, at least, the personalization made a marked difference. Especially when the active noise canceling is turned on, Mimi&#8217;s personalization feels significantly different on these headphones. Sound sounds crisper, and I could hear more details in the music than when the personalization was turned off. Music sounds like it is&#8230; more in stereo, somehow? It&#8217;s very hard to explain, but it is a good enough difference that I could be convinced to ensure that all of my headphones have Mimi&#8217;s integration in the future.</p>
<p>Of course, that made me wonder why the Cleer and Skullcandy earbuds didn&#8217;t have that pronounced a difference. I was wondering if I could use the profile I had made with the Beyerdynamic headphones, and use them on the others? It doesn&#8217;t appear that Skullcandy&#8217;s app lets me log into Mimi&#8217;s account, so that didn&#8217;t work. There was no way for the Cleer app to load the other profile once I had created one already. In the end, I had to delete the Cleer app from my phone, re-install it, and then log back into my Mimi account. I appreciate that not a lot of users will have the exact use case I&#8217;m describing here, but it&#8217;s pretty frustrating not to be able to copy a profile that&#8217;s already on the Mimi servers, when that&#8217;s one of the use cases Mimi&#8217;s founders is excited about.</p>
<p>Profile copying kerfuffle aside, with the Beyerdynamic profile, I could just about detect a difference on the Cleer earphones: the sound sounds as if the stereo channels are separated better (not unlike the &#8220;sounds more in stereo&#8221; description above), but I wouldn&#8217;t say that, on the whole, there was a dramatic difference. It&#8217;s certainly not the &#8220;woah, that&#8217;s cool!&#8221; reaction I had with the Beyerdynamic headphones. And nothing like my experience with the most obvious competitor in this space &#8212; Nuraphone.</p>
<p>It would be strange not to compare all of these headphones with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/19/nuraphones-custom-profiles-bring-out-new-detail-in-familiar-songs/">the Nuraphone headphones</a>. They cost a lot more &#8212; $399 &#8212; but they take a different approach in how they measure your hearing: Instead of putting the burden on you to figure out when you can and cannot hear the tones, <a href="https://blog.nuraphone.com/backstage/how-we-make-your-hearing-profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the headphones actually measure your ears directly</a>. The downside of this approach is that this only works in very specialized headphones, and the profiles aren&#8217;t transferable to non-Nura headphones. The result is spectacular, though &#8212; and even five years after I bought them, Nura&#8217;s Nuraphone headphones are my go-to for immersive music experiences.</p>
<p>On the whole, it&#8217;s exciting for the Mimi team to create these partnerships and to get their technology into people&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>Ultmately, that&#8217;s the challenge with reviewing personalization technology: I can only review how these headphones land on me personally, and perhaps my hearing is uniquely good or bad, which would make Mimi&#8217;s tech less useful to me. You may have different results. To me, on higher-end headphones, it makes a world of difference, and I would certainly look for Mimi&#8217;s tech in the next set of high-end headphones I purchase. As for the earbuds; well; I only have a small sample size, where it didn&#8217;t work at all on one set of earbuds, and it was underwhelming on the other. Overall, it doesn&#8217;t really seem worth it for me, but then, if the Mimi tech doesn&#8217;t increase the price of the headphones, or degrades the audio quality in other ways, I can&#8217;t really see the harm either.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.conductor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conductor</a> &#8212; a marketing technology company that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/06/wework-acquires-conductor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snapped up by WeWork</a> at the height of the latter company&#8217;s expansion ambitions, only then to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/condutor-wework-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy itself out</a> in the wake of WeWork&#8217;s collapse &#8212; has raised its first round of funding as a once-again independent startup. It has picked up $150 million, money that it will be using to continue investing in its technology and building out its business: an organic marketing platform aimed at SEO, content and web marketing teams, leveraging insights from search traffic to help build more accurate marketing strategies.</p>
<p>Conductor&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Seth Besmertnik has confirmed to us that the deal &#8212; led by Bregal Sagemount, with other investors not being disclosed &#8212; was made at a $525 million post-money valuation. Relatively speaking, that is a big leap considering that the management buyout he led for himself and others at the company was made at a price of $3.5 million, according to data from <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/52803-64/company/profile#general-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a>.</p>
<p>About half of the investment, he said, would be in the form of secondary shares that are going to the employee-owners of the business; and half is new equity to put into the business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234653" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For those who might not be familiar with Conductor&#8217;s backstory, here&#8217;s a brief summary, since it&#8217;s relevant to what the startup is doing today: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Conductor&#8217;s appeal to WeWork back in 2018 was based in part around WeWork already being one of Conductor&#8217;s big customers. The highly-capitalised WeWork was using Conductor&#8217;s marketing technology to figure out what businesses might be looking for when it came to office space, and it made sure that its marketing was aligned with this to drum up more business for WeWork itself. That proved to be a very successful partnership, enough to give WeWork the idea that it if it owned Conductor itself, it could leverage its technology for its existing business customers to help them grow their &#8220;virtual&#8221; real estate presence as much as their physical one, just as WeWork itself had done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For Conductor, the deal also made sense, Besmertnik said, because Conductor already counted a number of enterprises among its customers, and WeWork potentially could provide another route to it reaching more of them. </span></p>
<p>Those developments, as we now know, never quite came to fruition as the two companies thought it might. Luckily, the acquisition never touched Conductor&#8217;s pre-existing business. So when it started to become apparent that employees at the division might get laid off as part of WeWork&#8217;s drastic cost cuts, Besmertnik and the existing team hatched a plan to buy out the business to give it a shot of survival. When it went independent again in 2019, Conductor left with its customer list intact, and it has built on it since then. Between then and now, clients that it has added to its list include Microsoft, GlaxoSmithKline, and AT&amp;T, with other customers including Visa, Twitter, Comcast and LG &#8212; some 450 big names in all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At its heart, Conductor&#8217;s technology would typically be one of many tools &#8212; maybe dozens these days &#8212; that a marketer would use to both gather and analyse data to formulate and run campaigns. And to that end, the company already integrates with dozens of other sources and platforms to make that management and use easier for customers (The list includes insights tools like Dragon Metrics, Google Trends, TalkWalker, DeepCrawl, and SEMrush; project management platforms like Jira, Asana, Trello and WorkFront; and measurement tech from Adobe, Google, Webtrends, and more.)</p>
<p>But what is also interesting is that its approach in focusing around search is possibly more relevant today than ever before: not only are there an increasing number of controls being put in place to safeguard data (whether those are regulatory measures like GDPR, or choices being made by platform providers like Apple), but we are also seeing rapid growth of walled gardens in specific apps: audiences spend a lot of time in gaming environments or social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, and that gives a lot less visibility to marketers when it comes to understand what users want, or what they are doing.</p>
<p>Search essentially breaks through that, and Conductor&#8217;s belief is that it&#8217;s a big enough area that it provides a window into those activities and needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one ever lies to a search engine,&#8221; said <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Besmertnik. &#8220;Whenever someone needs to buy something or look something up, they are searching on Google. Big social media companies may be taking eyeballs away from other forms of media but when you want to act or seek something, search is ingrained in our blood. They still go to search engines.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The traffic going to search higher than ever, he points out, in part because of Covid-19 and the shift that it brought around more people carrying out their lives online, which has served as a big fillip to Conductor&#8217;s business, and specifically around how companies are leveraging search.</p>
<p>&#8220;Covid has hit the accelerator on digital for many companies that were not digital-first before,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can’t just have a great digital experience now. It has to be discoverable. It has to be able to be found.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a lot of other martech companies out there that have also discovered the power of search &#8212; specifically search-engine optimization specialists like SEMrush, Botify, BrightEdge, DeepCrawl and many more. Conductor&#8217;s customer list is one way that it has stepped out from the crowd to appear at to the top of the results, so to speak.</p>
<p>“At Bregal Sagemount, we pride ourselves on working with market leaders. The feedback we heard from Conductor’s customers and the market was definitive— Conductor is the leader in organic marketing,” said partner Michael Kosty, in a statement. “We are excited to partner with Seth and the whole Conductor team to advance their technology and their mission to empower brands to transform their wisdom into marketing that helps people.” Kosty is joining the board with this round.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The holiday season is in full swing, and just in September and October, the volume of gifts sent grew by 615%.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gift-giving is not always easy, but <a href="https://www.ongoody.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goody</a> wants to make it as easy as sending a text.</p>
<p>The Miami-based company launched in December 2020 with a curated list of gifts from robes to cookies to succulents to spa treatments. You can choose a gift without having to know what size is needed, and the recipient can choose the size or kind, or swap out the gift for one of similar price.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2234058" style="width: 264px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234058" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2234058" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2170.png?w=314" alt="Goody" width="254" height="550" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2170.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2170.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2170.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2170.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2170.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2170.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2170.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2170.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234058" class="wp-caption-text">Goody gift app</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234054" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Goody started as a consumer app and now also includes a website called <a href="https://plus.ongoody.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goody+</a> for business-to-business gifting. Since Goody+ launched in April, more than 1,000 companies have used the service.</p>
<p>The company is on a roll over the past 11 months, having now raised its third round this year, a $15 million round in what co-founder and CEO Edward Lando called “step-up” funding from SoftBank through its Latin America Fund.</p>
<p>“After raising a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/goody-launches-goody-to-allow-individuals-and-corporations-to-make-mobile-gifting-more-personal-and-as-fun-and-easy-as-sending-a-text-301284134.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$13.1 million Series A</a> earlier this year with NEA and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/goody-raises-4-million-its-mobile-app-that-lets-you-send-gifts-via-text/">$4 million seed round</a> with Index, we had plenty of runway,” Lando told TechCrunch. “We spent money on the team, but we had a lot of interest, and the holiday season is big for e-commerce companies, so we decided to not do a full Series B — we&#8217;ll do that next year — but take money at higher terms to help us expand.”</p>
<p>Now having taken in about $32 million in a short period of time, Goody is focused on expanding its existing products, features and services for corporate gifting, including future brand partnerships. Some of the new features include a gamified way of requesting birthdays in the app where users receive points.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The consumer app and desktop tool combined have seen 5,000% growth during the second and third quarters of 2021, and Lando said that the volume of gifts sent in September and October grew by 615%.</p>
<p>“We’re pumped to be investing in Goody,” said Shu Nyatta, managing partner at SoftBank Latin America Fund, in a written statement. “There is so much white space in corporate gifting and employee engagement. It’s exciting to see a team bring a delightful, consumer-grade approach to the space. We look forward to helping Goody scale their offering beyond the U.S. and into Latin America.”</p>
<p>Goody is the latest company to attract funding for gift-giving, especially on the corporate side, which was estimated to be a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2021/09/01/the-242-billion-business-of-corporate-gifting-turned-from-a-routine-to-a-priority-in-the-pandemic/?sh=500673016ac2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$242 billion market</a>. So far this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/reachdesk-wraps-up-43m-to-expand-its-b2b-gifting-marketplace/">Reachdesk</a> bagged $43 million, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/sendoso-nabs-100m-as-its-corporate-gifting-platform-passes-20000-customers/">Sendoso</a> brought in $100 million and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/alyce-an-ai-based-personalised-corporate-gifting-startup-raises-30m/">Alyce</a> raised $30 million.</p>
<p>Lando is eager to bite into a bigger piece of that pie to propel Goody to the level of “leading employer happiness and engagement platform in the U.S.” by next year. In addition to Latin America, having grown up in France, he is also eyeing other countries for expansion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://planetscale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlanetScale</a>, the serverless database company founded by the co-creators of the <a href="https://vitess.io/">Vitess</a> opensource project that powers YouTube, today announced that it has raised a $50 million Series C funding round led by Kleiner Perkins. Existing investors a16z, SignalFire and Insight Partners also participated in this round, together with GitHub CEO and co-founder Tom Preston-Werner, Lattice CEO and founder Jack Altman and Instacart co-founder Max Mullen. With this, the company has now raised a total of $105 million, including a $30 million Series B it announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/planetscale-raises-30m-series-b-for-its-database-service/">only five months ago</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, the company also today announced that its hosted enterprise platform is now generally available. Even though its service was only available as a private beta since its launch in May 2021, the company&#8217;s customers already include the likes of YouTube, GitHub, New Relic, Slack, MyFitnessPal, Square and Affirm. &#8220;We have major websites &#8212; top 4,000 websites &#8212; that have already moved to PlanetScale and that are hosted on PlanetScale right now &#8212; in beta,&#8221; PlanetScale CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isamlambert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Lambert</a> said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t keep people off it. The beta flag did nothing to deter them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lambert, who was previously the VP of Engineering at GitHub, took the CEO position in July after nine months as PlanetScale&#8217;s chief product officer. He replaced co-founder Jiten Vaidya, who stepped into the chief strategy officer role and continues to serve on the company&#8217;s board.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234393" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As Lambert told me, PlanetScale is expanding quickly and the number of employees tripled in the last six months. &#8220;We are now being spoken about as the default serverless database, especially if you&#8217;re using platforms like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify</a> and <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vercel</a>. Serverless is growing as a piece of the industry, but it was growing in areas of less complexity [&#8230;] and there were a few people putting databases together for the serverless world. But we showed up &#8212; and I think we brought something completely new: we brought the database that was the back end for YouTube.com, the second-largest website on planet Earth, and we brought it into a serverless world,&#8221; Lambert said.</p>
<p>According to Kleiner Perkins partner Bucky Moore, transactional databases like PlanetScale are &#8220;the premium market opportunity in all of infrastructure.&#8221; Yet while the big cloud providers are generating billions from these services, investors have remained cautious. &#8220;A lot of investors, frankly, have been hesitant to want to compete with the cloud providers on this axis because it is such a near and dear business to their heart and strategy,&#8221; Moore said. &#8220;The way I think about it, though, is quite different. You have these two megatrends in the need to deliver software at a web scale to global user bases, which of course the public cloud makes a lot easier. But at the same time, they really haven&#8217;t innovated all that much on how you solve the database part of this. And that&#8217;s, of course, why Vitess is such an interesting piece of technology and why so many great companies are running it at scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lambert argues, serverless is finally getting to the point where it delivers on many of the original promises of the cloud. &#8220;The cloud eventually just shifted to, &#8216;well, you don&#8217;t put plug servers in anymore.&#8217; But companies now have teams of people, hundreds of folks just managing their AWS and it&#8217;s like, &#8216;wow, we didn&#8217;t move far enough to where we need to go.&#8217; I think serverless is picking that up and it&#8217;s accelerating. It&#8217;s such an extreme pace. And it brings about human progress. It brings about the fact that there <em>will</em> be a five-person company worth over a billion dollars because they will just leverage serverless tools &#8212; and they will just pull these things together.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while PlanetScale sits on top of opensource projects like MySQL and Vitess, neither Lambert nor Moore were worried about the major cloud providers taking the code and launching their own competitors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;One thing the clouds cannot clone is taste,&#8221; Lambert said (and I should note that I&#8217;ve met few people who bring as much enthusiasm and passion to a discussion about databases as Lambert). &#8220;It&#8217;s absolutely true, right? You look at the licensing debate, the licensing war right now. Many, many companies and many database companies are hiding behind BSL licensing because of that fear that the clouds will just pick their tool up. We do not fear people being able to take our tastes, we do not fear. I sat at GitHub while major companies started up their competitor to GitHub and then closed it down. And it&#8217;s because of our incredible ability to build things that emotionally resonate with people through beauty and design and incredible taste. [&#8230;] We do not fear the clouds having a go, because truly, the magic that we bring to the conversation is extremely unique.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the company&#8217;s future plans, Lambert noted that, so far, PlanetScale has only laid the groundwork for its roadmap. In his view, the company has only shown about 10% of what Vitess can do, but the team needed to put in the basics like login systems and audit logging before it could work on these next steps (though with database branching, it has already launched a number of highly innovative features as well). In the view of the PlanetScale team, a lot of the work in the database world has been around taking roles away from the database itself and working with data outside of the database. But if you have a robust and highly scalable system like Vitess, you can simplify your architecture and, over time, bring a lot of the primitives that have been built outside of the database systems back into them.</p>
<p>With the GA launch today, the company is already offering a new database import feature that allows users to move any existing MySQL database to PlanetScale with just a few clicks. This should make it easier for new users to test the service with their own data before they make a full transition. The service is now also integrated with the new <a href="https://cloud.prisma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prisma Data Platform</a>, allowing developers to create PlanetScale databases in Prisma.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://glossgenius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GlossGenius</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a technology provider for the spa, studio and salon industry, announced today it has raised $16.4 million in a Series A funding round led by Bessemer Venture Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, a high-profile group of angels also participated in the financing, including Shopify co-founder and CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tobias Lütke, Toast CEO Chris Comparato, Toast co-founder Aman Narang, Mindbody co-founder Robert Murphy, Yelp executives and former Venmo executives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With “tens of thousands” of business customers (two-thirds of which are women or underrepresented), GlossGenius recently surpassed $1 billion in gross merchandise volume. Now the B2B software startup has also transitioned into payments as a fintech hardware provider for the beauty and wellness industry with the development of a </span><a href="https://cardreader.glossgenius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">card reader</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that integrates with its app.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234549" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, GlossGenius aims to be a “Business in a box” solution for salon, spa and studio owners. The end goal is to remove the administrative burden from the small business owners so they can focus more on growing their businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s so special about what we&#8217;re doing is that we are connecting the dots for business owners across their whole entire back office on GlossGenius,” said founder and CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danielle Cohen-Shohet. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what that means is everything is there for them. Everything is accessible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former Goldman Sachs analyst, Cohen-Shohet launched the New York-based startup in 2016. GlossGenius had previously raised $2.8 million in pre-seed and seed funding from angels and Techstars but then bootstrapped for five years before seeking more outside capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The early focus on bootstrapping helped us be maniacally focused on product market fit and revenue generation and helped business have a strong start,” Cohen-Shohet told TechCrunch. “For much of the time, the business was revenue-financed.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its new card readers sold out in 24 hours initially and have gone viral on social media among the salon community, according to Cohen-Shohet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They plug right into the GlossGenius ecosystem and enable any business to seamlessly track all of the transactions, level data and categorize expenses,” she said. “They can also track client visits, history and revenue in a very integrated way.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2234561" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234561" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2234561 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/horizontal-headshot-Danielle-Cohen-Shohet-Founder-CEO.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="421" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/horizontal-headshot-Danielle-Cohen-Shohet-Founder-CEO.jpg 2092w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/horizontal-headshot-Danielle-Cohen-Shohet-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/horizontal-headshot-Danielle-Cohen-Shohet-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/horizontal-headshot-Danielle-Cohen-Shohet-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=768,475 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/horizontal-headshot-Danielle-Cohen-Shohet-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/horizontal-headshot-Danielle-Cohen-Shohet-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=1536,950 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/horizontal-headshot-Danielle-Cohen-Shohet-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=2048,1267 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/horizontal-headshot-Danielle-Cohen-Shohet-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234561" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CEO and founder Danielle Cohen-Shohet / GlossGenius</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some companies are opting to go horizontal, GlossGenius touts its vertical SaaS approach as being key to its success &#8212; an approach that Cohen-Shohet likens to Toast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The recent and successful IPO of Toast has only reinforced that vertical software is here to stay. Small businesses have specific needs and need technology built just for them to be successful,” she said. “It isn’t one size fits all. I think we’re in the middle of a renaissance for SMB tech.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, GlossGenius is focused on growth over profitability. It plans to use its new capital mostly toward expansion and creating “unique product experiences that help extract the burden of running a business.” The startup is also looking to boost its 100-person team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s fascinating about GlossGenius is that it has managed to surpass $1 billion in GMV with a zero-person sales team. All of its growth has been driven primarily by word of mouth, according to Cohen-Shohet. Part of the new capital will go toward building a marketing team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kent Bennett, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, said his firm was amazed to see the “true customer love” for the GlossGenius product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, he told TechCrunch,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is “one of the few efficient hyper-growth companies that is succeeding through organic adoption among small businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unlike other solutions that tend to focus on business managers with a top-down approach, GlossGenius focuses first on serving the needs of service professionals that are running their businesses, helping them deliver the best possible client service in a convenient, mobile-first platform,” Bennett wrote via email. “This superior functionality leads to bottom-up driven success for businesses of any size in the beauty and wellness industry.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As restaurants continue to face employment shortages, owners will no doubt look increasingly toward automated solutions. Between that and increased focus on food handling amid a global pandemic, it’s arguably the best time ever to be running a food robotics company.</p>
<p>LA-based Nommi is striking while the oven is hot, announcing a partnership with restaurant brand C3 (Creating Culinary Communities), which is set to result in the rollout of up to 1,000 of its robotic kiosks to real estate and college campus partners globally.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233724" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233724" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233724" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233724" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nommi</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233719" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The variety of foodstuffs that can sufficiently be automated is still a relatively short list. Nommi’s focus is on food bowls &#8212; which, like pizza &#8212; is a relatively uniform and self-contained food delivery system that makes sense to robots. The company’s titular product is essentially an elongated kiosk with a built-in touchscreen that lets the customer customize their meal.</p>
<p>The machine makes noodle, grain and salad bowls in as quick as three minutes. The machine holds up to 330 bowls and lids, and can prepare multiple bowls at once. Once finished, it can hold up to 21 prepared bowls in “lockers,” which release the food via a QR code. The C3 deal includes a partnership with Iron Chef’s Masaharu Morimoto, which will bring his Sa’Moto brand products to the machines, which will operate 24/7.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233726" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233726" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233726" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-food-dispensers-close-up.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-food-dispensers-close-up.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-food-dispensers-close-up.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-food-dispensers-close-up.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-food-dispensers-close-up.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-food-dispensers-close-up.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-food-dispensers-close-up.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-food-dispensers-close-up.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-food-dispensers-close-up.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233726" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nommi</p></div></p>
<p>“Nommi’s secret sauce is undoubtedly its unmatched versatility, both from a brand and consumer perspective,” president and co-founder Buck Jordan said in a release. “Partnering with an innovative platform like C3 adds another layer of access to numerous revenue streams and unique customers. Both companies are disrupting the food industry and our partnership could not come at a better time.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nommi has raised $20 million to date, with assistance from Wavemaker Labs, an incubator behind robotics companies like Miso and Future Acres.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pistil Data, a <a href="https://www.pistildata.com/request">cannabis market intelligence platform</a>, has closed a $6.5 million seed round led by Snoop Dogg’s Casa Verde. The funding round included participation from JW Partners and other entrepreneurs. Pistil Data makes market intelligence accessible to cannabis brands and organizes billions of data points to provide customized sales opportunities for cannabis brands.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company’s co-founders, Jeffery Graham and Taylor Jones, launched the platform nine months ago. Since then, Pistil Data has built a client base including Connected, Curaleaf, Herbl, Raw Garden, and Stiizy.</p>
<p>“My entry point into cannabis was as head of business intelligence for a large West Coast cannabis brand. I saw how they struggled to keep track of sales opportunities, and how everyone was maintaining their own personal spreadsheet,” Pistil Data CEO Jeffrey Graham told TechCrunch. “We lost deals as a result of the confusion. Pistil was born out of trying to make things easier for companies like them by redefining the relationship cannabis brands have with data.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234165" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Graham says that he and Jones were able to home in on one of the most pressing problems that brands face, which is a lack of access to market intelligence. The pair believed that this gap was stifling growth and limiting efficiency for cannabis brands.</p>
<p>“The cannabis industry is extremely complex and fragmented, and there is almost no industry standardization of products or retailers. Our technology analyzes and organizes billions of data points every day to provide customized sales opportunities for cannabis brands,” Graham said.</p>

<p>Pistil Data now aims to help cannabis brands find the next chance to sell their products at a retail store or to get re-orders from current accounts. It also aims to make it easier for cannabis brands of all sizes to find new sales opportunities. Since its launch, the platform has signed up nearly 100 cannabis companies in California and Colorado. Graham also notes that more than 600 sales representatives use the service every week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regarding the seed funding, Pistil Data plans to use it to accelerate its nationwide expansion and launch new market intelligence products for brands and retailers.</p>
<p>“We invested in Pistil because its unique technology provides immediate ROI to its client,” said Yoni Meyer, a partner at Casa Verde, in a statement.​ ​”The company’s growth trajectory, coupled with its stellar leadership, puts Pistil on track to be the preeminent data platform in cannabis.”</p>
<p>In terms of the future, Graham stated that the company’s “vision is to help every business in cannabis find new opportunities to grow. We want to address the challenges the entire industry has faced around data. We think that our platform can ultimately be the connective tissue for the global cannabis industry.”</p>
<p class="p1">Graham said that Pistil Data’s emergence in the cannabis industry is akin to the impact that Bloomberg’s data platform had on the financial industry. He noted that the company triggers a similar critical turning point for the cannabis industry.</p>
<p class="p1">“When Bloomberg took Wall Street out of manual analysis, spreadsheets, and human error, it unlocked growth for the entire financial services sector. Every transformative industry has needed a company to organize its data and unlock exponential growth. Pistil is a similar positive and progressive disruptor that will directly impact the maturation of the cannabis industry as it grows into a major global industry.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The adtech giant formerly known as Facebook is still tracking teens for ad targeting on its social media platforms, according to <a href="https://fairplayforkids.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fbsurveillancereport.pdf">new research</a> by Fairplay, Global Action Plan and Reset Australia &#8212; apparently contradicting Facebook&#8217;s announcement this summer when the tech giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">claimed</a> it would be limiting how advertisers could reach kids.</p>
<p>Facebook has since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">rebranded the group business name to &#8216;Meta&#8217;</a> &#8212; in what looks like a doomed bid to detoxify its brand following a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/a-brief-history-of-facebooks-privacy-hostility-ahead-of-zuckerbergs-testimony/">never-ending</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/">string</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/seized-cache-of-facebook-docs-raise-competition-and-consent-questions/">of</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/internal-facebook-documents-highlight-its-moderation-and-misinformation-issues/">scandals</a>.</p>
<p>In the latest problem for Facebook/Meta, the adtech giant has been accused of not actually abandoning ad targeting for teens but, per the research, it has retained its algorithms&#8217; abilities to track and target kids &#8212; continuing to maintain its AIs&#8217; ability to surveil children so it can use data about what they do online to determine which ads they see in order to maximize engagement and boost its ad revenues.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234655" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So Facebook/Meta stands accused of failing to make a meaningful change to protect some of its most vulnerable users from hyper manipulative marketing &#8212; opting instead for a misleading ploy of stripping out a layer of targeting control from advertisers.</p>
<p>Although &#8212; in a response to the research &#8212; the tech giant denied it is using the tracking data it&#8217;s still linking to teens&#8217; accounts to &#8220;personalize&#8221; ads to under 18s<i>. </i>It didn&#8217;t explain why it&#8217;s still collecting it, however.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OMSAezqvwY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">Instagram to default young teens to private accounts, restrict ads and unwanted adult contact</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Instagram to default young teens to private accounts, restrict ads and unwanted adult contact&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/embed/#?secret=OMSAezqvwY" data-secret="OMSAezqvwY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>An international coalition of public health and child development groups, human rights organizations and privacy campaigners has made the accusation, writing to Facebook/Meta flagging the findings of the research it commissioned and calling for the tech giant to come clean on how teens are really targeted on its platforms &#8212; and <em>actually</em> commit to ending the practice &#8212; accusing it in the <a href="https://fairplayforkids.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fbsurveillanceletter.pdf">open letter</a> of misleading both the public and lawmakers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The researchers found evidence that advertising on Facebook&#8217;s platforms continues to be &#8220;optimized&#8221; for teens by algorithms; and that <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Facebook/Meta is using surreptitiously harvested information (such as from tracking pixels) about children’s online behaviour to feed its AI-driven ad targeting in order to keep lining its pockets. </span></p>
<p>Yet <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/facebook-is-changing-how-advertisers-can-reach-young-people">back in July</a> &#8212; when Facebook/Meta announced (global) changes to advertisers&#8217; ability to target under 18s (on Instagram, Facebook and Messenger) &#8212; the tech giant implied targeting would be limited to just age, gender and location, writing then that it would &#8220;only allow advertisers to target ads to people under 18 (or older in certain countries) based on their age, gender and location&#8221;; and specifying that it was removing previously available targeting options (such as &#8220;those based on interests or activity on other apps and websites&#8221;).</p>
<p>&#8220;[W]hile Facebook says it will no longer allow advertisers to selectively target teenagers, it appears Facebook itself continues to target teens, only now with the power of AI,&#8221; the coalition of advocacy groups writes in the letter. &#8220;Replacing ‘targeting selected by advertisers’ with ‘optimisation selected by a machine learning delivery system’ does not represent a demonstrable improvement for children, despite Facebook’s claims in July.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook is still using the vast amount of data it collects about young people in order to determine which children are most likely to be vulnerable to a given ad. This practice is especially concerning, given ‘optimisation’ might mean weight loss ads served to teens with emerging eating disorders or an ad being served when, for instance, a teen’s mood suggests they are particularly vulnerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>They go on to warn that if the research findings are correct, &#8220;advertising for children is in reality even more personalised on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger&#8221;.</p>
<p>The letter comes at an exceptionally awkward time for Facebook/Meta after whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked thousands of pages of internal documents to the press &#8212; leading to high profile reporting flagging <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">internal discussions of Instagram&#8217;s toxicity for teens</a>, among other excoriating issues.</p>
<p>Haugen has since spent hours giving <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">in person evidence to lawmakers</a> on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-raises-trust-and-security-questions-over-its-e2e-encryption/">both sides of the Atlantic</a> &#8212; including<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-european-parliament/"> to the European Parliament</a> where the EU is in the process of finalizing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">two packages of sweeping digital regulation</a> that will dial up transparency and governance requirements on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram; and apply ex ante rules to the biggest tech giants like Meta.</p>
<p>In recent months, a number of MEPs have been pushing to amend the EU&#8217;s draft legislation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/">to include an outright ban on surveillance advertising</a> &#8212; in favor of privacy-safe alternatives like contextual ads. And the coalition&#8217;s letter and research looks likely to build further support for such a move.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="eEUmwGjVma"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-european-parliament/">Europe&#8217;s digital rules reboot could tame Facebook, whistleblower Frances Haugen tells EU Parliament</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s digital rules reboot could tame Facebook, whistleblower Frances Haugen tells EU Parliament&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-european-parliament/embed/#?secret=eEUmwGjVma" data-secret="eEUmwGjVma" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The international coalition denouncing Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;misleading&#8221; double-dealing is also calling for a partial end to &#8220;creepy surveillance ads&#8221; &#8212; at least for advertising that&#8217;s targeted at young people.</p>
<p>Signatories to the letter include a wide range of civil society advocacy groups, from Amnesty International USA to Fair Vote, UK, Friends of the Earth, Center for Digital Democracy, National Center on Sexual Exploitation, Parent Coalition for Student Privacy, Privacy International, Stop Predatory Gambling and the Campaign for Gambling-Free Kids, Tech Transparency Project and many more.</p>
<p>In the letter, they write that their suspicions over Facebook&#8217;s ongoing ad targeting of teens were raised by evidence given by Haugen &#8212; citing testimony last month, in front of the US Senate, when she said: “I’m very suspicious that personalised ads are still not being delivered to teenagers on Instagram, because the algorithms learn correlations. They learn interactions where your party ad may still go to kids interested in partying, because Facebook almost certainly has a ranking model in the background that says this person wants more party-related content”.</p>
<p>For the report, the researchers analyzed whether Facebook continues to track children&#8217;s browsing data and other online activity for ad purposes &#8212; looking at Conversion APIs, such as Facebook Pixel and app SPK (which their report notes are &#8220;used exclusively to gather information for advertising purposes&#8221;) &#8212; and finding Facebook was collecting Facebook Pixel26 data from accounts registered to children.</p>
<p>Their method involved the creation of three experimental Facebook accounts &#8212; on &#8220;clean browsers&#8221; &#8212; with one registered with the age of a 13 year old and the other two for 16 year olds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our test account browsed a number of webpages containing an embedded Facebook Pixel. As the test account was logged in to Facebook, data about these visits could be identified by Facebook Pixel because of the login Cookie ‘c_user’,&#8221; they write.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using this Facebook Pixel data, Facebook can collect data from other browser tabs and pages that children open, and harvest information like which buttons they click on, which terms they search or products they purchase or put in their basket (‘conversions’)&#8230; There is no reason to store this sort of conversion data, except to fuel the ad delivery system.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This demonstrates that Facebook’s ad Delivery system is still harvesting children and teenagers data,&#8221; the researchers conclude, going on to argue that Facebook/Meta removing advertisers&#8217; ability to target kids but maintaining tracking so its AI can infer correlations for targeting does not represent any kind of improvement &#8212; nor the claimed &#8220;precautionary approach&#8221; Facebook/Meta claimed it would be taking this summer &#8212; and suggesting it may in fact be worse (not least because targeting of teens is entirely obfuscated).</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook’s ad delivery system continues to harvest teens’ data, for the sole purpose of serving them surveillance advertising, with all the associated concerns,&#8221; they add. &#8220;Replacing ‘targeting selected by advertisers’ with ‘targeting optimised by AI’ does not represent a demonstrable improvement for children in the way that Facebook characterised this in both their initial announcement and [Facebook’s global head of Safety Ms Antigone] Davis’ Senate testimony. It is, in all likelihood, worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the letter, the coalition points out that Facebook/Meta has itself acknowledged the harms of surveillance advertising for kids &#8212; hence taking the step of limiting how advertisers can reach children.</p>
<p>However if it has not actually stopped tracking and targeting kids with ads then there is no meaningful change &#8212; and this summer&#8217;s gesture looks like (yet) more misleading marketing from the company&#8217;s 24/7 crisis PR department.</p>
<p>Facebook/Meta was contacted for comment on the research and the coalition&#8217;s letter.</p>
<p>A spokesperson sent this statement &#8212; denying that the tracking data the coalition found being associated with teens&#8217; accounts is used for targeting teens with ads, even though Facebook/Meta has still received it, stored it and linked it to the user &#8212; claiming:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“It’s wrong to say that because we show data in our transparency tools it’s automatically used for ads. We don’t use data from our advertisers&#8217; and partners&#8217; websites and apps to personalize ads to people under 18. The reason this information shows up in our transparency tools is because teens visit sites or apps that use our business tools. We want to provide transparency into the data we receive, even if it&#8217;s not used for ads personalization.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>In her evidence to lawmakers in recent weeks, Haugen has repeatedly suggested there may be no such thing as safe &#8216;AI-driven&#8217; social media for young teens, given pressures faced by children whose brains are still developing &#8212; warning that Facebook&#8217;s algorithms are profiting by exploiting the mental health of vulnerable teens.</p>
<p>In a section of the Fairplay report on surveillance advertising and children, the researchers also warn that surveillance advertising intensifies the manipulation of children through what they describe as &#8220;a huge asymmetry of ability and information&#8221;.</p>
<p>They go on to cite what they describe as &#8220;emerging evidence&#8221; that children and young people resent being targeted by surveillance advertising &#8212; pointing to a recent Australian poll finding that 82% of 16 &amp; 17 year olds have &#8220;come across ads that are so targeted they felt uncomfortable&#8221;.</p>
<p>The report also notes other findings, such as that a majority (65%) of Australian parents reported being &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; with businesses targeting ads to children based on info they have obtained by tracking a child online; and an overwhelming majority (88%) of US parents believe “the practice of tracking and targeting kids and teens with ads based on their behavioral profiles” should be prohibited&#8221;.</p>
<p>With an excoriating global glare of attention on the workings of its ad tools, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/facebook-will-no-longer-allow-advertisers-to-target-political-beliefs-religion-sexual-orientation/">announced</a> another change earlier this month &#8212; saying it would no longer allow advertisers to target political beliefs, religion and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>However it did not say it would stop tracking users&#8217; online activity and feeding that data to its ad-targeting algorithms &#8212; meaning its AIs will be able to identify proxies that can be used to carry on that kind of sensitive targeting, just in a less transparent fashion. Facebook was also very keen to reassure advertisers that they could still use alternative tools it offers for granular targeting of users &#8212; such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1090330204367211?id=2469097953376494&amp;helpref=search&amp;sr=1&amp;query=ENGAGEMENT%20CUSTOM%20AUDIENCES">engagement custom audiences</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=401668390442328&amp;helpref=search&amp;sr=4&amp;query=lookalike%20audiences">lookalike audiences</a>.</p>
<p>So Meta&#8217;s internal &#8216;reforms&#8217; look intended to maintain its ad empire&#8217;s intrusive (and lucrative) targeting capabilities &#8212; while shielding its business from accusations of exploitation, manipulation and intrinsic data-fuelled harm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://justt.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Tel Aviv-based chargeback mitigation startup, is emerging out of stealth today with $70 million in total funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in February 2020 by Roenen Ben-Ami and Ofir Tahor, Justt says it fully automates chargeback disputes on behalf of online merchants. The startup recently raised $50 million a Series B round of funding led by Greenwich, Conn.-based Oak HC/FT. That built up on previous rounds, including a $15 million raise led by Zeev Ventures in February and a $5 million raise led by F2 Venture Capital in November 2020. Strategic individual investors in Justt include David Marcus, former PayPal president; Jacqueline Reses, former head of Square Capital; and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gokul Rajaram</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a DoorDash executive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justt, which was previously known as AcroCharge, says its annual recurring revenue (ARR) is up 900% over September of 2020. Its headcount has climbed to over 110 employees, up from 3 a year ago. The company declined to reveal at what valuation its Series B was raised.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234601" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the unacquainted, chargebacks are defined as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">demands by a credit card provider for a retailer to make good the loss on a fraudulent or disputed transaction. Just aims to help merchants globally fight false chargebacks with the artificial intelligence it has developed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">False chargebacks, also known as “friendly fraud,” occur when shoppers incorrectly dispute charges to their credit/debit card, resulting in their financial institution canceling their payments and merchants losing money. Justt’s AI-powered technology is designed to flag incorrect chargebacks, which typically represent at least 85% of disputes and result in over $125 billion in annual losses, the company says. It builds a system tailored to each merchant that integrates with their card processors, gathers evidence refuting illegitimate chargeback claims and submits the information to credit card companies on their behalf. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, it aims to replace in-house mitigation programs for companies, which are mostly large enterprises such as fintech unicorn Melio and Wyre, a blockchain-based payment company. It handles over 10,000 chargebacks per month for some of its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The chargeback system is fundamentally unjust, but many merchants view their losses as simply the cost of doing business. At Justt, we believe there’s a better way, and that  e-commerce sellers need someone in their corner as they navigate this archaic system,” said CEO and co-founder Tahor. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2234608" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234608" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2234608 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Justt-product-screeshot-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="467" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Justt-product-screeshot-1.jpg 813w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Justt-product-screeshot-1.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Justt-product-screeshot-1.jpg?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Justt-product-screeshot-1.jpg?resize=768,527 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Justt-product-screeshot-1.jpg?resize=680,467 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Justt-product-screeshot-1.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234608" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Justt</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive believes that Justt is different from other companies in the space such as Chargehound, Chargeback.com and Midigator, in that those companies offer tech tools “but still require customers to maintain an in-house team with the relevant expertise to create templates and gather evidence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These systems are dependent on customers’ teams to drive optimization and success rate improvements &#8212; they don’t offer a full-service solution like Justt,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other competitors, he claimed, do offer a full-service offering, but manage evidence creation manually using offshore teams to help customers handle chargebacks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The lack of a tech element means offshore teams rely on generic templates, leading to poor performance,” Tahor said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justt, he says, is different in that its research teams analyze merchants’ checkout processes, terms &amp; conditions, confirmation emails, chargeback reason codes, among other things, to offer a more customized service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup&#8217;s business model is designed to minimize risk for potential customers. It won’t charge them anything unless their funds are recovered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our business model is based entirely on success. We don&#8217;t have any integration fees or per-case fees; we only succeed, and only charge a fee, if our merchants succeed and realize real-world savings due to reduced transaction fraud,” Tahor told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justt was founded during the pandemic, which led to a boom in online transactions and related surge of fraudulent chargeback activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since then, the demand for our solution has skyrocketed, driven both by the general growth of online businesses and transactions, and specific pressures such as economic pressures, supply-chain issues, delivery delays that are fueling an increase in fraudulent transaction reversals,” Tahor said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to invest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">heavily” in product development, sales and marketing, including expanding its sales and marketing operations overseas to the U.S. and Europe. It also expects to triple the size of its Israel-based R&amp;D workforce in 2022.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this funding, we’re planning to expand into the North America market aggressively, including setting up our U.S. headquarters in New York City and preparing for our West Coast office opening,” Tahor said. “We will also invest in serving the European region in accordance with market opportunities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justt helps re-capture 60% to 80% lost from illegitimate chargebacks that occur post-transaction, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Streisfeld, partner at Oak HC/FT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He notes that while the e-commerce boom is increasing the risk to businesses from illegitimate chargebacks, few brands have systems in place to identify, track, dispute or recover lost revenue from illegitimate chargebacks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most simply write off these losses – an unsustainable and expensive approach, and one that leaves Justt positioned for record adoption in the next 5 years as merchants seek new ways forward,” Streisfeld wrote via e-mail.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clutch wants to be Canada&#8217;s largest online used car buying platform. The company, which was founded in 2016, just closed out a $80 million (CAD $100 million) Series B round that it will use to grow its team, expand its logistical capabilities and scale its inventory as it prepares to move into new Canadian markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be servicing 90% of Canadians by the end of 2023,&#8221; Dan Park, CEO of Clutch, told TechCrunch. &#8220;And that involves launching in a few more key cities across Canada. Cities like Montreal or Winnipeg are some of the larger cities in Canada which we will eventually go to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clutch is among a small handful of online car dealers to hit the market in recent years, each one of them with a regional focus. Carvana and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/06/online-used-car-startup-vroom-raises-254m-to-scale-product-and-engineering-hub/">Vroom</a> are the biggest players in the U.S., <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/uks-cazoo-will-list-on-the-nyse-by-way-of-a-spac-valuing-it-at-7b-and-raising-1-6b/">Cazoo</a> is crushing it in the UK and Kavak in Mexico, to name a few. Clutch is headquartered in Toronto and services Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario and Prince Edward Island, but plans to expand next year. By focusing its attention on the Canadian market, rather than on international expansion, the company is hoping to tee up a multi-billion dollar opportunity ahead of competitors like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/canada-drives-raises-79-4-million-to-expand-online-car-purchasing-and-delivery-platform/">Canada Drives</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234602" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Clutch has sold thousands of used vehicles on its site, and currently has about 1,250 more in stock, according to Park. It has used past debt financing to support the acquisition of vehicles, which it sources from auctions, private sellers and fleets before it puts them through a rigorous 210-point reconditioning process during which Clutch mechanics ensure safety and good looks of the vehicle. The fresh car is then delivered directly to the end consumer on a flatbed in a way that Park says feels &#8220;as magical as possible – click a button and have a car show up in your driveway!&#8221;</p>
<p>This most recent financing round –<span style="font-weight: 400;"> which was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">led by D1 Capital Partners with participation from Flight Deck Capital, Canaan Partners, Upper90, Real Ventures, GFC, BrandProject and FJ Labs –</span> will not only help Clutch grow its team from about 160 employees to over 250 over the course of next year, but also to build out the infrastructure and logistics network needed to scale. Clutch has a series of warehouses throughout Canada that it uses to store vehicles until they&#8217;re ready to be delivered, often as soon as next day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building inventory and building a selection of vehicles that is wide and diverse is a massive focus for next year,&#8221; said Park. &#8220;We know that as much as you might be a fan of Clutch, if you&#8217;re really looking for that blue Subaru Outback with 50,000 kilometres on it and newer than 2018, and we don&#8217;t have that model in stock, the chances of you buying from Clutch are pretty low. We want to cater to as many Canadians as possible. And so building that inventory and building that selection is a big focus and indirect of use of proceeds as we think about next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>E-commerce is only one part of Clutch&#8217;s business model. About half its revenue also comes from its FinTech offerings  like warranty, insurance and financing, says Park.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do here is really provide this streamlined experience and historically there hasn&#8217;t been a lot of vertical integration on that side either,&#8221; said Park. &#8220;If you can deliver not only a great car buying experience, you can offer this amazing ownership experience as well, which includes providing these financial products that you know can help the consumer, in some cases, rebuild credit, but also provide them with a better ownership experience from the vehicle.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>As Clutch begins to scale, it hopes to see improved unit economics. The most expensive parts of the business involve acquiring the vehicles themselves, as well as the logistics of getting a vehicle through the production process. Scaling further across Canada would help the company get efficiency on buying parts, delivery truck usage, lift utilization and other costs that can one day be amortized over more units.</p>
<p>Because Clutch is a used car marketplace, only a small fraction of its inventory are electric vehicles, but Park sees that changing in the coming years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that our model is better suited to EVs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;EVs generally require less reconditioning. There&#8217;s 2,000 moving parts in a gas powered vehicle and there&#8217;s 200 in an electric vehicle and so naturally, this requires less maintenance.&#8221;</p>
<p>While many traditional dealerships rely heavily on parts and services to gain a key profit margin, that&#8217;s not where Clutch makes its money. Margins aside, when Clutch sells an ICE vehicle, Park did mention that the company, bless its heart, donates three trees to whatever area that car is being sent. Today, Clutch has planted nearly 8,000 trees, says Park.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mensa Brands, an Indian startup that acquires direct-to-consumer brands and helps them scale within the home market and overseas, has become a unicorn just six months after launching its business.</p>
<p>Falcon Edge Capital led Mensa Brands’ $135 million Series B financing round that values the Indian startup at over $1 billion, the two said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Prosus Ventures, as well as all existing investors including Tiger Global, Norwest Venture Partners, and Accel also participated in the new round, pushing Mensa’s all-time raise to over $300 million in equity and debt.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234638" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="http://mensabrands.com">Mensa Brands</a> &#8212; founded by Ananth Narayanan, who previously served as the chief executive of fashion e-commerce giant Myntra that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/22/flipkart-myntra-acqusition/">eventually scooped by Flipkart</a> &#8212; operates in the same space as Thrasio, the Boston-based startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/thrasio-the-amazon-aggregator-raises-1b-in-fresh-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-10-billion/">widely credited with the success of this model.</a></p>
<p>But Narayanan believes that what Mensa is attempting to do is different. Mensa, which means constellation in Greek, is attempting to build a new age consumer brand similar to the Indian conglomerate Unilever or Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, he said.</p>
<p>“Brands today are getting built very differently. The distribution has completely been democratized. I think you can do brand building very differently and interestingly with a lot more virality and personalization,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2234641" style="width: 464px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234641" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2234641 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ananth2.jpg?w=454" alt="" width="454" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ananth2.jpg 1281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ananth2.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ananth2.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ananth2.jpg?resize=768,1151 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ananth2.jpg?resize=454,680 454w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ananth2.jpg?resize=1025,1536 1025w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ananth2.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234641" class="wp-caption-text">Ananth Narayanan founded Mensa Brands. The startup has become the fastest Indian firm to become a unicorn. (Image credits: Mensa Brands)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mensa Brands currently houses 12 brands, 80% of which are run by women, said Narayanan. The startup operates in three categories &#8212; apparel, beauty and personal care, and home. “In all of these categories, we are not trying to build a brand for India, but a brand for the globe,” he said, adding that 30% of the startup’s revenue already comes from overseas markets.</p>
<p>The startup buys a majority stake in each brand it partners with with plans to acquire fully acquire them in five years. All of these brands are profitable and their founding team joins Mensa Brands to work with the larger firm, said Narayanan. Mensa itself is also profitable, he said.</p>
<p>Mensa helps these brands organize and optimize their inventories across all popular marketplaces and their official websites. On the demand side, the startup performs &#8220;tech-led marketing,&#8221; and also optimizes the prices of products, he said. &#8220;We also do a lot of tech-led product developments such as identifying the products consumers are looking for, and help the brands launch new line of products,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Villain, a leading men’s fragrance and accessories brand that is part of Mensa now, grew by over 250% in October, the startup said. Another partner brand, Karagiri, a high-end designer sarees brand grew by 140% last month, it said. Narayanan said the vast majority of brands Mensa has acquired so far have grown by over 100%.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to continue backing Ananth Narayanan as he executes a best-in-class playbook of brand aggregation and acceleration focused on Indian and global e-commerce brands,&#8221; said Navroz Udwadia, co-founder and partner at Falcon Edge Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mensa demonstrates a tangible uplift through a combination of product and pricing optimization, technology-led process improvement, distribution and marketing augmentation and fine-tuning the supply chain. These levers meaningfully accelerate the growth and margin trajectory of the brands and make them well-poised to become category leaders. We believe Mensa is well on track to cement its reputation as the partner of choice for well-performing e-commerce brands.”</p>
<p>Mensa plans to partner with as many as 30 additional brands in the next one year, said Narayanan.</p>
<p>Scores of entrepreneurs are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/india-globalbees-raises-150-million-to-build-thrasio-like-house-of-brands/">attempting to find better e-commerce models</a> across the globe. Many investors believe that Amazons and Flipkarts of the world have laid the railroads for digital commerce, but smarter and more profitable businesses can be built atop of them. Other startups operating in the space in India include Global Bees, EvenFlow Brands, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/10club-raises-40-million-seed-funding-to-replicate-thrasio-model-in-india/">10club</a>, Powerhouse91 and Goat Brands Labs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to support Mensa Brands in their journey to build digital-first global brands from India. Their team brings superior execution focus and technology chops to help emerging brands scale digitally. This is an incredible time for made-in-India businesses, and we look forward to helping to fuel their future success,&#8221; said Ashutosh Sharma, Head of Investments for Prosus Ventures in India, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shared transportation in Nigeria, Africa’s largest country by population, is a thriving business, at least when done the conventional way: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With millions of Nigerians using <a href="https://www.pulse.ng/lifestyle/food-travel/what-mini-buses-are-called-in-every-african-country/t0e8r6d"><em>danfo</em> minibuses</a> and <a href="https://tourismobserver.blogspot.com/2017/08/boda-boda-or-okada.html"><em>okadas</em> </a>to commute to their various workplaces and destinations, mobility startups have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/africas-ride-hail-markets-are-hot-spots-for-startups-and-vc/">sought to digitize the market</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most have found little luck, especially those in the two-wheeler mobility space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most mobility tech in the country </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is centred</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around two-wheelers and car-hailing, there’s been hardly any deliberate disruption in the bus-sharing and mass transit space.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234465" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.shuttlers.ng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shuttlers</a>, a “tech-enabled scheduled bus sharing” company, is itching to change that. After years of bootstrapping, the company has raised $1.6 million in seed funding from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors to blitz scale within and outside Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago and Africa-focused investment firm VestedWorld led the round. Fintech unicorn Interswitch, Africa-focused VCs Rising Tide Africa, Launch Africa, EchoVC, Consonance Investment, CcHub Syndicate, CMC 21 &amp; Alsa, ShEquity, Five35, Sakore and Nikky Taurus also participated in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/damilola-olokesusi-37638035">Damilola Olokesusi</a> founded Shuttlers in 2016 to address the issue of inefficient transportation costs in Nigeria’s most renowned urban city, Lagos. Via its ridesharing platform, Shuttlers provides companies with better mobility options for their employees.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when Shuttlers launched in 2017, it did not have a functional mobile application. Instead, the company ran an unconventional online model using Slack, email and WhatsApp to communicate with its customers.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, that was enough to onboard its first set of business clients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech talent unicorn <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/softbank-sinks-200m-into-andela-propels-company-into-unicorn-territory/amp/">Andela</a> was Shuttlers’ first B2B2C client, Olokesusi told TechCrunch over a call</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B2B2C plan is one of three main offerings Shuttlers providers; here, companies split payment of transport fares with their employees whichever way they see fit. The others include B2B, where business clients pay the complete fares of their employees and B2C, where individual customers pay fares themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our mission is to transform the way people commute </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">around the world by building a global partner network and connecting communities of shuttlers like we are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">presently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doing in Lagos, Nigeria,” Olokesusi said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a revamp in 2019, Shuttlers now offers a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> functional app that allows mobile professionals on its three plans to book rides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the platform, commuters can book a seat on one of the buses that goes along predetermined and scheduled routes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, commuters pay 80% less when using its service instead of other ride-hailing services “without surges and peak-period pricing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of its other features include live bus tracking, optimal routing based on traffic and digital payments, the company said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also has a subscription feature where commuters can schedule rides in advance over a period of time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite raising </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <span class="LrzXr kno-fv wHYlTd z8gr9e">₦</span>3 million (~$6,000) from friends and family and grants since 2016, Shuttlers’ growth has been staggering</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company claims to have over 10,000 users across its mobile app and website users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 100 unbranded and branded buses are on its platform, ploughing over 30 routes in Lagos with over 300 bus stops. In total, they have recorded more than 2 million trips since the company’s inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olokesusi added that her company sells more than 6,000 bus tickets daily, which means over 3,000 people take two-way trips each day</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having done this much with so little, why is the company raising a seed round now? For one, it seems the company wants to go head-to-head with VC-backed competition; its funding is coming at a time when newer entrants are gaining ground across the country, most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">notably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Toronto and Lagos-based Plentywaka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Techstars-backed company is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fueling its expansion across Nigeria and Ghana having raised more than $1.5 million in funding, money also used to acquire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/mobility-startup-plentywaka-picks-up-1-5m-seed-acquires-ghanas-stabus/">a similar player</a> in Ghana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Olokesusi says investors’ interest in the company was the main reason behind the company’s first venture capital intake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> looking for investors; however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is now more attention in the shared mobility industry because of companies like SWVL. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, investors are interested in this and think local mobility plays can be valuable solutions,” Olokesusi said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made the right decision for the company at this particular right time so we can get ready for the opportunity that happens after</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we are ready to take over the African market, starting with Nigeria and West African markets in the next couple of months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has begun operations in Nigeria’s capital city Abuja, but Olokesusi doesn’t say which other cities within and outside Nigeria Shuttlers will expand to next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a similar train of thought, Nneka Eze, the managing director at lead investor VestedWorld, said her firm believes the “investment will help Shuttlers extend its offering </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to adjacent markets and help solve inefficiencies in the transportation sector across regions in Africa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olokesusi is one of the few female founders on the continent to have raised a significant round from VCs this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But her journey to Shuttlers was accidental, as she tells me how working in an oil and gas firm took the front seat of where she wanted to work after studying chemical engineering at university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founder was born in Lagos but grew up in Ibadan, a neighbouring city with a less chaotic transportation system than Lagos</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Years after returning to Nigeria’s commercial city, Olokesusi would encounter the infamous and troubling method of booking bus seats in public buses (<em>danfos</em>), which she says “troubled” her, narrating her experience <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/12/21/damilola-olokesusi-shuttlers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this interview</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were fewer issues of people running after buses in Ibadan. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Lagos, I remember when I was walking to a bus stop for the first time, I was actually shocked how people were running very fast to get seats</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That was my first interaction using danfo buses in Lagos, but like everyone, I got used to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO said she attended some tech conferences and meetups that opened her mind to the possibilities of starting a tech company to solve problems around her. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it wasn’t until her internship and her first place of work following graduation that the idea for Shuttlers started to take shape</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She experienced two contrasts in both workplaces. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her first employer had buses to transport Olokesusi and her colleagues from home to work and vice versa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Meanwhile, at the second, she made use of danfos once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What broke the camels back was my first time leaving the country in 2014, experiencing what it meant to live in a city with smart transportation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By the time I came back to Nigeria, I didn’t want to go back to using public transportation,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon her return, Olokesusi recreated the staff bus model. She felt the model could replace <em>danfos</em> and personal cars &#8212; the first-choice options professionals use to get to work. With Shuttlers, she also wanted to democratize the model and make it accessible to other users whose companies might not afford such services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five years in, Shuttlers is not only profitable while raising money and making expansion plans; it is also concerned about fostering its environmental impact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter is evident in a recent survey Shuttlers recently conducted where almost 30% of its daily commuters own cars. In essence, the company, in its little way, is reducing the amount of carbon dioxide that those commuters would have otherwise emitted if they used their cars daily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every single time that our buses are on the road, we are reducing the number of cars on the road. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are also optimizing routes and reducing the number of buses and emissions on the road,” said the founder and CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “As we proceed, we’ll be very intentional in recording and calculating how much gas emissions we’re reducing per route and daily, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">maybe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also release reports on how we’re impacting the environment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">positively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

<p>Vietnam’s digital economy is one of the fastest growing in the world, but the country is facing a <a href="https://vietnamnet.vn/en/business/vietnam-faces-it-workforce-shortage-789733.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing shortage of IT workers</a>. Many kids want to study coding, but school curriculums are limited, said Tung Nguyen, the co-founder of <a href="https://mindx.edu.vn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MindX</a>, an online/offline education platform that focuses on preparing students for tech careers.</p>
<p>The company announced today that it has raised a $3 million Series A, led by Wavemaker Partners, Vietnamese investment bank Thien Viet Securities and an undisclosed United States-based investor. MindX also received debt funding from Beacon Fund, an investment firm that focuses on companies founded by women.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234618" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The funding will be used to expand MindX’s online platform, create more educational content and expand into Vietnamese Tier 2 and 3 cities and rural provinces. MindX plans to build its network of tech companies that offer jobs to students who complete its courses. The startup&#8217;s courses are focused on kids ranging from kindergarten to grade 12, and university students, too. It says alumni have gone on to work as software engineers at companies like Google, Amazon and Shopee.</p>
<p>For students who enter MindX with the goal of becoming tech professionals, the startup plans to began offering an income share agreement, where students only pay tuition after securing a job, eliminating the need for upfront payments.</p>
<p>“One concern for parents with low-income levels is that they want their kids to have a guaranteed job placement, but they don’t want to run out of money for tuition,” said Tung. “They asked for financing solutions and we plan to implement the income sharing model by the end of this year for our students.” One example will be a program geared toward students who already have one or two years of experience working at software companies in Vietnam. The course will prepare them to find a higher-paying job in Singapore and allow them to pay back tuition after they start working.</p>

<p>MindX was created as a non-profit in 2015 by Tung Nguyen and Ha Nguyen. At the time, both were working at tech companies, and taught part-time coding classes in between their jobs, supplying learning spaces and laptops for their students. After a year, demand increased to the point where the two decided to commit to MindX full time as a company.</p>
<p>MindX now has 13 offline locations in Vietnam, in addition to its online education platform, and claims it has been profitable for the last six years, even during COVID-19. In fact, MindX’s founders say that as of September 2021, MindX had seen a 1,000% year-on-year growth in online enrollment.</p>
<p>MindX partners with 200 tech companies in Vietnam, Singapore, Japan and other countries to help find jobs for its students after they complete training, and says its hiring rates for graduates is 100% in Vietnam and 55% in Singapore. Some of the companies also serve as educational partners. For example, they give MindX’s students chances to create tech products or live projects with them.</p>
<p>For both Tung Nguyen and Ha Nguyen, starting MindX was a personal mission. “We didn’t have opportunities to study technology early in our lives,” said Tung. “For example, I was born in a poor working family, in a remote province in Vietnam. Computers were very, very expensive, they cost a fortune for most Vietnamese families at that time, so of course my family could not afford one for me.”</p>
<p>Tung was the first person in his extended family to go to college, but dropped out after one year “because I didn’t find any passion in the university’s curriculum and didn’t see my future in it.” Instead, he spent two and a half years studying coding on his own. “I think the experience of learning software engineering and coding transformed my life, because it opened a lot of opportunities for me,” including a software engineering position at a tech company in Hamburg, Germany.</p>
<p>While there, Tung met many European colleagues who were about the same age as him, but had started coding much earlier, when they were in primary school. “I really realized that for myself, and other young students in Vietnam, if we had the same opportunity to study software engineering, we might have far better futures and far more opportunities to compete and participate in the global job market.”</p>
<p>MindX’s founders say that many STEM education centers in Vietnam only offer 3 to 4 month courses. On the other hand, MindX’s options range from one year to a decade, depending on students’ ages, levels and goals. Most parents and students initially chose shorter courses, but MindX has recently seen more students start with 2, 5 or 6 year programs, to prepare for a tech career. Students are organized into cohorts and work closely with teachers.</p>
<p>After they finish their courses, MindX’s career consultants help students build CVs and prepare for job interviews. Part of MindX’s new funding will be used to apply blockchain technology to keep track of the relationships between MindX alumni and the companies that hire them so the application and interviewing process can be automated.</p>
<p>In statement about investment, Wavemaker general partner Gavin Lee said, “We’re excited to back the MindX team with their vision to revolutionize Vietnam’s tech education landscape and unlock career opportunities for 20 million K-12 and university students. MindX is addressing a clear need, given the worsening shortage of software engineers in Vietnam.”</p>

<p>One of those founders, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo, led the creation of Tesla’s Energy Storage group, and at an<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/145636603@N06/albums/72157720136032014"> event</a> last week, Jaramillo talked with former TechCrunch reporter and current CNBC correspondent Lora Kolodny about why the company has been operating in a kind of stealth mode. He shared more of how Form&#8217;s operations work. He also reflected on the more than seven years he spent at Tesla, working for Elon Musk, a period that we gather was, um, intense.</p>
<p>You can watch the entire interview below. In the meantime, following are excerpts from that conversation, edited for length.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234103" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>On why we&#8217;re seeing a renewable energy wave right now, with many companies aside from Form garnering attention and investment dollars:</strong></p>
<p>The cheapest available source of electricity in the world today comes from a renewable resource, and that&#8217;s either solar or wind, depending on which region you&#8217;re in. But if you&#8217;re looking for the marginally cheapest cost of electricity, it is going to be renewable today. And of course, the thing about renewable energy is that it&#8217;s driven by weather, and weather in only predictable to a certain degree, and it&#8217;s intermittent. That means that in order to enable a fully renewable decarbonized grid, we need to be able to store intermittent sources of energy over all the relevant timescales.</p>
<p>Yes, the sun does go down every night and very helpfully comes back every morning &#8212; so  that&#8217;s one gap that we have to bridge. But then we start to think about gaps associated with seasons or with longer-period weather patterns, and because renewable electricity has made such huge gains in the last 15 to 20 years, we&#8217;re now at penetration levels where we do have to think very hard about the last 30% or 40% of the electric system and exactly how we&#8217;re going to provide a level of reliability and cost using a renewable or generator like what we have.</p>

<p><strong>Jaramillo also addressed why iron-air technology, which is what Form relies on and that was first investigated nearly 50 years by federal agencies (and never commercialized), suddenly makes sense as a way to store energy:</strong></p>
<p>First of all, the technology that&#8217;s most deployed is pumped hydro. That&#8217;s by far the most amount of energy storage that we have out there in the world today. But the technology that is quickly coming up on that is, of course, lithium ion. Right now, at this event, I&#8217;m guessing everybody here has five lithium ion batteries on their person right now, just as an example of how prevalent that chemistry is. . . .</p>
<p>However, as we start to get to these deeper penetrations of renewable energies, we need something that&#8217;s a bit different from what lithium ion can do. If we&#8217;re going to have an electric system that is not only 100% renewables driven &#8212; by wind, water and solar &#8212; then we do need to think about these periods of intermittence that are longer than just a few hours at a time. And that means it also has to be a lot cheaper than what lithium ion can do . . .</p>
<p>Iron [meanwhile] is a phenomenally abundant metal substance. It&#8217;s the most mined metal on Earth. Humans know a lot about it. We had a whole age named after it because we were playing with it so much. And we figured out a lot about it. And we still use it, of course as the main input for steel production today. It&#8217;s also very cheap. It&#8217;s abundant on every continent . . .and it&#8217;s one of the largest scale industries in the world. And you&#8217;re right that it&#8217;s not a new chemistry. Form Energy did not invent iron air as a chemistry. What we did do, however, is take a chemistry that was sort of first studied by two national labs . . .and we pulled it 50 years into the future, and we applied modern techniques and modern methodologies, modern knowledge of electro chemistry, of corrosion, of metallurgy, and brought that performance from 40 to 50 years ago where it was initially to where it can be today. And that means that we are now working on devices that truly are 1/10th the cost of what lithium ion in the future could be. [That means] we really can enable this deeply decarbonized, highly renewable, affordable, reliable electric grid.</p>
<p>What does that mean &#8212; an iron air battery? It means very simply that we are rusting and unrusting iron, electrochemically. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s a very reversible process, but you have to be really good at exactly how you do that.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mcXdJJ_4hwY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Jaramillo also addressed why the company has been secretive about the efficiency of its systems (&#8220;If we&#8217;ve been secret, it&#8217;s only because we&#8217;re trying to avoid unnecessary hype around what we&#8217;re doing&#8221;). </strong></p>
<p><strong>He talked more precisely about how the whole thing works. If you&#8217;re curious, we suggest tuning in around the 10-minute mark to hear how Form is making use of &#8220;higher purity,&#8221; blueberry-size iron pellets that are now mass produced by the steel industry to the tune of 100 million tons per year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kolodny also asked what he learned at Tesla that he is trying to duplicate at Form Energy &#8212; and what he learned from his career with the automaker that he doesn&#8217;t want to repeat:</strong></p>
<p>I was a Tesla about seven and a half years. I started in 2009 and left in at the end of 2016. And Tesla is a lesson factory. You could say it makes cars, but really what it does is provide lessons to people. It was a wonderful place to be during that arc. When I joined, we were a couple hundred people and by the time I left, we were 30,000 or  40,000 employees, something like that.</p>
<p>I left because at the time, we had already launched the Tesla energy effort &#8212; the Powerwall and the Powerpack. I&#8217;m married. My wife and I have three kids. I would like to stay married and be a part of my kids lives, and seven and a half years in the circle with Elon was enough for me. I also very intentionally wanted to leave on good terms with Elon, and things were sort of in a good place, so that was it for me.</p>

<p>I left with no regrets but I take away a lot. I take away that there&#8217;s nothing more important than the people you work with, and the quality of those people. They have to be passionately committed in every possible way to the mission of what you&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p>The other part of the lesson is, sometimes you have to protect people from themselves. It can tip over, right? Every virtue, if driven too far, becomes a vice. And so it&#8217;s really important to also acknowledge that there can and should be limits around what you ask of people when they are that committed and when they are that passionate about the mission of the company. So hopefully, what we&#8217;ve done at Form Energy &#8212; and we&#8217;re now about 200 people &#8212; is create a culture where we are all extremely passionate and devoted and mission-oriented, and we also are able to sustain things like a family life. And those two things are not in opposition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A brand new social media platform focusing on social responsibility today announced it snagged $1.2 million to change the face of fundraising from a Gen Z perspective. <a href="https://wishlyapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wishly</a> is aimed at the curious Venn-diagram intersection of consumer brands, philanthropists and nonprofit organizations. The hope is to leverage the power of social media for social good.</p>
<p>The app was created by a couple of experienced social impact marketers, nonprofit fundraisers and administrators, Joanne Gonzalez-Forster and Justine Makoff. They saw a need for a social platform that embraced the optimism and altruism of the Gen Z generation, and to help people band together to bring about real, positive change in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;In early 2020 when support for COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter were exploding, we saw our kids and their friends using social media to inspire their followers to take action and give to the causes they care about,&#8221; said Joanne Gonzalez-Forster, co-founder and CEO. &#8220;There wasn’t an easy way for them to find and vet nonprofits, make small donations and inspire their friends to get involved.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234515" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company was able to drum up an impressive assortment of angel investors, including now-retired founding partner of Pelion Venture Partners Jim Dreyfous and social impact investor Joshua Mailman. The duo invested into a $400,000 pre-seed round in 2020, and came back with additional investors to invest in the company&#8217;s current seed round of $800,000.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re so excited to see what Gen Z and our young millennial kids are gonna do with it. There are so many opportunities and there&#8217;s so much to be done in the world. There are natural disasters every other day. There are so many social movements. We built Wishly for them &#8212; for young adults today &#8212; so that they can make a positive impact in the world with small actions,&#8221; said Gonzalez-Forster. &#8220;When you Google <em>philanthropist</em>, you see pictures of Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett, but you don&#8217;t see young faces. We want to change that. We want to see young faces of all different colors and shapes and sizes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s business model is simple: it retains 5% of all the funds raised on the platform. Wishly also makes sure to vet every nonprofit that is featured on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually pulled a list of every registered 501c3 organization from the IRS, so they are all already on our platform, and we can accept donations for them. Once a nonprofit goes on the app to claim its profile, that&#8217;s our cue to vet them,&#8221; says Gonzalez-Forster. &#8220;We use the IRS search tool to make sure they are in good standing with the IRS, which would mean that it has filed its taxes three years in a row. We also check Charity Navigator and the Better Business Bureau, and we do a quick Google check to make sure that there&#8217;s no scams or lawsuits or misleading information about the nonprofit. There are a lot of bad charities out there.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The app is available now on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1562148566" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wishly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>, although the team suggests that the product is mostly in a friends-and-family stage until a more public launch, which is coming up soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week, a handful of academic researcher teams will gain access to a new tool from Facebook designed to aggregate near-universal real-time data on the world’s biggest social network.</p>
<p>When it comes to who gets access to Facebook data and how, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">company now known as Meta</a> is still feeling reverberations from 2018’s Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a political consulting firm harvested the personal data of millions of unaware Facebook users to build detailed profiles on potential voters. The company shut down thousands of APIs in the three years that followed and is only now beginning to restore broad access for academic research.</p>
<p>TechCrunch previewed Facebook&#8217;s new academic research API and spoke with Facebook Product Manager Kiran Jagadeesh, who spearheaded the project with the <a href="https://research.fb.com/data/">Facebook Open Research &amp; Transparency (FORT)</a> team.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234505" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="eTtsWbh9Dl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-to-launch-a-researcher-api-for-the-academic-community/">Facebook to launch a &#8216;Researcher API&#8217; for the academic community</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook to launch a &#8216;Researcher API&#8217; for the academic community&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-to-launch-a-researcher-api-for-the-academic-community/embed/#?secret=eTtsWbh9Dl" data-secret="eTtsWbh9Dl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;This is just the beginning,” Jagadeesh told TechCrunch, characterizing the Researcher API as a beta version of the toolkit it eventually hopes to offer. The API, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-to-launch-a-researcher-api-for-the-academic-community/?guccounter=1">first announced at F8 this year</a>, is Python-based and runs in JupyterLab, an open source notebook interface</p>
<p>In light of Facebook’s many past privacy woes, the new Researcher API comes with some initial caveats. First, the API will only be made available to a small group of established academic researchers through an invite-only system. The company plans to expand access beyond the initial test group in February 2022, incorporating feedback from the trial into a broader launch to all academics.</p>
<p>Another precaution: The Researcher API runs in a very controlled environment that Jagadeesh described as a “digital clean room.” Academic researchers with access to the API can enter the environment through a Facebook VPN, collect data and crunch numbers, but the raw data can’t be exported — only the analysis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea is to protect user privacy and to prevent any data analyzed from being re-identified, but the limitation might rub some of the company’s critics the wrong way considering that all of the public data the Researcher API gathers is already out there floating around but difficult to aggregate and analyze with Facebook’s existing tools.</p>
<p>At launch the API will provide access to four buckets of real-time Facebook data: pages, groups, events and posts. In each case, the tool will only pull from public data and only from sources within the U.S. and the EU initially. For groups and pages, at least one administrator will need to be located in a supported country for that data to be made available through the API.</p>
<p>Through the tool, researchers can analyze large swaths of raw text using methodologies like sentiment analysis, which tracks the valence and emotions people express through their speech on a given topic. Beyond the text-based posts that comprise most of the available data, researchers can also access related information like group and page descriptions, their creation dates as well as post reactions.</p>
<p>Multimedia data like raw images won’t be included nor will comments or user demographic data (age, gender etc.). The API also won’t collect any data from Instagram, though Jagadeesh recognizes that the platform is very valuable for researchers and the team is exploring ways to make Instagram data available.</p>
<p>The FORT team is hoping to work closely with academic researchers to develop and build out the current tools, which Jagadeesh describes as a work in progress. While Meta indicated that its initial set of academic partners isn’t yet nailed down, the company has invited researchers from 23 academic institutions around the globe to kick the tires.</p>
<p>Researchers who have completed the team’s onboarding process and agreed to its privacy policies were granted access on Monday, November 15. Facebook requires anyone accessing the research to agree to privacy constraints, including not re-identifying specific individuals within the data.</p>
<p>The research API is only available to a handful of academic institutions for now, but the FORT team plans to explore granting access to other groups, including journalists. The goal is to create a public roadmap that gives researchers and journalists a transparent look at what the team is working toward.</p>
<p>The company has plenty of trust-building to do in the research community. In August, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/facebook-ad-observatory-nyu-researchers/">cut off access</a> to advertising data for two prominent researchers affiliated with NYU’s Cybersecurity for Democracy project, prompting a rebuke from many academics and regulators. Those researchers focused on tracking misinformation and political ads through an <a href="https://adobserver.org/">opt-in browser tool called Ad Observer</a>. In September, Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/2020-election-misinformation-distortions#facebook-sent-flawed-data-to-misinformation-researchers">apologized</a> to an elite group of researchers known as Social Science One for providing them with incomplete data — a mistake that undermined months of work and analysis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) often struggle to deal with several siloed functions, such as company secretary, bookkeeping, banking, tax, payroll, employment services, insurance and more.</p>
<p>French entrepreneurs Julien Labruyere and Adrien Barthel founded <a href="https://sleek.com/sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sleek</a> in 2017 to help entrepreneurs incorporate and operate businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong. The startup built a back-end operating system platform that handles everything from incorporation, government, accounting, taxes and visas to regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>Its mission is to be the go-to platform for entrepreneurs and business owners who want to focus on building their businesses, as Sleek takes away all the back-office hassle, Barthel said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234446" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Sleek has announced today it has secured a $14 million Series A round led by White Star Capital and Jungle Ventures. It brings Sleek’s total raised to $24 million.</p>
<p>The new capital will be used to bolster technology and product development, ramp up its headcount, expand its presence in existing markets and enter new markets, including Australia and the U.K.</p>
<p>As it enters the U.K. market, Sleek has also announced the acquisition of <a href="https://www.ltd-companies.co.uk/new/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ltd Companies</a>, the U.K.-based incorporation management company that has incorporated more than 450,000 companies since its foundation in 2005. Sleek will add its stack to the existing Ltd Companies offering to build an operating system for U.K.-based SMEs.</p>
<p>Since its inception, Sleek has expanded offices beyond Singapore to Hong Kong, Australia, the U.K. and the Philippines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Corporate services &#8220;superapp&#8221; Osome lands $16M Series A&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/corporate-services-super-app-osome-lands-16m-series-a/embed/#?secret=dx3uA7Jpcw" data-secret="dx3uA7Jpcw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup doubled its client portfolio size during the pandemic; the interesting point is Sleek clients appear to be less impacted by the overall economic turmoil, Barthel told TechCrunch. It generated $10 million annual recurring revenue earlier this year, Barthel noted.</p>
<p>Sleek, which manages a portfolio of more than 5,000 companies, handled over 1.4 million bookkeeping transactions and posted approximately $700 million of revenue in 2020.</p>
<p>Sleek recently launched Sleek Business Account that simplified opening bank accounts for SMEs. It enables entrepreneurs and small business owners to open a deposit account in just a day through the Sleek app and start transacting, getting rid of the onerous paperwork requirements before opening an account. Additionally, users can view the account details on the Sleek dashboard along with the other company metrics to streamline bank reconciliation for accounting and bookkeeping purposes. The company is also planning to release products addressing remittances and card issuance.</p>
<p>“With the launch of Sleek Business Account, we have added a major brick in our product vision of building the operating system (OS) for entrepreneurs,” Barthel said.</p>
<p>Sleek also launched CFO-services at a pilot level that enables experienced CFOs access to a client’s accounting data via a business intelligence tool to provide recommendations and analysis to clients (for budgeting, strategy and fundraising).</p>
<p>&#8220;In a future where technology enables super efficiency for humans, they spend more time advising clients than doing manual work. Today our corporate secretaries advise 4-5 times more clients than a traditional player, and we are aiming to achieve 100% automation of that function so they can focus solely on providing advice to clients,&#8221; Barthel told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We believe we can be an excellent partner to Sleek and leverage our global footprint to help address a fundamental problem for all SMEs and supercharge their growth into Europe and Australia,” said Eric Martineau-Fortin, founder and managing partner at White Star Capital.</p>
<p>“Sleek addresses the deeply underserved challenge of back-office management for entrepreneurs and SMEs globally. Their growth across geographies and rapid expansion is testament to the accelerated adoption of the platform the value it brings to the ecosystem,” said David Gowdey, managing partner of Jungle Ventures.</p>

<h2>NASA: Artemis-3 pushed back to 2025</h2>
<p>NASA officials <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/crewed-artemis-moon-landing-pushed-back-to-2025-nasa-says/">provided an update on the Artemis program</a> &#8212; which aims to send Americans to the moon for the first time since the Apollo days &#8212; during a briefing Tuesday, when they officially confirmed that Artemis-2 and Artemis-3 would be pushed back by at least a year.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that NASA Administrator Bill Nelson was not shy about pinning the delay at least partially on Blue Origin&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-goes-toe-to-toe-with-nasa-in-federal-court-over-award-to-spacex/">ongoing protest</a> of the Human Landing System contract (this is the crewed vehicle that will make the final leg to the moon). NASA awarded the contract solely to SpaceX back in April, and Blue Orogin has been protesting ever since.</p>
<p>The agency lost “nearly seven months in litigation” over HLS, Nelson said. He also gave a shout-out to NASA&#8217;s legal team and the Department of Justice lawyers.</p>
<p>Nelson also repeatedly brought up China’s rapidly advancing space program, noting that the country is “increasingly capable” of landing taikonauts on the moon. He vowed that NASA would be as aggressive as it could be in a safe and technically feasibly way “to beat our competitors with boots on the moon.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>SpaceX launches Crew-3, Rocket Lab launch delayed</h2>
<p>SpaceX is gaining a <em>lot </em>of experience in human spaceflight. The company brought back four astronauts from the ISS on Monday evening (&#8220;Crew-2&#8221;) &#8212; and then sent another quartet (&#8220;Crew-3&#8221;) to replace them on the station just two days later.</p>
<p>The Crew-3 mission is part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP), a partnership between the agency and private industry to develop and use human space transportation vehicles. SpaceX began providing transportation services to and from the ISS under the CCP in 2020, under a $3.1 billion contract for six missions. (Boeing was awarded a $4.8 billion contract under the program for its Starliner capsule, which has faced a series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/nasa-and-boeing-confirm-starliner-wont-fly-until-first-half-of-2022-as-valve-investigation-continues/">technical snafus</a> that will likely keep it grounded until the first half of next year.)</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/watch-spacex-launch-four-crew-3-astronauts-for-nasa/">rewatch the launch here</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rocket Lab &#8212; the only other company besides SpaceX to achieve first-stage reusability &#8212; also had a launch scheduled for Wednesday, but that is now delayed until at least November 16.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are holding off on launch today out of an abundance of caution due to an out-of-family ground sensor reading and to allow more time to complete helicopter recovery preparations,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/RocketLab/status/1458646267790168067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocket Lab said on Twitter</a>.</p>

The company reported revenues of $7.9 million for the quarter, up 49% from a year ago, with an EBIDTA loss of $16.2 million and $198 million on the balance sheet.</p>
<p><a href="https://brycetech.com/briefing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bryce Tech</a> released its quarterly report this week, focused on the global launch industry. Some tidbits: last quarter, state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation had the most orbital launches at 15, with Arianespace taking the No. 2 spot and SpaceX coming in third. Arianespace launched the most number of spacecraft, however.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/spinlaunch-completes-first-prototype-flight-using-kinetic-launch-system/">SpinLaunch</a>, a stealthy startup that is taking a <em>very </em>unconventional approach to launch, completed its first successful test of a subscale prototype of its kinetic launch system in October. Essentially, the startup is developing a system that uses a large, vacuum-sealed chamber and a hypersonic tether to spin a spacecraft at a high enough velocity — up to 5,000 miles per hour — to escape the atmosphere. That means no rocket, no rocket engines.</p>
<h2>The early agenda for TC Sessions: Space is here</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lucid Group completed its first quarter as a public company with a booming stock price and customer deliveries underway, as it seeks to grab the top spot in the burgeoning luxury EV market.</p>
<p>The company has come a long way since its founding as Atieva in 2007. After shifting its focus from EV battery and powertrain manufacturing to producing a line of luxury vehicles, the company went public in July after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/lucid-motors-strikes-spac-deal-to-go-public-with-24-billion-valuation/">merging with Churchill Capital IV Corp.</a> in one of the most hotly anticipated EV SPAC deals of the year.</p>
<p>Shares of the new EV entrant have nearly doubled over the past calendar month, going from around $27 per share on October 27 to $44.88 at the close of market Monday. The jump is likely due to the company commencing more than two dozen customer deliveries of the $169,000 Air Dream Edition sedan at the end of October. Just a few weeks prior, the automaker announced this variant had the longest EPA-certified range of any EV on the market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/lucid-air-snags-the-longest-range-ev-title-surpassing-tesla/">at more than 520 miles</a>, while the Lucid Grand Touring received a rating of 516 miles.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234491" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Overall, customer reservations increased to 13,000 in the third quarter, which reflects revenues of around $1.3 billion, the company said. Since the quarter’s closing, reservations jumped again to more than 17,000; that’s up from 11,000 reservations in July. The bulk of reservations are being made by people in the U.S., Lucid Group CEO Peter Rawlinson told investors Monday, with Saudi Arabia taking the second spot by order of reservations. The company has received major financial investment from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, and the fund continues to be the automaker’s largest shareholder.</p>
<p>Rawlinson said in a statement that he is confident the company will hit a production capacity of 20,000 vehicles next year. Lucid’s longer-term goal is just slightly more ambitious: 500,000 units by the end of the decade. But first, the company aims to deliver 520 Dream Editions to customers in the initial roll-out, followed by Grand Touring, Touring and Air Pure (the base model, which starts at around $77,000) next year.</p>
<p>The vehicles are manufactured in Lucid’s manufacturing facility in Casa Grande, Arizona, which it plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/lucid-motors-kicks-off-market-debut-with-ev-factory-expansion-plans/">expand by around 2.85 million square feet</a>. The aim is to eventually manufacture up to 90,000 vehicles per year at the facility by the end of 2023, including the mysterious “Project Gravity” SUV, and up to 365,000 units overall, Rawlinson said.</p>
<p>Gravity is on track for production in late 2023, executives confirmed in the investor call. Rawlinson didn’t add too much more detail on the SUV, other than vowing that it is going to be “equally as disruptive in the SUV space as Air is in its space.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Turning to the financials, the company is closing the quarter with around $4.8 billion in cash, which includes $4.4 billion from the SPAC merger and PIPE, as well as cash on the balance sheet at the time of the deal’s closing. CFO Sherry House specified that while the cost of production is reflected in this quarter’s earnings, vehicle revenues will not be reflected in financial statements until the next quarter as customer deliveries began October 30.</p>
<p>Also on Monday, Lucid Air was announced as MotorTrend’s 2022 Car of the Year. &#8220;For a new brand and a new company to win, to my knowledge, that’s only been done once before. I should know, I was there,” Rawlinson said, referring to Tesla’s win of the award for the Model S in 2012. Rawlinson previously worked as vehicle engineer of the Model S after joining the company in 2009.</p>
