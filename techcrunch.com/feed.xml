										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Buying and selling residential real estate is a complex business, no matter where you live. A slew of startups in the United States are focused on streamlining that process for people. But in Brazil, where no MLS exists, the challenge of digitizing real estate is even greater.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One startup that has set out to serve as a “one-stop shop” for Brazilians to help them manage the home buying and selling process has managed to attract one of the largest &#8212; if not the largest &#8212; funding rounds ever raised by a Brazilian startup.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This morning, digital real estate platform <a href="https://www.loft.com.br/">Loft</a> announced it has closed on $425 million in Series D funding led by New York-based D1 Capital Partners. A mix of new and existing investors also participated in the round, including Advent, Altimeter, DST, Silver Lake, Soros, Tarsadia, Tiger Global, Andreessen Horowitz, Caffeinated, Fifth Wall, Monashees, QED and Vulcan, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The round values Loft at $2.2 billion, a huge jump from its being just near unicorn territory in January 2020, when it raised a $175 million Series C.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A round of this size is impressive for any startup, but especially for one that was founded just over three years ago in Latin America. The region has seen explosive growth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/latin-americas-digital-transformation-is-making-up-for-lost-time/">as of late</a>, with a maturing startup scene in Brazil in particular. São Paulo-based Loft too has seen major growth. While the company was less forthcoming about its financials as of late, it told me last year that it had notched “over $150 million in annualized revenues in its first full year of operation” via more than 1,000 transactions.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Latin America&#8217;s digital transformation is making up for lost time&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/latin-americas-digital-transformation-is-making-up-for-lost-time/embed/#?secret=6v2GJS0EYD" data-secret="6v2GJS0EYD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">In 2020, Loft saw the number of listings on its site increase “10 to 15 times,” according to co-founder and co-CEO Mate Pencz. Today, the company actively maintains more than 13,000 property listings in approximately 130 regions across São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, partnering with more than 30,000 brokers. Not only are more people open to transacting digitally, more people are looking to buy versus rent in the country.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We did more than 6x YoY growth with many thousands of transactions over the course of 2020,&#8221; Pencz told TechCrunch. “We’re now growing into the many tens of thousands, and soon hundreds of thousands, of active listings.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company’s revenues and GMV (gross merchandise value) also “increased significantly” in 2020, according to Pencz, who declined to provide more specifics. He did say those figures are “multiples higher from where they were,” and that Loft has “a very clear horizon to profitability.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Loft has adapted really fast to the new reality we’re living in, with COVID having only propelled or accelerated our growth,” Pencz said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pencz and Florian Hagenbuch founded Loft in early 2018 and today serve as its co-CEOs. The aim of the platform, in the company’s words, is “bringing Latin American real estate into the e-commerce age by developing online alternatives to analogue legacy processes and leveraging data to create transparency in highly opaque markets.” The U.S. real estate tech company with the closest model to Loft’s is probably Zillow, according to Pencz.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the United States, prospective buyers and sellers have the benefit of MLSs, which in the words of the National Association of Realtors, are private databases that are created, maintained and paid for by real estate professionals to help their clients buy and sell property. Loft itself spent years and many dollars in creating its own such databases for the Brazilian market. Besides helping people buy and sell homes, it offers services around insurance, renovations and rentals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2020, Loft also entered the mortgage business by acquiring one of the largest mortgage brokerage businesses in Brazil. The startup now ranks among the top-three mortgage originators in the country, according to Pencz. When it comes to helping people apply for mortgages, he likened Loft to U.S.-based Better.com.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The startup has also grown its number of employees in the past year, growing from 450 last January to 700 today. In particular, it’s significantly beefed up its tech team, according to Pencz.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Notably, at the time of its series C, the investment marked the first and only investment in Latin America for Vulcan Capital (the investment arm of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen) and the first and only Brazilian investment for Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This latest financing brings Loft’s total funding raised to an impressive $700 million. Other backers include Brazil’s Canary and a group of high-profile angel investors such as Max Levchin of Affirm and PayPal, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger and David Vélez, CEO and founder of Brazilian fintech Nubank. In addition, Loft has also raised more than $100 million in debt financing through a series of publicly listed real estate funds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Loft plans to use its new capital in part to expand across Brazil and eventually in Latin America and beyond. The company is also planning to explore more M&amp;A opportunities.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“We&#8217;re now going into this year extremely well-capitalized and I think that in addition to doubling down on the core business, there might be strategic acquisitions also on the horizon,” Pencz told TechCrunch. “We also plan to make Loft as much of a regional and potentially global business, following in the footsteps of some of the other Brazilian companies who recently have been expanding globally.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Sundheim, founder of D1 Capital, said that part of his firm&#8217;s approach as investors is identifying opportunities &#8220;at the confluence of structural shifts, secular trends and world-class management teams.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Analyzing Loft, we were particularly impressed by the team’s focus and relentless execution, which has allowed them to build scale as well as deep data and technology moats in a short amount of time,&#8221; he said in a written statement.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Insuretech startup <a href="https://yourcounterpart.com/">Counterpart</a>, has raised $10 million in funding led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/valor-equity-partners">Valor Equity Partners</a>. Also participating was Susa Ventures and Felicis Ventures. Counterpart works in the ‘management liability&#8217; insurance market. Counterpart will also partner with Markel Specialty, a specialty insurance division of Markel Corporation, to offer its management liability insurance products.</p>
<p>Insuretech startups like Oscar, Lemonade, and Root have made incursions into personal insurance. What has been less prevalent, says Counterpart, is startups tackling the $300bn corporate insurance market.</p>
<p>Counterpart is competing with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/next-insurance">Next Insurance</a> which has raised $631M, and which also provides small business liability insurance, as well as the big insurance carriers, from AIG to Berkshire Hathaway.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Counterpart is used by some wholesale brokers in the United States to allow small to medium businesses get insurance coverage, because it digitizes much of the process, from application submission, coverage selection, binding, claims management, and loss prevention. Counterpart says this market has become less attractive to insurance carriers because of the increasing claims costs and severity, and their lack of digitization of the process.</p>
<p>Tanner Hackett, founder, and CEO, said in a statement: “The $1.2tn insurance industry is going through a digital revolution.. We saw an outsized opportunity with management liability, a critical insurance line in which we have unique expertise.”<br />
 <br />
Valor Equity Partners partner and Counterpart board member Jon Shulkin said: “Counterpart’s platform goes beyond the scope of a traditional insurer, layering in insights, tools, and services to help business stakeholders navigate this extremely challenging operating environment.”</p>
<p>Valor was an early backer of Tesla, SpaceX, Addepar, and GoPuff. Susa has previously backed Robinhood, PolicyGenius, and Newfront Insurance. Felicis has funded Hippo, Plaid, and Credit Karma.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital identity services &#8212; used as a key link between organizations to verify that you are who you say you are online and individuals logging into those services &#8212; have come into their own in this past year. Now, one of the companies providing digital identity products is announcing a large round of funding, underscoring both the market size and its ambitions to be a central player in that space.</p>
<p><a href="http://jumio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jumio</a>, which has built a platform that provides a variety of digital identity tools and technology &#8212; using biometrics, machine learning, computer vision, big data, and more to run checks on ID documents, log-ins, to help prevent suspicious financial activity, identity theft and more &#8212; has closed a $150 million round of funding. The Palo Alto-based company says it will use the funds to build more tools on its platform, and to double down on customer growth after a big year.</p>
<p>Currently, Jumio&#8217;s primary business is B2B: it provides tools to enterprise customers like HSBC to manage digital identity verification. Some of the areas where it will be investing include expanding its AI capabilities to do more anti-money laundering work, and to look at building a B2C product, using the data, tools and network of customers that it has to help individuals better manage their identities online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think the big thing is that the foundation of the internet is identity not anonymity,&#8221; said CEO Robert Prigge in an interview, who said the trend of digital transformation has spurred that chane. &#8220;It’s been a big shift over the last couple of years. People wanted to originally hide behind anonymity, but now identify is the keystone. Whether it&#8217;s online banking or social networks, you need to be able to establish trust remotely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, anonymity still is there, just in a different form: data protection regulations are all about making sure that we can stay private if we so choose as we use the tools that are now the norm, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-new-plans-to-help-build-trust-in-use-of-digital-identities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countries like the UK</a> are fleshing that out further with regulations in the works to make sure that services that use or manage digital identities are carried out on a common framework and with adequate oversight from users themselves. That presents the challenge and opportunity for a company like Jumio: how to navigate the push for identity while still providing a way to do that with privacy protections in mind.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from a single investor, Great Hill Partners, which will be joining Centana and Millennium as shareholders in the company. The valuation is not being disclosed but CEO Robert Prigge noted a few details that he believes point to the company&#8217;s position right now.</p>
<p>He confirmed that Jumio made $100 million in revenues last year; this is the first money the company has raised in nearly five years after <a href="http://www.marketwired.com/news-release/2016/08/30/1195718/0/en/Jumio-Momentum-Continues-With-15-Million-Financing-Round.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bringing in a modest $16 million in 2016</a>; and this looks to be the largest single round ever raised for a digital identity company.</p>
<p>However, given the market environment and the advances of tech, there has been quite a lot of momentum in the space, and a number of other digital identity and anti-money laundering (AML) prevention startups have been launching, growing and raising money. Just in the last year, they have included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/forgerock-nabs-93-5m-for-its-id-management-platform-gears-up-next-for-an-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ForgeRock</a> ($96 million round), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/onfido-the-ai-based-id-verification-platform-raises-100m-led-by-tpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onfido</a> ($100 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/payfone-raises-100m-for-its-mobile-phone-based-digital-verification-and-id-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Payfone</a> ($100 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/complyadvantage-nabs-50m-for-an-ai-platform-and-database-to-detect-and-stop-financial-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComplyAdvantage</a> ($50 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/ripjar-founded-by-gchq-alums-raises-36-8m-for-ai-that-detects-financial-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripjar</a> ($36.8 million) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/identity-management-startup-truework-raises-30m-to-help-you-verify-your-work-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Truework</a> ($30 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/zeotap-raises-18-5m-for-a-customer-id-platform-it-says-was-built-with-privacy-in-mind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeotap</a> ($18 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/persona-raises-17-5m-for-an-identify-verification-platform-the-goes-beyond-user-ids-and-passwords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persona</a> ($17.5 million) &#8212; so I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this is not an outlier at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Acquisitions like <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equifax-announces-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-kount-301203473.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equifax buying Kount earlier this year</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Okta acquiring Auth0 for $6.5 billion</a>, meanwhile, point to encroaching competition from other areas of the market such as credit rating agencies and those providing login services for corporates, as well as the bigger consolidation trends.</p>
<p>The pandemic has precipitated a shift where many services we might have used in person are now accessible via the web and apps, but at the same time, the amount of cybercrime aimed at abusing that environment is on the rise, and both trends fuel a stronger demand for ID verification tools.</p>
<p>Jumio is notable among the group of companies providing those services both for being one of the bigger and older players. Prigge said that currently has around 1,000 customers, including some of the very biggest enterprises like the banking group HSBC, United Airlines and the telecoms operator Singtel, and it is active in 200 countries.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also distinctive for having developed a platform approach, where it offers a range of different kinds of tools. This is in contrast to many others, which &#8212; partly as newer entrants &#8212; are focusing on more specific technology or addressing a narrower aspect of what is a pretty complex problem. That said, the company&#8217;s earliest work seems to still be the mainstay of what it does. The number of documents that it can &#8220;read&#8221; to begin the process of verifying users now numbers about 3,500. That has propelled more than 300 million verifications made on Jumio&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost all vendors verify you are who you say you are, not that it’s really you. That is why the biometrics is so important.<br />
In our case we see it as a holistic onboarding,&#8221; Prigge said. &#8220;We are one of the only AML and KYC [know your customer] providers.&#8221; The AML tools came by way of an acquisition the company made last year, of <a href="https://www.jumio.com/about/press-releases/jumio-acquires-beam-solutions-aml-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beam Solutions</a>.</p>
<p>This funding round, nevertheless, is a big step up for a company that has, in fact, seen a lot of ups and downs.</p>
<p>To be clear, Prigge is very explicit when he says that the Jumio he runs has nothing to do with an older incarnation of the company.</p>
<p>Jumio the first came into existence around a decade ago and raised nearly $40 million in funding from investors like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/05/payments-company-jumio-raises-25-5m-from-andreessen-horowitz-will-hit-100m-in-2012-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andreessen Horowitz</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/17/exclusive-facebook-co-founder-eduardo-saverin-leads-6-5m-round-for-jumio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eduardo Saverin</a> as an early player in mobile payments, with technology that could use the camera on a phone to scan cards and IDs to enable the payments. That business ran into a lot of hot water for mis-stating financial results and mostly likely other related things, and eventually it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/21/identity-verification-startup-jumio-files-for-bankruptcy-will-sell-assets-to-early-backer-eduardo-saverin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed for bankruptcy</a> in March 2016. Saverin apparently wanted to buy the business &#8212; if only to encourage other buyers to come out of the woodwork &#8212; <a href="http://www.wsj.com/article_email/jumio-wins-court-approval-of-sale-to-centana-1462567684-lMyQjAxMTA2NTAxNjgwNDY2Wj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually Centana did</a>, at a bargain price of $850,000.</p>
<p>While that took a portion of the business (mainly branding, a business concept and some employees) out of bankruptcy, the legacy Jumio remained in a<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> bankruptcy process that is, almost exactly five years to the date, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://cases.omniagentsolutions.com/documents?clientid=CsgAAncz%2B6bKJww4MJwEwx6LQOdnYTifoxFfKIjhu84%2FxgMaldrvK4vlcgf4ImE4V0VYL0O0UM8%3D&amp;tagid=880" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still ongoing</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, partly because the original founder is being accused of destroying documents needed to finally conclude that mess. </span></p>
<p>The fact that Great Hill Partners is doing the investing here is notable. It&#8217;s mostly a PE firm that has been doing an increasing amount of investing in tech companies, part of a bigger trend where more PE firms are getting involved in rounds for later-stage startups. Its interest is in backing a company that has emerged as a leader in a crowded space but one targeting a big opportunity in digital identity, forecast to be worth some <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/05/28/1851149/0/en/12-8-Bn-Identity-Verification-Market-Global-Forecast-to-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$12.8 billion by 2024</a>, from $6 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jumio has an incredible foundation – an expert management team, deep product roadmap and a global reach that is positioning the company for significant growth as the volume of online transactions and interactions, and associated fraud, is reaching record-highs. In particular, we have deep conviction in the company’s AI-enabled identity verification solution Jumio Go and KYC orchestration platform,&#8221; said Nick Cayer, partner at Great Hill Partners, in an emailed interview. &#8220;Jumio will need to both keep pace with incredible demand for online identity verification services, and of course outlast new and evolving competition in the space. We have strong conviction that Jumio has the right management team, innovative product roadmap and group of supporting investors to maintain leadership in the space.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According to the World Bank, more than one billion people in South and East Asia <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Research/GlobalFindex/PDF/N2Unbanked.pdf">lack access to a bank account</a>. For many, this makes it is difficult to secure loans and other services because they don’t have traditional financial records like a credit score. <a href="https://www.jeff-app.com/">Jeff</a>’s loan brokerage platform was created to make it easier for financial service providers to integrate alternative data scoring, allowing them reach more potential borrowers.</p>
<p>The startup, which launched its app in Vietnam last year, announced today it has raised $1 million, led by the Estonian Business Angels Network (EstBAN). The funding will be used to enter other Southeast Asian markets, including Indonesia and the Philippines, and introduce new products, like free credit score and insurance offers, digital discount coupons and mobile wallet cashbacks. Other participants in the round included Startup Wise Guys; Taavi Tamkivi, the founder of Salv who formerly held lead roles at TransferWise and Skype; and angel investors from European on-demand ride platform Bolt.</p>
<p>Jeff currently claims more than 300,000 users in Vietnam. Though it is based in Latvia, Jeff will continue focusing on unbanked people in South and Southeast Asia, said founder and chief executive officer Toms Niparts. Its goal is to build a &#8220;super app&#8221; that combines personalized loan comparisons with other services like e-commerce, mobile top-ups and online discounts, Niparts told TechCrunch in an email.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before starting Jeff, Niparts was CEO of Spain for Digital Finance International, a fintech company that is part of the Finstar Financial Group, which has investments in more than 30 countries. This gave Niparts the chance to &#8220;learn about the similarities and differences of financial services from the inside in different markets,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In particular, he saw that in Southeast Asian countries, most loan applicants &#8220;were rejected not because of bad credit history, low income or other similar reasons, but because there was not enough data about them.&#8221; While some lending companies have developed pilot projects for alternative data scoring, the process is often time-consuming, complicated and expensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a massive problem in a big part of the world, and it makes absolute sense to build it as a centralised solution,&#8221; Niparts said.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, Jeff currently has between 12 to 15 active partners at a time (the number changes because lenders occasionally turn off demand, a standard industry practice), and is adding another eight to 10. In total, the company now has about 80 to 100 potential partners in its Vietnam pipeline, and part of its new funding will be used to expand its team to speed up the onboarding process.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, Jeff has identified about 40 potential partners, &#8220;but so far we have only been scratching the surface,&#8221; said Niparts. &#8220;The Indonesian market is considerably larger than what we have seen in Vietnam, and the forecast is we will grow the pipeline to 150-200 banks and partners in 2021.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s selling point hinges on its ability to accurately measure creditworthiness based on alternative data. For lenders, this means more pre-qualified leads and access to a larger customer segment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building a credit score is a never-ending process, and we are at the very early stages of it. What we have right now is mainly around publicly accessible information and client-consented data,&#8221; Niparts said. This includes behavioral analytics, smart devices meta data, data from social media and other sources that have open APIs.</p>
<p>As Jeff grows, it also plans to make partnerships with mobile wallets, telecom companies and consumer apps. It is developing a lender toolkit that includes bank portal and lender API to reduce the amount of time needed to integrate with the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128827" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128827" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2128827" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg" alt="Loan brokerage app Jeff's onboarding chatbot, shown on a smartphone display" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg 4500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2128827" class="wp-caption-text">Jeff&#8217;s onboarding chatbot</p></div></p>
<p>Borrowers sign up for Jeff with the app&#8217;s chatbot and can start getting offers once they enter basic information like their name, contact information, the amount they want to borrow and the purpose of the loan. But adding more details and data sources to their profiles, which are screened by multiple lenders at once, increases their chances of approval, and unlocks more offers. This may include uploading documents, connecting social media accounts or consenting to share their smart device metadata.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we evolve, new integrations and compatible accounts from other service providers—such as utilities, food delivery, and more—will be regularly added,&#8221; said Niparts.</p>
<p>Jeff’s partners currently offer near-prime, peer-to-peer and digital lending services that include unsecured consumer loans, installment loans and motorbike financing. It plans to add more loan products, and is also working on its first insurance collaborations, credit cards and other bank-grade products.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our ambition for Jeff is to become a super app, where people can not only get access to financial services that were previously unavailable to them, but also tap in other benefits and discounts,&#8221; Niparts said. &#8220;This is also a great way to learn more about creditworthiness and what’s on demand. Every new interactions gives us more data and insights to further evolve the accuracy and value added of Jeff’s credit score.&#8221;</p>
<p>The number of fintech startups focused on financial inclusion is <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/fintech-startups-southeast-asia-market-map-expert-intelligence/">on the rise across Southeast Asia</a>. Jeff&#8217;s competitors fall into two main categories. The first are comparison portals like TopBank, TheBank and GoBear (which recently <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/financial-services-firm-gobear-closing-business">announced it is closing</a>), that allow users to compare financial providers and banks, but don’t focus on enabling them to access services. The second are companies like CredoLab, Seon and Kalap that provide third-party services like single data-source insights and fraud prevention, but &#8220;do not have control over the customer journey,&#8221; Nipsart said.</p>
<p>Jeff’s goal is to &#8220;be a one-stop shop for both,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We provide both clients, as well as deeper insights about them for banks and other partners using our platform. At the same time, we are the main point of interaction for the users, which not only solves the main need of comparing financial services and accessing them, but also offers an increasing range of other discounts and benefits.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending money from the U.S. to Nigeria can be a painstaking process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For remittance platforms like Western Union, it will cost a transfer fee and take between one to five business days for money sent from a U.S. debit card to enter a Nigerian bank account</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto remittance platforms are rising to the challenge of fixing these cross-border payment issues by reducing time and fees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yesterday, we talked about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/these-undergraduates-left-university-to-build-flux-a-payments-startup-now-in-yc/">Flux</a>, a Nigerian fintech solving this problem in the present YC W2021 batch. Today, another YC-backed startup, <a href="https://www.afriexapp.com/">Afriex</a> &#8212; but from the Summer 2020 batch &#8212; is raising a $1.2 million seed round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/topealabi">Tope Alabi</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/obirije-john-a2403310a">John Obirije</a> in 2019 provides instant, zero-fee transfers to Africans at home and in the diaspora</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It allows users to deposit cash on the app, send money to a bank account or another user, and withdraw money to a connected bank or debit card</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like other crypto remittance platforms, Afriex has built its business on stablecoins &#8212; cryptocurrency backed by the dollar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, the company buys cryptocurrency in one country and sells it in another to offer better exchange rates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is in contrast to better-known platforms like Western Union and Wise that use traditional banking systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year while the startup graduated from YC, it claimed to be processing about $500,000 per month in transaction fees and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in over 30 countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Afriex was only present in Nigeria and the U.S. But having started operations in Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda, Afriex claims to be processing millions of dollars each month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On its website, though, Afriex states that customers can only send money to and from Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Canada, and the U.S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new investment, the Lagos and San Francisco-based startup is looking to scale up by growing the team and expanding to other markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African VC firm <a href="https://www.launchafrica.vc/">Launch Africa</a> led the seed round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors include Y Combinator, SoftBank Opportunity Fund, Future Africa, Brightstone VC, Processus Capital, Uncommon Ventures, A$AP Capital, Precursor Ventures, and Ivernet Holdings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Angel investors like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russell Smith, Mandela Schumacher-Hodge Dixon, Furqan Rydhan, and Andrea Vaccari also took part</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://theopportunityfund.com/">SoftBank Opportunity Fund</a>, a subsidiary of the SoftBank Group, targets founders of color in the U.S. running early-stage startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching in June 2020, it has invested in 22 startups and Afriex seems to be the only one catering to a set of users in the US and another continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is due to Alabi&#8217;s upbringing as an immigrant child who has had a mix of both worlds. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was difficult to send money to Nigeria and his experience as a blockchain developer at Consensys made him realize he could solve a problem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We would go back home every two years and even then, I would always take note of what was missing and what could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be improved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I would find myself having to pay for foreign expenses with money that was sitting in a US bank account,” said Alabi. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Traditional remittance companies were so slow and expensive that I knew I could do it better with crypto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Remittance is the best and most important use case for crypto. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal is to build the world&#8217;s largest remittance company, starting with emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While much of the recent wave of relentless hype around NFTs &#8212; or non-fungible tokens &#8212; has been most visibly manifested in high-dollar art auctions or digital trading cards sales, there&#8217;s also been a relentless string of chatter among bullish investors who see a future that ties the tokens to the future of social media and creator monetization.</p>
<p>Much of the most spirited conversations have centered on a pre-launch project called <a href="https://bitclout.com/">BitClout</a>, a social crypto-exchange where users can buy and sell tokens based on people&#8217;s reputations. The app, which launches out of private beta tomorrow morning, has already courted plenty of controversy inside the crypto community, but it&#8217;s also amassed quite a war chest as investors pump tens of millions into its proprietary currency.</p>
<p>Early backers of the platform&#8217;s BitClout currency include a who&#8217;s who of Silicon Valley investors including Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, the startup&#8217;s founder tells TechCrunch. Other investors include Chamath Palihapitiya&#8217;s Social Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Winklevoss Capital and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. A report in <a href="https://decrypt.co/62162/bitclout-reaped-160m-tokens-pegged-celebs-followed-money">Decrypt</a> notes that a single wallet connected to BitClout has received more than $165 million worth of Bitcoin deposits suggesting that huge sums have already poured into the network ahead of its public launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>BitClout falls into an exploding category of crypto companies that are focusing on tokenized versions of social currency. Others working on building out these individual tokens include <a href="https://tryroll.com/">Roll</a> and <a href="https://rally.io/">Rally</a>, which aim to allow creators to directly monetize their internet presence and allow their fans to bet on them. Users who believe in a budding artist can invest in their social currency and could earn returns as the creator became more famous and their coins accrued more value.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Terry Crews is launching a social currency&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/why-terry-crews-is-launching-a-social-currency/embed/#?secret=yzBBIiRFT3" data-secret="yzBBIiRFT3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;If you look at people&#8217;s existing relationships with social media companies, it&#8217;s this very adversarial thing where all the content they produce is not really theirs but it belongs to the corporation that doesn&#8217;t share the monetization with them,&#8221; BitClout&#8217;s founder, who refers to themselves pseudonymously as &#8220;diamondhands,&#8221; tells TechCrunch. (There&#8217;s been some <a href="https://twitter.com/_prestwich/status/1373737053012201473?s=20">speculation on their identity</a> as a former founder in the cryptocurrency space, but in a call with TechCrunch, they would not confirm their identity.)</p>
<p>The BitClout platform revolves around the BitClout currency. At the moment users can deposit Bitcoin into the platform which is instantly converted to BitClout tokens and can then be spent on individual creators inside the network. When a creator gets more popular as more users buy their coin, it gets more expensive to buy denominations of their coin. Creators can also opt in to receive a certain percentage of transactions deposited into their own BitClout wallets so that they continue to benefit from their own success.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s biggest point of controversy hinges on what has been opt-in and what has been opt-out for the early group of accounts on the platform. Most other social currency offerings are strictly opt-in. Users come to the platform in search of a way to create tokens that allow them to monetize a fanbase and build a social fabric across multiple platforms. The thought being that if the platforms own the audience then you are at their mercy.</p>
<p>BitClout has taken an aggressive growth strategy here, turning that model on its head. T<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he startup has pre-populated the BitClout network with 15,000 accounts after scraping information from popular public Twitter profiles. This means that BitClout users can buy shares of Kim Kardashian&#8217;s social coin or Elon Musk&#8217;s without those individuals ever having signed up for a profile or agreeing to it. This hasn&#8217;t been well-received by all of those who unwittingly had accounts set up on their behalf including <a href="https://twitter.com/_prestwich/status/1373737053012201473?s=21">many crypto-savvy users</a> who got scooped up in the initial wave of seeding.</span></p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s founder says that this effort was largely an effort to prevent handle squatting and user impersonation but he believes that as the platform opens, a sizable pre-purchase of creator coins reserved for the owners of these accounts will entice those users to verify their handles to claim the funds.</p>
<p>Perhaps BitClout&#8217;s most eyebrow raising quirk is that the platform is launching with a way to invest into the platform and convert bitcoin into BitClout, but at launch there&#8217;s no way to cash out funds. The project&#8217;s founder says that it&#8217;s only a matter of time before this is resolved, and points to Coinbase and the Winkelvoss twin&#8217;s status as coin holders as a sign of future exchange support to come, but the company has no specifics to share at launch.</p>
<p>While the founders and investors behind the project see a bright future for social currencies on the blockchain, many in the decentralized community have been less impressed with BitClout&#8217;s early efforts to achieve viral adoption among creators in a permission-less manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;BitClout will make a great case study on how badly crypto projects can mess up incentive engineering when they try to monetize social networks.&#8221; Jay Graber, a decentralized platform researcher involved in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/">Twitter&#8217;s bluesky effort</a>, said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1374059653009575936">tweet</a>. &#8220;Trust and reputation are key, and if you create a sketchy platform and mess with people’s reputations without their consent it is not going to go well.&#8221;</p>
<p>If BitClout comes out of the gate and manages to convert enough of its pre-seeded early adopter list that there is value in joining its closed ecosystem version of a social token then it may have strong early momentum in an explosive new space that many creators are finding valuable. The concepts explored by others in the social currency space are sound, but this particular execution of it is a high-risk one. The network launches tomorrow morning so we&#8217;ll see soon enough.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starting May 1, apps in China can no longer force users into providing excessive personal data, according to a document jointly released by a group of the country&#8217;s top regulators, the Cyberspace Administration, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security and the State Administration for Market Regulation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a common practice in China where apps ask users to provide sensitive personal information and those who decline to share are often denied access. While some of the requests are justifiable, such as one&#8217;s location information to use a navigation map, many others are unnecessary, such as one&#8217;s biometrics to make mobile payments.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In December, Chinese authorities lay out the acceptable range of data that 39 common app types are entitled to collect, as TechCrunch </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/chinas-internet-regulator-takes-aim-at-forced-data-collection/">reported</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All forms of apps are subject to the requirements, including the increasingly popular &#8220;mini programs,&#8221; which are lite apps accessed through an all-encompassing native app such as WeChat and Alipay without the need for an app store install, said the new document.</p>
<p>&#8220;Extraneous data is most often used for advertising purposes, such as serving up localized ads or ads based on the user&#8217;s interests,&#8221; said Todd Kuhns, marketing manager at AppInChina, a firm that helps overseas apps distribute in China. &#8220;Developers could still request this additional info, but users who refuse will probably still get ads and offers &#8212; just less relevant ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, the document appears to be a guideline at best as it does not specify how the rules should be enforced and how offenders will be punished. While it marks China&#8217;s incremental progress on data protection, regulators will have to keep updating the rules as people&#8217;s daily lives are becoming more linked to digital devices at a rapid rate.</p>
<p>In recent months, China has been clamping down on the technological darlings that it used to pride itself on. It introduced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/china-antitrust-rules-on-internet-industry/">sweeping antitrust law</a> to rein in its &#8220;platform economy&#8221; and slammed anti-competition fines on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/china-literature-alibaba-fined/">Alibaba and Tencent</a>, following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">Ant Group&#8217;s IPO fiasco</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly five years after the launch of Pokémon Go, Niantic <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/nintendo-apps-partnership/?hl=en">announced</a> Monday that they are partnering with Nintendo to co-develop a new title based on the company&#8217;s Pikmin franchise.</p>
<p>Niantic says the app is being developed in their Tokyo office and will launch later this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The app will include gameplay activities to encourage walking and make walking more delightful,&#8221; a press release from Niantic reads. The company notably specifies that the title will make use of their augmented reality platform to integrate the real world into the app&#8217;s experiences.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pokémon Go has fallen out of headlines but has continued to deliver massive sums to the San Francisco gaming company, eclipsing $1 billion in revenue in 2020. In recent years, Nintendo has sought to build out their presence on mobile gaming platforms with a number of titles playing on some of their biggest franchises, but none of them have reached Pokémon Go&#8217;s level of success.</p>
<p>Niantic has raised nearly $500 million in capital, most recently raising at a $4 billion valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The music streaming arm of Tencent is further tightening its ties with the &#8220;big three&#8221; record label companies, its major licensing partners. Tencent Music Entertainment announced Tuesday that it has formed a new joint label with Warner Music Group, following similar deals with Universal Music Group in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/universal-music-tencent-joint-label/">August 2020</a> and Sony Music Entertainment<a href="https://sonymusic.me/news/sony-music-entertainment-tencent-music-entertainment-group-announce-new-label-liquid-state-east-meets-west-dancefloor/"> in early 2018</a>.</p>
<p>The collaboration will take advantage of &#8220;Warner Music&#8217;s global resources and experience in supporting artists&#8217; careers, as well as TME&#8217;s massive influence in mainland China&#8217;s music and entertainment market,&#8221; TME says in an <a href="https://ir.tencentmusic.com/2021-03-22-Tencent-Music-Entertainment-Group-And-Warner-Music-Sign-Multi-Year-Strategic-Licensing-Agreement-And-Agree-to-Establish-a-Joint-Venture-Music-Label-in-China">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The joint label<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/universal-music-tencent-joint-label/"> established with UMG</a> similarly aims to bring international artists to China, one of the world&#8217;s fastest-growing music markets, and take Chinese musicians abroad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alongside the label deal, TME and WMG have signed a multi-year licensing agreement, an extension of their decade-long collaboration.</p>
<p>TME has ongoing licensing relationships with all three major record labels and some have manifested in equity relationships. In January, a Tencent-led consortium increased its total stake in UMG to 20%.</p>
<p>TME also operates some of China&#8217;s most popular online music services. Through its family of music streaming apps including QQ Music, Kugou Music and Kuwo Music, TME collectively commands 622 mobile monthly active users as of the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Paying ratio remains relatively low, however, with 9% of the users paying in the quarter, up from 6.2% in the previous year.</p>
<p>But TME has another major revenue stream that distinguishes it from Western streaming services like Spotify: social entertainment. This category includes the karaoke app WeSing which monetizes through the sales of virtual gifts, which are bought by users and sent to performers they appreciate. It mirrors real-life fan-idol interaction.</p>
<p>The segment contributed $854 million to Q4 revenue, compared to $423 million generated from user subscription and digital music sales.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Purplle, an e-commerce platform for beauty products in India, said on Monday it has raised $45 million in a new financing round as it looks to expand its presence in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The new round, a Series D, was financed by Sequoia Capital India and existing investors Verlinvest, Blume Ventures, and JSW Ventures. The new round values the Indian startup &#8212; which has raised $95 million to date &#8212; at about $300 million, up from $150 million in its 2019 Series C round, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The new round gave partial exit to IvyCap Ventures, which had invested about $2 million in <a href="https://www.purplle.com">Purplle</a> in 2015. The venture firm said in a statement that Purplle delivered a 22X return and 1.35x of its entire Fund 1.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We continue to believe in the growth of the company and therefore we have retained our stake for Fund 2,” said Vikram Gupta, Founder and Managing Partner of IvyCap Ventures.</p>
<p>Eight-year-old Purplle.com, which counts Goldman Sachs among its investors, says it sells nearly 50,000 products from over 1,000 brands. The startup said it has amassed 7 million monthly active users.</p>
<p>“Purplle has been on a robust growth trajectory. Even with a Covid year, we have delivered &gt;90% GMV CAGR for the last 3 years. This, while scaling our private brands successfully; Good Vibes is already an INR 150 Cr [$20.7 million] brand. The investment will help to shape Purplle into a multibillion-dollar, digital-first, beauty and personal care enterprise,” said Manish Taneja (pictured above), co-founder and chief executive of Purplle, in a statement late Monday.</p>
<p>The growth of Purplle is indicative of the growing e-commerce space in India, where users are beginning to purchase fashion and beauty products online. MyGlamm, an omnichannel direct-to-consumer Indian brand, last week raised $24.2 million in a round co-led by Amazon.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Purplle as we believe they have cracked the beauty playbook of value retailing with 3 key tenets – a business built on high retention and low customer acquisition cost (CAC), a wide assortment of brands offering quality at best prices, and an attractive private label portfolio mix. We see Purplle emerging as a dominant beauty destination as the online beauty penetration grows from 10% to 25%+ over the next decade,” said Sakshi Chopra, Principal, Sequoia India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Healthcare tech startup <a href="https://ro.co">Ro</a> has raised $500 million to help fuel continued growth of its hybrid telehealth/in-home primary care platform, which also includes a growing pharmacy business as the company pursues a strategy of vertical integration to optimize delivery and reduce costs for clients. The company&#8217;s latest raise is a Series D round, and means it has now raised over $876 million since its 2017 founding.</p>
<p>That may seem like a lot of money, but as Ro co-founder and CEO Zachariah Reitano told me in an interview, it&#8217;s actually &#8220;peanuts&#8221; when it comes to the healthcare industry – which is part of why they founded the company in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes people talk about how great it is to be in the healthcare arena, in tech circles,&#8221; Reitano said. &#8220;They say, &#8216;Oh, healthcare is a $4 trillion market – it&#8217;s so massive.&#8217;  But that&#8217;s the worst thing in the entire world; it&#8217;s awful how large it is. And I think what we have the opportunity to cut it in half with technology.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s what Reitano says will be the primary focus of this round of funding: Fueling its efforts around vertical integration of healthcare services and technology, to further the eventual end goal of reducing costs to patients through the efficiencies realized in that process.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, what I&#8217;m really excited about is being able to continue to invest in that infrastructure and add even more,&#8221; Reitano told me. &#8220;We&#8217;ll continue to invest in telemedicine, we&#8217;ll continue to invest in our logistics and pharmacy, and continue to invest in in-home care, as well as the connection between the three, and then we&#8217;ll also invest in additional diagnostics, remote patient monitoring – so collecting and distributing devices to patients to go from reactive to proactive care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ro&#8217;s model focuses on primary care delivered direct to consumer, without involving any payer or employer-funded and guided care programs. The idea is to reduce costs through vertical integration and other efficiency engineering efforts in order to get them to the point where they&#8217;re effectively on par with your out-of-pocket expense with co-pays anyway. Reitano explained that the insurance system as it exists in the U.S. now only effectively masks individual costs, making it less clear that much of what a person pays out in healthcare costs comes out of their pocket anyway, whether it&#8217;s through taxation, or employers allocating more of the funds they have available for compensation to healthcare, vs. take-home pay.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128686" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128686" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2128686" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2128686" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ro</p></div></p>
<p>That&#8217;s what&#8217;s behind Ro&#8217;s recent push into operating its own pharmacies, and growing that footprint to include more all the time. Reitano told me that the company will have 10 pharmacies by the end o this year, and 15 by the end of next, all placed strategically around the country to ensure that it can provide next-day shipping to patients at ground shipping rates pretty much anywhere in the U.S.</p>
<p>Doing that kind of vertical optimization has enabled Ro to offer 500 common drugs at $5 per month, including treatments for heart disease, anxiety, depression and diabetes — with a plan to ramp it to 1,000 drugs available at that price by year&#8217;s end. That&#8217;s roughly equal to the co-pay required for many insurers for the same treatments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Reitano says Ro has seen big changes in the healthcare system generally that favor its model and accelerate its hybrid care plans owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that there are two most profound impacts of the pandemic on the healthcare system,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One is that it simultaneously shed light on all of the inequities for the entire country to see, right at the same time where we all cared about it. So those things were sort of known for the people impacted day to day — the geographic inequity, the financial inequity, the racial inequity. If someone felt that that inequity, then they would talk about it, but it wasn&#8217;t something everyone cared about at the same time. So this massive spotlight was shed on the healthcare system. And the second was that everyone&#8217;s healthcare journey now starts online, even if it is going to end in person, it will still start online.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ro&#8217;s model all along has espoused this time of healthcare delivery, with remote care and telehealth appointments handling most day-to-day needs, and follow-up in person care delivered to the home when required. That obviously generate a lot of efficiencies, while ensuring that older patients and those with mobility issues also don&#8217;t need to leave the house and make a regular trip into their physician&#8217;s office for what amounts to a 15-minute visit that could&#8217;ve been handled over video.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128687" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128687" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2128687" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg" alt="Ro co-founders Rob Schutz, Zachariah Reitano and Saman Rahmanian (left to right)" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2128687" class="wp-caption-text">Ro co-founders Rob Schutz, Zachariah Reitano and Saman Rahmanian (left to right)</p></div></p>
<p>According to most industry observers, Reitano is likely right that healthcare probably won&#8217;t go back to the old, inefficient model of favoring primarily in-person care after the pandemic ends. One of the positive outcomes of the COVID-19 situation has been proving that telehealth is more than capable of handling a lot of the primary care needs of a lot of people, particularly when supplemented with remote monitoring and ongoing proactive health measures, too.</p>
<p>While Ro doesn&#8217;t work with insurance currently, Reitano points out that he&#8217;s not against the concept entirely – he just says that health insurance as it exists now doesn&#8217;t actual work as intended, since it&#8217;s meant to pool risk against an, expensive, uncertain and rare outcome. Eventually, he believes there&#8217;s a place for insurance in the overall healthcare mix, but first the industry needs to face a reckoning wherein its incentive structure is realigned to its actual core customer – patients themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Teamflow, founded by ex-Uber manager Flo Crivello, has raised an $11 million Series A just three months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/teamflow-lands-3-9-million-for-a-productive-virtual-hq-platform/">raising a $3.9 million seed f</a>or its virtual HQ platform. The latest round in the startup was led by Battery Ventures, with Menlo Ventures leading its previous financing event.</p>
<p>Teamflow’s raise comes just days after competitor<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sequoia-capital-puts-millions-of-dollars-into-gather-a-virtual-hq-platform/"> Gather announced a $26 million Series A round led by Sequoia Capital.</a> Another company, Branch, has raised a $1.5 million seed round from investors such as Homebrew and Gumroad’s Sahil Lavingia and is currently raising its Series A.</p>
<p>All these startups want to bring into the mainstream a game-like interface for people to toggle through during their work day. The reality is, all three companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">(and dozens of others)</a> likely can’t win. The winning difference lies in strategy, Teamflow’s Crivello tells me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I think in the early days, the biggest differentiator is going to be UX and our aesthetic,” he said. “A lot of the other players have a very gamified approach, and we&#8217;re big fans of that, but we think that people don’t want to have their [work] meetings in a Pokémon game.”</p>
<p>A tour through Teamflow’s office shows that the company is more focused on productivity than gamification. Integrations include a Slack-like chat feature as well as file and image sharing. It is working on an in-platform app store so users can download the integrations that work best with their team, Crivello said. There are games too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128503" style="width: 861px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128503" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2128503" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png" alt="" width="851" height="605" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png?resize=2048,1456 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128503" class="wp-caption-text">Teamflow&#8217;s virtual HQ platform.</p></div></p>
<p>This focus has helped Teamflow gain traction with employers instead of event organizers, a more stable source of revenue per the founder. The company currently hosts thousands of teams within startups on its platform, wracking in “hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue.” Gather, a competitor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sequoia-capital-puts-millions-of-dollars-into-gather-a-virtual-hq-platform/">recently told TechCrunch</a> that it gets the majority of its revenue from one-off events. Gather’s monthly revenue is currently $400,000, according to founder Philip Wang.</p>
<p>Gather, alternatively, looks and feels very different from Teamflow in that it is closer to the feel of Sims.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124265" style="width: 869px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124265" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2124265" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png" alt="" width="859" height="506" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png 1574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=768,452 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=1536,905 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124265" class="wp-caption-text">Gather&#8217;s virtual HQ platform.</p></div></p>
<p>Branch&#8217;s Dayton Mills said that it has been able to stay competitive through becoming &#8220;much more gamified.&#8221; It has added levels, in-game currencies and XP to encourage employees to customize their office space.</p>
<p>&#8220;Productivity isn’t broken, but culture, fun and social interaction is,&#8221; Mills told TechCrunch. &#8220;So when it comes to work and play we’re aiming to fix the play part, not the work. Work comes as a side effect.&#8221; Branch has not made revenue yet.</p>

<p>The next ambition for Teamflow is expanding its customer base beyond the hip experimental team at startups. Crivello noted that Zoom brings in about 40% of its revenue through enterprise sales, and Teamflow is resultedly “doubling down on enterprise readiness.”</p>
<p>The company will work on being compliant and upholding privacy standards so it can onboard healthcare and biotech companies, what it views as “buttoned up verticals” that might not want the other gamified approaches.</p>
<p>Crivello is clear about his vision for the startup: He wants to make it harder to move out of a virtual office than a physical office. If Teamflow can become an operating system of sorts long-term, adding on applications and bringing in a high quality of standards, it might be able to bring on a broader set of clients.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: Investors back away from Dispo</strong></p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3">a recent story in Business Insider</a> brought allegations to light that a member of David Dobrik&#8217;s vlog squad had sexually assaulted an extra during a shoot, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">Spark Capital announced</a> that it would &#8220;sever all ties&#8221; with Dobrik&#8217;s photo-sharing startup Dispo, as did fellow investors Unshackled Ventures and Seven Seven Six.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have stepped down from our position on the board and we are in the process of making arrangements to ensure we do not profit from our recent investment in Dispo,&#8221; said Spark, which led a $20 million Series A in Dispo less than a month ago.

					<description><![CDATA[At its most generous share count and highest projected price, Coursera's valuation could reach $5.56 billion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001651562/000119312521089500/d65490ds1a.htm">new S-1/A filing</a>, Coursera set an initial IPO price range between $30 and $33 a share, signaling the market views its edtech business warmly ahead of its impending public offering.</p>
<p>Coursera will have 130,271,466 shares outstanding after its IPO, or 132,630,966 including its underwriters’ option. At $30 per share, the low end of the company’s IPO range and a share count inclusive of 2,359,500 shares reserved for its underwriting banks, the firm would be worth $3.98 billion. That number rises to $4.38 billion at $33 per share.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Coursera is being valued as a software company, likely a breathe-easy moment for still-private edtech companies, since the debut could be an industry bellwether.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This is a solid increase from Coursera’s last private-market valuation, which was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2020/07/17/online-learning-platform-coursera-raises-130-million-at-reported-25-billion-valuation/?sh=306e1d2f688f">around $2.4 billion</a> when it raised a Series F round in October 2020.</p>
<p>For the bulls in the room, there’s a bigger valuation if you tinker with the numbers. In a fully diluted accounting, including in our calculation, shares that are issuable upon vested options and RSUs, Coursera’s share count rises to 166,006,474, or 168,365,974 if we count its underwriters’ option. At its most generous share count and highest projected price, Coursera&#8217;s valuation could reach $5.56 billion.</p>
<p>However, IPO-watching group Renaissance Capital <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/79790/Online-education-platform-Coursera-sets-terms-for-$495-million-IPO">comes to</a> a smaller $5.1 billion figure for a midpoint-range, fully diluted valuation. That result excludes shares reserved for underwriters and equity currently present in vested RSUs.</p>
<p>Using the more modest $5.1 billion midpoint figure, Coursera would be worth around 17.5 times its 2020 revenue of $293.5 million. Using a run-rate figure calculated from the company’s Q4 2020 results, its multiple falls to just over 15x.</p>
<p>Coursera is therefore being valued as a software company, likely a breathe-easy moment for still-private edtech companies, since the debut could be an industry bellwether.</p>
<p>The valuation is also a vote of confidence that Coursera’s rising deficits are not even a valuation risk, let alone an existential threat to its business. In the four quarters of 2020, the edtech giant lost $14.3 million, $13.9 million, $11.9 million and $26.7 million, the final Q4 net loss being the largest among the time interval for which we have data.</p>
<p>From all appearances, investors are valuing Coursera on its growth, not its profitability — or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Helping push its losses higher are rising sales and marketing costs, something<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/5-takeaways-from-the-coursera-ipo-filing/"> TechCrunch has written about in the past</a>. In Q4 2019, for example, the company spent $16.7 million on sales and marketing activities. That figure rose to $35 million in Q4 2020.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Shares of Box, a well-known content-and-collaboration company that went public in 2015, rose today after Reuters reported that the company is exploring a sale.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of <a href="http://box.com">Box</a>, a well-known content-and-collaboration company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/22/box-prices-ipo/">went public in 2015</a>, rose today after <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-box-m-a-exclusive-idUSKBN2BE28W">Reuters reported</a> that the company is exploring a sale. TechCrunch previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">discussed rising investor pressure</a> for Box to ignite its share price after years in the public-market wilderness.</p>
<p>At the close today Box’s equity was worth $23.65 per share, up around 5% from its opening value, but lower than its intraday peak of $26.47, reached after the news broke. The company went public a little over five years ago at $14 per share, only to see its share price rise to around the same level it returned today during its first day’s trading.</p>
<p>Box, famous during its startup phase thanks in part to its ubiquitous CEO and co-founder Aaron Levie, has continued to grow while public, albeit at a declining pace. Dropbox, a long-term rival, has also seen its growth rate decline since going public. Both have stressed rising profitability over revenue expansion in recent quarters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GbPPMSEOmo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">As activist investors loom, what’s next for Box?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As activist investors loom, what’s next for Box?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/embed/#?secret=GbPPMSEOmo" data-secret="GbPPMSEOmo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But the problem that Box has encountered while public, namely hyper-scale platform companies with competing offerings, could also prove a lifeline; Google and Microsoft could be a future home for Levie’s company, after years of the duo challenging Box for deals.</p>
<p>As recently as last week, Box announced a deal for <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210318005272/en/Box-Announces-Deeper-Integrations-With-Microsoft-365-to-Power-Secure-Collaboration-in-the-Cloud">tighter integration with Microsoft Office 365</a>. Given the timing of the release, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1372569232664375297">it was easy to speculate</a> the news could be landing ahead of a potential deal. The Reuters article adds fuel to the possibility.</p>
<p>While we can’t know for sure if the Reuters article is accurate, the possible sale of Box makes sense.</p>
<p>The article indicated that one of the possible acquisition options for Box could be taking it private again via private equity. Perhaps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/private-equity-firms-can-offer-enterprise-startups-a-viable-exit-option/">a firm like Vista or Thoma Bravo</a>, two firms that tend to like mature SaaS companies with decent revenue and some issues, could swoop in to buy the struggling SaaS company. By taking companies off the market, reducing investor pressure and giving them room to maneuver, software companies can at times find new vigor.</p>
<p>Consider the case of Marketo, a company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/vista-equity-partners-buys-marketo-for-1-8b-in-cash/">Vista purchased in 2016 for $1.6 billion</a> before turning it around and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/20/adobe-gets-its-company-snaring-marketo-for-4-75-billion/">selling to Adobe in 2018 for $4.75 billion</a>. The end result generated a strong profit for Vista, and a final landing for Marketo as part of a company with a broader platform of marketing tools.</p>
<p>If there are expenses at Box that could be trimmed, or a sales process that could be improved, is not clear. But Box’s market value of $3.78 billion could put it within grasp of larger private-equity funds. Or well within the reaches of a host of larger enterprise software companies that might covet its list of business customers, technology or both.</p>
<p>If the rumors are true, it could be a startling fall from grace for the company, moving from Silicon Valley startup darling to IPO to sold entity in just six years. While it’s important to note these are just rumors, the writing could be on the wall for the company, and it could just be a matter of when and not if.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Biden didn&#8217;t campaign on getting tough against Big Tech, but his early actions are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/tech-biden-era-cabinet-antitrust-transition/">speaking louder than his words</a>.</p>
<p>The White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/22/president-biden-announces-his-intent-to-nominate-lina-khan-for-commissioner-of-the-federal-trade-commission/">confirmed</a> its intentions to nominate Lina Khan to the FTC Monday, sending a clear signal that his administration will break from the Silicon Valley-friendly precedents of the Obama era. Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2021/03/09/biden-taps-lina-khan-for-ftc-commissioner-793869">first reported</a> Biden&#8217;s planned nomination of Khan, which will be subject to Senate confirmation, earlier this month.</p>
<p>Lina Khan is a star of the antitrust movement, insofar as a topic like regulating big business can produce one. Khan is best known for a paper she published as a law student in 2017 called <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">&#8220;Amazon&#8217;s Antitrust Paradox.&#8221;</a> The paper argues that thinking about what qualifies as monopolistic behavior hasn&#8217;t kept pace with how modern businesses operate, particularly within the tech sector.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She believes that a modernized approach to antitrust must look at market forces in a big picture way instead of only examining traditional measures like <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/dealings-competitors/price-fixing">price and output</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My argument is that gauging real competition in the 21st century marketplace — especially in the case of online platforms — requires analyzing the underlying structure and dynamics of markets. Rather than pegging competition to a narrow set of outcomes, this approach would examine the competitive process itself. Animating this framework is the idea that a company’s power and the potential anticompetitive nature of that power cannot be fully understood without looking to the structure of a business and the structural role it plays in markets. Applying this idea involves, for example, assessing whether a company’s structure creates certain anticompetitive conflicts of interest; whether it can cross-leverage market advantages across distinct lines of business; and whether the structure of the market incentivizes and permits predatory conduct.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As associate law professor at Columbia, Khan also contributed to a comprehensive <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf?utm_campaign=4493-519">report from the House&#8217;s antitrust subcommittee</a> last year that set the stage for major antitrust reform that could trim back Big Tech&#8217;s considerable overgrowth.</p>
<p>Khan isn&#8217;t the only high-profile tech antitrust crusader in the Biden administration&#8217;s orbit. In early March, Biden named Columbia law&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-staff/biden-adds-big-tech-critic-tim-wu-to-his-economic-staff-idUSKBN2AX1LS">Tim Wu</a> to shape technology and competition policy at the National Economic Council. Wu came up with the term &#8220;net neutrality&#8221; and is well known as an advocate for an open internet. In 2018, Wu authored &#8220;The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age,&#8221; a treatise calling out corporate consolidation in tech as a looming political and economic threat.</p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is leading tech-focused antitrust reform efforts through the Senate&#8217;s own antitrust subcommittee, praised Khan&#8217;s nomination. &#8220;We need all hands on deck as we work to take on some of the biggest monopolies in the world, and President Biden is making his commitment to competition policy clear,&#8221; Klobuchar said in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lina’s experience working both in Congress and at the Federal Trade Commission and as an advocate for competitive markets will be vital as we advance efforts to strengthen enforcement and protect consumers.&#8221;</p>

<p>With Frank, Google gets an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/uri-frank-95ab5330/">experienced chip industry executive</a>, who spent more than two decades at Intel rising from engineering roles to corporate vice president at the Design Engineering Group, his final role before leaving the company earlier this month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Frank will lead the custom chip division in Israel as part of Google. As he said in his announcement <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/uri-frank-95ab5330_build-for-everyone-google-careers-activity-6779764218351771648-dm7L">on LinkedIn</a>, this was a big step to join a company with a long history of building custom silicon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google has designed and built some of the world’s largest and most efficient computing systems. For a long time, custom chips have been an important part of this strategy. I look forward to growing a team here in Israel while accelerating Google Cloud&#8217;s innovations in compute infrastructure,&#8221; Frank wrote.</p>

<p>Google&#8217;s history of building its own chips dates back to 2015 when it launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/google-is-making-a-fast-specialized-tpu-chip-for-edge-devices-and-a-suite-of-services-to-support-it/">the first TensorFlow chips</a>. It moved into video processing chips in 2018 and added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/google-opentitan-secure-chip/">OpenTitan </a>, an open-source chip with a security angle in 2019.</p>
<p>Frank&#8217;s job will be to continue to build on this previous experience to work with customers and partners to build new custom chip architectures. The company wants to move away from buying motherboard components from different vendors to building its own &#8220;system on a chip&#8221; or SoC, which it says will be drastically more efficient.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of integrating components on a motherboard where they are separated by inches of wires, we are turning to “Systems on Chip” (SoC) designs where multiple functions sit on the same chip, or on multiple chips inside one package. In other words, the SoC is the new motherboard,&#8221; Vahdat wrote.</p>
<p>While Google was early to the &#8220;Build Your Own Chip&#8221; movement, we&#8217;ve seen other large scale companies like Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft begin building their own custom chips in recent years to meet each company&#8217;s unique needs and give more precise control over the relationship between the hardware and software.</p>
<p>It will be Frank&#8217;s job to lead Google&#8217;s custom chip unit and help bring it to the next level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/nyc">Techstars NYC</a> just announced the 10 startups participating in this year&#8217;s program, making up what Managing Director Jenny Fielding described as the accelerator&#8217;s most global class yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always had applications from around the world and I was always able to take companies from anywhere,&#8221; Fielding said. &#8220;But the truth is, when you run Techstars New York, if you don&#8217;t have five companies from New York, there&#8217;s a feeling that you&#8217;re letting the ecosystem down a little bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the program is almost entirely virtual, Fielding said she felt free to &#8220;open up the geos.&#8221; In fact, not a single one of the startups is based in New York — instead, there are multiple San Francisco and Washington, D.C. companies, as well as others based in the France, Israel, Kenya, Portugal and the United Kingdom.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fielding argued that even without New York startups, the accelerator still has a New York identity, because it connects global startups with the New York ecosystem.</p>
<p>After conducting last year&#8217;s accelerator virtually, Fielding said the hardest element to recreate has been the in-person camaraderie between the founders. So she&#8217;s hoping to have an in-person meetup here at the end of May, although the logistics of that meetup will depend on what&#8217;s safe and legal at that time (and what the entrepreneurs are comfortable with).</p>
<p>Other aspects of the virtual experience are likely to stick around post-pandemic. After all, Techstars hosts around 200 mentors per class, and Fielding said the virtual program marked the first time &#8220;nobody was late.&#8221; Similarly, she suggested that demo day remains an &#8220;open question,&#8221; as an extended period of investor meetings seems to be driving more fundraising for the startups.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here are the startups:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://spektra.co">Dash</a> (Nairobi, Kenya) — An alternative, cross-currency payment network for African consumers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.detech.ai">Detach.ai</a> (Lisbon, Portugal) — An AI operations platform focused on resolving issues proactively.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.elanzawellness.com">Elanza Wellness</a> (San Francisco and London, U.K.) — A fertility platform that brings together medical, lifestyle and mental health data.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gable.to">Gable</a> (San Francisco and Tel Aviv, Israel) — A &#8220;workspace as a service&#8221; company helping businesses find neighborhood workspaces for their employees.</li>
<li><a href="https://hiitide.com">Hiitide</a> (Chicago) — A marketplace that turns books into virtual book clubs and courses.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.onevillage.io/">OneVillage</a> (Washington, D.C.) — An online wishlist, planning tool and retailer for cancer patients and their supporters.</li>
<li><a href="https://paerpay.com">Paerpay</a> (Boston) — A contactless payment platform that doesn&#8217;t require additional hardware or app downloads.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.phalanx.io">Phalanx</a> (Washington, D.C.) — A company that secures AI systems using data, model validation and vulnerability scanning.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.phood.co">Phood</a> (Boulder) — A startup digitizing university student cards so they can be used payments in various online services.</li>
<li><a href="https://prediko.io">Prediko</a> (London, U.K. and Paris, France) — A startup focused on e-commerce inventory planning.</li>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic-induced growth of e-commerce is, by now, now well documented.</p>
<p>What is happening in the app ecosystem that supports e-commerce? Is it growing? Are we likely to see consolidations or IPOs? Are there superapps that will emerge?</p>
<p>This post is less about conclusions and more about taking you along while I go through the rabbit hole to satiate my own curiosity.</p>
<p>I see all three trends forming:</p>
<ol>
<li>Superapps are likely to emerge. I think companies like <a href="https://boldcommerce.com/">Bold Commerce</a> will be among the earliest superapps.</li>
<li>There will be consolidations anchored around large SaaS players and roll-ups powered by private equity funds.</li>
<li>There are players like Tiny that acquire early-stage firms and let them run independently.</li>
</ol>
<p>The closest match to the growing e-commerce stack is the marketing automation stack. While there are significant overlaps, it&#8217;s fascinating to compare and contrast the growth of these ecosystems and what drives consolidation.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Between 2015 and 2021, the martech stack grew from 1,800 to 8,000, meaning it roughly doubles every three years.</p>
<p>The explosion of the martech stack is common knowledge and is well documented by Scott Brinker and his <a href="https://chiefmartec.com/">famous supergraphics</a>. What&#8217;s worth noting is that the consolidation we expected to happen is happening, and yet the pace of new companies coming up in the space makes up for the consolidation — and some more.</p>
<p><a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2020/04/marketing-technology-landscape-2020-martech-5000/">According to Brinker</a>, the martech landscape grew 5,233% between 2011 and 2020. The fastest-growing category within martech in 2020 is data and governance, which grew in numbers by 25%. The martech app ecosystem more than tripled between 2015 to 2018, powered by the growth of SaaS and e-commerce industries.</p>
<p>I am an avid tracker of this space, but I am also interested in how we can apply martech’s evolution to the e-commerce stack. The e-commerce stack also grew 3.5 times between 2017 and 2020. But much of the growth is ahead, and so is the upcoming consolidation.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
