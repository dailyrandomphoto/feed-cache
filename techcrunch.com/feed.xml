										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://stableprice.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an insurtech aiming to help minimize a businesses’ risk due to volatile commodity prices, today announced it has raised $46.5 million in a Series A round of funding led by Greycroft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notion Capital, Anthemis, Continental Grain and existing backers Syngenta and Ascot also participated in the financing, which brings the Chicago-based startup’s total raised to about $50 million since its 2016 inception. Anthemis led its $3.5 million seed round in early 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder Richard Counsell is the son of a farmer and a former trader. When growing up, he saw firsthand how the volatility of commodity prices could have devastating impacts. His goal with Stable is to help “millions of businesses that are exposed to volatile commodity prices to manage the risk in a simple and effective way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, Stable wants to give businesses &#8212; particularly those in the $8 trillion food and farming industry &#8212; a way to purchase insurance to protect themselves from potential volatility in commodity prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup is on track to reach $500 million of annual premium within three years of launch, which, according to Greycroft Partner Ian Sigalow, could make it “the fastest growing insurtech ever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Counsell said he wanted to found Stable after he realized how little innovation the industry has seen since 1848 when the Chicago Board of Trade opened its doors with a mission to provide buyers and sellers of crops financial certainty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I set about creating a platform that combines modern tools like machine learning (AI), great UX and a clear and client-focused purpose to get back to our industry’s grassroots and become relevant again for businesses with a real risk to manage,” he said. “When trading shares on platforms like Robinhood has never been easier, why should it feel like you need a PhD to hedge your commodity risk?”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s parametric platform hosts more than 5,000 third-party indexes from 70 countries that can be used to purchase a policy to protect against an unexpected price rise or fall. Clients can select an index to customize a contract. Payouts are automated and reference the local or highly correlated index to minimize basis risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stable uses an index to simplify the risk transfer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Instead of having to work out the exact loss the company has faced we use an index as a proxy,” Counsell said. “So if you use an index the more the index is correlated to your actual risk the better. That’s why we have 5,000+ indexes &#8212; so we can create an index-based contract that is super precise and accurately reflects the client’s real risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other big advantage of using an index, he said, is that claims can be completely automated and no claims process is needed as it’s all agreed in advance &#8212; referencing the index they have chosen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So if the index is currently $100 and the client is a food buyer &#8212; they might know they lose money if the index reaches $120,” Counsell explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stable charges a premium and then provides a “payout” if the index goes higher than $120 in that case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our payment replaces the client’s lost income and provides the financial stability they are looking for,” Counsell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agricultural commodities are perishable and come in all shapes, grades and sizes, which makes them “very hard” to standardize and trade on an exchange, noted Counsell. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The result is that only 8% of commodities are available to trade on the likes of the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange), which makes purchasing risk management products such as futures or options contracts difficult without enormous basis risk,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the agrifood industry alone, more than $5 trillion of untraded commodity exposures are currently self insured, according to Counsell. Businesses that want to just protect their risk rather than trade or speculate might find hedging to be complex, risky or intimidating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve used a pretty sophisticated kind of machine learning to find the price of that risk, or the index rising or falling, and that took us three and a half years to do,” Counsell told TechCrunch. “We run like 62 trillion simulations every day to manage this and look for a price that is fair for the clients but also fair for the capital providers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major disruptions to the food chain, which has made manufacturers and producers even more aware of potential risks, Counsell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if a smoothie maker typically sells its product to a grocery store chain for a fixed price of $1 a can and the price of mangoes (which can be up to 50% of the cost) fluctuates a lot &#8212; Stable will pay the difference of anything that goes over 20%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just gives more certainty over the future,” Counsell said. “Whether they’re on the producer side, or buying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stable has operations in Chicago, Austin, New York City and London. It plans to use its new capital to build out its North American sales and marketing teams and hire data scientists, particularly in New York and London. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stable won regulatory approval earlier this year and as such is now starting to work with many large food businesses in the U.S., as well as farming organizations wishing to protect against future price falls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, Stable plans to expand into other sectors such as packaging, construction/timber and energy and geographically to Central and South America. Because the company is able to serve both producers and consumers of commodities, it “looks set to be popular in tractors as well as treasury departments in the months and years to come,” according to Counsell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50-person company is a regulated insurance business that works with “A-rated” re-insurers to take on the risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re just a technology platform. Our job is to find as many businesses as we can that need help, price the risk, manage their portfolio, reinsure all of that risk and pass on all that risk,” Counsell told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes money as if it were a broker, by charging a fixed commission for the business it brings back to its re-insurers.</span></p>
<p>Stable&#8217;s insurers are bullish about the company&#8217;s potential.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthemis’ Ruth Foxe Blader said she was drawn to Stable since it is so rare to have the opportunity to invest in “a truly new product.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stable is not just a better mousetrap,” she wrote via email. “It is a completely innovative way to conceive of protection against price movements in untraded commodities. Bespoke commodity price insurance did not exist before Stable launched this year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stable harnesses an “enormous” amount of index data to create “simple” protection products for clients with exposure to commodity price volatility,” Blader added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While the models are, individually, fairly straightforward, and therefore insurable, the sheer data science and machine learning horsepower within each Stable product was inconceivable even a few years ago,” she said. “The result is a simple, perfectly adapted commodity price insurance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Greycroft’s Sigalow </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was impressed by Counsell’s “unique perspective” on the crop insurance market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He assembled an amazing team of data scientists and subject matter experts, and we felt that this market could be hundreds of billions in premium annually,” he said. It also fit in well alongside Greycroft&#8217;s other insurance investments &#8212; such as Bright Health, Branch Insurance and Pie Insurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked how Stable compares to other similar offerings, Sigalow said he knew of none.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I haven’t seen this before in my career,” he told TechCrunch, “but when we called customers they would tell us that there were no substitutes and it was a total blue ocean.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Measuring growth is complex and challenging — and it’s only getting tougher. Changes to attribution in iOS 14 have forced growth marketers to rethink how they define their growth analytics engines.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s said that you should measure what you value, and for founders, nothing is more valuable than growth. Growth provides revenues, venture capital, prestige and scale — ultimately driving the success of every business. Yet, measuring growth is complex and challenging — and it’s only getting tougher. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">Changes to attribution in iOS 14</a> and further refinements in iOS 15, plus other privacy-preserving initiatives in the industry, have forced growth marketers to rethink how they define their growth analytics engines.</p>
<p>On the Extra Crunch stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>, we convened a distinguished panel of growth experts: Jenifer Ho, vice president of marketing at Elation Health; Shoji Ueki, head of marketing and analytics at Point; and Nik Sharma, the owner of Sharma Brands, a notable DTC growth marketing consultancy and investment shop.</p>
<p>We talked about the crisis around attribution and how startups should define their models, how to acquire the first customers in a business and when growth marketing should really start, and finally, how companies should select the right metrics for their business.</p>
<h2 id="The fundamentals of growth marketing: building the attribution model">The fundamentals of growth marketing: Building the attribution model</h2>
<p>Our conversation started with a deep dive into the world of attribution, which is a hot topic for growth marketers these days. Attribution is all about connecting marketing spend on channels like Facebook and Google to actual purchase actions made by a customer. If you display an Instagram ad for shovels, and that user then buys a shovel two days later, attribution models are designed to capture that activity.</p>
<p>Purchasing decisions can be quite involved for businesses and consumers, which is why defining attribution is so important for a startup’s success. When it comes to how to model it, Ueki emphasized one word to describe all aspects of attribution: Simplicity.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think one of the main things I&#8217;ve learned from experiences with attribution is that it&#8217;s really important to start basic and simple and then try to evolve from there. I’ve definitely been in companies where we&#8217;ve made that mistake before.</p>
<p>The example I like to give is, if you think about attribution, it’s a vehicle. It&#8217;s really enticing to try to build that Ferrari of attribution systems, but a lot of times when you&#8217;re just starting out, all you really need is a skateboard, right? It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s simple, and it gets the job done.</p>
<p>One example from a few years ago at SeatGeek: We tried to build a media-mix model before we had something much more basic in place. We invested a lot of time and effort into that with our data science team, but after all of that, it was actually never used and never adopted.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the ultimate goal of attribution is to measure incrementality, or how much incremental revenue is being generated by your marketing efforts. A complex media-mix model or multitouch attribution model is intended to do that, but it&#8217;s hard to do it right. For us, we had built one that actually didn&#8217;t serve that need of measuring your incrementality as much as possible. <em><b>(Timestamp: 2:48)<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volvo Cars, the Swedish carmaker owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding, said Monday it would file for an initial public offering and list on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, in a transaction that&#8217;s expected to raise up to $2.9 billion (25 billion Swedish kroner).</p>
<p>The deal could value the automaker at up to $25 billion, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/volvo-cars-unveils-plan-to-list-in-stockholm-11633346350">the Wall Street Journal reported</a>, citing sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>While Geely will sell a certain number of its shares, according to a press release, Volvo said the Chinese company will remain its largest shareholder following the deal; its Swedish institutional shareholders, Folksam and AMF, will also remain. In a statement, the Swedish automaker added that its relationship with Geely – and other companies in Geely’s ecosystem – “allows it to benefit from sharing existing and future technology, coordination of procurement and economies of scale to achieve synergies, competitiveness and deliver long-term value.”</p>
<p>Volvo made a voluntary commitment to shift its entire line-up to electric by 2030, with 50% of its sales volume to be electric by the middle of the decade. The proceeds from the IPO will go toward accelerating its transition to full electric “even in case of a weakening market environment,” the automaker said.</p>
<p>The news reinforces just how far Volvo has come over the past 11 years, after Ford Motor sold it at a major loss to Geely for $1.8 billion in 2010. (Ford had purchased the Swedish automaker for $6.5 billion in 1999.) Since its purchase by Geely, Volvo underwent a major expansion, building two vehicle assembly facilities in China and a factory in South Carolina. In June, Volvo said it would invest another $118 million into its South Carolina plant.</p>
<p>The turnaround is reflected in its sales. On Friday, Volvo reported a 17.6% increase in sales for the first nine months of this year, compared to the same period in 2020.</p>
<p>Volvo’s intention to go public comes on the heels of news from EV maker Polestar that it would merge with a special purpose acquisition company in a deal valued at $20 billion. Polestar, an arm of Volvo Car’s electric brands, is also owned by Geely. It seems likely that the timing is not a coincidence; according to WSJ reporting, the Polestar SPAC assigned a value of around $10 billion to Volvo’s stake in the company, paving the way for Volvo’s IPO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix is today officially launching a new feature for its Android users that will make it easier to find something to watch when you can&#8217;t make a decision. The feature, called &#8220;Play Something,&#8221; is a shuffle mode option that will play another movie or show Netflix believes you may like, based on your interests and your prior viewing behavior.</p>
<p>These selections may include a movie or show you&#8217;re already watching but haven&#8217;t completed, a movie or show on your watch list, or a brand-new series or film that Netflix&#8217;s personalization algorithms suggest, among other things.</p>
<p>The feature had been in development for some time before its public release. Last year, for example, Netflix was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/netflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen/">testing</a> it as &#8220;Shuffle Play.&#8221; And in its Q4 2020 earnings, Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/netflixs-shuffle-play-feature-will-roll-out-to-all-users-worldwide-this-year/">said</a> it would roll out its shuffle mode to users worldwide during the first half of 2021, describing it as a way to &#8220;instantly watch a title&#8221; that was chosen just for the user.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2211814" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?w=446" alt="" width="446" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png 5829w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?resize=98,150 98w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?resize=197,300 197w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?resize=768,1171 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?resize=446,680 446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?resize=1008,1536 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?resize=1343,2048 1343w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /></p>
<p>That rollout schedule was partially realized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Play Something,&#8221; as the feature was rebranded to, officially<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/netflix-launches-its-shuffle-feature-now-called-play-something-to-users-worldwide/"> launched to worldwide users on Netflix&#8217;s TV app</a> back in April. Here, the option can be found in several places, including on the profile selection screen underneath your profile name, on the navigation menu to the left of your screen, and on the tenth row on your Netflix homepage &#8212; a location that&#8217;s meant to appear right at the point where you&#8217;re beginning to get frustrated with browsing and may have otherwise exited the app. In addition, Netflix users with screen-readers could also use Text-to-Speech (TTS) to use &#8220;Play Something.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company said at the time it would soon start testing the feature on mobile devices, starting with Android. It then began those tests in late May.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other words, you may very well have had the feature on your own Android device long before this &#8220;official&#8221; debut &#8212; but not all of Netflix users globally have been able to try it yet.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s now changing, as Netflix is officially bringing &#8220;Play Something&#8221; to all Android mobile devices worldwide, with the rollout that starts today. The company says it will test the feature on iOS in the &#8220;coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p>On mobile, the &#8220;Play Something&#8221; button hovers over the content at the bottom of the phone&#8217;s screen as you scroll and also has its own dedicated tab in the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211815" style="width: 456px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211815" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2211815" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?w=446" alt="" width="446" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png 5829w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?resize=98,150 98w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?resize=197,300 197w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?resize=768,1171 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?resize=446,680 446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?resize=1008,1536 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?resize=1343,2048 1343w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211815" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>User response to the addition, so far, has been positive, Netflix noted &#8212; even pointing to a few tweets where <a href="https://twitter.com/jengolbeck/status/1370218863741304840?s=20">people</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/xxcarinaxx_/status/1379630999932387328?s=20">praised</a> the feature.</p>
<p>But for Netflix, the shuffle mode feature isn&#8217;t only about giving users another, easier way to watch &#8212; it&#8217;s a means of retaining users in the app before they jump to another entertainment option, whether that&#8217;s a rival streamer or even a social media app for video, like TikTok.</p>
<p>In fact, the threat from short-form video is serious enough that Netflix recently built its own TikTok-like feature for its mobile app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">called &#8220;Fast Laughs</a>,&#8221; which shows a feed of comedy videos meant to drive users to its content. Putting harder numbers to this potential threat, TikTok, at an event last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/merryh/status/1443037796613058566">noted</a> that 35% of its users were watching less TV due to TikTok, citing <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/time-well-spent">data from its own research.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Play Something&#8221; joins other newer additions as well, including a smart downloads feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/netflix-launches-downloads-for-you-a-new-feature-that-automatically-downloads-content-youll-like/">&#8220;Downloads for You</a>&#8221; and support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-partial-downloads-launch-android-130054347.html">partial play downloads</a>, as well as last year&#8217;s addition of the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/new-netflix-feature-reveals-the-top-10-most-popular-programs-on-its-service/"> Top 10 list</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that a lot of startups are trying to help developers reduce the complexity involved in coding an app. Last week we covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/runx-announces-4-1m-seed-to-simplify-cloud-infrastructure-deployment-for-developers/">the seed round for RunX</a>, a company that helps developers code back-end cloud resources more quickly. Today, <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/wasp">Y Combinator Winter 2021</a> graduate <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/">Wasp</a> announced a $1.5 million seed round to help programmers code the business logic side of the application faster.</p>
<p>Lunar Ventures and HV Capital co-led the round with help from 468 Capital, Tokyo Black, Acequia Capital, Abstraction Capital and a slew of individual angels.</p>
<p>Wasp CEO Matija Sosic said that he started the company in Croatia in 2019 with his twin brother Martin because they wanted to make it easier for developers to stitch together a group of services into a full stack web application. They ease this process by providing a configuration layer on top of whatever coding language developers are already using such as React or Node.js.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a very high level Wasp is a simple language for building full stack applications with less code and with the best practices [built in],&#8221; Sosic told me. &#8220;We want to provide a unified experience for developers, and we think that is one of the biggest values [of our solution] because they don&#8217;t have to assemble everything and [piece] different solutions together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like RunX, Wasp is an open source tool that&#8217;s available for free to any developer who wants to use it, and so far quite a few have with Sosic reporting around 300 apps that have been built using Wasp. For now they want to concentrate on the open source side of things and get the tooling right before they consider how they will generate revenue, but that is the eventual goal.</p>
<p>Sosic and his brother launched the company a couple of years ago with their own money and after releasing an early version of Wasp on Product Hunt at the beginning of this year, they started getting some initial interest, eventually getting into Y Combinator and scoring their seed round to continue developing the product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product is in alpha at the moment, and available for <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp">download at GitHub</a>. The plan is use this money to add features, get to beta and eventually release version 1.0 of the product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Life insurance has had a new lease of life in the era of insuretech, and today one of the companies building a business out of rethinking everything &#8212; from target customers through to how to provision and pay for insurance, and how much coverage to give &#8212; is announcing some funding on the back of strong growth. <a href="https://www.ladderlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ladder</a>, which providers flexible-term life insurance policies providing coverage ranging from $100,000 to $8 million, has raised $100 million in equity funding, a Series D that values the company at $900 million.</p>
<p>At a time when mortality is perhaps more present than usual to the average person &#8212; thanks, Covid-19 &#8212; Ladder has had a really strong year, with revenues growing four-fold (exact amount undisclosed). The Palo Alto-based startup, which operates in the U.S. only today, is on track to issue $30 billion in coverage by the end of this year.</p>
<p>(The company&#8217;s valuation is also a measure of that 4x growth: <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/120964-60/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook estimates</a> that in its last fundraise, in 2020, it was valued at around $238 million.)</p>
<p>Thomvest Ventures and OMERS Growth Equity co-led the Series D, and the company is not disclosing who else is in the round. Previous backers include strategics like the venture arms of Allianz Life and Northwestern Mutual, along with RRE, Canaan Partners, Lightspeed and others.</p>
<p>A wave of startups have emerged in the last several years with a mission to rethink the insurance model. Tapping into some of the same trends we are seeing in fintech, companies are leaning on technology built by others and embedding functionality by way of APIs to provide tools to people to find and get pricing for insurance policies.</p>
<p>Their unique selling points become easier-to-use interfaces on the web and via apps; a wider range of options in terms of pricing and coverage; and using algorithms and other new technology to produce quotes, close deals and initiate coverage much faster.</p>
<p>They are also targeting new demographics &#8212; for example <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/hedvig-banks-45m-to-expand-its-millennial-focused-insurance-service-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hedvig in Europe</a>, which is focused on providing insurance services primarily to people under the age of 30. Others include the likes of Lemonade; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/marshmallow-insurance-85-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marshmallow</a> in the UK rethinking inclusive car insurance; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/yulife-nabs-70m-at-a-346m-valuation-for-its-gamified-wellness-oriented-approach-to-life-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YuLife</a> presenting life insurance as a gamified, wellness-focused offering; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/bima-nabs-30m-more-for-micro-health-and-life-insurance-aimed-at-emerging-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bima</a> targeting emerging markets; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/ethos-picks-up-100m-at-a-2-7b-valuation-for-a-big-data-platform-to-improve-life-insurance-accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethos</a> lowering the barrier to entry for getting life insurance products; and so on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By providing flexible terms policies that can be searched for and purchased online, Ladder&#8217;s approach is in the same realm as many of these, with the added critical detail that it is vertically integrated, building not just user-friendly and modern interfaces and the risk-based algorithms that determine pricing, but also the underwriting, instant issue, and policy administration.</p>
<p>As with other vertically integrated approaches, this may give Ladder more operational overhead, but also potentially providers it with significantly more control around how it designs policies, how it can implement updates and changes, and of course in the long term, the margins it makes on sales, or conversely the savings it can pass to users. Ladder today claims to provide 40% savings to users compared to others on the market.</p>
<p>“I know first hand how life insurance can change a life,” said Jamie Hale, CEO and Co-Founder at Ladder, in a statement. “With our carrier in operation and this new round of funding, we are in the position to greatly accelerate innovation in service of families and communities. I am so excited to see our original vision continue to materialize.”</p>
<p>“The world is only becoming more digital, not less, and the life insurance industry to-date has been slow to modernize,” said Don Butler, MD, Thomvest Ventures, in a statement. “We are excited to invest in Ladder’s vision to build the digital life insurance company of tomorrow, and their announcement today that they are the first in operation shows that they are outpacing the industry.”</p>
<p>“Jamie Hale and his visionary management team are building Ladder into an innovative, market- leading digital life insurance company,” added Saar Pikar, MD and fintech lead, OMERS Growth Equity. “We are very pleased to count Ladder as OMERS Growth Equity’s first direct fintech investment – as well as our entry in the insurtech space, expanding on the insurtech presence established by our OMERS Ventures colleagues. We believe that the company offers a truly transformative approach, including through its efficient adjudication of risk and enhanced user experience.&#8221;</p>

Today, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-watch-series-7-orders-start-friday-october-8/">the company announced</a> that the popular wearable will go up for preorder this Friday (October 8), with in-store available starting a week later, on the 15<sup>th</sup>, for customers in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, UAE, UK and US.</p>
<p>The most notable addition here is a display that’s 20% larger than its predecessor, capable of fitting 50% more text. The screen is brighter as well, and fortified by stronger crystal, with the watch now sporting an IP6X rating for dust, coupled with the existing WR50 water rating for swimming. Contrary to rumors, the overall battery life hasn’t improved (rated at 18 hours), but charging is now 33% faster.</p>

<p>The smartwatch comes in five aluminum different case finish colors, including black, silver, blue, green and (Product) Red. There are three stainless steel colors (silver, graphite and gold) and two titanium. The Apple Watch Series 7 starts at $399, while the SE is available $279. The Series 3 is still available, as well, starting at $199.</p>
<p>Apple continues to <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/smartwatch-market-grows-27-yoy-q2-2021-apple-watch-user-base-crosses-100-million/">dominate global smartwatch marketshare</a>, leading chief competitors like Google and Samsung to combine forces on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-a-well-rounded-smartwatch/">Galaxy Watch 4</a>, which leverages both Wear OS and Tizen.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin&#8217;s next passenger list will include TV and film space exploration veteran William Shatner, along with Blue Origin&#8217;s own Audrey Powers, who serves as the company&#8217;s Voice President of Mission &amp; Flight Operations. These two will round out the four-person crew that includes previously announced passengers Chris Boshuizen and Glen de Vries, on a launch that is scheduled to fly on October 12.</p>
<p>Shatner, who of course played Captain James T. Kirk on Star Trek, will become the oldest person to have flown in space when he makes the trip, narrowly edging out current record holder Wally Funk, the aerospace pioneer who flew on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">Blue Origin&#8217;s first human spaceflight on July 20 alongside Jeff Bezos</a>. Shatner is 90, while Funk is 82.</p>
<p>Besides Bezos himself, Audrey Powers will be the first Blue Origin employee to make the journey to suborbital space with the company. She&#8217;s been on the Blue Origin team since 2013, and served as its deputy general counsel before leaving the mission and flight operations team for the company&#8217;s New Shepard rocket.</p>
<p>Boshuizen and de Vries, the who other previously announced passengers, were announced last week. Boshuizen is a Planet Labs co-founder, and current Partner at VC firm DCVC. De Vries is co-founder of a medical software startup, Medidata Solutions, that was acquired by Dassault Systems.</p>
<p>Blue Origin is currently facing scrutiny and criticism afte<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/chief-blue-origin-complaint-author-disputes-cause-of-termination-while-the-space-companys-ceo-does-damage-control/">r former employee Alexandra Abrams went public with a letter co-authored with 20 other current and former company employees</a> detailing accusations of safety concerns and a history of sexual harassment at the company. This doesn&#8217;t appear to have impacted the company&#8217;s launch schedule, though the FAA is said to be reviewing the safety concerns brought to light in the Abrams letter.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[CEO Yadhu Gopalan said Insight proactively approached the company, and Esper “jumped at the opportunity to partner with them to accelerate our trajectory and predict market growth quicker.”]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As DevOps SaaS platform <a href="https://esper.io/">Esper</a> continues to build out the category and the number of connected devices grows, the company took on another round of funding to stay ahead of demand.</p>
<p>Just five months after announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/esper-raises-30m-series-b-for-its-iot-devops-platform/">$30 million Series B round</a>, the company is back with an even bigger capital infusion — $60 million in Series C funding led by Insight Partners. Existing investors, including the Series B lead Scale Venture Partners, Madrona Ventures and Root Ventures, also participated. The investment brings Esper&#8217;s total funding to $100 million.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Yadhu Gopalan told TechCrunch that there are already billions of IoT devices out there currently, and that it is growing exponentially each year. The growth is coming from technology innovation and companies reprioritizing how they will be doing this, especially amid the global pandemic.</p>
<p>“They see reasons, from needing alternatives to doing business remotely to putting new uses in front of customers,” he added. “The trend started earlier as devices became cloud connected. That is the key, companies moving away from closed solutions to cloud and wanting to provide good customer experiences. We are solving the problem for use.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Esper raises $30M Series B for its IoT DevOps platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/esper-raises-30m-series-b-for-its-iot-devops-platform/embed/#?secret=JbbiusWfvV" data-secret="JbbiusWfvV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Using Esper, organizations can remotely scale, manage, secure and update those devices and custom apps by using DevOps practices that Gopalan said are now considered standard operations.</p>
<p>However, he notes that the industry is “still about 10 years behind where it should be,” and that is the need that Esper is addressing.</p>
<p>While it may be behind, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2637/internet-of-things/">Internet of Things</a> is not slowing down for anyone to catch up. It is projected to be a $1.1 trillion category by 2027 and the number of active IoT-connected devices ​​is expected to reach 30.9 billion units by 2025. The enterprise side of that includes devices like the tablets used in travel, restaurants and warehouses, medical devices, fitness equipment and in-store kiosks.</p>
<p>Today, Seattle-based Esper has more than 200 paying customers and over 2,000 developers using its platform for product development. Revenue growth is on target to be four times higher over last year, and Esper quadrupled its headcount this year, Gopalan said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some of the ways the company is keeping up with demand is enabling organizations to sign up and start for free with 100 devices to see how the platform works. It is also working with partners and creating other channels.</p>
<p>“Aside from what is available, we want potential customers to experience the feature before we talk to them about doing it full-time,” he added. “It really gives them a mechanism to see the features and the difference it could make. If they decide to continue, they can use the same tools, they don’t have to switch over.”</p>
<p>The new capital will also play into this. Insight proactively approached the company, and Esper “jumped at the opportunity to partner with them to accelerate our trajectory and predict market growth quicker,” Gopalan said.</p>
<p>He intends to use the new funding to reach more customers, explaining that though the company is one of the leaders in the space, there is always room for improvement, and Esper will get there through marketing and partnerships.</p>
<p>The company’s next steps are about continuing to build its product and improve customer experience and support.</p>
<p>“Soon, we will have single fleets of millions of devices and will have to help customers visualize how to manage those and how it is different from what they are doing today,” Gopalan added. “We see ourselves as the leaders in the space, and the category we are building addresses mission-critical devices. Customers need them to operate on a continued basis, and improve on the continued basis, and we can enable that.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Its platform enables employees to better understand and manage their pre-tax benefits from one dashboard.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Company benefits make or break the ability to recruit top talent. On one side of that is 401(k), while on the other are consumer-directed benefits, any accounts offered by the employer to use for a designated purpose that typically has tax-advantaged benefits.</p>
<p><a href="https://elevate.inc/">Elevate</a> has a new approach to how employers and employees access, manage and experience consumer-directed benefits. Former Businessolver executive Brian Cosgray and former ConnectYourCare founder Brian Strom started the company in 2020.</p>
<p>CEO Cosgray explained that these benefits are most commonly the out-of-pocket healthcare expenses an employee has, like health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, commuting expenses, tuition reimbursement or even reimbursement of expenses for adoption or fertility treatments.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UqehwnmqLu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/catch-takes-hold-of-12m-to-provide-benefits-that-arent-tied-to-employers/">Catch takes hold of $12M to provide benefits that aren&#8217;t tied to employers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Catch takes hold of $12M to provide benefits that aren&#8217;t tied to employers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/catch-takes-hold-of-12m-to-provide-benefits-that-arent-tied-to-employers/embed/#?secret=UqehwnmqLu" data-secret="UqehwnmqLu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Statistics show that <a href="https://ecfc.org/page/BytheNumbers">95% of American companies offer these benefits</a>, but are only used by 95 million American employees. Meanwhile, with <a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/enrollment-changes-to-high-definition-health-insurance-plans#nation">half of Americans enrolled in high-deductible healthcare plans</a> and <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/press-release/2020/new-survey-two-of-five-working-age-adults-do-not-have-stable-health-coverage">21% of working-age individuals underinsured</a>, consumer-directed benefits programs are meant to help offset rising costs that employers and employees end up paying, Cosgray said.</p>
<p>And, with anything involving the tax code, administration of these types of benefits can get complicated. Cosgray saw this firsthand: At his former company, he sold these types of benefits to large employers, but was constantly coming up against the same issue of an industry heavily reliant on a paper-based process.</p>
<p>“It is hard for employees to understand and make use of these benefits when there&#8217;s tons of legalese and tons of jargon,” he told TechCrunch. “They don&#8217;t know which card to use, mainly because there were multiple cards due to growth of the industry through consolidation. I went looking for a better alternative and couldn&#8217;t find one.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211528" style="width: 1420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211528" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2211528 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Elevate-activity-detail-view-2.png" alt="Elevate consumer directed benefit dashboard" width="1410" height="844" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Elevate-activity-detail-view-2.png 1410w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Elevate-activity-detail-view-2.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Elevate-activity-detail-view-2.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Elevate-activity-detail-view-2.png?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Elevate-activity-detail-view-2.png?resize=680,407 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Elevate-activity-detail-view-2.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1410px) 100vw, 1410px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211528" class="wp-caption-text">Elevate consumer directed benefit dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Elevate</p></div></p>
<p>The Denver-based company emerged Monday from a year in stealth mode. Its platform enables employees to view, plan and manage their pre-tax benefits from one web and mobile dashboard. There is also one contactless card for all of the benefits, and claims are processed instantly with reimbursement taking place within minutes. On the employer side, they can customize their offering with standard templates for many of the common plans and then configure the plan for their particular market or plan.</p>
<p>To date, the company raised $15 million in total funding, $12 million of it a new capital infusion of Series A funding, co-led by Greycroft and Norwest Venture Partners, with participation from existing investor Bowery Capital. Elevate intends to put the new funds to work in sales, continued product innovation and hiring additional talent for its implementation and service teams.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cosgray said it was too early to discuss growth metrics, but said the company spent a year building out the product and now has its first set of customers. It will be rolling out to a few distribution partners in the first quarter that will give Elevate access to approximately 900 employers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ellie Wheeler, partner at Greycroft, invests heavily in the digital healthcare space and said that as with other areas that touch consumers, employees are expecting a platform that makes sense, is as easy to use as other products and gives them flexibility in the way they can use it.</p>
<p>Rather than provide $150 to a very specific gym, employers are moving toward a benefit like a lump sum that can be allocated as the employee pleases: some for transportation, some for childcare or some for healthcare, she said.</p>
<p>She believes Elevate is coming into the market with deep domain knowledge and expertise. The founders are also building a product “for the modern world” that isn’t making assumptions about needs and wants, but building in the flexibility for employers and employees to decide that.</p>
<p>“They know all the players and are not coming up the curve on the market, they know what it is,” Wheeler added. “They know how to win, and they&#8217;re off to a running start.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company’s proprietary platform vets ethical and sustainable businesses along the supply chain and uses technology to connect brands with that network of suppliers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jane Mosbacher Morris started her career in the U.S. Department of State helping women fight terrorism. Now she is helping them find fairly paid work.</p>
<p>She recognized that for women to drive change they needed access to resources, so she started studying agriculture and other sectors and become interested in the strategic investment in supply chain.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211673" style="width: 463px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211673" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2211673" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CC09.jpg?w=453" alt="" width="453" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CC09.jpg 3712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CC09.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CC09.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CC09.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CC09.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CC09.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CC09.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CC09.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211673" class="wp-caption-text">Carrie Colbert, founder and general partner of Curate Capital, and Jane Mosbacker Morris, founder of To The Market</p></div></p>
<p>“What I noted was that retail manufacturing is the largest economies of scale and dominated by women in the supply chain,” Mosbacher Morris told TechCrunch. “However, there was not enough strategic investment into it to drive ethical and sustainable retail products. We started thinking about how we could be the catalyst and elevate roles to be able to fully participate in the global supply chain.”</p>
<p>She started <a href="https://tothemarket.com/">To The Market</a> in 2016 with the vision of democratizing that access to the global supply chain while also protecting the environment and promoting businesses, especially those founded by women. The company’s proprietary platform vets ethical and sustainable businesses along the supply chain and uses technology to connect brands with that network of suppliers. Its syndicated supply chain now includes over 200 makers in 50 countries.</p>
<p>The company announced a Series A round of funding Monday and Mosbacher Morris confirmed it was $5 million. The financing was led by Curate Capital and included Working Capital Fund, Spouting Rock and Forward Ventures, as well as follow-on investment from Belle Fund, Knightsgate Ventures and a group of strategic angel investors.</p>
<p>“To The Market is becoming a seal of approval for ethically made goods,” said Carrie Colbert, founder and general partner of Curate Capital. “They are going to be the end all, be all for these vetted sources. I applaud them for their growth in 2020. This team not only weathered the storm of the pandemic because they are so well-positioned, but when makers were unable to get goods out of China, Jane had an extensive network ready to meet their needs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mosbacker Morris said that because of its investment in the vendor matrix, the company is “at least a decade ahead of any other connector,” not only in the sustainability and ethical characteristics, but also in business performance.</p>
<p>Retailers To The Market is working with include Nordstrom Rack, TJ Maxx, Burlington and Bloomingdales. The company intends to put the funding to use around new growth. That includes expanding the team, technology development and capturing more of the market. The company has about 20 employees, “a lean and mean team,” Mosbacher Morris called it.</p>
<p>“We are partnering with makers not in China to add more value to the global supply chain and for U.S. companies that, in particular, have previously been hyper focused on one country,” Mosbacher Morris said. “This pandemic has shown us that it is critical to have a diversified, syndicated supply chain.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In preparation for the holiday shopping season, Amazon today <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazons-new-mobile-shopping-feature-makes-gifting-convenient">convenient</a> a new way to send gifts through its mobile app. Instead of entering in the recipient&#8217;s mailing address &#8212; a piece of information people often don&#8217;t know in today&#8217;s age of digital communications &#8212; Prime members can now send a gift to a friend via their phone number or email address.</p>
<p>The feature works by offering an alternative to entering in a delivery address at checkout. If you don&#8217;t have someone&#8217;s address, you&#8217;ll be able to select a new option that says, &#8220;Let the recipient provide their address.&#8221; You then enter in the person&#8217;s email address or mobile phone number.</p>
<p>When checkout is complete, the gift recipient will then receive either an email or text, depending on what information you provided, that lets them accept the gift by providing Amazon with their preferred delivery address from their own Amazon account. They also have the option of exchanging the item in question for an Amazon gift card of the same amount &#8212; something that&#8217;s possible because the gift-giver selected the &#8220;add a gift receipt&#8221; option at checkout. This exchange can be done without notifying the gift-giver, of course, just as in real life. And because Amazon showed the recipient what was purchased, they can still say thank you for the specific gift that had been picked out.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WbaD-dl83cg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The addition isn&#8217;t being made available to anyone who wants to shop Amazon. The retailer is instead using it as another lure to encourage users to sign up for a Prime membership ($119/year or $12.99/mo). As it tackles one of the annoyances of the gift-giving season, it could perhaps encourage a few fence-sitters to sign up. But more than likely, it&#8217;s not enough of a reason to encourage those who weren&#8217;t yet considering an Amazon Prime subscription to join. After all, you can always ask your family member, friend, or colleague to simply provide their address. But for those who already have a Prime subscription, it could serve as a useful retention strategy, especially for last-minute gift-giving or those times where you forgot a gift.</p>
<p>Amazon says the feature will roll out to Prime members in the U.S. on its mobile app beginning on Oct. 4.</p>
<p>The retailer today also announced its<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-unveils-black-friday-worthy-deals-earlier-than-ever"> early Black Friday deals</a>, and a multi-week <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-beauty-kicks-off-first-ever-holiday-beauty-haul-shopping-event">beauty haul event</a> with discounts on a variety of products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

Now, the whistleblower who brought that information to light has revealed herself as Frances Haugen in an interview with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-misinformation-public-60-minutes-2021-10-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em>60 Minutes</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/03/technology/whistle-blower-facebook-frances-haugen.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>New York Times</em></a> has reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve seen a bunch of social networks and it was substantially worse at Facebook than what I had seen before,&#8221; Haugen told <em>60 Minutes</em>. &#8220;Facebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haugen joined Facebook in 2019, working on democracy and misinformation issues, while also handling counterespionage, according to a <a href="https://www.franceshaugen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">personal website</a>and <a href="https://twitter.com/FrancesHaugen_" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Twitter account</a> she and her team set up. She worked as a Facebook product manager and left the company in May.</p>
<p>She first brought &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of pages of internal Facebook documents to Whistleblower Aid founder John Tye, requesting legal protection and help in releasing the information. The trove included internal company research, slide decks, cover letters and more. She also filed a whistleblower complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), accusing Facebook of taking internal actions that didn&#8217;t match its public statements.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Whistleblower Frances Haugen is a data scientist from Iowa with a computer engineering degree and a Harvard MBA. She told us the only job she wanted at Facebook was to work against misinformation because she had lost a friend to online conspiracy theories. <a href="https://t.co/csgaRe6k5h">https://t.co/csgaRe6k5h</a> <a href="https://t.co/tSNav057As">pic.twitter.com/tSNav057As</a></p>
<p>&mdash; 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) <a href="https://twitter.com/60Minutes/status/1444810361996292099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the SEC complaint, Haugen compared Facebook&#8217;s internal research and documents to public statements and disclosures made by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives. In one example, she said that Facebook contributed to election misinformation and the January 6th US Capitol insurrection.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Facebook has publicized its work to combat misinformation and violent extremism relating to the 2020 election and insurrection,&#8221; she wrote in a cover letter on the subject. &#8221; In reality, Facebook knew its algorithms and platforms promoted this type of harmful content, and it failed to deploy internally recommended or lasting countermeasures.&#8221;</p>
<p>The site allows divisive content because it promotes engagement, she noted. &#8220;Its own research is showing that content that is hateful, that is divisive, that is polarizing, it’s easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions,” Haugen told <em>60 Minutes</em>. “Facebook has realized that if they change the algorithm to be safer, people will spend less time on the site, they’ll click on less ads, they’ll make less money.&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of being in touch with the SEC&#8217;s whistleblower office, which normally provides protections for corporate tipsters, she and her legal team contacted Senators Richard Blumenthal (D) and Marsha Blackburn (R). She also spoke to lawmakers in France and Britain, along with a member of the European parliament.</p>
<p>Facebook, which has struggled to quell leaks of late, preemptively pushed back ahead of the 60 Minutes interview, calling the accusations &#8220;misleading.&#8221; VP for policy and global affairs Nick Clegg told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/03/media/reliable-sources-facebook-vp-interview/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><em>CNN</em></a> that Facebook represented &#8220;the good, the bad and the ugly of humanity&#8221; and that it was trying to &#8220;mitigate the bad, reduce it and amplify the good.&#8221; He added that it was &#8220;ludicrous&#8221; to blame January 6th on social media.</p>
<p>In a statement to Engadget, Facebook spokesperson Lena Pietsch said the &#8220;segment also disregards the significant investments we make to keep people safe on our platform&#8230; to suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.&#8221; The company also pushed back against any claims it was misleading the public or regulators. &#8220;We stand by our public statements and are ready to answer any questions regulators may have about our work.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end, Haugen said she wants to help fix Facebook, not see it taken down. &#8220;The path forward is about transparency and governance,” she said in the video. “It’s not about breaking up Facebook.&#8221; Haugen is set to testify in Congress about issues surrounding Facebook&#8217;s impact on young users on Tuesday, December 5th.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Welp, it was an EV heavy week, starting with the Polestar SPAC and ending with the Rivian IPO filing (curses to the late Friday regulatory filing). Oh, and Tesla&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/02/tesla-delivers-record-breaking-number-of-vehicles-in-third-quarter/">record-breaking delivery</a> and production numbers posted Saturday, which blew past analyst expectations.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other insights tucked in here, including Aria Alamalhodaei&#8217;s policy corner, which is focused on jobs this week, and Rebecca Bellan&#8217;s roundup of micromobility news.</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During his presidency, Donald Trump removed bikeshare stations on the White House campus. As of this week, the bikeshare is back.</p>
<p>Capital Bikeshare, a D.C.-area bikeshare program that&#8217;s operated by Lyft, has reinstalled an 11-dock Buy America-compliant station at the E Street NW and South Executive Avenue entrance of the campus. It&#8217;s only available to those who have access to the White House grounds, so the general public won&#8217;t be able to see it in the apps.</p>
<p>Still, the move is good for all of us; the more lawmakers (or more likely their staff) start using zero-emissions methods of travel, the more they&#8217;ll see the utility in shared micromobility programs, the more they&#8217;ll hopefully enact policies to support them.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935121010033?dgcid=author">recent study</a> found that bikeshare systems in the U.S. save $36 million per year in healthcare costs, as well as help reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions from the transportation sector. In other words, I see your electric cars and I raise you more bikes.</p>
<p>D.C. gets it. The council recently approved Mayor Bowser&#8217;s Fair Shot Budget, which included $19 million to add 80 new Capital Bikeshare stations and 3,000 e-bikes to the fleet. The plan also stipulates that every D.C. resident will live within a quarter-mile of a bikeshare station.</p>
<h3>Money coming into micromobility</h3>
<p>Electric motorcycle manufacturer <strong>Cake</strong> closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/e-motorcycle-maker-cake-closes-60m-round-to-scale-production-and-retail-sales/">$60 million Series B round</a> just a few weeks after launching a new city utility bike called the Makka. The company will use the funds to set up manufacturing facilities in Europe, North America and Asia so that it can save money and carbon emissions on shipping out bikes across the world. Cake also plans to scale up retail capabilities, introducing showrooms to major cities this fall.</p>
<p>German startup <strong>Dance</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/dance-raises-another-19-4-million-for-its-e-bike-subscription-service/">raised $19.4 million</a> just a few weeks after the company started rolling out its e-bike subscription service in Berlin. The company&#8217;s subscription service costs $93 per month for a white glove rental experience of the Dance One, its in-house designed e-bike. Dance will use the money to double the size of its operations and engineering teams and expand to more cities across Europe next year.</p>
<p><strong>Ola Electric</strong> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/ola-electric-raises-200-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">raised over $200 million</a> at a valuation of $3 billion, money it will use to scale its electric vehicle manufacturing business in South Asia. Ola Electric recently came out with its first electric scooter, the Ola S1, but said it would use the new funds to develop other e-vehicles, like a motorbike, a mass market scooter and an electric car. The company has previously said it plans to go public sometime next year.</p>
<h3>E-scooters, but make it competitive</h3>
<p>The <strong>eSkootr Championship</strong> (eSC), the world&#8217;s first electric kickscooter race, is a thing. (It&#8217;s happening in 2022.)</p>
<p>The eSC unveiled the S1-X electric scooter earlier this year. Now, they&#8217;re <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/29/check-out-the-absurdly-fast-60-mph-standing-electric-scooters-built-for-the-esc-racing-league/">providing a closer look</a> and sharing some specs. The scooters can reach speed of more than 60 miles per hour, splitting their power between two in-wheel hub motors and a special boost button for an extra 20% of power on straightaways.</p>
<h3>Deliveroo&#8217;s first dark store</h3>
<p>British online food delivery company <strong>Deliveroo</strong> has teamed up with supermarket giant Morrisons to <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/business/deliveroo-hop-rapid-grocery-service-10-to-15-minutes-launches-in-london-b958093.html">launch its first &#8220;dark store&#8221;</a> for rapid grocery deliveries in central London. &#8220;Deliveroo Hop,&#8221; as the new service is being cutely called, promises to deliver goods in 10 minutes or less. London is already full of such services from other funny-named companies like Jiffy, Getir, Zapp and Weezy, but we&#8217;re seeing (or rather hearing about) these dark stores opening up in cities around the globe. Does anyone else feel a stab of anxiety for the gig workers who have to make such quick deliveries?</p>
<h3> Transit equity and affordability</h3>
<p>Orion Electrics Company is both <a href="https://www.wvxu.org/community/2021-09-30/orion-company-low-cost-e-bike">selling e-bikes</a> at an affordable rate (starting at $899) and placing rental e-bikes in low-income neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Whereas other services might cost you $10 to ride for 20 minutes, Orion&#8217;s service will allow riders to reserve a bike for as little as $10 per month or $60 per year for unlimited access, distance and time. The company is also working with communities, companies and educational institutions to provide users free access to bikes for a contractual fee. Orion plans to start testing in Columbus, Ohio in 2022 and in Cincinnati in 2023.</p>

<p>Rivian! Late Friday, Rivian made its IPO filing public and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000119312521289903/d157488ds1.htm#toc157488_9">released its S-1</a>, which is perhaps my favorite document that exists in the world.</p>
<p>After cranking out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/rivians-ipo-filing-is-now-public/">breaking news story</a>, Alex Wilhelm and I took the first deeper look at the S-1 and came up with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/rivians-ipo-filing-is-now-public/">seven takeaways</a>; it&#8217;s a TechCrunch+ article (yes, it&#8217;s no longer called Extra Crunch), but I pushed the paywall down a skosh.</p>
<p>I have since spent a bit more time with it, plus received a few friendly texts and emails from others who have spotted interesting nuggets. Rivian has not yet set terms for the IPO, so we don&#8217;t have that. But there are plenty of other items to consider.</p>
<p>I will highlight just a couple of them.</p>
<p>First up, Rivian outlined a number of future businesses beyond the traditional automotive play of making money from assembling, selling and financing vehicles. This is a route that even the big legacy automakers are aiming for. The difference is that Rivian is doing this from the beginning.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it plans to sell a variety of vehicle variants that hit different price points. That likely means cheaper vehicles that fall below its current range of $67,000 to $75,000-priced EVs. After an initial focus on the U.S. and Canadian markets, it plans to enter Western European markets in the near-term, followed by major Asian-Pacific markets. And to support those sales, Rivian plans to localize production &#8212; that means more factories.</p>
<p>Another obvious but important growth area is Rivian&#8217;s plan to to offer integrated hardware such as charging, generation, and storage as well as software-based energy management solutions in the residential, industrial, and commercial markets.</p>
<p>The company said in its S-1 that it plans to build multiple vehicles within the consumer and commercial sectors. That commercial sector is interesting to me, especially after I noticed this little item further down, where Rivian says its believes it &#8220;will become the largest centrally managed EV fleet,&#8221; allowing the company &#8220;to unlock future service offerings, including <strong>autonomous mobility-as-a-service for the movement of people and goods.</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>Next up, <strong>Amazon</strong>. As we mentioned in our Friday article, there are 81 mentions of Amazon in the Rivian S-1 filing. The number is high as Amazon is both an investor in the company, and a customer. Per the filing, Amazon owns at least 5% of Rivian, though the final number is not yet available. Ford also has a stake greater than 5%, along with a number of investors.</p>
<p>But past investment, Rivian&#8217;s commercial fleet is largely designed with Amazon in mind. Which makes sense as the American e-commerce giant is expected to purchase some 100,000 vehicles from the company. While, Rivian notes that certain aspects of the commercial electric vans (EDV) design and styling will remain exclusive to Amazon, the partnership is not.</p>
<p>Under the terms, Rivian will exclusively provide last-mile delivery vehicles to Amazon&#8217;s logistics unit the fourth anniversary of the &#8220;Initial Delivery Date.&#8221; I interpret that initial delivery date as December 2021, which is when Rivian will deliver 10 production ready vans. The terms also say that between the fourth anniversary to the sixth anniversary of the Initial Delivery Date, Amazon has a right of first refusal to purchase last mile delivery vehicles that Rivian produces.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Ford</strong>, which as I noted earlier holds more than 5% of Rivian stock. Two items pop out — one of which is a courtesy of an eagle-eyed reader.</p>
<p>Rivian and Ford (specifically its Troy Design and Manufacturing subsidiary) reached a deal in April 2019 for the development, production and supply of all prototype and pre-production &#8220;bodies in white&#8221; vehicles across the R1T, R1S, and EDV vehicle programs. This means that Ford produced Rivian&#8217;s early prototype builds since 2019. Rivian said that it stop purchasing from Troy Design and will stamp and assemble its own &#8220;BIWs&#8221; (bodies in white) once its Normal, Illinois factory advances to steady-state vehicle production. Rivian paid Ford $8 million in 2019 and $66 million in 2020 for this service.</p>
<p>And lastly (thanks for hanging in there) &#8230; despite Ford&#8217;s stock position and relationship with Rivian, it no longer has any representatives on its board of directors. Joe Hinrichs was on Rivian&#8217;s board until 2020, when he abruptly left Ford. Alexandra Ford English, Bill Ford&#8217;s daughter, was appointed to Rivian&#8217;s board in May 2020, presumably to fill Hinrichs&#8217; vacancy, but stepped down in May 2021.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amazon and Cox Automotive still have spots on the board.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let&#8217;s turn briefly to another potentially big deal: Polestar. The company reached an agreement to go public via special purpose acquisition with Gores Guggenheim Inc., The SPAC deal would give <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/26/swedish-ev-maker-polestar-reportedly-preparing-to-go-spac-at-21b-valuation/">the combined company a valuation of $20 billion</a>. Once the merger closes, the combined company will be held by a new public company named Polestar Automotive Holding UK Limited. The company is expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol &#8220;PSNY.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polestar falls under Volvo Car Group&#8217;s electric performance brand, but both Polestar and Volvo are owned by Chinese car maker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.</p>
<p>With this announcement, Polestar joins a mass of EV makers that will have gone public via SPAC, including Arrival, Canoo, Fisker, Lordstown Motors and Lucid Group. Rivian is the one EV maker outlier that is taking the traditional IPO route.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>AutoLeap</strong>, an auto repair software company, raised $18 million in a Series A round led by Bain Capital Ventures, with repeat participation from Threshold Ventures, which led AutoLeap&#8217;s $5 million Seed round in September 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Contemporary Amperex Technology</strong>, China&#8217;s battery-making giant known as CATL, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/02/china-roundup-tesla-catl-millennial-lithium/">agreed to acquire</a> Vancouver, Canada-based Millennial Lithium in an all-stock cash deal valued at CAD$377 million, or $297 million.</p>
<p><strong>Energize Ventures</strong>, an early and growth-stage venture fund, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/energize-ventures-raises-330m-to-fund-energy-mobility-and-climate-resiliency-technology/">closed its second fund</a> with total capital commitments of $330 million. Fund II will be used to help scale and commercialize software across renewable energy, mobility, cybersecurity, battery storage, critical infrastructure and climate resiliency. The fund is backed by anchor investors such as Invenergy, CDPQ, SE Ventures, GE Renewable Energy and Hannon Armstrong. Credit Suisse, Xcel Energy, American Electric Power and Equinor Ventures also participated.</p>
<p><strong>NASA</strong> picked GE Aviation and MagniX to develop <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/nasa-awards-253m-to-two-companies-developing-electric-propulsion-tech-for-aircraft/">electric propulsion technologies</a> for aircraft, with the aim of introducing this tech to U.S. aviation fleets by 2035. The awards, granted under the agency&#8217;s Electric Powertrain Flight Demonstration (EPFD) program, have a combined value of $253.4 million. Of that, $179 million was awarded to GE Aviation, with MagniX receiving $74.3 million.</p>
<p><strong>Ninja Van</strong>, the Singapore-based logistics company, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/ninja-van-raises-578-mln-funding-round-adds-alibaba-investor-2021-09-26/">raised $578 million</a> and it could be about 18 months before it taps public markets for an IPO, Reuters reported. Alibaba Group joined as an investor in its late stage funding round. Existing investors include European parcel delivery network GeoPost/DPDgroup, Monk&#8217;s Hill Ventures and Facebook Inc. co-founder Eduardo Saverin&#8217;s B Capital Group.</p>
<p><strong>Ralf Spath</strong>, who was CEO of Jaguar Land Rover until 2020, is<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1861541/000110465921120271/tm2117318-2_s1.htm"> leading a SPAC</a> called Pegasus Pegasus Digital Mobility Acquisition  that filed for an IPO.</p>
<p><strong>Swiggy</strong>, the Indian food delivery startup, is in talks to raise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/indian-food-delivery-giant-swiggy-in-talks-to-raise-funds-at-over-10-billion-valuation/">more than $500 million</a> in a new financing round that could value it at over $10 billion, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Atlanta-headquartered Invesco is in talks to lead &#8212; or co-lead &#8212; the new financing round in the Bangalore-based startup, which counts SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Falcon Edge Capital and Prosus Ventures among its existing investors.</p>
<p><strong>Toyota</strong> subsidiary <strong>Woven Planet Holdings</strong> has made its third acquisition in less than a year in its bid to invest in, develop and eventually bring future-of-transportation technologies like automated driving to market. This time, the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/toyotas-woven-planet-acquires-av-operating-system-developer-renovo-motors/">acquired Renovo Motors</a>, the automotive operating system developer based in Silicon Valley. Terms of the deal, which has closed, were not disclosed.</p>

<p>Looks like <strong>Argo AI</strong> is setting up shop in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Back in August, I wrote about Argo AI landing a permit in California that will allow the company to give people free rides in its self-driving vehicles on the state’s public roads. Argo has never officially indicated which city it is targeting for a robotaxi service in California.</p>
<p>The company has been testing its autonomous vehicle technology in Ford vehicles around Palo Alto since 2019. Today, the company’s test fleet in California is about one dozen self-driving test vehicles. It also has autonomous test vehicles in Miami, Austin, Washington, D.C., Pittsburgh and Detroit. In July, Argo and Ford announced plans to launch at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles on Lyft’s ride-hailing network in a number of cities over the next five years, starting with Miami and Austin.</p>
<p>A source, at the time, said I should look south. Way south. My bet was San Diego. It looks like I was wrong.</p>
<p>A tweet from a new employee this week, shows Argo is opening an office in Los Angeles. The tweet announced this person&#8217;s employment at Argo AI on its autonomy platform integration team. When asked if they were moving to Pittsburgh, the person responded:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll be remote until we open our LA office. I do like Pittsburgh though, so I&#8217;m not opposed to visiting the mothership.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Policy corner</h2>

<p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner. This week, we&#8217;re talking&#8230; jobs!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the big news: <strong>Ford&#8217;s</strong> bombshell announcement that it, along with its South Korea-based battery partner <strong>SK Innovation</strong>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/ford-sk-to-spend-11-4b-to-build-two-us-manufacturing-campuses-dedicated-to-evs-and-batteries/">would spend $11.4 billion</a> to build two massive new manufacturing campuses in Tennessee and Kentucky. The automaker said the new campuses would generate a staggering 11,000 new jobs.</p>
<p>This is good news for <strong>President Joe Biden</strong>, who has been pushing automakers to bring more of their electric vehicle and battery manufacturing business to the United States. Other lawmakers are behind him, enough to even propose that a new EV purchase incentive should only be applicable to U.S.- and union-made vehicles. (Read more about the proposals <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/toyota-honda-urge-congress-to-reject-expanded-tax-incentive-that-would-benefit-ford-gm-stellantis/">to expand the tax credit</a> here &#8212; spoiler alert: not all automakers are happy about it.)</p>
<p>But will these new jobs be union? It looks like it&#8217;s still an open question. A group of reporters over at Reuters wrote a really excellent piece on the issue &#8212; I encourage you to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-technology-kentucky-tennessee-nashville-fe233dd4d20d45714d905f8f6a08b193">read it here</a>. Essentially, both Tennessee and Kentucky are &#8220;right-to-work&#8221; states, meaning they ban companies from requiring (or not) union membership as a condition of employment. Reuters suggests that Ford is staying mum either way on whether the new jobs would be union because it doesn&#8217;t want to antagonize its political partners in the southern states, who still need to approve key funding and incentives for the automaker&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>The stakes are high because there is a lot of concern amongst industry workers regarding the effects of transitioning to electric vehicles on employment. In general, electric vehicles require fewer workers to manufacture than internal combustion engine cars, because EVs have fewer moving parts and a simplified powertrain. Plus, union workers on average make 20% more than non-union workers. The <strong>Economic Policy Institute</strong> <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/ev-policy-workers/">even estimated</a> that &#8220;manufacturing policy inaction&#8221; combined with a rise in EV sales to 50% by 2030 could result in as many as 75,000 job losses by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>Not all is lost &#8212; greater domestic capacity to produce powertrains could mitigate the effects of the transition to EVs, the EPI finds. It, along with other think tanks like the <strong>Center for American Progress</strong>, agree that <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2020/09/23/489894/electric-vehicles-win-american-workers/">concurrent policy efforts</a> to shift EV manufacturers to the U.S. and strategic investments in jobs will help ensure workers are not left behind by the mobility revolution.</p>
<p>One of Biden&#8217;s refrains throughout his entire presidency is that the electric revolution will bring about &#8220;good-paying union jobs,&#8221; so it&#8217;s clear where his preference lies. Of course, union membership is not a prerequisite to having a &#8220;good job,&#8221; and Ford hasn&#8217;t released any details regarding the anticipated salaries of these 11,000 jobs. But the fact that Ford is bringing so much manufacturing stateside is certainly a good sign for workers.</p>

<p>Holy hell, lots this week. That means I am going to skip some items. It&#8217;s just too much!</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong> invited media, partners and investors (existing and potentially new ones) to get a closer look at its tech and operations. I was among those who visited. Here&#8217;s what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/aurora-shines-spotlight-on-autonomous-truck-tech-strategy-ahead-of-spac-merger/">I saw and experienced</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong> and <strong>Waymo</strong> were given the OK to start charging for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/cruise-waymo-get-ok-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">autonomous vehicle services</a> offered to the public in some areas of San Francisco. It&#8217;s gonna getting interesting, folks.</p>
<p><strong>Kodiak Robotics</strong> revealed its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kodiak-robotics-unveils-its-next-generation-autonomous-truck-with-plans-to-more-than-double-its-self-driving-fleet-301386504.html">fourth generation AV truck</a>, which has a modular sensor suite that includes Luminar and Hesai lidar sensors. I spent some time after their announcement talking with co-founder and CEO Don Burnette and digging into their business strategy and approach to automation. It deserves a bit of space, so look for it next week here.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Ford Motor</strong> and battery manufacturer <strong>SK Innovation</strong> made a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/ford-sk-to-spend-11-4b-to-build-two-us-manufacturing-campuses-dedicated-to-evs-and-batteries/">huge announcement</a> (as Aria noted earlier) about plans to spend $11.4 billion to build two massive campuses in Tennessee and Kentucky that will produce batteries as well as the next generation of electric F-Series trucks &#8212; a project the companies said will create 11,000 new jobs. Rebecca Bellan took a look at how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/how-fords-electrification-footprint-will-change-with-planned-investments/">Ford&#8217;s factory footprint</a> will change.</p>
<p><strong>Foxconn</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/foxconn-will-build-evs-for-lordstown-motors-and-fisker-at-ohio-plant/">will build electric vehicles</a> for <strong>Lordstown Motors</strong> <em>as well as</em> its other partner <strong>Fisker Inc.</strong> at a former GM factory in Ohio, under an agreement announced this week. What a wild world we live in.</p>
<p><strong>Lamborghini</strong> has a vision for its future. Abigail Bassett <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/lamborghinis-vision-for-an-alternative-fuel-future/">digs in</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Lucid Group</strong> opened up its factory to media, customers and analysts. Abigail Bassett and I were among those. Here is her take on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/first-drive-of-the-lucid-air-reveals-power-and-panache/">the Lucid Air.</a> Keep in mind, these were limited drives. Also, weird side note: because the Lucid Air has lidar, it also had to get &#8220;approval&#8221; from the FDA. That term approval isn&#8217;t what you&#8217;re thinking; this isn&#8217;t like a drug approval. Basically, the lidar manufacturer that Lucid uses (they have yet to name them) had to file a report with specs etc of the sensor showing it meets certain FDA requirements. Basically, it&#8217;s a self-certification like the FMVSS cert.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> invited press to test its R1T pickup truck. I spent a few days driving the truck and talking to engineers and other employees. My take: Rivian has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/first-drive-rivian-delivers-the-electric-truck-weve-been-waiting-for/">produced an electric truck</a> we never knew we needed. Meaning, I think the company will sell to folks who have never considered a pickup truck before. Also, I put together this video of the final version of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/rivian-r1t-camp-kitchen-check-out-the-final-version-of-the-electric-pickups-outdoor-cooking-station/">camp kitchen</a>.</p>
<h3>Gig economy</h3>
<p>If a measure to classify <strong>gig economy workers</strong> as independent contractors makes it to the November 2022 ballot and passes, drivers could end up earning as little as a quarter of the minimum wage, according to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/uc-berkeley-finds-gig-workers-could-earn-4-82-per-hour-if-ma-ballot-proposal-passes/">University of California-Berkeley study</a> published this week.</p>
<h3>Misc stuff</h3>
<p><strong>Honda</strong> laid out a plan to innovate in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/honda-motor-co-announces-plans-for-evtol-avatar-robots-and-space-technologies/">new business areas</a> like electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOL), bipedal robots and space technology. The company&#8217;s R&amp;D and innovation arms will be leading the effort on &#8220;outside-the-box research on technologies that will bring about new value for people by expanding the potential of mobility into the third dimension, then the fourth dimension, which defies the constraints of time and space, and ultimately into outer space,&#8221; according to the company.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s some real galaxy brain stuff there.</p>
<p><strong>Gene Berdichevsky</strong>, co-founder and CEO of battery chemistry company Sila Nano, talked to TechCrunch&#8217;s Rebecca Bellan about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/battery-chemistry-company-silas-founder-gene-berdichevsky-on-the-science-of-scaling-up/">science of scaling up</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More consolidation is afoot in the world of cybersecurity, specifically around services to help organizations manage identity and access. Today, <a href="https://www.oneidentity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Identity</a> &#8212; which provides tools for managing &#8220;zero trust&#8221; access to systems, as well as running log management and other governance services for enterprises &#8212; announced that it has acquired <a href="https://www.onelogin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OneLogin</a>, a rival to companies like Okta, Ping and others in the area of secure sign-on services for end users.</p>
<p>Terms of the acquisition &#8212; which officially closed last week, on October 1 &#8212; are not being disclosed, but we are trying to find out.</p>
<p>For some background, One Identity today is part of Quest Software, which is privately held by PE firm Francisco Partners. Before that it was a part of Dell. Francisco originally partnered with Elliott to acquire Quest and related assets from Dell <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/20/confirmed-dell-sells-software-division-to-francisco-partners-and-elliott-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2016</a> as part of the latter&#8217;s streamlining efforts, in a deal that at the time was reportedly worth about $2 billion. The company has some 7,500 enterprise customers and says that it manages some 250 million identities.</p>
<p>O<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">neLogin, meanwhile, last disclosed funding in 2019 &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/onelogin-snares-100m-investment-to-expand-identity-solution-into-new-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$100 million Series D</a></span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;"> that valued it at $330 million, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/52320-88/company/profile#deal-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>. (Note: you will notice that PItchBook lists another fundraise after this, but it doesn&#8217;t specify a date, or an amount.) OneLogin has some 5,500 customers including the likes of Airbus, Stitch Fix, the AAA, and Pandora. Together, the companies will handle some 290 million identities under management, Quest CEO Patrick Nichols told TechCrunch in an interview. This figure includes not just &#8220;people&#8221; but M2M-style nodes on systems, he added. </span></p>
<p>The M&amp;A comes amid a bigger shift in the security industry. In the intervening years since both Dell sold off its assets, and OneLogin raised money, cybersecurity threats have only grown, fueled by the ongoing shift to more cloud services and people and organizations doing more business digitally. (OneLogin, citing data from IBM, estimates that the average cost of a breach <a href="https://www.onelogin.com/blog/iam-cyber-insurance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now stands at $3.86 million</a>, although that also does not include the significant cost to an organization&#8217;s reputation and trust with its users.)</p>
<p>Within that bigger trend, identity management &#8212; and often more likely mis-management &#8212; has been an especially vulnerable area, with malicious hackers using a variety of techniques relying both on sophisticated technology and human error to crack into systems.</p>
<p>When considering the different threat vectors in the market today, &#8220;70% of them are a direct result of poor identity management,&#8221; Nichols said, citing research from <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/solutions/secure-your-business/business-security-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verizon</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And the threat is particularly acute in part because the numbers of end points are growing rapidly, not because of more people coming on to networks, but because of more connected devices. Half of the endpoints on a system are typically devices rather than specific individuals, Nichols said, &#8220;and once they get breached, it is just like stealing a password.&#8221;</p>
<p>And at the same time, after years of using point-solutions for different aspects of their cybersecurity strategies, enterprises are increasingly looking for platforms and bigger toolsets that can handle multiple functions to have a more unified picture of system activity, and to ensure that there is less risk of different cybersecurity tools inadvertently conflicting.</p>
<p>All of this points to more consolidation. In the specific case of One Identity, the company sees an opportunity in providing a fuller set of services to customers beyond those to help them manage networks internally, by adding on more end-user facing tools. Similarly, the thinking goes that customers of OneLogin might also be interested in bringing more of their cyber strategy on to a single platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, organizations see a twofold gain from consolidating around a platform player in cybersecurity,&#8221; Nichols said. The first is, &#8220;to increase efficiency&#8221; but the other, he pointed out, is legislation. With more regulatory oversight in how companies are handling their cybersecurity challenges, the pressure is on them to make their systems more resilient, and having too many components becomes a challenge to manage for that reason, too.</p>
<p>“Joining One Identity provides us with the ability to further accelerate our growth and provide additional value for both of our customers,” added Brad Brooks, CEO of OneLogin, in a statement. “With OneLogin’s robust unified platform for both workforce and CIAM, combining forces with One Identity’s suite of products including their PAM solution, will allow new and existing customers, on a global scale, to tap into the market’s only unified identity security platform.”</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how and if we continue to see more M&amp;A moves in the space. Okta has been a very acquisitive player to date, and there are still a number of companies on the market covering different aspects of the identity challenge that are still independent. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jumio-raises-150m-as-its-all-in-one-id-authentication-platform-crosses-300m-verified-identities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jumio</a> being one example.)</p>
<p>The combined company will cover a number of services, including <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Privileged Access Management (PAM); </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Identity Governance and Administration (IGA); Active Directory </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Management and Security; and now I</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">dentity &amp; Access Management (IAM).</span></p>
<p>“With the proliferation of human and machine identities, the race to the cloud and the rise of remote working, identity is quickly becoming the new edge – and protecting identity in an end-to-end manner has never been more important,” said Bhagwat Swaroop, president and general manager of One Identity, in a statement. “By adding OneLogin to our portfolio, and incorporating it into our cloud-first Unified Identity Security Platform, we can help customers holistically correlate all identities, verify everything before granting access to critical assets and provide real-time visibility into suspicious login activity. With identity at the core, customers can now implement an adaptive zero trust strategy and dramatically improve their overall cybersecurity posture.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The $110,000 GMC Hummer EV is a wild mashup that can keep up with the best off-roader, has the comfort of a luxury sedan and the speed of a sports car. And it has a truck bed. GM calls it a super truck, and I cannot disagree.</p>
<p>After driving the Hummer EV at General Motor&#8217;s test track, a few things were immediately apparent. First, the large Hummer EV is a joy to drive thanks to plenty of power and excellent four-wheel steering. Second, the infotainment system and driver&#8217;s gauge cluster are beautiful but overwhelmingly busy and occasionally slow. Lastly, the Hummer EV is a shining example of how General Motors&#8217; Ultium platform can lead to vehicles with unconventional capabilities and features.</p>
<p>GM spokespersons set strict expectations before letting me drive: GM only wanted to talk about how the Hummer EV drives and handles, and the company was not ready to answer questions concerning specific vehicle specifications, capabilities, and availability. Cameras were not allowed; GM security taped my phone. I only spent 30 minutes driving the Hummer EV, and all the driving was done deep in General Motors&#8217; remote Milford, Mich. proving grounds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that I drove a pre-production vehicle. Allegedly, all the necessary bits were in place, but a few things were missing, like texture on some interior materials and the addition of some noise dampening materials.</p>
<p>I drove the Hummer EV over a pile of rocks, sped around dirt roads, and hit 95 mph on General Motors&#8217; high-speed test track. I learned a lot. The Hummer EV is a competent go-anywhere, do-anything vehicle able to go bouldering, swing into tight parking spaces, and carry five adults and their luggage comfortably. It has a 0-60 time of 3.0 seconds, and it drives much smaller than it looks thanks to four-wheel steering.</p>

<h2>Four-Wheel Steering For The Win</h2>
<p>The Hummer EV plays a fun trick. The large, wide vehicle lumbers over the road but does so in a brisk, fleeting manner. The electric motors and four-wheel steering make it lighter on its feet than a pickup and more responsive than a large crossover. As a result, the Hummer EV drives like a sturdy and wide sports car instead of a pickup truck.</p>
<p>The Hummers of yesteryear felt like durable trucks, dominant and all-powerful. The Hummer EV still feels unstoppable, but now, it also feels as comfortable on the highway as it does on backwood trails. Buyers are not conceding comfort for capabilities with the Hummer EV. Past Hummers (and current Jeep and 4Runners) sacrificed on-road ride quality for off-road capabilities; nothing is seemingly lost with the Hummer EV. Just hit a button and it will climb boulders. Hit a different button and it can outrun most sports cars.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the formula: three electric motors + four-wheel steering. This isn&#8217;t a secret formula per se; Tesla is equipping its Cybertruck with the same combination.</p>
<p>I cannot understate the impact of the Hummer EV&#8217;s four-wheel steering. The rear wheels can turn up to 10 degrees, which comes standard on all models. In its most extreme use-case, called CrabWalk, the four-wheel steering makes the vehicle move as if on ice, gliding left and right in a way that feels more like a rear-wheel-drive forklift than a five-passenger pickup.</p>
<p>Rear-wheel steering debuted in the 1980s and saw little adaptation outside of sports cars at the time. It attempted a comeback in the early 2000s, and General Motors even offered it on the Suburban and Silverado half-ton trucks from 2002 to 2005. Today, it&#8217;s available on several sedans, with some models providing 2-3 degrees of turning, while ultra-luxury models offer up to 10 degrees. These systems are a costly option few buyers select, but it comes standard in the Hummer EV. This system is critical to the function and appeal of the Hummer EV.</p>
<p>The Hummer&#8217;s four-wheel steering also allows it to drive much smaller than similar-sized vehicles. It turns quicker, backs up easier, and makes the pickup handle more like a family sedan than a large SUV. The vehicle has a 37-foot turning circle closer to the compact Chevy Sonic than the Chevy Silverado &#8211; a full-size pickup.</p>
<p>I only had a few minutes to test this system. The four-wheel steering doesn&#8217;t have a learning curve, and I didn&#8217;t have to adjust my driving technique to compensate for the tighter turning. It just worked and felt natural. I&#8217;m curious whether passengers in the rear seat would feel the difference.</p>
<p>The four-wheel steering is active by default, though it can be turned off. I&#8217;m told it even improves towing as when the Hummer EV is at highway speeds, the wheels on the two axles move in phase, eliminating trailer sway (I would like to verify this claim).</p>
<p>This four-wheel steering feature allows the Hummer to drive diagonally. Called CrabWalk, this unique mode requires the driver to stop the vehicle and click through several menu buttons to activate. Once engaged, the front and rear axles move in tandem and allow the truck to glide in unexpected ways. Crab Walk mode makes the Hummer EV feel like it&#8217;s on ice. Turn the wheel left, and the vehicle glides diagonally left. The front end doesn&#8217;t turn left; the whole vehicle drifts left. This isn&#8217;t a system designed for use at speed, but rather when parking, overlanding, and impressing onlookers. I&#8217;ve never felt anything like it.</p>
<p>Watch this video from Detroit&#8217;s 2021 Woodward Dream Cruise where GM employees were eager to demonstrate the ability.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvO3wTsAqvw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<h2>Watts to Freedom = WTF Mode</h2>
<p>The Hummer EV is blistering fast &#8212; if you want it to be. A launch mode, called Watts to Freedom (WTF mode), is impressive, allowing drivers to hit 60 mph in 3 seconds. That&#8217;s fast fast. Under normal conditions and in standard vehicle modes, the Hummer EV still scoots, but it won&#8217;t pin riders to their seats as it does in WTF mode.</p>
<p>Hitting that velocity is incredible in any vehicle; doing so in a five-passenger pickup is even more memorable. The all-wheel-drive pickup effortlessly finds enough traction to shoot forward with the force of a rocket. It&#8217;s similar to the launch sensation found in other electric vehicles like the Tesla Model X.</p>
<p>In its normal driving modes, the Hummer EV&#8217;s torque is on a short leash. It&#8217;s more tame but still fast enough to race anyone at a stoplight. The acceleration is controlled and measured, and I appreciate the finesse that went into the tuning.</p>
<p>The Hummer EV&#8217;s wide stance makes for a stable ride. I raced the Hummer EV around the proving ground&#8217;s back roads, fishtailing the SUV on the gravel. The pickup held firm and felt flat even during the most aggressive turns. On the banked test track, the Hummer EV felt as solid and sturdy as any vehicle. The batteries packed on the bottom of the truck force the gravity to the floor, the Hummer never felt top-heavy like its gas-powered ancestors.</p>
<p>On the high-speed loop, the Hummer hit 90 mph without trying. The vehicle didn&#8217;t feel strained or overworked. Hit the gas, and it gets to speed in a heartbeat. The Hummer EV cruises with the best, sailing across the road on massive 35-inch Wrangler tires &#8212; and I don&#8217;t recall an obnoxious amount of tire noise either.</p>
<p>The Hummer EV isn&#8217;t silent. Hit the accelerator, and you&#8217;ll hear two things: The whine of the three electric motors and an artificial revving sound that sounds like a more beefy electrical noise. In an off-road driving mode, the artificial tone is louder to drown out the increased road noise. In the end, I found it unoffensive. The sound is not heavy and is always in the background. A General Motors engineer explained that the company feels the driver needs and unknowingly expects audible feedback.</p>
<p>I took the Hummer EV bouldering in as much as driving over two dozen large rocks. Did it drive over? Sure. Was it graceful? Not really. The Hummer EV slid around the rocks, and I had trouble holding traction. To be clear, for this drive, GM dumped a pile of beach-ball-sized rocks in a field, allowing us to drive over a 10-foot section one time. I&#8217;m not comfortable drawing conclusions about the Hummer EV&#8217;s off-roading capabilities from this experience.</p>
<h2>An Industrial User Experience</h2>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t given a chance to dig deep into the infotainment system. From my little experience, I discovered a couple of things. One, the system is beautiful thanks to Epic&#8217;s Unreal graphical engine. The Hummer EV is the first to use this particular build of the Unreal engine generally reserved for video games. The system looks lovely, but in my pre-production test vehicle, it was laggy. It constantly took several moments to respond to input. It didn&#8217;t matter if I selected an option on the screen or used a hardware controller (like the terrain select dial).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, while lovely to look at, the infotainment&#8217;s design is overly complex, busy, and styled with a faux industrial look. GM&#8217;s engineers were evidently trying to show off the graphical ability of the screen and implemented an interface that uses widely overstyled icons and menus. Every graphical element seems designed to look pretty rather than being easier to use.</p>
<p>General Motors was keen on demonstrating the capabilities of the Hummer EV&#8217;s cameras. There are 18 scattered around the vehicle, including several mounted under the truck, assist the driver when traversing sketchy terrain or parking at Trader Joe&#8217;s. These cameras work as advertised, and some have built-in cleaners to remove debris.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thrilled to report GM retained physical buttons for climate control instead of burying them in a touchscreen menu. Other EV makers like Tesla and Rivian have relegated temperature dials, heated seat controls, and even vent direction to the touchscreen. In the Hummer EV, there&#8217;s a row of rocker switches for such controls.</p>
<p>The driver has a commanding position. There&#8217;s great visibility from the driver&#8217;s seat. The front occupants have plenty of space with lots of headroom and legroom. The backseats have less space for legs, but there&#8217;s still lots of room thanks to the wide body. Think full-size SUV — roomy in the front, tighter in the back.</p>
<h2>The New Electric Powertrain</h2>
<p>General Motors revealed a few details about the Hummer EV&#8217;s powertrain. The first edition of the Hummer EV comes with a 24-module battery system packed within the vehicle&#8217;s unibody frame. It&#8217;s General Motors&#8217; first use of its Ultium platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/gm-reveals-ultium-the-heart-of-its-ev-strategy/">which the car company debuted in March 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The three-motor arrangement offers several advantages. The electric motors allow GM to equip the Hummer with electronic differentials on both axles &#8212; handy for low-traction situations. On the rear wheels, an e-locker enables the pickup to control traction at all four corners with torque vectoring; the two motors are not physically connected but equipped with software to virtually lock them together. This allows the wheels to start or stop in milliseconds.</p>
<p>I asked if the battery packs were similar to those used in the Chevy Bolt, which has had two recalls because of its battery. A GM spokesperson responded, saying GM is working with LG on the cells, but GM builds the Hummer EV&#8217;s packs at its Detroit, MI Brownstown factory, and the batteries feature new cell chemistry over those used in the Bolt. Eventually, GM will build Ultium batteries at facility built with LG in Lordstown, Ohio.</p>
<h2>Questions Remain</h2>
<p>The Hummer EV is packed full of features I was unable to test or experience. It comes equipped with GM&#8217;s latest version of its self-driving mode, SuperCruise, which now features highway lane changes. The pickup also has automated tire deflation, is supposedly able to ford 26 inches of water, and recharge 100 miles of travel in 10 minutes. Unfortunately, I could not remove the roof panels or see them stored in the so-called frunk. I would also love some time to dig into the infotainment system &#8212; it looks immersive but complex.</p>
<p>General Motors has been quiet on several aspects of the Hummer EV, and the company revealed little extra during this test. Exact pricing and availability are unknown. The official EPA range rating is unannounced. The towing and hauling capabilities are also still unknown.</p>
<p>As someone who regularly tows a large trailer, the Hummer EV doesn&#8217;t feel like it was built to haul or tow. The power is there, but the unibody frame and air suspension speak to a lower tow rating than a Chevy Silverado 1500 or Ford F-150. I expect the Hummer EV to have a rating closer to a full-size SUV (6,000 &#8211; 8,000 lbs.) than a half-ton pickup (8,000 to 12,000 lbs.). This means the Hummer EV could tow a trailer of ATVs, a small boat, or a cargo trailer, if I&#8217;m correct. With that rating, it would be unable to pull most travel trailers outside of small, ultra-light options. And how will hauling a load affect the battery range? That&#8217;s unknown, too.</p>
<h2>An Electric Revolution</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s the scene. General Motors is nervous. The Hummer EV was announced in October 2020 and was supposed to hit dealers in Fall 2021. Now, in October 2021, there&#8217;s a global supply chain crisis affecting automotive manufacturers, and the company is having to focus unexpectedly on battery recalls on its other EV, the Chevy Bolt. Insiders tell me General Motors is nervous about consumer confidence after sending Chevy Bolt owners two battery recalls.</p>
<p>The star of the Hummer EV show is GM&#8217;s Ultium platform. When GM announced its EV blueprint in 2020, the company said it allowed the automaker to build vehicles in 19 different battery and drive unit configurations, including rear-wheel, front-wheel, and all-wheel-drive configurations. It also provides for 400-volt and 800-volt packs, meaning this design gives America&#8217;s largest carmaker many options. The Hummer EV is a rolling proof of concept of the Ultium platform&#8217;s capability. If it can make a Hummer ultra-fast and ultra-maneuverable, what can it offer a roadster, crossover, or seven-passenger family mover?</p>
<p>The Hummer EV succeeds in being General Motors&#8217; ostentatious, attention-seeking super electric vehicle. The latest Hummer is outrageous and excessive just like it&#8217;s always been. It&#8217;s clear after just a few minutes that General Motors built something special in the electric pickup. It&#8217;s big, heavy and electric, and it has everything from insane speed to serious off-roading chops to substantial cargo capacity. The Hummer EV has everything.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">FoodTech is booming in Europe and is growing exponentially. In 2020, €3 billion went into European FoodTech companies (<a href="https://2020.stateofeuropeantech.com/">State of European Tech Report, March 2021</a>), and the pandemic has accelerated demand as consumers have shifted to grocery delivery. The industry has also been affected by the rise of direct-to-consumer food brands. Finally, the pandemic created a boom in interest in healthy food and nutrition to improve people&#8217;s immunity to COVID-19.</p>
<p>So it’s perhaps understandable that European FoodTech VC  <a href="https://www.fiveseasons.vc/">Five Seasons Ventures</a> has announced the final closing of €180 million second fund. Their first fund was €77 million, so this next fund is a sizeable improvement and reflects what’s going on in Food Tech.</p>
<p>The new Fund II will continue making Series A and B investments into European FoodTech companies, with, says the company “an emphasis on fast-growing consumer-focused food with a quantifiable environmental or social impact.”</p>
<p>Five Seasons says it’s aiming to prove that FoodTech startups can grow as fast as ‘normal’ tech startups, with its Fund I portfolio on track to reach a combined revenue of over €350M in 2021, it says. One such company, Air Up, has hit a €100M revenue run rate in less than two years, says Five Seasons. <a href="https://uk.air-up.com/">Air-Up</a> sells a reusable smart water bottle that “delivers flavor via retro-nasal scent”.</p>
<p>Ivan Farneti, Co-founding Partner of Five Seasons Ventures, said: “There’s no doubt that FoodTech is experiencing a boom in Europe right now. When we launched Five Seasons in 2018, we were the first VC to focus on FoodTech in Europe, and we believe we contributed to making this an attractive asset class. Fund II was quickly oversubscribed as more investors wanted to get exposed to European FoodTech, seeking high growth and impact.”</p>
<p>Five seasons has also backed Butternut Box, a direct-to-consumer fresh dog food company in Europe, and ‘This’, plant-based meat alternative. The VC’s team has also grown to nine, with the appointment of a Head of Impact and Sustainable Investing.</p>
<p>Fund II has so far invested in female wellness supplements her1, and vly, a company using peas to provide a plant-based milk alternative filled with protein. It’s also invested in Barkyn and The Nu Company. </p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In total, Five Seasons Ventures has backed 14 companies across six European countries: Germany, France, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, and the UK. </p>
<p>In an interview, Niccolo Manzoni, Co-founding Partner of Five Seasons Ventures, added: “If you look at the amount of capital that has gone into FoodTech ventures in the last two years it&#8217;s grown from €1 billion to €3 billion just in Europe, and it&#8217;s bound to continue growing because there are lots of companies that have raised good money and have grown really fast.”</p>
<p>“Secondly, it also has the Impact side,” he said. “Two of the most pressing issues the world is facing today are human health and climate change. And that&#8217;s exactly the kind of companies we look for. If you look across our portfolio, for example, last year we saved about 2 million kilograms of food waste. The products that our companies sell are designed to improve health and well being… There&#8217;s a huge amount of things you can do in food tech which you cannot do in SaaS, for example.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Byju’s has raised about $300 million as part of a larger round of new investment as the Indian edtech giant focuses on expanding its international business and aggressively explores merger and acquisition opportunities.</p>
<p>A filing, supplied to TechCrunch by research firm Tofler, showed that the new investment values the startup at $18 billion, up from a valuation of $16.5 billion in June this year. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">$16.5 billion valuation</a>, Byju&#8217;s had already surpassed fintech giant Paytm for the tentpole position in India&#8217;s startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>Oxshott Capital Partners led the new tranche of investment while XN Exponent, Edelweiss, Verition Master Fund, IIFL, and Time Capital Advisors participated.</p>
<p>TechCrunch understands the new investment is part of a larger financing round that is likely to propel Byju&#8217;s valuation above $21 billion.</p>
<p>A Byju’s spokeswoman declined to comment Monday.</p>
<p>The new investment comes at a time when Byju’s is also engaging with bankers about potentially filing for an initial public offering sometime next year. Some bankers have given the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bankers-chase-byjus-for-ipo-valuation-pegged-up-to-50-billion/">a valuation of up to $50 billion if it lists next year</a>, TechCrunch reported in August. In an interview last month, Byju Raveendran (founder and chief executive of Byju&#8217;s) confirmed that the &#8220;IPO was on the cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup, which has raised over $1.8 billion since the beginning of pandemic, has used a significant portion of its recent fundraises to acquire firms. Earlier this year, it bought Aakash, one of the largest coaching institutes for high-school students with over 200 centers, for nearly $1 billion. It has also purchased Great Learning, and U.S.-based Epic, among others, for over $1 billion in cash and stock deals. Last month, the startup unveiled it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/byjus-acquires-coding-platform-tynker-for-200-million-in-us-expansion-push/">acquired kids coding platform Tynker for $200 million</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Raveendran said last month that Byju’s is continuing to explore more merger and acquisition opportunities. These acquisitions are helping Byju’s aggressively broaden its offerings and tap international markets in more meaningful ways, he said.</p>
<p>Byju’s prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses, and in recent years it has also expanded its catalog to serve all school-going students. Tutors on the Byju’s app tackle complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake.</p>
<p>The pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to enforce a months-long nationwide lockdown and close schools, accelerated its growth, and those of several other online learning startups including Unacademy and Vedantu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, <a href="https://hhi.harvard.edu/publications/perceptions-disaster-resilience-and-preparedness-philippines">with geography that makes it vulnerable</a> to typhoons, floods, volcanos, earthquakes and droughts. While working in IT, Felix Ayque began compiling cyclone reports and sending them as email alerts to communities. His work evolved into environmental intelligence platform <a href="https://komunidad.co/">Komunidad</a>, which collects data from government and private sources, and turns it into customizable analytics to help clients react quickly to potential disasters.</p>
<p>The Manila and Singapore-based startup announced it has raised $1 million in seed funding, led by Wavemaker Partners with participation from ADB Ventures, the Asian Development Bank’s venture arm, to expand in Asia and add features to its platform, including a self-serve version that is slated for release in January 2022.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, Komunidad has clients in the Philippines, India, Cambodia and Vietnam, and serves multiple sectors, including utilities, agriculture, mining, education, local governments and business outsourcing centers. Before launching the startup, Ayque worked as an IT developer at several weather agencies, including the state-owned New Zealand MetService. He began creating cyclone reports on his own as a consultant after Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, also known as Super Typhoon Yolanda, which killed at least 6,300 people in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The reports were meant to help businesses respond more quickly to natural disasters. Typhoon Haiyan hit at a time when the business outsourcing sector was growing rapidly in the Philippines, with many foreign companies setting up multiple offices in the country. During a typhoon, businesses typically transfer workload to offices in areas that are not affected. Ayque’s first emails contained manual analysis of potential cyclones.</p>
<p>Demand for his reports grew as companies, including energy providers, needed to respond to climate change. Komunidad began earning enough revenue to expand and for Ayque to hire employees, including meteorologists, data scientists, software developers and business development teams based in India and Southeast Asia. Its new investment will be used to build a scalable platform.</p>
<p>Komunidad’s data sources include major players like The Weather Company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/28/ibm-will-acquire-the-weather-companys-digital-business/">acquired by IBM in 2015</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/weather-platform-climacell-is-now-tomorrow-io-and-raises-77m/">weather intelligence platform Tomorrow.io</a>, and several smaller environmental and weather data providers.</p>

<p>The platform turns data into dashboards relevant to their customers’ needs, like severe weather, solar, marine, soil moisture or air quality. “We act as a system integrator that only brings the relevant data and tells customers that this is the most important data,” said Ayque. Komunidad also enables its customers to build their own alert systems. For example, in the Philippines, many customers send alerts through Viber, one of the country’s most popular messaging apps, or SMS to reach areas with unstable internet connections.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;BreezoMeter, which powers air quality in Apple’s Weather app, launches Wildfire Tracker&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/breezometer-wildfire-tracker/embed/#?secret=J2U4kTOrNy" data-secret="J2U4kTOrNy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For customers in the energy sector, Komunidad’s tools help them predict things like power usage based on temperature. It&#8217;s also been used by local governments to decide school cancellations. During the pandemic, Komunidad helped cities monitor people density so they can decide what areas need more crowd control.</p>
<p>One of Komunidad’s competitive advantages is understanding what data is important in different areas. For example, it recently closed a deal with the Assam State Disaster Management Agency (ASDMA) to focus on lighting and thunderstorm alerts, because Assam is the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/assam-9th-most-lightning-prone-state-with-46-deaths-in-last-1-year/articleshow/85136091.cms">one of the most lightning-prone states in India</a>.</p>
<p>“Every country has a different profile, and we understand that our approach has to really focus on community, and then extend to business,” Ayque said.</p>
<p>Since Komunidad’s customers have to react quickly, it creates easy-to-understand visualizations from raw data reports, which are often incomprehensible to people without technical backgrounds. For example, that might be a simple bar graph, warnings in green, yellow and red, or maps that turn red if a major weather or environmental event is expected to occur within the next six hours.</p>
<p>Part of Komunidad’s funding will be used to launch self-service customizable dashboards next year that will allow clients to drag-and-drop widgets, similar to creating a website in Wix or WordPress. The seed round will also help Komunidad take on new business opportunities in India, Thailand, Cambodia and other markets, grow its sales teams and pay for more data sources.</p>
