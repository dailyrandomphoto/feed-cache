										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It has been over three months since Click Studios, the Australian software house behind the enterprise password manager Passwordstate, warned its customers to &#8220;commence resetting all passwords.&#8221; The company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/passwordstate-click-studios-password-manager-breach/">hit by a supply chain attack</a> that sought to steal the passwords from customer servers around the world.</p>
<p>But customers tell TechCrunch that they are still without answers about the attack. Several customers say they were met with silence from Click Studios, while others were asked to sign strict secrecy agreements when they asked for assurances about the security of the software.</p>
<p>One IT executive whose company was compromised by the attack said they felt &#8220;abandoned&#8221; by the software maker in the wake of the attack.</p>
<p>Passwordstate is a standalone web server that enterprise companies can use to store and share passwords and secrets for their organizations, like keys for cloud systems and databases that store sensitive customer data, or &#8220;break glass&#8221; accounts that grant emergency access to the network. Click Studios says it has 29,000 customers using Passwordstate, including banks, universities, consultants, tech companies, defense contractors and U.S. and Australian government agencies, according to public records seen by TechCrunch. The sensitive data held by these customers might be why Passwordstate was the target of this supply-chain attack.</p>
<p>Click Studios sent an email to customers on April 22 warning of a possible Passwordstate compromise, but it wasn&#8217;t until Danish security research firm CSIS published a <a href="https://www.csis.dk/newsroom-blog-overview/2021/moserpass-supply-chain/">blog post</a> the next day that revealed the existence and the extent of the breach.</p>
<p>CSIS said that cyber-criminals had compromised the Passwordstate software update feature to deliver a malicious update to any customer who had updated their server during a 28-hour window between April 20–22. The malicious update was designed to steal the secrets from customers&#8217; Passwordstate servers and transmit them back to the cyber-criminals.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This is how some customers found out about the hack, they told TechCrunch. Many customers turned to social media since Click Studios shut down its blog and forums as a &#8220;precaution,&#8221; prompting customers to look for <a href="https://lordx64.medium.com/initial-analysis-of-passwordstate-supply-chain-attack-backdoor-code-aaff1df389e4">other sources of information</a>.</p>
<p>Some believed that the hack was “another SolarWinds,” referring to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">an incident</a> months earlier at tech company SolarWinds after the network management software it sells to customers to monitor their networks and fleets of devices was compromised. Russian spies had infiltrated SolarWinds&#8217; network and planted a backdoor in Orion&#8217;s software update feature, which was automatically pushed to customer systems. That gave the spies unfettered access to sneak around and gather information from potentially thousands of networks, including nine agencies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-nasa-federal-aviation-administration-networks/">of the U.S. federal government</a>.</p>
<p>But Passwordstate was fortunate in ways that SolarWinds was not. Since new Passwordstate software updates need to be manually installed, many companies evaded compromise simply by luck. Determining whether a server had been compromised was also relatively easy by checking to see if the size of a particular file on the server was larger than it should be; the fix was fairly simple, as well.</p>
<p>Click Studios <a href="https://clickstudios.com.au/advisories/default.aspx">went public</a> with the breach on April 24 — late on Friday night in the United States — by publishing an advisory on its website. The advisory largely repeated what it emailed to customers the day before, urging them to reset their passwords starting with all internet-facing networking gear, which, if compromised by a stolen password, would allow the cyber-criminals into a victim&#8217;s network.</p>
<p>Several customers who spoke to TechCrunch about the hack, including customers with compromised servers, said the Click Studios was largely unresponsive after that.</p>
<p>The IT executive whose Passwordstate server was compromised by the attack said they updated their server during the 28-hour-long attack, but heard nothing from Click Studios besides the mass email warning of the hack. &#8220;Everything was just, &#8216;change your passwords,'&#8221; the executive said.</p>
<p>The executive&#8217;s company invoked its incident response plan and found logs showing that passwords had been exfiltrated, but found no evidence that the stolen passwords were used. Because the company uses multi-factor authentication, the stolen passwords alone aren&#8217;t enough to break into its network. &#8220;None of the multi-factor authentication prompts came up that would have if somebody had tried to log in with any of these accounts,&#8221; the executive said.</p>
<p>The executive offered to provide its logs to Click Studio in the hope it would help the investigation. In a reply, Click Studios apologized but did not request the logs.</p>
<p>Another compromised customer — a managed service provider — said that the attackers tried to steal the company&#8217;s passwords but a glitch stopped the exfiltration in its tracks. The company&#8217;s logs showed that the malicious update tried to communicate with the cyber-criminals&#8217; servers using a deprecated encryption protocol, which the server refused to accept. The customer said they offered to provide the logs to Click Studios, which the company agreed to and received, but that the customer heard nothing more from Click Studios after that.</p>
<p>Click Studios published two more advisories that weekend, but customers who asked for more information were only referred back to the advisories. Some vented their frustrations along with their other embattled customers on public forums.</p>
<p>By the following week, Click Studios began asking customers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/click-studios-asks-customers-to-stop-tweeting-about-its-passwordstate-data-breach/">refrain from posting its correspondence to social media</a> after reports of phishing emails that were similarly worded to the emails sent by Click Studios, but some customers suspected the company was trying to control the fallout.</p>
<p>Months on, some customers said they feel discouraged by the Click Studios&#8217; lack of response and are using what leverage they have to get answers.</p>
<p>Some customers had licenses up for renewal and wanted firm reassurances about the security and resiliency of the software. Before the incident, customers would expect an update every week or two, but Passwordstate updates were on pause indefinitely until the company&#8217;s software development line could be secured. Click Studios had a plan to prevent a similar attack in the future, but insisted on customers signing strict non-disclosure agreements before it would say anything about what changes it was making. The non-disclosure agreements also included provisions that barred anyone from revealing the very existence of the agreement.</p>
<p>Click Studios chief executive Mark Sandford has not responded to multiple requests for comment since the incident. Instead, TechCrunch received the same canned auto-response from the company’s support email saying that its staff are &#8220;focused only on assisting customers technically.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its most recent advisory, Click Studios said as of May 17 the company has returned to &#8220;normal business operations,&#8221; but has not responded to our more recent emails. Click Studios released a long-awaited update to Passwordstate on August 2 to remove the software update feature that it blamed on the supply chain attack.</p>
<p>Some organizations said they are staying on as customers despite the attack. One said while the incident was scary and that it warranted an investigation, they said the initial reporting was &#8220;vastly overblown.&#8221; Others expressed some sympathy for Click Studios for what was seen as a rare event that was unlikely to happen again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t lost faith. But this was unpleasant,&#8221; said one customer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.reservetrust.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reserve Trust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Denver-based financial services provider, has raised $30.5 million in a Series A round led by QED Investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech Collective, Ardent Venture Partners, Flywire CEO Mike Massaro and Quovo founder and CEO Lowell Putnam also participated in the financing, which included $17.9 million in secondary shares. It brings the startup’s total raised since its 2016 inception to $35.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reserve Trust describes itself as “the first fintech trust company with a Federal Reserve master account.” What does that mean exactly? Basically, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> federal reserve master account allows Reserve Trust to move dollars on behalf of its customers directly, via wire and ACH payment rails, without an intermediate or partner bank. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, only banks were able to access these payment rails directly, which left both domestic and international fintechs “with limited partner options, poor technology and slow implementations when it came to embedding high-value B2B payments,” says COO Dave Cahill. Reserve Trust touts that its technology and services give companies all over the world the ability to “seamlessly move money via the first cloud-based payment system connected directly to the Federal Reserve” since it is not limited by legacy banking systems.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with the fundraise, Reserve Trust is also announcing that Dave Wright has been named CEO and Cahill joined as COO. The pair worked together previously at SolidFire, a flash storage startup that Wright founded and </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinwarren/2015/12/21/netapp-acquires-solidfire-for-870-million/?sh=366b46d76764"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold to NetApp for $870 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reserve Trust works with businesses that seek to embed domestic and cross-border B2B payment by offering them the ability to store funds in custody accounts that are backed by its Federal Reserve master account.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history of the company relates back to the global financial crisis. After the crisis, banks in the U.S. went through a process called <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2017/06/adriano.htm">derisking</a>, which meant they shed businesses that on a risk return basis weren’t as strong as other businesses. One of those included the handling of U.S. dollar payments, particularly in emerging countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the consequences of this is that it became significantly more difficult and expensive for businesses and smaller economies to trade and move U.S. dollars around the world,” Wright told TechCrunch. “And the founders of Reserve Trust saw this opportunity to build a new type of financial institution that was focused on helping to provide U.S. dollar payment services, especially to emerging fintechs in markets around the world, and helping to reconnect those economies to global trade.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But rather than start a bank, the founders (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dennis Gingold</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Justin Guilder</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) navigated a previously unexplored part of regulatory waters to create a state-chartered trust company with a Federal Reserve master account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s something that had never really been done before,” Wright added. “Pretty much every other trust company has to work through banks for all their payment services. Reserve Trust is the first that has actually managed to get a Federal Reserve master account and can process payments directly with the Federal Reserve.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The complex process took about three years, and in 2018, the company got a Federal Reserve master account and started providing U.S. dollar custody and payment services for fintechs all over the world. Reserve Trust began to see strong demand from payment and fintech companies that were struggling to develop strong partner bank relationships, even though fundamentally there wasn&#8217;t any reason the banks couldn&#8217;t work with them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They found working with banks to be a slow process, one that didn&#8217;t involve a lot of technology expertise on the side of the banks, and it was really inhibiting their ability to develop their technology,” Wright said. And that was even here in the U.S. Today, more than half of its business is from domestic fintechs, although Reserve Trust still has a strong international presence as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new funds will mainly go toward helping the company scale to handle what Wright describes as “a fairly overwhelming amount of demand” and toward building out the team, the technology and the services it needs to address the payment needs of larger, faster growing fintechs around the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most of our customers today are small and midsize fintechs, but now we&#8217;re seeing demand for much larger fintechs that have much higher payment volumes and are involved in embedded banking and B2B payments,” Wright said. “They are looking for a stronger banking partner than what they&#8217;ve been able to find among the role of traditional banks.” Customers include </span><a href="https://www.unlimint.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlimint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.vertofx.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VertoFX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QED Investors partner Amias Gerety and FinTech Collective principal Matt Levinson are bullish both on Reserve Trust’s history and its potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair point to payments giant Stripe as an example of how far Reserve Trust can go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stripe has significant market share doing merchant acquiring and processing e-commerce payments for the consumer,” Levinson said. “B2B payments is significantly bigger in terms of volume, so we&#8217;re talking about well over $20 trillion of addressable payment flow. But there&#8217;s no real technology company that&#8217;s brought the modern payments platform to market without being beholden to legacy banks. And that’s why we’re so excited about this business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reserve Trust, he added, is giving businesses a way to facilitate B2B payments that “are smarter, faster and cheaper.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gerety agrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Despite all the excitement around digital payments and infrastructure, there is still no fintech that can offer direct integration with the U.S. payment system,” he said. “With Reserve Trust, we are creating foundational infrastructure to hold and move payments globally and at scale.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The California-based startup, which was founded in 2018, has raised $40 million in a Series B round led by Norwest Venture Partners.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fresh off a strategic partnership with Toyota Industries Corporation to build an autonomous forklift, Third Wave Automation has snagged another $40 million from investors.</p>
<p>The California-based startup, which was founded in 2018, has raised $40 million in a Series B round led by Norwest Venture Partners, including participation from prior investors Innovation Endeavors and Eclipse, along with Toyota Ventures, according to a Form D filed with regulators. Matt Howard, general partner at Norwest Venture Partners, will join Third Wave&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p>The injection of capital came after Howard learned of Third Wave&#8217;s partnership with Toyota Industries Corporation, which builds a third of the world&#8217;s forklifts, Third Wave CEO Arshan Poursohi told TechCrunch. Under that deal, which was announced in May, Third Wave and Toyota Industries (TICO) will develop an autonomous forklift together. The machine will be manufactured at a TICO factory and equipped with Third Wave&#8217;s sensors and compute stack. Third Wave will support the software side.</p>
<p>Third Wave&#8217;s three co-founders &#8212; including Mac Mason, who is chief roboticist, and James Davidson, who is no longer with the company &#8212; have long backgrounds in robotics, oftentimes working together at places like Google&#8217;s robotics program and Google Research and Toyota Research Institute.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve covered just about every kind of robot there is,&#8221; Poursohi said. &#8220;But all of these robots that we built ended up, you know, sitting in a closet somewhere because ultimately, Google or, in my case, Sun Microsystems, would decide it&#8217;s not worth scaling it out because it&#8217;s not the core business, or some other reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>The co-founders struck out to form their own company to focus on robots that would be used and would meet an immediate need.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we looked at forklifts, it&#8217;s this beautiful manipulation problem, so it&#8217;s a robot that actually touches the world on purpose,&#8221; Poursohi said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s a thing that we can actually build and ship on a time horizon that is not measured in decades.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The forklifts they have developed operate under what is called shared autonomy. This means the forklift, which can lift pallets and move them around, will operate on its own 90% of the time. However, every robot can also be controlled remotely if the need arises. The robots are easy to operate, meaning the customer, not Third Wave, can have on-site employees to provide assistance remotely if the robot encounters something that prevents it from operating.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a big impact we can make on logistics and supply chain, just by moving pallets around, and that&#8217;s where we&#8217;ve been concentrated. The key to our technology is that it&#8217;s very fast to set up and it works in brownfield [environments],&#8221; Poursohi said.</p>
<p>Third Wave is still at an early stage in its development, but it&#8217;s making progress. The momentum from the funding and the recent completion of technical trials will allow the company to speed up its hiring effort and focus on commercialization, Poursohi said. He noted that Third Wave is in active conversations with 20 third-party logistics operators and retailers in the industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve tackled and have solid answers on all the technical fronts,&#8221; Poursohi said. &#8220;The next year and a half to two years is about is scaling out our operations team. And the market demand for this right now is massive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The target is to have 100 units in the field — meaning warehouses and other indoor locations — by the end of 2022 and scaling to 350 to 400 by the end of 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The twice-issued recall for 2017 to 2019 Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles cost General Motors $800 million, the company said in its <a href="https://investor.gm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gm-reports-strong-second-quarter-2021-results">second quarter earnings statement</a> Wednesday. Costs associated with fixing defective Bolt batteries make up the lion’s share of GM’s $1.3 billion in warranty expenses last quarter.</p>
<p>CEO Mary Barra specified on an investor call that the recall does not impact the Ultium platform, GM&#8217;s battery cell technology it is developing in a joint venture with South Korea&#8217;s LG Energy Solutions. &#8220;<span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">[Ultium]</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">is</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">a</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">different</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">battery</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">system</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">and</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">our</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">joint</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">venture</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">plants</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">that</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">manufactures</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">Ultium</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">cells</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">will</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">follow</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">rigorous</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">quality</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">processes,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p>GM issued the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/gm-recalls-bolt-evs-once-again-over-fire-risks/">second recall</a> for the Bolt in July, telling customers it planned to replace defective battery modules to address fire risk. Until customers are notified that a replacement battery is ready for them, GM <a href="https://my.chevrolet.com/how-to-support/safety/boltevrecall">advised</a> to charge their vehicle after each use and to not let the battery level drop below around 70 miles of range.</p>

<p>The numbers were posted part of the automotive giant’s second quarter earnings release. It announced revenues of $34.2 billion, up $1.7 billion from the first quarter 2021, and $17.4 billion up from its year-ago quarterly result. GM also reported net income of $2.84 billion in the second quarter, up from a year-ago loss of $758 million, largely driven by the pandemic and associated economic fallout. GM&#8217;s adjusted income of $4.1 billion, a figure that is inclusive of recall costs.</p>
<p>Income was boosted by used car prices, truck and SUV sales, and strong profits at GM Financial. GM&#8217;s lending arm posted net sales of $3.4 billion and adjusted income of $1.58 billion for the quarter.</p>

<p>The automaker is bullish the remaining year. GM raised its adjusted full-year guidance to between $11.5 billion and $13.5 billion, or $5.40 to $6.40 a share. That&#8217;s up from their previous guidance of $10 billion to $11 billion, or $4.50 to $5.25 a share.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazon announced this morning it&#8217;s expanding its faster, same-day delivery service to half a dozen more U.S. cities. The service, which the retailer has been working to make same-day delivery even faster over the past year, now offers consumers in a number of markets the ability to shop up to 3 million items on Amazon.com, [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/faster-same-day-delivery-marks-milestone-by-adding-six-new-cities">announced</a> this morning it&#8217;s expanding its faster, same-day delivery service to half a dozen more U.S. cities. The service, which the retailer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/amazon-makes-its-same-day-delivery-service-faster-in-select-u-s-cities/">has been working to make same-day delivery even faster</a> over the past year, now offers consumers in a number of markets the ability to shop up to 3 million items on Amazon.com, then receive their orders in only a few hours.</p>
<p>To do so, Amazon invested in what it called &#8220;mini-fulfillment centers&#8221; closer to where customers lived in select U.S. markets, initially in Philadelphia, Phoenix, Orlando, and Dallas. Those customers could then shop across a dozen merchandise categories, including Baby, Beauty &amp; Health, Kitchen &amp; Dining, Electronics, Pet Supplies, and more. As the pandemic continued to impact Amazon&#8217;s business, in November 2020, Amazon expanded its faster same-day service to more cities, to include Nashville and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s expansion, Amazon is rolling out same-day delivery to Prime members in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Tampa, Charlotte, and Houston, bringing the total markets served to 12. In these markets, shoppers will be able to place orders online throughout the day then have items on their doorstep in as fast as 5 hours, Amazon says. Customers can also place orders by midnight to have their orders arrive the following morning.</p>
<p>The service continues to be free with no additional charges on orders over $35 that qualify for same-day delivery. Orders under $35 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GTFUTRQF459U3H3Y">have a $2.99 fee</a> for Prime customers, and a $12.99 fee for non-members. Prime membership, meanwhile, is $12.99 per month or $119 per year.</p>
<p>The time frame commitments for same-day delivery are the same as those Amazon promised last year when it first announced its plans to speed up Prime delivery. Orders placed between midnight and 8 AM will arrive today by 1 PM. Orders placed between 8 AM and 1 PM arrive by 6 PM; those placed between 1 PM and 5 PM will arrive by 10 PM; and those placed between 5 PM and midnight will arrive overnight by 8 AM. That means customers can place orders fairly late and receive their items before they head out of the house the next day.</p>
<p>Faster same-day delivery has been one of the most significant services Amazon has used to challenge rivals like Walmart and Target, who both benefit from having a large brick-and-mortar footprint that allows them to more quickly serve their customers through same-day order pickup, curbside pickup, and same-day delivery services. While Walmart partners with third-parties on its same-day service, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/express-delivery/3696472">Express delivery</a>, largely focused on grocery, Target acquired delivery service Shipt <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/13/target-is-buying-alabama-based-same-day-delivery-service-shipt-for-550-million/">in 2017</a> to bring its fast delivery services in-house.</p>
<p>In response to the growing competition, Amazon has been recently <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2019/07/11/amazon-on-the-hunt-for-small-warehouse-space-in.html">acquiring smaller warehouse space</a> inside major urban metros, <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2021/04/30/amazon-announces-new-delivery-stations-in-tampa.html">including</a> in <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2021/03/24/amazon-new-local-delivery-stations.html">these</a> six <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/business/2020/6/22/21299517/amazon-fulfillment-centers-suburban-chicago-matteson-markham">new</a> <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-expands-investment-metro-detroit-creates-thousands-new">markets</a> where it&#8217;s now announcing same-day delivery, as well as larger markets, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scoops-up-more-warehouse-space-on-staten-island-11580255458">like New York,</a> and even<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-16/amazon-plans-to-put-1-000-warehouses-in-neighborhoods?sref=gni836kR"> suburban neighborhoods</a>. It also acquired Whole Foods for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/16/report-amazon-is-gobbling-whole-foods-for-a-reported-13-7-billion/">$137.7 billion in 2017,</a> not only to more fully participate in the online grocery business, but also in part because of its large retail footprint.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Amazon has sped up the pace of what&#8217;s available under &#8220;Prime&#8221; delivery, it has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/amazon-is-shutting-down-its-prime-now-fast-delivery-app.html">wound down its older</a> &#8220;Prime Now&#8221; business, which was retired Aug. 30 and will be fully shut down by year-end. The separate app had allowed customers to shop items that were available in one or two hours for an additional fee.</p>
<p>The news follows Amazon&#8217;s earning miss last week, when the retailer<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/amazon-amzn-earnings-q2-2021.html"> fell short of Wall St.&#8217;s estimates for revenue</a>, and gave a weaker than-expected outlook for the quarter ahead, which Amazon attributed to difficult comparisons with a time frame that included Covid lockdowns during height of the pandemic in 2020. The company reported $113.08 billion in revenue and earnings of $15.12, versus expectations of $115.2 billion and $12.30.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For our Wednesday show this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> hosted a PR roundtable. Yep, our promise back when Alex Konrad came on the program to chat funding rounds is being fulfilled. Here&#8217;s who joined us:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/amynw">Amy Widdowson</a>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">VP Corporate Communications at <a href="https://www.zenogroup.com/">Zeno Group</a> and <a href="https://t.co/BK749xzZ5b?amp=1">newsletter writer extraordinaire</a> </span></li>

</ul>
<p>We had a few things to chat about, so we broke the show into a few sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Today&#8217;s PR world:</strong> The impact of COVID-19, burnout, what their work entails, and some tips for startups.</li>
<li><strong>The sheer pace of news today:</strong> The evolution of client expectations, managing clients themselves, and burnout.</li>
<li><strong>Tech vs. Media:</strong> We chatted content marketing, sharing details with the press, and why the media never shares drafts of stories before they go out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frankly it was a very good time and a fun chat. Shoutout to our guests for arriving <em>early</em> and being very put together. May all podcast guests in the future learn from such efforts. One guest was even wearing a shirt with a collar! In 2021! We were impressed.</p>
<p>Recall that Equity is off the rest of the week so that we can recharge and retool a bit. Hugs!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The wild swing in the price of Robinhood today appears from our vantage point to be another stonk moment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Update:</strong> <em>Trading of Robinhood shares has been <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1422915957945679875?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">halted</a> due to volatility. The company&#8217;s stock paused at $65.60 on Robinhood itself. Yahoo Finance has a higher $77.03 price on the company&#8217;s equity, up a stunning 64.59% today. Things are fluid, but Robinhood may have been halted and then rose again when it resumed trading. Stonks indeed.</em></p>
<p>Shares of Robinhood, an investing-focused consumer fintech company, soared this morning in pre-market trading. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/stonks-flying-burritos-and-my-bosss-bosss-bosss-boss/">stonk phenomenon</a>, which helped propel minor companies like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/"> GameStop and AMC earlier</a> this year, appears to be impacting Robinhood&#8217;s own stock; that much GameStop and AMC trading took place on Robinhood&#8217;s platform during stonk-fever is irony not lost on this publication.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what things look like this morning, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HOOD?p=HOOD&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch">per Yahoo Finance</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2185487" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-8.39.14-AM.png" alt="" width="681" height="128" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-8.39.14-AM.png 681w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-8.39.14-AM.png?resize=150,28 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-8.39.14-AM.png?resize=300,56 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-8.39.14-AM.png?resize=50,9 50w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /></p>
<p>Recall that Robinhood went public at $38 per share, the low end of its range, and sank in its early trading sessions to below its IPO price. Now, it&#8217;s worth $54 per share.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Normally we&#8217;d crack a joke and close this small news item here, but with Robinhood&#8217;s IPO featuring a unique twist on the traditional public offering, we have to do a bit more work. When it went public, Robinhood reserved a chunk of its equity for purchase by its own users. The impact of this was that more retail investors likely owned Robinhood equity at the start of its trading life than would be normal with a traditional IPO.</p>

<p>One hypothesis regarding Robinhood&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/robinhoods-cfo-says-it-was-ready-to-go-public/">somewhat slack early trading performance</a> was that early retail demand for its shares was sated by its effort to allow its users to buy stock in its shares, leading to a less-skewed supply/demand curve when it debuted.</p>
<p>Things have changed. What&#8217;s going on? Last week, an analyst <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/robinhood-stock-price-predictions-why-one-analyst-sees-hood-stock-hitting-65-1030663991">put a $65 per share price target</a> on the stock. And there are a <a href="https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnas/hood/research-ratings">handful of other ratings to chew on</a>. But the wild swing in the price of Robinhood today appears from our vantage point to be another stonk moment. The stock is being traded like a short-squeeze, even if some market participants <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/03/robinhood-shares-soar-more-than-20-percent-despite-lack-of-news/">are skeptical of the idea</a> due to what they view as a limited short interest in the company.</p>
<p>Checking the Robinhood IR page, there&#8217;s no news. Robinhood did not recently report earnings. And the company&#8217;s recent 606 filings that deal with PFOF incomes seemed to match up with expectations in revenue terms regarding what the company detailed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021014488/robinhoods-1a2.htm">in its Q2 2021 flash numbers</a>. Perhaps there was more crypto in there than expected, but nothing truly wild.</p>
<p>It appears that Robinhood is simply going up because it is. This happens in 2021; we just have to get used to it.</p>
<p>But what matters most for our purposes is that Robinhood&#8217;s decision to sell some IPO stock to its users did not manage to create so much float for the now-public unicorn to diminish weird trading. You can go public in an unusual manner and still catch a stonk wave. Now we know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Who says there is no big money in software aimed at helping people? Private equity firm <a href="https://www.apax.com/">Apax Funds</a> announced this morning that it is combining three social impact firms to create a platform of sorts in a deal valued at $2 billion.</p>
<p>To build this social good juggernaut, Apax went out and purchased <a href="https://www.everyaction.com/">EveryAction</a> from Insight Partners and <a href="http://www.socialsolutions.com/">Social Solutions</a> from Vista Equity Partners, two firms we often see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/private-equity-firms-can-offer-enterprise-startups-a-viable-exit-option/">involved in SaaS deals</a>.</p>
<p>The plan is to combine the two firms with <a href="https://impact.cybergrants.com/">CyberGrants</a>, a company that <a href="https://www.apax.com/news-views/apax-funds-invest-in-cybergrants/">Apax acquired in June</a>. With EveryAction, companies get a customer engagement platform focused on the needs of nonprofits. Instead of trying to get people to buy more stuff, the goal would be to increase engagement with donors. Social Solutions is a tool for gathering data on an organization&#8217;s activities and taking advantage of that data to coordinate service delivery and measure how well you are doing with your service goals.</p>
<p>Finally, CyberGrants is a corporate responsibility platform designed to help companies create programs for employees to volunteer in the community and &#8220;maximize the impact of corporate philanthropy.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EZlvAMoGtP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/five-key-lessons-from-founders-who-launched-social-impact-startups/">Five key lessons from founders who launched social impact startups</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five key lessons from founders who launched social impact startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/five-key-lessons-from-founders-who-launched-social-impact-startups/embed/#?secret=EZlvAMoGtP" data-secret="EZlvAMoGtP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Erin Mulligan Nelson, CEO of Social Solutions sees combining the three companies as a way to accelerate their individual efforts as companies. &#8220;Joining forces will empower human services agencies in both the non-profit and public sectors to fully capitalize on the opportunities for digital transformation. Our expanded offerings and opportunities for product innovation will create real value for our clients, improve outcomes for the people they serve, and help them accelerate lasting social change,&#8221; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>While the three companies have a common theme of using software to help customers operate more efficiently in a social impact context, putting together three disparate companies into a single platform could prove challenging, even if the new company will surely have numbers in its favor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apax reports the combined companies will generate $200 million in revenue, involving 650,000 non-profits and half the Fortune 500, while coordinating an impressive 38 million donors and volunteers. That is certainly scale.</p>
<p>PE firms tend to be looking for deals in undervalued companies that they can build up and find missing value, and if that involves software aimed at helping charitable efforts, so be it. The fact that Apax bought these companies from other PE firms suggests that this is an area that these companies are watching.</p>
<p>Of the three companies involved only Social Solutions raised venture capital, according to Crunchbase data, raising $70 million including a $59 million investment from former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer in 2018. As is often the case with PE deals, these three companies are a bit older, with EveryAction founded in 1997, CyberGrants in 1999, and Social Solutions in 2006. Perhaps they could use modernizing or could benefit from additional investment from a company like Apax, which hopes by combining these three companies, it can be a force in this space.</p>
<p>Sometimes bigger is better. Sometimes it&#8217;s not. Time will tell if Apax can pull this off. The deal will be subject to normal closing conditions and is expected to close some time this quarter.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Baleon Capital will invest in pre-Series A and Series A companies focused on health and medical care in the United States.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://baleoncapital.com/">Baleon Capital</a>, a one-year-old venture capital firm started by investment veteran Jon Kaiden, closed its first fund to invest in pre-Series A and Series A companies focused on health and medical care in the United States.</p>
<p>Before starting the Miami-based firm, Kaiden was a founding member and principal of Sopris Capital, where he told TechCrunch his track record of internal return on revenue landed him in the top 95th percentile of all early-stage funds. Baleon is a mash-up of the names of Kaiden’s four children: Brooke, Allie, Leo and Nicole.</p>
<p>Though he did not disclose the fund amount, Kaiden did say he was targeting $100 million for the second fund. He expects to initially be able to invest in between eight and 12 companies with $5 million to $10 million in check sizes. If he is able to get the $100 million, Kaiden plans for nearly three-fourths to go into initial investments and the rest for follow-on or new opportunities that come in.</p>
<p>Despite the pandemic, the past year was a “great environment to raise a fund,” he said. After running Sopris for 18 years, he thought it was time to raise a fund especially targeting the healthcare industry, which saw a boom.</p>
<p>“The pandemic tweaked a lot of the industry, especially virtual healthcare, and sped up a lot of things to be more efficient,” Kaiden said. “However, doctors are still among the slowest group to adopt technology.”</p>
<p>As a result, Baleon Capital will invest in companies building the new digital infrastructure for healthcare, aimed at reducing costs, improving access and solving inefficiencies that are hindering patient care. In addition to healthcare, the firm has identified opportunities in vertical SaaS, like finance and real estate.</p>
<p>Baleon’s first fund invested in three companies: Mantra Health, a digital mental health clinic on a mission to improve access to evidence-based mental healthcare for young adults; LifeLink, which is building infrastructure for modern patient engagement; and ClearStep, a care navigation platform leveraging artificial intelligence to match patients to the right provider based on their symptoms, insurance and location.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As healthcare settles into its new digital transformation, Kaiden sees an industry that will rely more heavily on data interoperability as electronic medical records and gleaning insights from big data will evolve. He expects that to help reduce costs without reducing patient satisfaction and provide better health outcomes.</p>
<p>“It’s always a good time in healthcare, and there will always be companies that are disruptive,” Kaiden said. “Healthcare is 18% of the country’s GDP — that is a huge part of our economy, and it is inefficient. That makes it ripe for entrepreneurs to disrupt it.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Zeni’s AI-powered finance concierge platform offers bookkeeping, accounting, tax and CFO services, essentially becoming a back-end controller for startups.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zeni.ai/">Zeni</a>, a Palo Alto fintech company providing real-time financial services data to venture-backed startups, raised $34 million in Series B funding led by Elevation Capital.</p>
<p>The new investment comes just five months after Zeni announced <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/zeni-raises-13-5m-to-put-a-real-time-digital-bookkeeper-inside-every-startup/">$13.5 million in a combined seed and Series A round</a>. The company has now raised $47.5 million in total since it was co-founded in 2019 by twin brothers Swapnil Shinde and Snehal Shinde.</p>
<p>Elevation was joined in the new round by new investors Think Investments and Neeraj Arora, as well as existing investors Saama Capital, Amit Singhal, Sierra Ventures, Twin Ventures, Dragon Capital and Liquid 2 Ventures. As part of the investment, Ravi Adusumalli, founder and managing partner at Elevation Capital, will join Zeni’s board.</p>
<p>The Shinde siblings started the company after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/virtual-travel-assistant-mezi-acquired-by-american-express/">selling their last company</a>, Mezi, a travel concierge, to American Express in 2018. Zeni’s AI-powered finance concierge platform offers bookkeeping, accounting, tax and CFO services, managing these for a flat monthly fee starting at $299 per month. Founders have real-time access to financial insights via the Zeni Dashboard, including cash in and out, operating expenses, yearly taxes and financial projections. They can also download the financial data in the “slice” that they want.</p>
<p>At the time of its seed/Series A round, the company was managing more than $200 million in funds each month, and that has ballooned to more than $500 million, CEO Swapnil Shinde told TechCrunch. Its customers range from pre-revenue startups to businesses generating more than $100 million in annual revenue.</p>
<p>In addition to the cash in and cash out analysis, the company also created a search function for transactions and spend and income trends on every customer and vendor, Snehal Shinde, chief product officer, said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185284" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185284" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2185284" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Zeni-Dashboard-dark-mode-zoomed-out.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Zeni-Dashboard-dark-mode-zoomed-out.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Zeni-Dashboard-dark-mode-zoomed-out.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Zeni-Dashboard-dark-mode-zoomed-out.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Zeni-Dashboard-dark-mode-zoomed-out.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Zeni-Dashboard-dark-mode-zoomed-out.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Zeni-Dashboard-dark-mode-zoomed-out.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Zeni-Dashboard-dark-mode-zoomed-out.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Zeni-Dashboard-dark-mode-zoomed-out.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185284" class="wp-caption-text">Zeni Dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zeni</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zeni experienced 550% revenue growth year-over-year, while the company’s customer base grew 375%, driven by referrals and organic growth, Swapnil Shinde said.</p>
<p>Despite the growth, the Series B came as a surprise to the siblings. The company was already “very well capitalized,” with a majority of the previous round still around, Swapnil Shinde said.</p>
<p>However, Zeni began receiving so many inbound inquiries that he said it was too exciting to pass on. Especially with the addition of Elevation Capital as an investor. Shinde said that was appealing because the firm was an investor in Paytm, and “knows how to partner and build unicorns.”</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to continue scaling and building the bookkeeping and accounting functions and to accelerate hiring, particularly in the engineering, sales and finance team verticals. Shinde expects to double or triple the finance team in the next year.</p>
<p>“As our customers scale through to their Series B, the more you can use our solution in real time to see what is happening with your finances, especially with startups and businesses having more of a remote workforce,” Swapnil Shinde added. “Zeni fits with that.”</p>
<p>Ash Lilani, managing partner at Saama Capital, one of Zeni’s earliest and largest investors, said he knew how big the total addressable market was — $200 billion — and how much these kinds of financial services were a giant pain point for startup companies.</p>
<p>“To know where you stand financially in real time is hard to do, usually, you get that information at month-end,” Lilani said. “I believe we have the opportunity to build a large company. Though Zeni is going after startups today, the small and medium markets can be leveraged. As they grow, Zeni will become their controller on the back end, while companies can just hire a CFO for the strategic decisions.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Buildots' technology automatically validates images captured by hardhat-mounted 360-degree cameras, detecting any gaps between the original design and what's actually happening on construction sites.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/buildots-raises-16m-to-bring-computer-vision-to-construction-management/">raising $16 million</a>, construction technology company <a href="https://buildots.com/">Buildots</a> is back to claim another $30 million, this time in Series B funding.</p>
<p>Lightspeed Venture Partners led the round, with participation from previous investors TLV Partners, Future Energy Ventures and Tidhar Construction Group. This gives the company $46 million in total funding, Roy Danon, co-founder and CEO of Buildots, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The three-year-old company, with headquarters in Tel Aviv and London, is leveraging artificial intelligence computer vision technology to address construction inefficiencies. Danon said though construction accounts for<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/digging-out-forecasting-for-construction-oems-in-the-next-normal"> 13% of the world’s GDP</a> and employs hundreds of millions of people, construction productivity continues to lag, only growing <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/construction-tech/">1% in the past two decades</a>.</p>
<p>Danon spent six months on construction sites talking to workers to understand what was happening and learned that control was one of the areas where efficiency was breaking down. While construction processes would seem similar to manufacturing processes, building to the design or specs didn’t happen often due to different rules and reliance on numerous entities to get their jobs done first, he said.</p>
<p>Buildots&#8217; technology is addressing this gap using AI algorithms to automatically validate images captured by hardhat-mounted 360-degree cameras, detecting immediately any gaps between the original design, scheduling and what is actually happening on the construction site. Project managers can then make better decisions to speed up construction.</p>
<p>“It even finds events where contractors are installing out of place and streamline payments so that information is transparent and clear,” Danon said. “Buildots also creates a collaborative environment and trust by having a single source telling everyone what is going on. There is no more blaming or cutting corners because the system validates that and also makes construction a healthier industry to work in.”</p>
<p>Buildots went after new funding once it was able to show product market fit and was expanding into other countries. The platform is being utilized on major building projects in countries like the U.S., U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia and China. To meet demand, Buildots will use the new funding to continue that expansion; double the size of its global team with a focus on sales, marketing and R&amp;D; and grow on the business side. Danon’s aim is “to get to the point where we are the standard for every construction site.” The company is also looking at areas outside construction where its technology would be applicable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Tal Morgenstern, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, said he keeps an eye on graduates of the Israel Defense Forces, where the three Buildots founders came from. However, in the case of this company, Lightspeed actually passed on both the seed and Series A.</p>
<p>Morgenstern admits the decision was a mistake, but at the time, he thought the technology Buildots was trying to build “first, impossible and second, I knew construction was difficult to sell into.” He felt that Buildots, with such a premium product, would have a challenge selling to a low-margin industry that was late to adopt technology in general.</p>
<p>By the time the Series B came round, he said Buildots had solved both of those issues, proving that it works, but also that customers were adopting the technology without much sales and marketing. In addition, other solutions in construction tech were still relying on lasers or people to manually input or tap photos.</p>
<p>“Buildots is seamlessly capturing images and providing a level of insights that is so high, and that is why the company is able to command the price structure they have and are receiving interesting commercial results,” Morgenstern said.</p>
<p>Walking around today’s construction site, Danon said the adoption of technology is enabling Buildots to move quickly to build processes for the industry.</p>
<p>As such, the company saw more than 50% growth quarter over quarter over the past year in three of the countries in which it operates. It is now working with four of the top 10 construction companies in Europe and around the world.</p>
<p>“We did a good job selling remotely, but now we need local offices,” Danon added. “We are also sitting on piles of data from construction sites. We learn from one project to another and want to look for the challenges where data will help make a financial impact. It’s a natural next step for the company.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even with all the years of work that have been put into improving how screen-based interfaces work, our experiences with websites, mobile apps, and any other interactive service you might use still often come up short: we can&#8217;t find what we want, we&#8217;re bombarded with exactly what we don&#8217;t need, or the flow is just buggy in one way or another.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FullStory</a>, one of the startups that&#8217;s built a platform to identify when all of the above happens and provide suggestions to publishers for fixing it &#8212; it&#8217;s obsessed enough with the issue that it went so far as to trademark the phrase &#8220;Rage Clicks&#8221;, the focus of its mission &#8212; is announcing a big round of funding, a sign of its success and ambitions to do more.</p>
<p>The Atlanta-based company has closed a Series D round of $103 million, an oversubscribed round that actually was still growing between me interviewing the company and publishing this story (when we talked last week the figure was $100 million). Permira&#8217;s growth fund &#8212; which has previously invested in other customer experience startups like Klarna and Nexthink &#8212; is leading this round, with previous investors Kleiner Perkins, GV, Stripes, Dell Technologies Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and Glynn Capital also participating.</p>
<p>FullStory, which has raised close to $170 million to date, has confirmed that the investment values the company at $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>Scott Voigt, FullStory&#8217;s founder and CEO, tells me that FullStory currently has some 3,100 paying customers on its books across verticals like retail, SaaS, finance, and travel (customers include Peloton, the Financial Times, VMware and JetBlue), which collectively are on course to rack up more than 15 billion user sessions this year &#8212; working out to 1 trillion interactions involving clicks, navigations, highlights, scrolls, and frustration signals. It says that annual recurring revenue has to date risen by more than 70% year-on-year.</p>
<p>The plan now will be to continue investing in R&amp;D to bring more real-time intelligence into its products, &#8220;and pass those insights on to customers,&#8221; and also to &#8220;move more aggressively into Europe and Asia Pacific,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>FullStory competes with others like Glassbox and Decibel, although it also claims its tools have more presence on websites than its three biggest competitors combined.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Working across different divisions like product, customer success and marketing, and engineering, FullStory uses machine learning algorithms to analyze how people navigate websites and other digital interfaces.</p>
<p>If approved as part of the &#8220;consent gate&#8221; you might encounter because of, say, GDPR regulations, it then tracks things like when they are clicking in areas excessively over a short period of time because of delays (the so-called &#8220;rage clicks&#8221;); or when a click leads nowhere because of, for example, a blip in a piece of JavaScript; or when a person is just scrolling or moving their mouse or cursor or finger in a frustrated (fast) way &#8212; again with little or no subsequent activity (or activity from the customer ceasing altogether) resulting from it. It <em>doesn&#8217;t use</em> &#8212; nor does it have plans to &#8212; use eye tracking, or anything like sentiment analysis around data that customers put into, say, customer response windows.</p>
<p>FullStory then packages up the insights that it does collect into data streams that can be used with various visualization tools (having Salesforce as a strategic backer is interesting in this regard, given that it owns Tableau), or spreadsheets, or whatever a customer chooses to put them into. While it doesn&#8217;t offer direct remediation (perhaps an area it could tackle in the future), it does offer suggestions for alternative actions to fix whatever problems are arising.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185455" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185455" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2185455" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fs-top-opportunities-conversion-copy.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="391" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fs-top-opportunities-conversion-copy.jpg 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fs-top-opportunities-conversion-copy.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fs-top-opportunities-conversion-copy.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fs-top-opportunities-conversion-copy.jpg?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fs-top-opportunities-conversion-copy.jpg?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fs-top-opportunities-conversion-copy.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185455" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://fullstory.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FullStory <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Part of what has given FullStory a big boost in recent times (this round is by far the biggest fundraise the company has ever done) is the fact that, in today&#8217;s world, digital business has become the centerpiece of all business. Because of Covid-19 and the need for social distancing that have taken away some of the traffic of in-person experiences like going to stores, organizations that have natively or built experiences online are seeing unprecedented amounts of traffic; and they are now joined by organizations that have shifted into digital experiences simply to stay in business.</p>
<p>All of that has contributed to a huge amount of content online, and a big shift in mindset to making it better (and in the most urgent of cases, even more basically, simply usable), and that has resulted in the stars aligning for companies like FullStory.</p>
<p>&#8220;The category was so nascent to begin with that we had to explain the concept to customers,&#8221; Voigt told me of the company&#8217;s early days, where selling meant selling would-be customers on to the very idea of digital experience insights. &#8220;But digital experience, in the wake of Covid-19, suddenly mattered more than it ever has before, and the continued amount of inbound interest has been afterburner for us.&#8221; He noted that demand is increasing among mid-market and enterprise organizations, and something that has also helped FullStory grow is the general movement of talent in the industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our customers tend to take their tools with them when they change their jobs,&#8221; he said. Those tools include FullStory&#8217;s analytics.</p>
<p>The evolution of bringing more AI into the world of basically structuring what might otherwise be unstructured data has been a big boost to the world of analytics, and investors are interested in FullStory because of how it&#8217;s taken that trend and grown its business on top of it.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to partner with the FullStory team as they continue to expand and build a truly extraordinary technology brand that improves the digital experience for all stakeholders,” said Alex Melamud, who led the transaction on behalf of Permira Growth, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Traditional analytics have been upended by AI- and ML-enabled approaches that can instantly uncover nuanced patterns and anomalies in customer behavior,&#8221; said Bruce Chizen, a senior advisor at Permira, in a statement. &#8220;Leveraging both structured and unstructured data, FullStory has rapidly established itself as the market and technology leader in DXI and is now the fastest-growing company in the category and the de facto system of record for all digital experience data.” Chizen is joining the FullStory Board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has become a lynchpin in the e-commerce machine over the years in part because it&#8217;s a site we consumers can visit to buy just about anything we want &#8212; sold either by Amazon or its<a href="https://www.feedbackexpress.com/amazon-1029528-new-sellers-year-plus-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 5 million+</a> third-party merchants &#8212; and easily get it delivered to our homes. But the system is not completely efficient, and today, one of the startups looking to build more economies of scale is announcing some funding<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> that it will use to roll up and consolidate some of these third-party merchants.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sumabrands.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suma Brands</a>, which buys up what it sees as some of the more interesting and successful brands <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling and fulfilling</a> their orders via Amazon, has picked up $150 million in funding, a round led by Pace Capital and Material alongside a credit facility led by i80 Group.</p>
<p>As with other roll-up plays that have raised huge sums of money, the majority of Suma&#8217;s round is coming in the form of debt, which will be used for acquisitions, with a smaller equity tranche to continue building out its tech stack and core business. In this case, equity is $12.5 million and the rest is in debt. Valuation currently is not being disclosed.</p>
<p>Roll-up plays are rolling into town at a very fast pace at the moment &#8212; we&#8217;ve written about many of them raising money, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/elevate-brands-banks-250m-to-roll-up-third-party-merchants-selling-on-amazons-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrasio</a>; <a href="https://heyday.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heyday</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Razor Group;</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branded</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroes</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SellerX</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perch</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/">X2</a>); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/benitago-group-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benitago</a>; Latin America’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valoreo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/founded-by-former-carousell-ovo-and-fave-execs-rainforest-raises-36m-to-aggregate-asia-pacific-amazon-marketplace-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainforest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/una-brands-launches-with-40m-to-acquire-brands-on-multiple-asia-pacific-e-commerce-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Una Brands</a> out of Asia.</p>
<p>In all of these, the premise is the same: Amazon has built its business on economies of scale, but that efficiency has not necessarily been played out at the marketplace level, where you still see the vast majority of sellers working as independent companies, facing all of the challenges they might face as they grow &#8212; these include the need for more sophisticated tech tools to manage areas like marketing, analytics, and supply chains; more buying power with suppliers; capital to grow; and more strategic talent succession plans.</p>
<p>This is where the roll-up plays step in: they provide a route for marketplace founders to potentially exit their businesses without giving them up, by giving them a chance to grow under the wing of a company looking to build the brands alongside others they are acquiring.</p>
<p>In the case of Minneapolis-based Suma, the startup is being led by co-founder Andrew Savage, who has a very interesting insight into the world of retail, and specifically online retail, by way of his background.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It includes years with Amazon itself, where he led teams in categories like toys, and also spearheaded the company&#8217;s push into targeting university students. Prior to that, he also worked for years at Target &#8212; where he was instrumental in building Target.com &#8212; and Best Buy.</p>
<p>Sidenote: these are also two Minneapolis companies, and one reason why this is such an interesting city in which to found an e-commerce startup.</p>
<p>He also spent time as an executive at hip, independent e-commerce company Dolls Kill, meaning he understands both the pain points of being a relatively small and indy brand, as well as the big behemoth that works to sell them on their platforms.</p>
<p>His two co-founders equally have interesting track records: Matt Salzberg was the founder and former CEO of Blue Apron; and Jon Dussel was the former CFO of Dolls Kill.</p>
<p>Savage told me he came to found Suma because he could see a clear opening to build a company to bridge the gap between small merchant and big platform better than it is today. While that might well spell economies of scale and economic opportunity &#8212; the two big motivators for other roll-up players &#8212; it feels a little more like Suma may be approaching that challenge from the operational perspective.</p>
<p>This will include helping manage supply chains and sourcing, running performance marketing, brand building and running multiple channels across Amazon and other properties, and providing working capital, Savage said.</p>
<p>“We vetted a number of potential investments in the space, but hadn’t found the right team until we talked to Suma,” said Jordan Cooper, General Partner at Pace Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Winners are going to be exceptional operators, and the Suma team from the co-founders on down have e-commerce operations in their DNA. They’re a tested team who have proven their ability to rapidly scale e-commerce businesses,&#8221; Asher Hochberg, Managing Director at i80 Group, added.</p>
<p>Suma, like others in this space, declines to say how many brands it has acquired so far, nor will it spell out too many specifics on its strategy of what it wants to pick up. Some of the companies in its stable today include a children&#8217;s footwear brand Lone Cone, and Turmaquik, a turmeric supplement company.</p>
<p>Savage tells me that the plan is not necessarily to buy up brands and give founders an easy exit, or even to tie every star to Amazon&#8217;s rise: some who want to join Suma may stay on, and some brands might find D2C to be a better or supplementary option to Amazon. There is no winner-takes-all, nor is there a one-size-fits-all approach, simply because it&#8217;s too big, and so many brands need help.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a $300 billion space, and growing at double digits,&#8221; said Savage. &#8220;It&#8217;s an ocean. And there are at least a couple of hundred thousand brands with more than $500,000 in revenues worldwide. It&#8217;s easy to get lost in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Refreshingly, in a market full of a lot of the same stuff &#8212; Amazon is overpopulated with sellers who all buy the same wholesale goods, and it&#8217;s somewhat depressing when you realize that choice isn&#8217;t nearly as big as it looks on first glance &#8212; Suma is looking to forge something different simply by focusing on other things.</p>
<p>&#8220;What gets out of bed is not creating financial instruments but a stable that makes people feel better,&#8221; said Savage. &#8220;The thing that differentiates us is that we are very founder-focused and spend a lot of time considering this before buying a business. We are really trying to avoid the me-too businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spoken with a number of founders in this field, and one of my biggest takeaways has definitely been that it may not be a winner-take-all-market if the space is a long term winner, because each company is bringing something unique to the table that gives them a new angle for success.</p>
<p>The &#8220;if&#8221; in that premise is still debatable, however, not least because Amazon could easily also become a consolidator, and might be best one of all in terms of operational expertise and financial muscle.</p>
<p>Savage said he wasn&#8217;t sure if Amazon would ever look to repeat the roll-up approach itself, but it&#8217;s an area to watch. If the strategy is strong enough for Amazon to try to replicate itself, it&#8217;s a pretty strong signal that it is one to continue pursuing (even with that extra competition in the field).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kuaishou Technology, a Chinese firm perceived as a ByteDance rival by many, said on Wednesday it will shut down its controversial short video app Zynn later this month. The app was only available in the U.S.</p>
<p>The firm, which last month said it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/tiktoks-chinese-nemesis-kuaishou-hits-1-billion-monthly-users-worldwide/">amassed 1 billion monthly active users</a>, didn’t offer an explanation for why it was shutting down the app, which was mired in controversy ever since it launched in May last year.</p>
<p>An investigation last year found that Zynn was <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/the-rise-of-new-short-form-video-app-zynn-could-spell-trouble-for-tiktok/578733/">paying users</a> to watch videos to superficially improve its ranking on the US iOS App Store. The app, a clone of TikTok, was also <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/zynn-hot-new-video-app-stolen-content/">pulled from the Play Store</a> after reports found the platform was riddled with videos that were stolen from other apps. It was then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292623/zynn-tiktok-clone-removed-ios-app-store-plagiarism-payments">pulled from the Apple App Store</a> following similar complaints.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Kuaishou spokesperson said the decision to stop services of Zynn won’t affect users in any other market. Kuaishou also operates similar apps in many other markets including South America (as Kwai) and the South Asian region (as Snack Video).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our strategy for the international markets remains unchanged,&#8221; said the firm, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/kuaishou-ipo/">raised $5.4 billion in its Hong Kong IPO</a> early this year.</p>
<p>Zynn app failed to attract users in the U.S. The app had just 200,000 monthly active users in June of this year, down from about 3 million in August 2020, according to mobile insight platform App Annie (data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South African insurtech platform <a href="https://www.naked.insure/">Naked</a> has raised $11 million in a Naspers-led round. Existing investors, Yellowwoods and Hollard, also participated in the funding round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">barely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two weeks after Naspers, via its early-stage tech investment vehicle Naspers Foundry, <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2021/07/22/insurtech-platform-ctrl-becomes-6th-sa-startup-backed-by-naspers-foundry-banks-2-3m/">invested in another South African insurtech platform Ctrl</a> in its $2.3 million Series B round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naked&#8217;s latest investment is a Series A round. According to a statement released by the company, Naspers Foundry invested $8.3 million as the lead investor &#8212; the largest the Naspers investment vehicle has made so far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2018 by Alex Thomson, Sumarie Greybe, and Ernest North, Naked is a digital insurance platform covering cars, content, homes, and standalone items. The company says it employs artificial intelligence to create new processes and experiences for its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa&#8217;s insurance sector is worth over $68 billion in annual gross written premiums. South Africa makes up 70% of this market, with an annual gross written premiums market of over $47 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only a fraction of personal insurance </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is sold</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without human intervention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the pandemic has changed the way South African millennials want to consume insurance products these days</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While 28% of South African millennials are in the market for insurance, 60% of them would prefer communicating with their insurer via the internet. For insurers, this online automation can reduce the cost of a claims journey by 30%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where Naked comes in. On the platform, customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are presented</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with lower costs than they would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordinarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> see in traditional insurance platforms, and more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they have more control of their insurance experience.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They can get a final insurance quote for their home, its contents, their standalone items or their car in less than 90 seconds, and switch or pause their cover, all online, without speaking to a contact center agent,&#8221; said the company in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naked </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that it does not plug into other insurance products in the market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the company built the product from the ground up, which allows it to add features that resonate with its customer base</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such feature allows customers to pause their car premiums whenever they&#8217;re not driving during the lockdown</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is methods like this that Naked takes into consideration to improve insurance experiences for consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our ambition is to build insurance that people love by offering an experience that is affordable, convenient, and transparent. We have come a long way since our launch in 2018 towards meeting these goals&#8230;,” said co-founder Alex Thomson. “But this is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the start of our journey to reinvent insurance. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have an investor of Naspers Foundry’s caliber on board to work with us as we expand our team, continue to invest in the technology that puts customers in control, meet the insurance needs of a growing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the SA market and enter into international markets.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This investment is Naspers&#8217; seventh since launching its Foundry arm back in 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $100 million fund targets </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">South African early-stage tech companies looking to &#8220;address big societal needs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asides from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aforementioned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> insurtech platform Ctrl and now Naked, Naspers has also invested in five other South African companies &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/naspers-co-leads-14-5m-extension-round-in-mobility-startup-whereismytransport/">mobility company WhereIsMyTransport</a>; edtech platform The Student Hub; food tech startup Food Supply Network; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/south-africa-startup-aerobotics-raises-17m-led-by-naspers-foundry/">agritech company Aerobotics</a>; and home service platform SweepSouth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re excited to support Naked in their journey of pioneering a new generation of insurance, giving consumers access to convenience, control, and savings with its end-to-end digital processes. This fits in with our focus of backing purpose-driven technology businesses. Investing in Naked is consistent with the portfolio we’ve built to date, and Naspers Foundry’s healthy pipeline of potential future investments,” head of Naspers Foundry Fabian Whate said in a statement.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More than one smartphone app startup has tried to convince you that by using their app you will miraculously stave off the ravages of age and flab. All I need to do is flip open my phone and real off a few: Gyroscope, MyFitnessPal, Welltory, ActivityTracker, SleepCycle. The list goes on. You name it, there’s a health app for it.</p>
<p>But today you get to download and kick the tires on a new app that is laying claim to be able to literally slow your aging.</p>
<p>We already covered the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/humanity-inc-raises-funding-to-allow-us-to-monitor-and-affect-our-rate-of-aging/">$2.5m seed funding</a> of <a href="https://www.humanity.health/">Humanity</a> late last year.</p>
<p>But now you can actually <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/humanity-stay-healthy-longer/id1519091344">download the iPhone app here</a> in the UK. And Android version is on its way. The app will launch in the US/Worldwide on the first week of September. A free version is available, but a premium subscription service of £30 a year will enable users to continuously monitor their biological age and the actions that are affecting it.</p>
<p>More on the app in a moment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the UK-based startup is clearly making waves amongst investors. It has now raised <em>yet another</em> seed funding round, this time totalling $2.5 million, from 65 health-tech and consumer-tech investors, taking its total raised to $5m.</p>
<p>Investors include Alex Tew and Michael Acton-Smith (Co-Founders of Calm), Taavet Hinrikus (Co-Founder of Wise, founding team of Skype), Robin Thurston (Co-Founder of MyFitnessPal), One Way Ventures, 7Percent, Seedcamp, Breega, Alexander Ljung (CEO and Co-Founder of Soundcloud) and legendary health tech investor Esther Dyson.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Humanity founders Pete Ward and Michael Geer have also built a ‘Science Advisory Board’, which includes Kristen Fortney, Co-Founder of BioAge, George Church who helped map the Human Genome and a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey">Aubrey de Grey</a>, a pioneer of the aging science movement and Chief Science Officer at the SENS Research Foundation, amongst others.</p>
<p>Humanity has also been playing out the invite-only strategy famously employed by startups like Clubhouse to keep the hype building and users bet-testing the app, reaching over 10k users, with, they say, a ‘waiting list of tens of thousands’.</p>
<p>This strategy seems to have paid off. The startup says it’s now reached the maximum number of users on TestFlight (Apple’s app testing facility) and has steadily grown its waiting list.</p>
<p>Ward and Geer teamed up over two years ago with the idea of creating an app that could monitor your biological age and give out hints and tips on how to slow and &#8211; they say &#8211; possibly even reverse it. This is not beyond normal science.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185448" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185448" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png" alt="Humanity app" width="600" height="600" class="size-full wp-image-2185448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185448" class="wp-caption-text">Humanity app</p></div></p>
<p>We are regularly told by doctors say that you can extend your lifespan just by doing simple things like exercising regularly, cutting out fast food, and all that jazz. But what Ward and Geer realized was that you could take standard advice like “walk more” or “drink more water” and actually <em>benchmark</em> this stuff to a real-world population.</p>
<p>So the secret sauce in the Humanity app, isn’t that it will tell you you’ve aged a little slower because you’ve had 8 hours sleep, or similar. It’s because other people of your age and health profile did that, and you’re being compared to that <em>real-world data</em>. Because Humanity isn’t drawing on data of other users of its app, but on a scientific database.</p>
<p>Geer said: “Aging remains the leading cause of disease globally, but few people make the connection between aging and their overall health &#8211; and most feel ultimately helpless to tackle it. Being ‘healthy’ is quite a nebulous term as it is completely personal to each individual. Being able to monitor your aging provides a truly holistic indicator of health, which could help reduce your probability of disease and extend the healthy lives of millions.”</p>
<p>Humanity’s appearance is good timing. The Coronavirus pandemic appears to have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/10/covid-life-expectancy-england-wales">cut life expectancy in England and Wales</a> by one year, sending it back 10 years with the poor hardest hit.</p>
<p>So how does the app actually work?</p>
<p>Humanity bills its app as being like the Waze traffic app, enabling you to navigate your way to a healthier lifestyle and “add years of fully functional, healthy life”, thus increasing your healthy lifespan, rather than living a reasonably long but unhealthy life.</p>
<p>After registering on the app, it takes you through the basics such as age, weight, and links into Apple Health.</p>
<p>You then get a ‘Humanity Score’ (H Score) in the app under one of four key categories &#8211; ‘movement’, ‘mind’ ‘recovery’, and ‘nutrition’. The higher the H Score the more likely you will see a slowing or reversal in the aging process over time, says the startup.</p>
<p>The app also connects with sensors in your smartphone and wearables to track data points such as heart rate, step rate, sleep, and activity. This then feeds into your ‘rate of aging’ and ‘biological age’, analyzing your profile and comparing it to data from the <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">UK Bio bank</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s where Humanity’s ‘special sauce’ lies.</p>
<p>The startup says it’s built algorithms validated against real-world outcomes from longitudinal biobanks (including the UK Biobank). These biobanks take anonymized data about the factors that affect a population’s lifespan. Humanity says it is drawing on in-house research and development alongside collaborations with the teams at Gero and Chronomics, and partnerships with companies like Illumina and <a href="https://www.eurofins.com/">Eurofins</a>.</p>
<p>Using all of this data, the app then makes suggestions, such as to go for a run, meditate, get more sleep etc. Admittedly any app could do this, but the fact that it is drawing on actual real-world data about what may really affect your lifespan, does instill a great deal more confidence.</p>
<p>But what about the matter of privacy?</p>
<p>Geer told me over a call: “Health data is obviously some of the most personal data you can have. So we try to keep as much of that data actually just locally on your phone. We&#8217;re running our algorithms mostly on your phone. Some of that stuff will have to pass back to our servers, but that&#8217;s encrypted both at rest and when it&#8217;s in movement. The little that we do take to our servers we keep strictly secure.”</p>
<p>But, is Humanity trying to replace other health apps? What’s the long game here?</p>
<p>Ward told me: “We&#8217;re not trying to replace Calm or My Fitness Pal etc. They&#8217;re actually part of the ecosystem that we will work with. What we want to do is really be a beacon for this way of using data, to actually know if people are getting healthier. Previously, this kind of health data was only available to study participants in universities, but we want everyone to be able to have this ability to compare their lifestyle to this real-world data. And we think this approach is far more powerful than the old-school &#8216;health app&#8217; model of just telling you to ‘walk 10,000 steps’ or whatever.”</p>
<p>But there is a wider issue here. Are we looking at a new opportunity for startups to leverage this global Bio Bank data, which is generally held by academic institutions in almost every country? Perhaps we shall see more startups emerge, trying to use it in similar ways to the Humanity startup. Times, as is usually the case, will tell. However, at least for now, Humanity has the jump on that potential competition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elroy Air has raised a $40 million Series A, including financing from Lockheed Martin’s venture capital arm, to ramp up the build, testing and validation of its inaugural autonomous cargo drone.</p>
<p>The funding round saw participation from Marlinspike Capital and Prosperity7, as well as existing investors Catapult Ventures, DiamondStream Partners, Side X Side Management, Shield Capital Partners and Precursor Ventures. This latest round brings Elroy’s total raised to $48 million to date.</p>
<p>The four-and-a-half-year-old company was founded by David Merrill and Clint Cope. “We started the company with this dual insight that the enabling technology was within reach, was here to build larger drones […] and that there would be a lot of useful things that larger systems can support,” Merrill said in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Elroy is focused on building what Kofi Asante, Elroy’s VP of strategy and business development, called “a dual-use system,” fit for both the defense industry and the commercial market. <a href="https://www.elroyair.com/">Elroy’s</a> flagship autonomous cargo aircraft, Chaparral, is designed to fly at a 300-mile range, carry 300-500 pounds of cargo, and have automated flying and cargo handling capabilities. The idea is to minimize the need for humans not only in the pilot seat, but on the ground, manually loading and unloading payload.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_V3oD7u5V6w?start=1" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Unlike other competitors in the space, Chaparral is hybrid electric, equipped all-electric propulsors, a generator, and a turboshaft jet engine. The generator is used mostly during take-off and landing, both of which are energy-intensive, as a way to boost power to the rotors.</p>
<p>Its propulsion system is a key differentiator between Elroy Air’s product and companies that are building eVTOL air taxis, like Joby Aviation. “What we heard from our customers was that they needed longer routes, longer range missions than what today&#8217;s battery technology can actually support,” Elroy Air CEO David Merrill said. “It became pretty clear to us that we needed an alternative supply side power plan on a vehicle.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another differentiator from other VTOLs is that Elroy has decoupled the cargo pod from the drone via the automated cargo handling function. Through a combination of GPS and sensing technology, the drone can pick up and drop off cargo automatically. The design is meant to maximize efficiency and free up humans for packing and staging the cargo pods.</p>
<p>This functionality could be especially useful in defense settings, as missions like resupply for soldiers can sometimes pose risks to pilot, crew, and cargo handlers.</p>
<p>“More generally, there&#8217;s this interest across the national security community of having logistics be more nimble and automated, and this shift from big expensive aircraft that you don&#8217;t have very many of to smaller, lower cost aircraft that you can have more of,” Merrill said.</p>
<p>The company has a handful of next steps it needs to take before it starts flying for either defense or commercial customers. On the defense side, Elroy will begin flight validation with the U.S. Air Force and the Navy next year. The company has a Phase 3 Small Business Innovation Research contract with the Air Force via Agility Prime, part of which is doing flight operations with these next systems.</p>
<p>The company would likely be able to start commercial operations abroad, in places that have different regulatory standards, before going through the full certification process here in the U.S. with the Federal Aviation Administration. It will need to achieve both a Type Certificate and a Part 135 certificate before it can start building out its business domestically. They’re staying flexible about potentially selling Chaparral systems to companies that want to operate the network themselves, and operating Chaparral systems itself as a full-service cargo airline.</p>
<p>“The space of drone delivery has risen up quickly with small last mile drones […] and now this new chapter is opening for middle mile [cargo delivery],” Merrill said. “We’re excited that the technology is ready to support this, customers want it, and we’ve built a team and assembled the funds to go after it.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today, customers start using products for free and either get value from it or not, but sales teams don’t have real-time data on their experience.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getcorrelated.com/">Correlated</a> on Wednesday announced it raised $8.3 million in seed funding to launch its product-led growth platform for sales teams.</p>
<p>NextView Ventures and Harrison Metal co-led the round and were joined by Apollo Projects, Attentive co-founders Brian Long and Andrew Jones, Cockroach Labs co-founder Ben Darnell and Atrium’s Pete Kazanjy. The round includes funding raised last year and more recent follow-on funding from both NextView and Harrison, co-founder and CEO Tim Geisenheimer told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The New York-based company was founded in 2020 by Geisenheimer and Diana Hsieh, who overlapped at TimescaleDB, and John Pena, who Geisenheimer met at Facet. In their previous roles, they saw a need to connect product data to sales tools.</p>
<p>While at Timescale, Geisenheimer said there were thousands of free users to talk to, and he and Hsieh built a similar version of a product-led growth platform there, but secretly wished there was something more like Correlated available.</p>
<p>What they saw was data across multiple tools being stored manually on spreadsheets so that actionable insights could be generated. The data would quickly become outdated. Add in that the way customers use products now is different. Traditionally, customers would not be able to use a product until they talked to the sales team. Today, customers start using products for free and either get value from it or not, but sales teams don’t have real-time data on their experience.</p>
<p>“Sales needs to know how customers are using the product and the right time for sales to engage based on maturity of the experience,” Geisenheimer said. “That was the missing piece of it and sales teams ended up talking to the wrong people. With Correlated, they can close more deals efficiently.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startups have never had it so good&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/embed/#?secret=u0PXT2IQAx" data-secret="u0PXT2IQAx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Correlated’s technology pulls in product usage data from tools and data warehouses and connects to a management platform like Salesforce or HubSpot, stitching it together into a data graph to show how customers are using a product. For example, within a company of 200 to 500 employees, a salesperson can see the frequency employees logged in and be alerted of when the best opportunity is to make the sale.</p>
<p>The company has a SaaS pricing model and is already working with mid-market companies like Ally, Pulumi, ReadMe and LaunchNotes. To support its launch out of beta, Geisenheimer intends to use the new funding for hiring across functions like engineering and go-to-market. The company has 11 employees currently.</p>
<p>There are other product-led growth platforms out there that raised venture capital funding recently, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/product-led-sales-startup-endgame-raises-over-17m/">Endgame</a>, and similarly Geisenheimer said the competition is often in-house product teams building their own systems. Correlated’s differentiator is that it has taken on that task itself and enables customers to quickly see value once they are up-and-running, he added.</p>
<p>David Beisel, co-founder and partner at NextView Ventures, said his firm invests in category stage companies and is currently operating out of its fourth fund, infusing business-to-business SaaS and e-commerce companies. Beisel has known Geisenheimer for nearly a decade now, having met him when NextView invested in one of Geisenheimer’s previous companies, TapCommerce.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day with Tim, he knows sales and the company is selling a product that has a strong founder market fit,” Beisel said. “We are moving toward a world where end-user adoption of software — not the initial engagement — is growing over time. Instead, Correlated empowers that initial sale and account expansion and that will align with where the industry is going.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These past few years have seen the emergence of buy now, pay later services worldwide, with leading players raising buttloads of cash to serve an insatiable young adult population who don&#8217;t fancy credit cards or paying interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what seems to be a consolidation of some sorts, fintech juggernaut Square acquired Australian buy now, pay later giant Afterpay in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/">mouthwatering $29 billion deal</a> this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal is a sign of things to come for established markets like Europe and the U.S. and promising markets witnessing a proliferation of these services. For instance, in the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/bnpl-middle-east-overview/">not less than ten startups</a> offering BNPL services have launched within the past three years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://tabby.ai/">Tabby</a> is one such service and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the most known in the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it is announcing that it has raised a $50 million Series B, valuing the company at $300 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Founders Capital and STV led the funding round, with participation from Delivery Hero and CCVA. Existing investors, including Arbor Ventures, Mubadala Investment Capital, Raed Ventures, Global Ventures, MSA Capital, VentureSouq, Outliers VC, JIMCO, and HOF, also participated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosam Arab founded the company in late 2019 after he left fashion e-commerce Namshi, a company he led as CEO until a Dubai-based real estate firm acquired it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch of tabby as a buy now, pay later solution was to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> target economic problems of the MENA and wider GCC region, says Arab</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, BNPL services address obvious pain points around the flexibility of payments for customers and better conversion rates for merchants. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in the Middle East, there&#8217;s another component tabby wanted to address, which was the over-dependence on cash as a payment method</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s so deep-rooted that while running Namshi, Arab noticed that 80% of the transactions recorded by the company were cash-based, presenting unique challenges to scaling the e-commerce platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With buy now, pay later, our view and hypothesis was that, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the well-known benefits of buy now, pay later, we also provide an alternative for consumers to pay online </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And if we&#8217;re able to do that, that becomes a very interesting solution for the retailers of this market.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company integrates with retailers to allow their customers to shop at online and physical stores with interest-free installments. Tabby went live in early 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it had a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> slow start because the launch coincided with the onset of the pandemic, it turned out to be in the company&#8217;s best interests, as merchants and customers began to shift online significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While pre-COVID e-commerce penetration levels in the GCC region stood at single digits, Arab thinks it might have increased to double digits due to the sheer number of merchants and consumers that have since embraced online commerce.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185359" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185359" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2185359" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/85A9F84A-8CDF-4390-A837-1680BE7FF7C8.jpeg?w=680" alt="Tabby" width="680" height="503" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/85A9F84A-8CDF-4390-A837-1680BE7FF7C8.jpeg 1157w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/85A9F84A-8CDF-4390-A837-1680BE7FF7C8.jpeg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/85A9F84A-8CDF-4390-A837-1680BE7FF7C8.jpeg?resize=300,222 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/85A9F84A-8CDF-4390-A837-1680BE7FF7C8.jpeg?resize=768,568 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/85A9F84A-8CDF-4390-A837-1680BE7FF7C8.jpeg?resize=680,503 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/85A9F84A-8CDF-4390-A837-1680BE7FF7C8.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185359" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tabby</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The jump in penetration is one reason tabby has scaled 20x </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transaction volume since June 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the company, more than 400,000 active shoppers use its platform, and approximately 3,000 installs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are recorded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> daily. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, over 2,000 global brands and small businesses, including Adidas, IKEA, SHEIN, and Marks &amp; Spencer, use the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fast growth has allowed tabby to secure another round of capital than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">originally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> planned, Arab adds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In June, the company raised $50 million in one of the largest debt facilities by a fintech in the MENA and GCC region. The investment follows tabby&#8217;s seed and Series A rounds of $7 million and $23 million </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2020 <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tabby">per Crunchbase</a>. This means tabby has received over $130 million despite launching early last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But tabby isn&#8217;t the only company with such firepower in the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its Saudi counterpart <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/tamara-series-a/">Tamara recently raised a $110 million Series A</a> in debt and equity financing from Checkout</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although Tamara claims Checkout acquired a minority stake, there are contrasting reports that prove otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the latter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">true, the buyout follows a line of consolidation happening in the MENA and wider GCC region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Australian BNPL company Zip Co said it was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210523005030/en/Zip-Expands-into-Europe-and-the-Middle-East-with-the-Acquisitions-of-European-BNPL-Provider-Twisto-and-UAE-based-Spotii">acquiring Spotti</a>, another major player in MENA, for $26 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Afterpay also took a significant stake in Postpay&#8217;s <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/postpay-10-million/">recent $10 million investment</a>. This series of events makes tabby the sole independent local player in the market. But how does the company see competition playing out?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing this level of competition globally. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that our market is any different. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the market is big enough to handle a few players. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many players is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the question, and will that lead into further consolidation down the line </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what we&#8217;ve seen as well, even with Square&#8217;s acquisition of Afterpay, is that there needs to be a broader differentiation from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plain vanilla BNPL. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if you continue to play in that very limited space of BNPL, the opportunities are going to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fairly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is why tabby strategically positioned itself with Delivery Hero instead of taking investments from an established BNPL player</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company, which owns and operates </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regional food and grocery delivery companies, including Talabat, InstaShop and Hunger Station, has one of the largest customer bases in the MENA region. And the investment marks Delivery Hero’s first fintech investment in MENA.</span></p>

He says the multinational sees &#8220;great potential in tabby to drive the industry forward and &#8220;is proud to be supporting the company on its growth journey.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahmad Alshammari, partner at co-lead investor STV, in a statement, said, &#8220;As the global BNPL market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to grow at ~30% CAGR over the next five years, we estimate that MENA will grow at least twice as fast, further accelerated by a rapid switch to contactless payments, e-commerce growth, and access to credit. Our doubling-down shows our strong belief that tabby is the market leader in MENA and that they will continue to drive BNPL’s growth across the region by enabling buyers and merchants alike.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding will help tabby expand its product portfolio and enter new markets in the GCC area. When that happens, will we see more consolidation take place? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, will companies like Klarna and Affirm, which don&#8217;t have a presence in MENA and the GCC, try to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or buy a majority stake in tabby</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is a very long journey ahead of us and where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we&#8217;re headed and what we want to build around this business,&#8221; Arab said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;And so the short answer is no, we&#8217;re not looking for a quick exit; otherwise, we would have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> done it by now. The opportunity here for us is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bigger.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Karan Bajaj, the founder and chief executive of WhiteHat Jr, is leaving the firm a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">selling the startup for $300 million</a> to Indian edtech giant Byju’s.</p>
<p>In an email to employees on Wednesday, Bajaj and Byju’s founder and chief executive Byju Raveendran said the departure follows a “mutually decided” decision made at the time of acquisition of WhiteHat Jr.</p>
<p>Chatter about Bajaj leaving the firm has been floating around for more than a quarter. TechCrunch inquired Byju’s in early April if Bajaj was going to leave the firm, a detail India&#8217;s most valuable startup dismissed as false at the time.</p>
<p>Days later, Byju&#8217;s announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/indian-edtech-giant-byjus-to-expand-to-international-markets/">rebranding its international business as Byju&#8217;s Future School</a> and Bajaj as its leader.</p>
<p>In the email today, Raveendran said, &#8220;while I wish he would&#8217;ve stayed longer, Karan is a force of nature and accustomed to making unconventional choices, as you all know, and I wish him only the best for what will surely be an exciting path ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raveendran said Trupti Mukker, who previously oversaw the customer experience at WhiteHat Jr, will now be leading WhiteHat Jr.</p>
<p>WhiteHat Jr, which teaches kids coding, math, and science to students in several markets including India, Australia and the U.S., is one of the fastest growing edtech startups in India. The startup has also drawn attention because of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/22/whitehat-jrs-founder-files-2-6m-defamation-suit-against-critic/">unusual step to sue critics</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;All in all, I&#8217;m truly very excited for your path ahead and deeply grateful for allowing me to be a part of your lives for this intense, challenging but deeply satisfying period we experience together,&#8221; wrote Bajaj to employees today.</p>
<p>Byju&#8217;s has made a series of acquisitions &#8212; including those of U.S.-based Epic, physical coaching centre chain Aakash and Asian edtech Great Learning &#8212; in recent months as the Indian edtech giant looks to aggressively expand into new markets and broaden its product offerings.</p>
<p>In the U.S, Byju&#8217;s now has three businesses that he expects would clock $100 million in revenues each this year, he told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p>
<p>He said the startup acquires other firms and helps them super-charge their growth and the original founding teams continue to oversaw those operations.</p>
