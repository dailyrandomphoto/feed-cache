<p><strong>The big story: Biden&#8217;s labor secretary says gig workers should be reclassified</strong></p>
<p>The Biden administration&#8217;s labor secretary Marty Walsh recently said in an interview with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-labor-secretary-says-most-gig-workers-should-be-classified-2021-04-29/">Reuters</a> that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/labor-secretary-reclassify-gig-workers-biden/">he&#8217;s &#8220;looking at&#8221; the gig economy</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In a lot of cases gig workers should be classified as employees,” Walsh said. “In some cases they are treated respectfully and in some cases they are not and I think it has to be consistent across the board.”</p>
<p>For now, this is just talk, but it suggests that new regulations and gig work reclassification could be a priority for the new administration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/orchard/">Orchard</a>, founded in 2017, was relatively early to the proptech industry. The company, originally called Perch, focused on dual-trackers, which are folks who are both buying and selling a home simultaneously. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/firstmark-capital/">FirstMark Capital</a> led both the Series A and the Series B funding rounds for Orchard, doubling down on the real estate platform.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have FirstMark Capital Managing Partner Rick Heitzmann and Orchard CEO Court Cunningham join us on an upcoming episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>. The event takes place on <strong>May 5 at 3pm ET/noon PT</strong>. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-firstmark-capital-and-orchard">Register here.</a></p>
<p>Orchard has raised more than $350 million, including a $200 miilion+ debt financing. Alongside running a full brokerage company for dual-tracking home buyers and sellers, it also offers title and mortgage services. But what&#8217;s most interesting about the vertically integrated company is the innovation it&#8217;s doing around the consumer experience. Namely, Orchard is taking an entirely new approach to home searching, which has been incredibly stagnant despite the rush to digitize the process by major tech players.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Orchard allows consumers to get ML-driven recommendations based on homes they&#8217;ve already liked, and search by different rooms in the house. For example, perhaps the backyard or the kitchen is the most important part of the house &#8212; Orchard lets you default to that pic when browsing listings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rick Heitzmann founded FirstMark Capital all the way back in 2008. He&#8217;s led investments in companies including Pinterest, Airbnb, StubHub, Tapad, DraftKings, Riot Games, Ro, Discord, Carta and more.</p>
<p>On Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;ll talk more about what Heitzmann looks for in a founder, what he sees in Cunningham and the future of proptech, why Cunningham chose FirstMark and even take a walk through Orchard&#8217;s early pitch deck.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also look at pitch decks submitted by the audience, giving you the chance to hear directly from a founder and investor how they consume funding decks, what works and what doesn&#8217;t. If you want to submit your deck to be featured in a future episode of ECL, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">hit up this link</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s gonna be a blast.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The red-hot market for special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, has “screeched to a halt,” according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/26/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html">CNN</a>. As the SPAC market grew in the past six months, it seemed that everyone was getting into the game, with celebrities from Shaquille O’Neal to former House Speaker Paul Ryan leading their own SPACs.</p>
<p>But shareholder lawsuits, huge value fluctuations and warnings from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have all thrown the brakes on the SPAC market, at least temporarily. So what do privately held tech companies that are considering going public need to know about the SPAC process and market?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Despite some warning signs, there are still hundreds of SPACs on the market looking to close deals, and this process can still have plenty of upsides.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>SPAC perks</h2>
<p>First, the upside of SPACs: They’re a much more efficient way for a private company to go public than a traditional IPO. By merging with a SPAC instead of launching an IPO, a private company can avoid the rigamarole of working with underwriters, hosting roadshows, preparing a prospectus and other complexities of the public filing process.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it can potentially be a fast track into an IPO with a seasoned partner who has experience navigating the process.</p>
<p>There are also big potential financial upsides. For example, stockholders of the private company will often roll over their stock and provide significant cash liquidity. SPACs also offer more certainty about a private company’s valuation than a traditional IPO, and some experts believe that a SPAC can add up to <a href="https://www.crestbridge.com/insights/special-purpose-acquisition-companies-innovative-solution-capital-raising#:~:text=There%20are%20numerous%20benefits%20to,a%20typical%20private%20equity%20deal">20%</a> to a company’s sale price compared to a typical private equity transaction.</p>
<p>And, especially when the SPAC market was hot, multiple SPACs could create a bidding war to increase value and generate more favorable terms for a transaction than through the traditional capital markets.</p>
<p>Lastly, partnering with an experienced management team and impressive industry insiders can help a private company accelerate its financial growth and create long-term value.</p>
<h2>Warning signs</h2>
<p>All these benefits led to a dramatic increase in SPAC transactions in late 2020 and early 2021. But the market cooled substantially in April, in part because of high-profile problems in the market and signs that the SEC will be scrutinizing the entities more closely in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Biden Labor Secretary Marty Walsh charged into the white hot issue of the gig economy Thursday, asserting that many people working without benefits in the gig economy should be classified as employees instead.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-labor-secretary-says-most-gig-workers-should-be-classified-2021-04-29/?taid=608af69798240b0001ea90a3&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter">an interview with Reuters</a>, Walsh said that the Department of Labor is &#8220;looking at&#8221; the gig economy, hinting that worker reclassification could be a priority in the Biden administration.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; In a lot of cases gig workers should be classified as employees,&#8221; Walsh said. &#8220;In some cases they are treated respectfully and in some cases they are not and I think it has to be consistent across the board.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Walsh also said that the labor department would be talking to companies that benefit from gig workers to ensure that non-employees at those companies have the same benefits that an &#8220;average employee&#8221; in the U.S. would have.</p>
<p>&#8220;These companies are making profits and revenue and I&#8217;m not [going to] begrudge anyone for that because that&#8217;s what we are about in America&#8230; but we also want to make sure that success trickles down to the worker,&#8221; Walsh said.</p>
<p>Walsh&#8217;s comments aren&#8217;t backed by federal action, yet anyway, but they still made major waves among tech companies that leverage non-employee labor. Uber and Lyft stock dipped on the news Thursday, along with Doordash.</p>
<p>In the interview, Walsh also touched on pandemic-related concerns about gig workers who lack unemployment insurance and health care through their employers. The federal government has picked up the slack during the pandemic with two major bills granting gig workers some benefits, but otherwise they&#8217;re largely without a safety net.</p>
<p>Reforming labor laws has been a tenet of Biden&#8217;s platform for some time and the president has been very vocal about bolstering worker protections and supporting organized labor. One section of then President-elect Biden&#8217;s transition site was devoted to expanding worker protections, calling the misclassification of employees as contract workers an &#8220;epidemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biden echoed his previous support for labor unions during a joint address to Congress Wednesday night, touting the Protecting the Right to Organize Act — legislation that would protect workers looking to form or join unions. That bill would also expand federal whistleblower protections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The middle class built this country,&#8221; Biden said. &#8220;And unions build the middle class.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Live audio experiences will be adopted by every major platform just like Stories have been, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told investors on Wednesday&#8217;s earnings call. The streaming service recently <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-30/spotify-acquires-locker-room-and-announces-plans-for-a-new-live-audio-experience/">acquired</a> a live audio app, Locker Room, whose technology it expects to use to power a range of new live audio conversations centered around sports, culture and, of course music.</p>
<p>Investors were curious how exactly Locker Room would fit in with Spotify&#8217;s current offerings, given the streamer today is focused on delivering recorded content &#8212; music and podcasts &#8212; amd not some sort of live social networking experience.</p>
<p>Ek, mirroring what many in the industry have already been thinking, said he sees live audio as a new set of capabilities that will be broadly adopted by all. He basically dubbed it the next &#8220;Stories&#8221; &#8212; a feature popularized by Snapchat, but that eventually made its way to every platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really no different than how you think about Stories,&#8221; Ek said, explaining his thoughts on live audio. &#8220;Stories today exist on a format on a number of platforms, including Spotify, including, of course, Instagram, Snap and many others. So, I do look at [live audio] as a compelling feature set, and I think creators will engage in the places where they have the best sort of creator-to-fan affinity for the type of interactions that they&#8217;re looking for. And I think this is very similar to say how Stories played out historically.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, each platform may attract a certain kind of live audio creator, and Spotify sees its own potential in the realm of music and culture &#8212; the latter thanks to its existing and expansive investments in podcasts.</p>
<p>The interest in live audio emerged in the middle of a pandemic that trapped people at home and shut down traditional networking and large events, like conferences. But that doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s no future for the format when the world opens back up.</p>
<p>Of course, Clubhouse gets credit for dring the interest in the live audio space as its exclusive invite-only status attracted a crowd of determined networkers (and clout-chasers) looking to participate in the next big thing. But as the app grew more popular, snagging big-name celeb guests &#8212; like Tesla founder Elon Musk, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, actor-turned-investor Ashton Kutcher, Drake, Oprah, and more &#8212; other tech companies began to take notice. Soon, everyone was building a Clubhouse clone.</p>
<p>Today, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Twitter, Discord, Telegram, and even LinkedIn have plans for live audio in various stages of development or availability.</p>
<p>Instead of starting from scratch, however, Spotify made an acquisition. Thanks to Locker Room, originally a place to discuss sports, Spotify said it would soon open up live audio to more professional athletes, writers, musicians, songwriters, podcasters, and &#8220;other global voices&#8221; who want to host real-time conversations. The Locker Room service will be rebranded as &#8220;Spotify Greenroom,&#8221; Ek noted, via a company <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4OsuS4G6ukepPsjme51uFt?si=EeR5IFrHRSqCJYIYXDh8Lg">podcast</a>.</p>
<p>In its first earnings call since the deal was announced, investors asked whether Spotify believed linear consumption of spoken word audio was more interesting than music streaming.</p>
<p>Ek explained how spoken word content may only be the beginning of what&#8217;s to come as the format evolves.</p>
<p>&#8220;As more people start engaging with a feature in a medium, you start seeing more and more professional creators jump on board. So I think it&#8217;s probably going to start out with spoken word content,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But specifically as it relates to Spotify, I think that there will be a lot of musicians that want to engage in everything from speaking to their fans to having listening parties and all other things because it&#8217;s so clear to them that on the Spotify platform, that engagement drives meaningful conversion to monetization opportunities just on the basis of our revenue model.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotify said that the biggest request it gets from its over 8 million creators are to have more ways for them to connect with fans. Live audio, by its nature, would give them a very direct way to do just that, given Spotify&#8217;s reach  of over 350 million users.</p>
<p>In other words, live audio does not present some either/or scenario with regard to music streaming, as the investor&#8217;s question suggested. It&#8217;s more of a loop where one thing feeds the other. And &#8220;live,&#8221; apparently, could also mean music, not just chat.</p>
<p>For example, Ek hinted, when an artist has an album to promote, &#8220;you as the fan, may be able to experience that earlier than other consumers can.&#8221; Oh really?</p>
<p>Artists could also use live audio to talk about their thinking around writing a song, similar to what the <a href="https://support.spotify.com/nr/article/lyrics/">Genius integration</a> &#8220;Behind the Lyrics&#8221; today provides.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it really comes down to the quality of the content,&#8221; said Ek. &#8220;And I think when I look at our 8 million creators, we have some of the world&#8217;s best storytellers on the platform, and that&#8217;s ultimately what people will tune into, and that&#8217;s what matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>But one area that could be difficult is moderation of live content. Live audio presents a whole new range of challenges for any company, as conversations can go off the rails quickly. And Spotify&#8217;s position on drawing line between free speech and policing misinformation or other inappropriate content is still somewhat murky. Its top podcaster Joe Rogan <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/28/media/daniel-ek-responds-joe-rogan-podcast-controversy/index.html">recently advised listeners</a> to not get the Covid vaccine, if they were young and healthy, for example. Spotify <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/joe-rogan-anti-vaccine-podcast-spotify-1234961803/">declined</a> to weigh in on this particular controversy. But it has removed <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2021/04/06/joe-rogan-spotify-removing-shows/">some 40-plus episodes</a> from the same podcast in the past &#8212; some for seemingly lesser violations, like an episode about Bulletproof Coffee and its health claims, for instance.</p>
<p>Before Spotify wades into live audio, it may want to first solidify its own values around creator content. It will need a careful, worst-case-scenario plan for what happens when a live session goes out of bounds, too.</p>
<p>Despite Ek&#8217;s optimism around live audio, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/spotify-stock-tumbles-in-the-premarket-amid-signs-subscriber-growth-is-slowing-11619615730">Spotify&#8217;s stock tumbled after earnings</a> as there were signs of slowing growth on the horizon, thanks to increased pressure from rivals, like Apple and Amazon. The company added 3 million paid subscribers in the quarter, but missed on expectations of monthly active users and lowered its full-year guidance. Revenues were up €2.1 billion ($2.6 billion) in the quarter, a 16% increase from the same period last year but down 1% from Q4 2020, raising concerns. But live audio could give fans a reason to tune back in more often in the future, if the Spotify can make the integration work.</p>

<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			This push for greater data liquidity coincides with demand from consumers for better information about cost and quality.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In 2009, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act <a href="https://www.asha.org/practice/reimbursement/hipaa/hitech-act/">(HITECH)</a> gave the first big industry push, catalyzing a wave of digitization through electronic health records (EHR). Today, over 98% of medical records are digitized. This market is dominated by multibillion‐dollar vendors like Epic, Cerner and Allscripts, which control 70% of patient records. However, these giant vendors have yet to make these records easily accessible.</p>
<p>A second wave of regulation has begun to address the problem of trapped data to make EHRs more interoperable and valuable. Agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services have mandated data sharing among payers and providers using a common standard, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) protocol.</p>

<p>This push for greater data liquidity coincides with demand from consumers for better information about cost and quality. Employers have been steadily shifting a greater share of healthcare expenses to consumers through high-deductible health plans — from 30% in 2012 to 51% in 2018. As consumers pay for more of the costs, they care more about the value of different health options, yet are unable to make those decisions without real-time access to cost and clinical data.</p>

<p>Tech startups have an opportunity to ease the transmission of healthcare data and address the push of regulation and consumer demands. The lessons from fintech make it tempting to assume that a Plaid for healthcare data would be enough to address all of the challenges within healthcare, but it is not the right model. Plaid’s aggregator model benefited from a relatively high concentration of banks, a limited number of data types and low barriers to data access.</p>
<p>By contrast, healthcare data is scattered across tens of thousands of healthcare providers, stored in multiple data formats and systems per provider, and is rarely accessed by patients directly. Many people log into their bank apps frequently, but few log into their healthcare provider portals, if they even know one exists.</p>
<p>HIPPA regulations and strict patient consent requirements also meaningfully increase friction to data access and sharing. Financial data serves mostly one-to-one use cases, while healthcare data is a many-to-many problem. A single patient’s data is spread across many doctors and facilities and is needed by just as many for care coordination.</p>
<p>Because of this landscape, winning healthcare technology companies will need to build around four propositions:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is continuing its Starship spacecraft testing and development program apace, and as of this afternoon it has authorization from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to conduct its next three test flights from its launch site in Boca Chica, Texas. Approvals for prior launch tests have been one-offs, but the FAA said in a statement that it&#8217;s approving these in a batch because &#8220;SpaceX is making few changes to the launch vehicle and relied on the FAA&#8217;s approved methodology to calculate the risk to the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>SpaceX is set to launch its SN15 test Starship as early as this week, with the condition that an FAA inspector be present at the time of the launch at the facility in Boca Chica. The regulator says that has sent an inspector, who is expected to arrive today, which could pave the way for a potential launch attempt in the next couple of days.</p>
<p>The last test flight SpaceX attempted from Boca Chica was the launch of SN11, which occurred at the end of March. That ended badly, after a mostly successful initial climb to an altitude of around 30,000 feet and flip maneuver, with an explosion triggered by an error in one of the Raptor engines used to control the powered landing of the vehicle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In its statement about the authorization of the next three attempts, the FAA noted that the investigation into what happened with SN11 and its unfortunate ending is still in progress, but added that even so, the agency has determined any public safety concerns related to what went wrong have been alleviated.</p>
<p>The three-launch approval license includes flights of SN16 and SN17 as well as SN15, but the FAA noted that after the first flight, the next two might require additional &#8220;corrective action&#8221; prior to actually taking off, pending any new &#8220;mishap&#8221; occurring with the SN15 launch.</p>
<p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has at time criticized the FAA for not being flexible or responsive enough to the rapid pace of iteration and testing that SpaceX is pursuing in Starship&#8217;s development. On the other side, members of <a href="https://spacenews.com/congress-raises-concerns-about-faas-handling-of-starship-launch-license-violation/">Congress have suggested that the FAA has perhaps not been as thorough as necessary</a> in independently investigating earlier Starship testing mishaps. The administration contends that the lack of any ultimate resulting impact to public safety is indicative of the success of its program thus far, however.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">R.I.P. Madefire, a startup that recruited high-profile artists to reinvent comics for new formats and platforms.</p>
<p>An announcement on <a href="https://www.madefire.com">the Madefire website</a> states the company entered into &#8220;an assignment of benefit for creditors&#8221; (explained as &#8220;a state-level insolvency proceeding similar to bankruptcy&#8221;) earlier this month, which was then <a href="https://www.comicsbeat.com/madefire-shuts-down-leaving-several-digital-comics-apps-in-limbo/">reported this morning in The Beat</a>. As a result, no new books will be published, users will not be able to purchase any additional books and they&#8217;re also encouraged to download all their purchased content before the end of the month.</p>
<p>This news affects other apps built with Madefire&#8217;s technology. The Archie comics app has shut down as well, with the publisher <a href="https://archiecomics.com/appnews/">writing</a>, &#8220;We realize this comes as a surprise and we are making every effort to do right by our loyal customer base,&#8221; specifically by offering readers a free one-month subscription to Comixology Unlimited. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/10/amazon-acquires-digital-comic-book-service-comixology/">Amazon acquired digital comics platform Comixology</a> in 2014, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/27/comixology-unlimited-interview/">launching an Unlimited subscription service</a> two years later.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Madefire first l<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/21/madefire-launch-dave-gibbons/">aunched in 2012</a>, back when publishers were experimenting with formats like motion comics. The company described its titles as &#8220;motion books,&#8221; combining the animation and effects of motion comics with a more traditional reading experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Motion comics are a passive experience, a watching experience that is tantamount to bad animation – it’s like watching a movie,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Ben Wolstenholme said at the time. &#8220;Motion Books is a reading experience, actively controlled by the reader – it’s like reading a book. Our goal is to be the best reading experience developed for the iPad.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the most impressive thing about the company was the artists it had enlisted before launch, including Dave Gibbons and Bill Sienkiewicz.</p>
<p>More recently, Madefire announced partnerships with other tech platforms, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/18/20698572/overwatch-comics-madefire-snapchat">Snapchat</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/magic-leap-has-a-new-chief-executive-and-its-former-microsoft-exec-peggy-johnson/">troubled</a> augmented reality company <a href="https://www.magicleap.com/en-us/news/product-updates/madefire-magic-leap-launch">Magic Leap</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/madefire">According to Crunchbase</a>, Madefire had raised $16.4 million in funding from investors including True Ventures, Plus Capital, Kevin Spacey (yes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/movies/kevin-spacey-anthony-rapp-lawsuit.html"><em>that</em> Kevin Spacey</a>) and Drake, but The Beat reports that the total was &#8220;even more than that.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gaming and streamed video have been two of the biggest pastime winners during the last year+ of pandemic living. Today a startup that has created an app that brings those two entertainment formats together is announcing a notable seed round of funding as it prepares to come out of closed beta.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.portalone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PortalOne</a>, a hybrid gaming startup, is announcing a $15 million seed round of funding as it prepares to come out of closed beta with an app that lets people play on-demand games and also watch live shows in which users can play against a special guest.</p>
<p>The startup and its funding are notable in part because of who is doing the investing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It includes Atari and camera maker ARRI, Founders Fund, TQ Ventures (the firm led by Scooter Braun and financiers Schuster Tanger and Andrew Marks), Coatue Management (specifically Arielle Zuckerberg), Rogue Capital Partners (Alice Lloyd George&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/alice-lloyd-george-launches-fund-for-deep-tech-internet-culture-11599213601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new fund</a>), Signia Venture Partners (via Sunny Dhillon); Seedcamp, Talis Capital and SNÖ Ventures out of Europe.</p>
<p>Other investors included Kevin Lin, the co-founder of Twitch; Mike Morhaime, co-founder of Blizzard and Dreamhaven; Amy Morhaime, co-founder of Dreamhaven; Marc Merrill, co-founder of Riot Games; Xen Lategan, former CTO and executive advisor at various companies such as Hulu; and Eugene Wei, former Head of Video at Oculus and Head of Product at Hulu.</p>
<p>PortalOne is part tech startup, and part media company. On the one hand, it has spent the last three years building a full stack of hardware and software that can be used to build games, record live shows, and integrate the two into an experience that blends both on-demand and real-time gaming and entertainment.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the benefits of building first is that what we are doing is extremely hard to do on a technical level,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Bård Anders Kasin</span>. &#8220;The way we do it is the key. It is our secret sauce.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other, it is using that tech to create a gaming and live events platform and brand &#8212; providing a place for itself and third parties to build games and bigger live experiences around them. It believes that it&#8217;s managed to do something here that has eluded others for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We come from the entertainment industry and have also been in games many years,&#8221; said Stig Olav Kasin, Bård&#8217;s brother, CXO, and the other co-founder. &#8220;We’ve talked to all the big companies and know that hybrid gaming combining games and TV is difficult,&#8221; not least because of the silos in companies where different groups &#8220;own&#8221; TV and gaming.</p>
<p>The Oslo-based company has so far been running a pared-down, early version of its service in the US and Norway &#8212; two games in so far, one called Blockbuster that, well, involves you throwing a massive ball and knocking over blocks, and another a reimagined version of Centipede &#8212; with corresponding talk shows set out of a living room that&#8217;s actually all computer-generated on a green screen.</p>
<p>Users can play and watch all this either through a VR headset or over a phone, and they win &#8220;prizes&#8221; for placing well in gaming competitions. Alongside that PortalOne will sell virtual goods much as companies like Fortnite do today.</p>
<p>The plan is to more widely launch the first iteration of its service &#8212; PortalOne Arcade, a selection of 80s-themed, old-school arcade games reimagined as multiplayer, immersive experiences combined with interactive talk shows &#8212; in the US and Norway later this year before extending to other markets.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Bård Anders Kasin &#8212; who previously built a VR company and worked as a technical director at Warner Brothers, making movies such as the Matrix trilogy &#8212; and Stig Olav Kasin &#8212; who worked with his brother on VR and before that was a media exec on shows like </span><em style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Voice</em><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><em style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</em><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; founded PortalOne back in 2018. </span></p>
<p>Between then and June 2020, when PortalOne launched its closed beta, the startup&#8217;s focus was on building out its technology and its content strategy and early partners.</p>
<p>From the sounds of it, it was no small task. Its tech stack incorporates virtual reality, computer vision, gaming technology, and software and hardware to capture and stream video that drastically reduces the resources required for both, among other IP. Some of it PortalOne built itself; other areas it worked with Arri, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major player</a> in motion picture camera equipment, which built a new kind of 3D camera for PortalOne.</p>
<p>Part of the challenge that PortalOne has been tackling has been the very process of creating content for a hybrid platform like the one it envisioned.</p>
<p>Typically, recording immersive experiences is complex and expensive because of the volumetric equipment that is used, the set-up of studios necessary to capture the experiences, and more, which involve Hollywood-movie-studio size, staffing and costs.</p>
<p>PortalOne&#8217;s breakthrough has been to turn that process into something that can be produced more easily and at a much lower cost, necessary &#8220;since we have daily shows and we want to scale and mass produce more daily shows for each game,&#8221; said Bård.</p>
<p>In the PortalOne setup, in addition to the host &#8212; an affable Norwegian with a mostly American English accent called Markus Bailey &#8212; and his guest, there are only two other people involved, technician-producers triggering effects and controlling when the action switches from talk to game and back again.</p>

<p>From previously needing large sets and dozens of people, &#8220;now we can do all of this in a YouTube-sized studio,&#8221; said Bård.</p>
<p>On the content front, PortalOne is building its own games, but it is also tapping into an old-school gaming aesthetic, it said.</p>
<p>Atari is not only investing, but has inked a seven-year deal with PortalOne, giving the latter exclusive global distribution rights to some of its most popular arcade game franchises, which PortalOne is reimagining and rebuilding for its hybrid platform.</p>
<p>Bård said that the company wants to work with brands in music, sport, travel and education to build other games, too. (Braun&#8217;s reach here might not extend to Taylor Swift, but he&#8217;s pulled in Justin Bieber for the promo video, and possibly more.)</p>
<p><iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/530292806" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Massive opportunities continue to emerge in the interactive entertainment space as distribution and business models evolve,&#8221; said Kirill Tasilov, a principal at Talis Capital, in a statement. &#8220;PortalOne is redefining mobile by unlocking new hybrid experiences at the intersection of games and video, and we are thrilled to be a part of their journey.”</p>
<h2>Blurring the lines</h2>
<p>In some ways, what PortalOne is doing is not completely new, since the lines between what is a game, what is interactive, and what is linear entertainment have been getting blurred for decades.</p>
<p>You could argue that even game shows, one of the earliest TV formats, was an early stage in hybrid interactivity, although more modern programs like the ones that Stig helped build out, with interactive voting from at-home audiences using phones, definitely pushed the concept in new ways.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic and the fact that so many in-person live events were cancelled, meanwhile, definitely paved the way for content players to think outside the box when it came to building new kinds of &#8220;live&#8221; shows. With Marshmello getting a huge response to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBsCzN-jfvA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortnite &#8220;show&#8221; in 2019</a>, the game saw <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/24/travis-scott-concert-fortnite-more-than-12m-players-watch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 million people</a> flock to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/apple-record-china-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Travis Scott concert</a> last year; and <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2020/12/explosive-lil-nas-x-concert-paves-way-bold-new-roblox-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roblox said in December</a> said its show with Lil Nas will pave the way for future events.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we see virtual concerts inside of TikTok, Roblox, and Fortnite, it&#8217;s great but PortalOne offers an evolution of interactive metaverse entertainment &#8212; true real-time, one-to-many interaction between gamers around the world, all in a mobile-native hybrid game format,&#8221; said Dhillon, a partner at Signia Venture Partners.</p>
<p>Yet if well-established platforms really pick up on this trend, that&#8217;s an endorsement of what PortalOne has built. But they could also feasibly build their own live game shows, too, and blow PortalOne out of the water just as it&#8217;s dipping its toes in.</p>
<p>This is also where its time spent building tech could prove either to be a boost or a bust. Gaming is a notoriously tough one to call when it comes to resonating and taking off with audiences, and so too will presumably the experiences that are built around those games.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next big social platform will likely be a convergence of media with gaming at its core &#8211; a truly new immersive interactive experience &#8211; and PortalOne is a major contender for becoming such a platform,&#8221; said Kevin Lin.</p>
<p>Indeed, if PortalOne finds an audience for what it&#8217;s making, it will have the tools to serve them more content efficiently and and cheaply. But if it doesn&#8217;t strike the right note, the question will be how and if that tech will otherwise be used.</p>
<p>For investors right now, it&#8217;s more about the opportunity.</p>
<p>“As PortalOne continues to grow, it is seamlessly integrating the gaming and entertainment worlds to create a single interactive experience and endless opportunities for content creation,&#8221; said Braun. &#8220;Creators and performers alike want new and innovative ways to bring their craft to life, and PortalOne is meeting that demand in a way that no other business has done. I’m excited to work with the entire team to realize their trailblazing vision. I have never seen anything like this before.”</p>
<p>Delian Asparouhov, a principal at Founders Fund &#8212; <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210429/p22#a210429p22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the news today</a> for another reason, his role in bringing a lot of attention to Miami as a new tech hot spot &#8212; also thinks that the building of infrastructure and tech combined with the media element will give the startup a lot of runway.</p>
<p>“We back companies that we believe have strong potential to become global category leaders,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;PortalOne creates a new category and simultaneously the platform that is clearly set to dominate that new category. The market is ripe, the opportunity is clear, and the potential is unlimited. PortalOne is poised to create a before and after in the industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a joint address to Congress last night, President Biden updated the nation on vaccination efforts and outlined his administration’s ambitious goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden’s first 100 days have been characterized by sweeping legislative packages that could lift millions of Americans out of poverty and slow the clock on the climate crisis, but during his first joint address to Congress, the president highlighted another smaller plan that&#8217;s no less ambitious: to “end cancer as we know it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can think of no more worthy investment,” Biden said Wednesday night. “I know of nothing that is more bipartisan…. It&#8217;s within our power to do it.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The comments weren’t out of the blue. Earlier this month, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/FY2022-Discretionary-Request.pdf">released a budget request</a> for $6.5 billion to launch a new government agency for breakthrough health research. The proposed health agency would be called ARPA-H and would live within the NIH. The initial focus would be on cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer’s, but the agency would also pursue other “transformational innovation&#8221; that could remake health research.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ARPA-H would be modeled after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/darpa/">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)</a>, which develops moonshot-like tech for defense applications. DARPA’s goals often sound more like science fiction than science, but the agency contributed to or created a number of now ubiquitous technologies, including a predecessor to GPS and most famously ARPANET, the computer network that grew into the modern internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike more conservative, incremental research teams, DARPA aggressively pursues major scientific advances in a way that shares more in common with Silicon Valley than it does with other governmental agencies. Biden believes that using the DARPA model on cutting edge health research would keep the U.S. from lagging behind in biotech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“China and other countries are closing in fast,” Biden said during the address. “We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips and clean energy.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google today <a href="https://twitter.com/googleafrica/status/1387745594270265348">announced the launch</a> of 40,000 new developer scholarships in Africa. Google will offer the scholarships &#8212; created in partnership with tech talent companies <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a> and <a href="https://andela.com/">Andela</a> &#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to developers spread across mobile and cloud development tracks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the statement released by the company, Google will give full scholarships (with certifications in Android and cloud development) to the top 1,000 students (beginner and intermediate developers) at the end of the training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">took place from</span> a <span style="font-weight: 400;">virtual event,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was also detailed in the company&#8217;s <a href="https://africa.googleblog.com/2021/04/our-continued-commitment-to-helping.html">blog post</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company hosted key stakeholders in Africa&#8217;s tech ecosystem and &#8220;reviewed opportunities unfolding throughout the internet economy, paying special attention to the support of developers and startups in the region.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the opportunities presented to developers, Google announced the continuation of its accelerator program for African startups. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going into this year, the</span><a href="https://startup.google.com/accelerator/africa/#accelerator-programs"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google for Startups Accelerator program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be hosting its sixth cohort</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three-month program </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to start on June 21; applications are open until May 14</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A virtual affair, this cohort will be a continuation of how the previous cohort panned out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first virtual class of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google for Startups Accelerator Africa</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was the first all-online iteration of Google’s accelerator program for Africa and saw 20 startups from seven countries undergo a 12-week virtual journey to redefine their offering while receiving mentoring and attending workshops,&#8221; said Onajite Emerhor, head of Google for Startups Accelerator Africa in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This year, with the 6th cohort, we want to continue to play our part by supporting developers and startups within the Africa tech ecosystem, ensuring they get all the access and support necessary to see them continue to grow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formerly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> known as Google Launchpad Accelerator, Google for Startups Accelerator Africa has worked with up to 50 startups across 17 African countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, it selected <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/06/18/20-startups-selected-for-class-5-of-google-for-startups-accelerator-africa/">20 startups into the program</a> (eight from Nigeria, six from Kenya, two from South Africa and one each from Ghana, Tunisia, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It expects to also select startups from additional countries, including Egypt, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda, for this sixth cohort</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The growth of entrepreneurship is crucial, especially in the African context. African developers and startups play a critical role in the transformation of the African economy, creating new opportunities and paving the way for the economic and social development on the continent that we want to see. We recognize Africa’s exceptional digital potential, and that is why Google </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is committed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to providing this critical support for African startups,” says Nitin Gajria, managing director of Google Sub-Saharan Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developer communities remain one of the most vital aspects of Google&#8217;s operations in the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It currently has more than 120 communities across 25 African countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Besides the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced scholarship program and other communities like Google Developer Groups and Developer Student Clubs, Google has provided an intersection between developers and other tech players by building a Google Developers Space in Nigeria.</span></p>

<p>This is the particular flavor of content, rich in key insights and tactical advice for founders, that goes down on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p>
<p>In an upcoming episode on Wednesday, May 19, we&#8217;ll sit down with Sequoia&#8217;s Shaun Maguire and Vise CEO and co-founder Samir Vasavada.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maguire focuses on enterprise, fintech and frontier technology for Sequoia. His portfolio companies include AMP Robotics, Knowde, Physna and Vise. He joined Sequoia in 2019, before which he was a partner at GV, where he led investments in Stripe, Opendoor, IonQ, SpinLaunch, Lambda School, Dandelion Energy, Clutter and Mode and sourced the firm&#8217;s investment in Segment.</p>
<p>Maguire has also been an entrepreneur in his own right, co-founding Expanse (a cybersecurity company), which was ultimately acquired by Palo Alto Networks for more than $800 million.</p>
<p>If that weren&#8217;t enough, Maguire also spent two years working at DARPA, and was deployed to Afghanistan, participating on a team that earned a Joint Meritorious Unit Award from the U.S. Secretary of Defense.</p>

<p>Samir Vasavada co-founded Vise in 2016.

<p>Vise has raised upwards of $60 million.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to Maguire and Vasavada about what brought them together, key tips for fundraising and how to be successful in the fintech space, and ask about the next great opportunity in fintech.</p>
<p>On the second half of the episode, Maguire and Vasavada will put on their feedback hats and listen to live elevator pitches from the audience as part of the ECL Pitch-off. Folks attending the event will be able to raise their hand and pitch their startup to the VC/founder duo, and then answer their questions and get their feedback.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In addition to Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">Clubhouse competitor built within Messenger Rooms</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/facebook-tests-hotline-a-qa-product-thats-a-mashup-of-clubhouse-and-instagram-live/">experiments with a Clubhouse-like Q&amp;A platform</a> on the web, the company is now leveraging yet another of its largest products to take on the Clubhouse threat: Instagram Live. Today, Instagram announced it&#8217;s adding new features that will allow users to mute their microphones and even turn their video off while using Instagram Live.</p>
<p>Instagram explains these new features will give hosts more flexibility during their livestream experiences, as they can decrease the pressure to look or sound a certain way while broadcasting live. While that may be true, the reality is that Facebook is simply taking another page from Clubhouse&#8217;s playbook by enabling a &#8220;video off&#8221; experience that encourages more serendipitous conversations.</p>
<p>When people don&#8217;t have to worry about how they look, they&#8217;ll often be more amenable to jumping into a voice chat. In addition, being audio-only allows creators to engage with their community while multitasking &#8212; perhaps they&#8217;re doing chores or moving around, and can&#8217;t sit and stare right at the camera. To date, this has been one of the advantages about using Clubhouse versus live video chat. You could participate in Clubhouse&#8217;s voice chat rooms without always having to give the conversation your full attention or worrying about background noise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For the time being, hosts will not be able to turn on or off the video or mute others in the livestream, but Instagram tells us it&#8217;s working on offering more of these types of capabilities to the broadcaster, and expects to roll them out soon.</p>
<p>Instagram notes it tested the new features publicly earlier this week during <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/COLhAulnD_6/">an Instagram Live</a> between Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first feature Instagram has added in recent weeks to lure the creator community to its platform instead of Clubhouse or other competitors. In March, Instagram rolled out the option for creators to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/instagram-launches-live-rooms-for-live-broadcasts-with-up-to-four-creators/">host Live Rooms that allow up to four people to broadcast</a> at the same time. The Rooms were meant to appeal to creators who wanted to host live talk shows, expanded Q&amp;As and more &#8212; all experiences that are often found on Clubhouse. It also added the ability for fans to buy badges to support the hosts, to cater to the needs of professional creators looking to monetize their reach.</p>
<p>Although Instagram parent company Facebook already has a more direct Clubhouse clone in development with Live Audio Rooms on Facebook and Messenger, the company said it doesn&#8217;t expect it <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/bringing-social-audio-experiences-to-facebook/">to launch into testing until this summer.</a> And it will first be available to Groups and public figures, not the broader public.</p>
<p>Instagram Live&#8217;s new features, meanwhile, are rolling out to Instagram&#8217;s global audience on both iOS and Android starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I don&#8217;t think Jim Belushi was high while we talked on Zoom this week. Instead of a joint, he was puffing on a cigar, but he was still happy and smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have my brother&#8217;s face on it. I have the Blues Brothers brand. It&#8217;s got to be good shit, man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Belushi was telling me about his weed, specifically about the small 0.7 gram pre-rolls he sells — the perfect size for the post-Covid era, when passing a joint to a friend is likely discouraged. Belushi started his farm with 48 cannabis plants in 2015. Now, six years and one pandemic later, there are 200 plants in each of his four high-tech greenhouses along the Rogue River in southern Oregon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always chasing magic,&#8221; Belushi said.</p>
<p>We were talking about his new greenhouses supplied in part by <a href="https://growgeneration.com">GrowGeneration</a>, but Belushi cannot stop gushing about the benefits of cannabis. More than just a celebrity with a weed brand, Belushi is a fully-committed cannabis advocate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s magic when I do the Blues Brothers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I chase magic on a film set when I&#8217;m acting, and chase magic when I&#8217;m singing. I mean, I&#8217;m always chasing magic, and I&#8217;m going to do this cannabis business because there&#8217;s magic here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belushi is among a recent group of celebrities diving deep into the world of cannabis. And he&#8217;s not shy about it. Look at his social media footprint. Belushi&#8217;s Twitter name is &#8216;<a href="https://twitter.com/JimBelushi">Cannabis Farmer: Jim Belushi</a>&#8216;. His <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@belushisfarm">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jim_belushi/?hl=en">Instagram</a> feeds are full of clips from his farm. He even has a TV series on Discovery about his farm: &#8220;Growing Belushi.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cannabis is Belushi&#8217;s life right now. He even recently turned down a movie role because filming would take place in the fall, during harvest time. His agent didn&#8217;t approve of passing on the opportunity, and told Belushi he represents actors, not farmers. But according to Jim, cannabis farming is more important than acting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a cross between Elmer Fudd and Bill Murray,&#8221; Belushi confesses. Like Murray in <em>Caddyshack</em>, Belushi is just good enough to be dangerous. According to Belushi, he&#8217;s been on the farm more than 200 days during the last year. In his eyes, this is what sets his apart from other celebrity cannabis operations.</p>
<p>Growing cannabis is more than a branding play for Belushi. It&#8217;s clear he&#8217;s not just trading his credibility and body of work for a hefty check; he&#8217;s on the farm, working the land, and tending to the bud he&#8217;s dealing.</p>
<p>&#8220;My hand is in the soil,&#8221; he said, explaining he works the land, ensuring the pH is correct, and that the soil is at the right temperature. He&#8217;s curing, smelling, testing, and tasting his crop.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, my name is on it, my brother&#8217;s name is on it, and I&#8217;m not just throwing it out there,&#8221; Belushi said. &#8220;I&#8217;m really farming, and I&#8217;m loving this profession.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145746" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145746" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2145746" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2145746" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Belushi&#8217;s Farm</p></div></p>
<h2><strong>Helping Mother Nature</strong></h2>
<p>Like many cultivators, Belushi turned to technology to combat pests and increase yields. A team from GrowGeneration outfitted his farm with the goods to mitigate pests and improve the quality. He says what they were selling for $1,000 a pound a year ago is now going for $2,200 a pound, and points to the improved growing facility as a significant factor.</p>
<p>Jeremy Corrao, VP of Commercial Operations at GrowGeneration, says the cannabis industry benefits from a range of new technologies that enable operators to see a faster return on their investments. He points to new lighting technology as an example.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing the most movement in people moving from energy-inefficient solutions into energy-efficient solutions,&#8221; Corrao said, explaining that the industry still has doubters who are hesitant of new technology. Yet, he says it&#8217;s lowering the cost of goods and improving ROI.</p>
<p>Corrao explains that functions and practices found throughout the agriculture industry are finally making their way to cannabis cultivators such as Belushi.</p>
<p>Yet even with new greenhouses complete with automated systems, some growers like Jim Belushi still rely on nature for help.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Belushi&#8217;s Farm] is in Southern Oregon with 192 days of sun,&#8221; Belushi said, stressing his love for the area. Moreover, his new greenhouses rely on the Oregon sun and still offer localized climate control, and pest management, which means he can have four growth cycles per year. This hybrid approach forgoes a closed climate system in favor of something that works within Belushi&#8217;s world.</p>

<p>As legalization draws closer, cultivators are constantly look for an edge amid more competition &#8212; better soil, quicker harvest cycles, new strains &#8212; and Belushi has his name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has the Belushi name always been associated with pot?&#8221; I ask Jim. I&#8217;m thinking back to the days of his departed brother, John Belushi, the always-on, always-authentic star of the 1970&#8217;s and &#8217;80s. After all, substances were imbibed, smoked, and regularly snorted in those days, and John Belushi was a manic presence in much of 1980s comedy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not pot, but fun&#8221;, he says after some thought. Jim gives credit to his brother John for starting the Belushi brand in 1975. To him, the Belushi brand represents &#8220;trying to make people feel good with a sense of humor or entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Look at the brands from Belushi&#8217;s Farm: Blues Brothers, Belushi&#8217;s Secret Stash, and Captain Jack, named after the O.G. weed dealer of the early days of Saturday Night Live. Each of these brands offers strains true to Jim Belushi&#8217;s perspective on his name, too. There&#8217;s hardly anything offered with THC levels that would be considered gas (aka, stuff that gets you really high), but each offers respectable characteristics. That&#8217;s by design.</p>
<p>&#8220;My stuff has more to do with great blends of terpenes and THC,&#8221; Belushi said. &#8220;[This is] to create more of a medicinal effect that sends someone on a pathway to healing.&#8221; He added, laughingly, he has a couple of strains hasn&#8217;t smoked. He&#8217;s scared of them. Likewise, he looks at some of the strains offered by other celebrities as ready to rip and roar thanks to sky-high levels of THC. He hasn&#8217;t tried those either.</p>
<p>I ask why he thinks it&#8217;s exciting and newsworthy when celebrities launch a cannabis brand. Belushi is hardly the only one doing it. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg j<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/cannabis-banking-act-passes-u-s-house-with-bipartisan-support/">ust launched Houseplant in the U.S.</a>, a cannabis brand offering dried flower and house goods. There&#8217;s Jay-Z with his upscale cannabis brand, Monogram. Even Martha Stewart is hawking cannabis, albeit in CBD gummy form.</p>
<p>Belushi is hesitant to compare his product to his celebrity competitors (probably related to his self-identification as a cultivator), but points to Snoop and Willy&#8217;s original celebrity pot brands as paving the way for him and others.</p>
<h2><strong>The failed war on drugs</strong></h2>
<p>New regulations are quickly changing the cannabis industry. As more states decriminalize and regulate cannabis, different industry segments are looking to the federal government to loosen its hold on the cannabis business.</p>
<p>For Belushi, access to traditional banking services would immediately impact him and the industry as a whole. And it could be coming soon: Two weeks ago, the U.S. House of Representatives <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/cannabis-banking-act-passes-u-s-house-with-bipartisan-support/">passed a banking bill with broad bipartisan support</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very exciting time in the cannabis world,&#8221; Belushi said. &#8220;People have seen changes in others [who partake in cannabis]. Tumors are shrinking, seizures are stopping, people are sleeping, and people are getting better. It&#8217;s interesting because, no matter if you&#8217;re conservative or liberal or old or young, everybody knows someone that has suffered deeply.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cannabis is not a gateway to drugs,&#8221; Belushi said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pathway to healing.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet, there are countless individuals in prison because of this so-called pathway to healing. Jim Belushi is working on that, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get them out,&#8221; Jim shouted when I talked about the Last Prisoner Project&#8217;s current goals. He&#8217;s referring to those incarcerated for crimes involving cannabis. To Belushi, who helps the cannabis activist group, this is a serious effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time to shift some energy to real justice,&#8221; Belushi said with deep passion. &#8220;Look at the Last Prisoner Project. It&#8217;s really a symbol that the war on drugs is over. It&#8217;s done. It&#8217;s ruined. The war on drugs ruined us. It ruined black and brown communities, which were especially hard hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get me started,&#8221; Belushi warned, as he laughed and calmed down.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.lastprisonerproject.org">Last Prisoner Project</a> was founded in 2019 by Steve DeAngelo and seeks cannabis criminal justice reform. The organization is made up of activists, attorneys, advocates, and others, including Belushi, who is an advisor. It&#8217;s clear he has a deep respect for the Last Prisoner Project&#8217;s founder and leader, Steve DeAngelo. &#8220;There&#8217;s no better hustler in the world than Steve DeAngelo,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Man, he&#8217;s just relentless, and it&#8217;s beautiful to watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belushi says the project is riding a wave right now, and they&#8217;re finding more states&#8217; Attorneys General are answering their calls. But there are still needs, he says. The project can always use capital, as a lot of the work is done pro bono. And there&#8217;s a constant need for people to write letters and sign petitions &#8212; all of which are readily available on the project&#8217;s website <a href="https://www.lastprisonerproject.org/take-action">here</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it would be great if people in the [cannabis] industry hire those that get out,&#8221; Belushi said, calling on the industry to lean in and help &#8220;these men and women who have been incarcerated for so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not just suggesting it as a course of action for others; he&#8217;s actively helping raise capital, too. The Blues Brothers is hosting a fundraiser at M.J. Unpacked this coming October in Las Vegas. Belushi, actor, comedian, weed farmer, and a member of the Blues Brothers beamed as he spoke about performing for the Last Prisoner Project.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re gonna have a big party there,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and we&#8217;re going to raise lots of funds, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because everybody needs someone to love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australian security software house Click Studios has told customers not to post emails sent by the company about its data breach, which allowed malicious hackers to push a malicious update to its flagship enterprise password manager Passwordstate to steal customer passwords.</p>
<p>Last week, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/passwordstate-click-studios-password-manager-breach/">told customers</a> to &#8220;commence resetting all passwords&#8221; stored in its flagship password manager after the hackers pushed the malicious update to customers over a 28-hour window between April 20-22. The malicious update was designed to contact the attacker’s servers to retrieve malware designed to steal and send the password manager’s contents back to the attackers.</p>
<p>In an email to customers, Click Studios did not say how the attackers compromised the password manager&#8217;s update feature, but included a link to a security fix.</p>
<p>But news of the breach only became public after Danish cybersecurity firm CSIS Group published a <a href="https://www.csis.dk/newsroom-blog-overview/2021/moserpass-supply-chain/">blog post</a> with details of the attack hours after Click Studios emailed its customers.</p>
<p>Click Studios claims Passwordstate is used by “more than 29,000 customers,” including in the Fortune 500, government, banking, defense and aerospace, and most major industries.</p>
<p>In an update on its website, Click Studios said in <a href="https://clickstudios.com.au/advisories/default.aspx">a Wednesday advisory</a> that customers are &#8220;requested not to post Click Studios correspondence on Social Media.&#8221; The email adds: &#8220;It is expected that the bad actor is actively monitoring Social Media, looking for information they can use to their advantage, for related attacks.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6409adV8wO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/how-to-respond-to-a-data-breach/">How to respond to a data breach</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How to respond to a data breach&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/how-to-respond-to-a-data-breach/embed/#?secret=6409adV8wO" data-secret="6409adV8wO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;It is expected the bad actor is actively monitoring social media for information on the compromise and exploit. It is important customers do not post information on Social Media that can be used by the bad actor. This has happened with phishing emails being sent that replicate Click Studios email content,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Besides a <a href="https://clickstudios.com.au/advisories/default.aspx">handful of advisories</a> published by the company since the breach was discovered, the company has refused to comment or respond to questions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also not clear if the company has disclosed the breach to U.S. and EU authorities where the company has customers, but where data breach notification rules obligate companies to disclose incidents. Companies can be fined up to 4% of their annual global revenue for falling foul of Europe&#8217;s GDPR rules.</p>
<p>Click Studios chief executive Mark Sandford has not responded to repeated requests (from TechCrunch) for comment. Instead, TechCrunch received the same canned autoresponse from the company&#8217;s support email saying that the company&#8217;s staff are &#8220;focused only on assisting customers technically.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch emailed Sandford again on Thursday for comment on the latest advisory, but did not hear back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ibm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBM</a> today made another acquisition to deepen its reach into providing enterprises with AI-based services to manage their networks and workloads. It announced that it is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-to-acquire-turbonomic-building-industrys-most-comprehensive-aiops-capabilities-for-hybrid-cloud-301280441.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring Turbonomic</a>, a company that provides tools to manage application performance (specifically resource management), along with Kubernetes and network performance &#8212; part of its bigger strategy to bring more AI into IT ops, or as it calls it, AIOps.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but according to data in PitchBook, Turbonomic was valued at nearly $1 billion &#8212; <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/53000-02/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$963 million, to be exact</a> &#8212; in its last funding round in <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170123005625/en/GE-CIO-Gary-Reiner-Joins-Turbonomic-Board" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September 2019</a>. A report in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turbonomics-m-a-ibm-exclusive-idUSKBN2CG1VB">Reuters</a> rumoring the deal a little earlier today valued it at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. A source tells us the figure is accurate.</p>
<p>The Boston-based company&#8217;s investors included General Atlantic, Cisco, Bain, Highland Capital Partners and Red Hat. The last of these, of course, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/ibm-closes-red-hat-acquisition-for-34-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now a part of IBM</a> (so it was theoretically also an investor), and together Red Hat and IBM have been developing a range of cloud-based tools addressing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/ibm-and-red-hat-expand-their-telco-edge-and-ai-enterprise-offerings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telco, edge and enterprise use cases</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This latest deal will help extend that further, and it has more generally been an area that IBM has been aggressive in recently. Last November </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/ibm-is-acquiring-apm-startup-instana-as-it-continues-to-expand-hybrid-cloud-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBM acquired another company called Instana</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to bring application performance management into its stable, and it pointed out today that the Turbonomic deal will complement that and the two technologies&#8217; tools will be integrated together, IBM said.</span></p>

<p>Turbonomic&#8217;s tools are particularly useful in hybrid cloud architectures, which involve not just on-premise and cloud workloads, but workloads that typically are extended across multiple cloud environments. While this may be the architecture people apply for more resilience, reasons of cost, location or other practicalities, the fact of the matter is that it can be a challenge to manage. Turbonomic&#8217;s tools automate management, analyse performance and suggest changes for network operations engineers to make to meet usage demands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Businesses are looking for AI-driven software to help them manage the scale and complexity challenges of running applications cross-cloud,&#8221; said Ben Nye, CEO, Turbonomic, in a statement. &#8220;Turbonomic not only prescribes actions, but allows customers to take them. The combination of IBM and Turbonomic will continuously assure target application response times even during peak demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bigger picture for IBM is that it&#8217;s another sign of how the company is continuing to move away from its legacy business based around servers, movinh deeper into services, and specifically services on the infrastructure of the future, cloud-based networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;IBM continues to reshape its future as a hybrid cloud and AI company,&#8221; said Rob Thomas, SVP, IBM Cloud and Data Platform, in a statement. &#8220;The Turbonomic acquisition is yet another example of our commitment to making the most impactful investments to advance this strategy and ensure customers find the most innovative ways to fuel their digital transformations.&#8221;</p>

<p>A large part of the AI promise in the world of network operations and IT ops is how it will afford companies to rely more on automation, another area where IBM has been very active. (In a very different application of this technology &#8212; in business services &#8212; this month, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/ibm-acquires-italys-myinvenio-to-integrate-process-mining-directly-into-its-suite-of-automation-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired MyInvenio</a> in Italy to bring process mining technology in house.)</p>
<p>The promise of automation, meanwhile, is lower operation costs, a critical issue for managing network performance and availability in hybrid cloud deployments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that AI-powered automation has become inevitable, helping to make all information-centric jobs more productive,&#8221; said Dinesh Nirmal, general manager, IBM Automation, in a statement. &#8220;That&#8217;s why IBM continues to invest in providing our customers with a one-stop shop of AI-powered automation capabilities that spans business processes and IT. The addition of Turbonomic now takes our portfolio another major step forward by ensuring customers will have full visibility into what is going on throughout their hybrid cloud infrastructure, and across their entire enterprise.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even as signs of life after the pandemic have begun to emerge here in the U.S., increases in video game spending continue. There’s no doubt that much of last year’s big numbers were driven by stay-at-home requirements in much of the country and the world. All said, U.S. spending on the industry increased 27% for 2020.</p>
<p>There remains a broader question, however, around whether this momentum can maintain, as people start to, you know, leave the house more. For now, at least, things are continuing to look rosy for the industry. NPD noted this morning that U.S. spending on the category jumped 30% y-o-y for Q1 2021, to $14.92 billion.</p>
<p>When we break the number down a bit, however, it becomes clear that the driver goes beyond mere pandemic entertainment. Content was up 25% for the quarter, accessories jumped 42% and hardware went up 82%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The motivator behind that last figure should be immediately obvious to anyone who follows the industry with any amount of interest. Where Nintendo&#8217;s Switch dominated the conversation for most of 2020, Sony and Microsoft both launched their next-gen consoles late last year.</p>
<p>“While we are still seeing elevated rates of both engagement and spending resulting from changes in consumer behavior driven by the pandemic, we are also seeing cyclical gains from the November launches of both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles,” analyst Mat Piscatella said in a release The growth driven by these new platforms, combined with gains experienced in mobile, PC and VR content spending, as well as the continued strength of Nintendo Switch, have pushed the market to new highs.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The first three months of the year were the most valuable period for fintech investing, ever. Where did the fintech venture capital market push the most money in Q1, and why? Let's dig in.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While waiting for full first-quarter venture capital results for fintech startups to drop, we knew that they were going to be outsized. The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/there-have-never-been-more-100m-fintech-rounds-than-right-now/">previously explored</a> the pace at which huge venture rounds were invested into the startup niche, noting that by mid-March the fintech market had already recorded a record number of $100 million rounds.</p>
<p>But the largest venture capital rounds are only part of the fintech investing picture, so we were looking forward to getting a deeper look into what happened in the critical startup sector more generally. We’ve now got the data, so today we’re digging in with both hands.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/fintech-trends-q1-2021/">CB Insights compilation of Q1 2021 fintech venture capital data</a> from around the world, the first three months of the year were the most valuable period for fintech investing, ever. Somewhat shockingly, the first quarter beat the infamous second quarter of 2018, when Ant Group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/07/ant-financial-raises-14-billion/">raised a $14 billion round</a>, so skewing the category’s longitudinal data that some analyst groups simply discount it for analytical purposes.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t necessary this time: The 614 tracked fintech deals in Q1 were worth a total of $22.8 billion, per the report, enough to set an all-time high, Ant Group be damned. Per CB Insights, the quarter’s fintech VC deal volume rose a modest 15% compared to the year-ago quarter, while VC dollar volume in the sector shot 98% higher over the same interval.</p>

We&#8217;re also going to chat subsectors in the fintech world, parsing where there’s the most venture activity to track, and, critically, where VCs are pushing &#8212; or pulling back &#8212; their attention and capital.</p>
<p>So, where did the fintech venture capital market push the most money in the first quarter, and why? We’ll be chatting data as we go, but The Exchange also enlisted VCs from three continents who have made fintech investments to help provide context: We’ll hear from <a href="https://twitter.com/jwedler?lang=en">Jesse Wedler</a>, a partner at <a href="https://www.capitalg.com/">CapitalG</a> based in North America; <a href="https://twitter.com/kola_aina?">Kola Aina,</a> a general partner at <a href="http://www.venturesplatform.com/">Ventures Platform</a> based in Africa; and<a href="https://twitter.com/shiyankoh"> Shiyan Koh</a>, a general partner at <a href="https://www.hustlefund.vc/">Hustle Fund</a> based in Asia.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a few key fintech numbers, and then rip into venture results by geography and focus.</p>
<h2>Huge checks, myriad exits</h2>
<p>While we’re looking beyond the largest checks today to get a more holistic perspective on the state of the fintech venture capital world, we cannot discount them. So, briefly, what matters from the mega-round space, or the funding category of rounds worth nine figures and more? Some 57 were raised by fintech startups around the world in the first quarter, or about 4.5 per week. That number was 30 in Q4 2020, and just 21 in Q1 2020.</p>
<p>The first quarter’s 57 mega-deals were worth a huge 69% of total venture capital in the fintech space during the quarter. Don’t be shocked by that figure; a single mega-round can add up to the value of 50 seed deals pretty easily.</p>
<p>The huge results should also not be a complete surprise, CapitalG’s Wedler told TechCrunch in an email, as “the reality is that fintech has been a hot category for years.” What could be driving the recent acceleration in capital disbursement into financial technology startups? Wedler mused it&#8217;s a combination of “the ubiquity of smartphones and the modern internet, the development of modern cloud technology, and advancements in APIs and modular services.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

With an update, Google Pay will now include new options for grocery savings, paying for public transit and categorizing their spending.</p>
<p>Through partnerships with Safeway and Target, Google Pay users will now be able to browse their store&#8217;s weekly circulars that showcase the latest deals. Safeway is bringing more than 500 stores to the Google Pay platform, and Target stores nationwide will offer a similar feature. Google Pay users will be able to favorite the recommended deals for later access. And soon, Google Pay will notify you of the weekly deals when you&#8217;re near a participating store, if location is enabled.</p>

<p>Another update expands Google Pay&#8217;s transit features, which already today support buying and using transit tickets across more than 80 cities in the U.S. New additions arriving soon now include the major markets of Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area. This follows Apple Pay&#8217;s recently added and much welcomed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/you-can-now-pay-for-bart-using-an-iphone-or-apple-watch/">support for the Bay Area&#8217;s Clipper card</a>. The company is also integrating with <a href="https://tokentransit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://tokentransit.com/&quot;}">Token Transit</a> to expand transit support to smaller towns across the U.S.</p>
<p>Soon, the Google Pay app will also allow Android users to access transit tickets from the app&#8217;s home screen through a &#8220;Ride Transit&#8221; shortcut. They can then purchase, add or top up the balance on transit cards. Once purchased, you&#8217;ll be able to hold up your transit card to a reader &#8212; or show a visual ticket in case there&#8217;s no reader.</p>

<p>The final feature is designed for those using Google Pay for managing their finances. With last year&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/google-pay-gets-a-major-redesign/">revamp</a>, Google partnered with 11 banks to launch a new kind of bank account it called Plex. A competitor to the growing number of mobile-only digital banks, Google&#8217;s app serves as the front-end to the accounts which are actually hosted by the partner banks, like Citi and Stanford Federal Credit Union.</p>

<p>As a part of that experience, Google Pay users will now gain better access into their spending behavior, balances, bills and more via an &#8220;Insights&#8221; tab. Here, you&#8217;ll be able to see what your balance is, what bills are coming due, get alerts about larger transactions, and track spending by either category or business. As Google is now automatically categorizing transactions, that means you&#8217;ll be able to search for general terms (like &#8220;food&#8221;) as well as by specific business names (like &#8220;Burger King&#8221;), Google explains.<img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2145716" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GoogleThese features are part of Google&#8217;s plan to use the payments app to access more data on users, who can then be targeted with offers from Google Pay partners.</p>
<p>When the redesigned app launched, users were<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/11/20/google-pay-app-opt-in-privacy/3772240001/"> asked to opt in to personalization features</a>, which could help the app show users better, more relevant deals. While Google says it&#8217;s not providing your data directly to these third-party brands and retailers, the app provides a conduit for those businesses to reach potential customers at a time when the tracking industry is in upheaval over <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-privacy-changes-are-poised-to-boost-its-ad-products-11619485863">Apple&#8217;s privacy changes</a>. Google&#8217;s ability to help brands reach consumers through Google Pay could prove to be a valuable service, if it is able to grow its user base, and encourage more to opt in to the personalization features.</p>
<p>To make that happen, you can expect Google Pay to roll out more useful or &#8220;must have&#8221; features in the weeks to come.</p>
