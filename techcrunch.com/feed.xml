										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following the customary weeks of leaks, Samsung just announced a couple of new additions to its laptop line. The Galaxy Book Pro and Galaxy Book Pro 360 joined the hardware giant’s wide range of devices toward the high end &#8212; offering what can reasonably be categorized as the company’s take on the MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>The Windows machines continue the company’s push to blur some of the productivity lines between its Galaxy PC and mobile offerings, including a number of cross-device software offerings and, naturally, the inclusion of the S-Pen, which ships in the box with the Pro 360. As the name implies, the 360’s lid hinges in either direction, so it can double as a writing surface.</p>
<p>The thin and light design is probably the headline feature for Samsung. The Pro and Pro 360 measure 11.2 and 11.9 millimeters, respectively. Both feature an option of a 13.3 and 15.6-inch Super AMOLEDs. With a 1920 x 1080 resolution. That’s all powered by either a Core i5 or i7 11th-gen Intel processor, 8 or 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage (512GB max on the Pro).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>There are also options for LTE and 5G versions (depending on market availability). That will almost certainly have a direct impact on the battery, which the company rates as “all-day.” Both models sport 65W fast charging by way of the USB-C port. The keyboard mechanisms have been upgraded over previous models and the track pad is now 23% larger.</p>
<p>The systems go up for preorder today and start shipping May 14. The 13 and 15-inch versions of the Pro start at $1,000 and $1,100, respectively and the 360 runs $1,200 and $1,300.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix today is officially launching a feature that will make it easier to find something to watch when you&#8217;re stuck browsing and unable to make a decision. The service is introducing a tool called &#8220;Play Something&#8221; to users worldwide &#8212; the final iteration that &#8220;shuffle&#8221; feature you may have already seen during Netflix&#8217;s tests over the past year. When selected, Netflix will play another show or movie it thinks you&#8217;ll like, based on your interests and prior viewing behavior.</p>
<p>In other words, it won&#8217;t play random content, but will instead bring up either a movie or show you&#8217;re already watching, a series or movie on your list, an unfinished series or movie you may want to revisit, or a brand new series or film that Netflix&#8217;s personalization algorithms suggest.</p>
<p>The feature has been in testing under various names and styles for some time. A year ago, the feature was called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/netflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen/">Shuffle Play</a>, for example. During its Q4 earnings, Netflix said the shuffle feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/netflixs-shuffle-play-feature-will-roll-out-to-all-users-worldwide-this-year/">would roll out</a> to its worldwide users sometime in the first half of 2021, describing it as a way for users to &#8220;instantly watch a title chosen just for them.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For today&#8217;s launch, not much has changed beyond the feature&#8217;s name and style.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144938" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144938" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2144938" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US_NETFLIX_TV_Comp_00003-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US_NETFLIX_TV_Comp_00003-1.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US_NETFLIX_TV_Comp_00003-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US_NETFLIX_TV_Comp_00003-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US_NETFLIX_TV_Comp_00003-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US_NETFLIX_TV_Comp_00003-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US_NETFLIX_TV_Comp_00003-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US_NETFLIX_TV_Comp_00003-1.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US_NETFLIX_TV_Comp_00003-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2144938" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>The new option can be found on Netflix&#8217;s TV app underneath your profile name, on the navigation menu to the left of your screen and on the tenth row on your Netflix homepage &#8212; a location that hopes to find users after they&#8217;ve been scrolling for some time without landing on anything they want to watch.</p>
<p>Netflix users with screen-readers can use Text-to-Speech (TTS) to use Play Something, the company notes.</p>
<p>While Netflix is always testing features that make it easier for users to jump from browsing to watching, this feature in particular comes at a time when Netflix is seeing slower subscriber growth &#8212; something <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/netflix-q1-2021/">it&#8217;s blaming on the lighter content slate</a> due to COVID. But the reality is that Netflix is no longer the only streamer in town. And some of the content it has shipped has been weak, as evident in the growing list of <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/netflix-cancelations-2021-canceled-shows-tv-series-1558429">cancellations</a>. It has also lost t<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/nielsen-says-the-office-was-the-most-popular-streaming-series-of-2020/">op titles like &#8220;The Office&#8221;</a> to rivals as rights&#8217; holders have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/the-office-leaving-netflix-why-are-you-the-way-that-you-are/">pulled their content</a> back to their own new services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144940" style="width: 456px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144940" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2144940" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US-Play-Something-Android-2.png?w=446" alt="" width="446" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US-Play-Something-Android-2.png 5829w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US-Play-Something-Android-2.png?resize=98,150 98w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US-Play-Something-Android-2.png?resize=197,300 197w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US-Play-Something-Android-2.png?resize=768,1171 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US-Play-Something-Android-2.png?resize=446,680 446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US-Play-Something-Android-2.png?resize=1008,1536 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US-Play-Something-Android-2.png?resize=1343,2048 1343w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/US-Play-Something-Android-2.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2144940" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>For those reasons, too, Netflix needs a way to addict its current user base to what&#8217;s available in its existing catalog before they churn out.</p>
<p>The new Play Something feature is available today on Netflix on TVs, and will soon begin testing on mobile devices, starting with Android.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/alex"> Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> dove into the world of audio. Sure, you&#8217;ve heard of Clubhouse, but there&#8217;s lots more going on than just a single app&#8217;s cultural rise. So from the biggest companies to niche startups, we compiled all the recent audio news into a single show for all our delectation.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook is building a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">number of audio products</a>, including a Clubhouse clone and a short-form audio service that we think could be neat.</li>
<li>Reddit is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">building a Clubhouse-like service</a>, and Alex is excited about it.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not just the established social networks that are trying out live audio. Peanut, a social networking app for women, added live audio &#8220;Pods&#8221; to its platform. It kicked off a conversation on what it takes to win this market, and what&#8217;s a smart versus silly bet.</li>
<li>While a drop in downloads doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean a drop in active users, it&#8217;s worth pointing out that Clubhouse&#8217;s monthly downloads dropped 72% in March. Where is that gosh darn Android app?</li>
<li>And Alex explained <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22402183/clubhouse-partnering-nfl-draft-week-programming">why the Clubhouse-NFL deal</a> matters for the company, as it could molt into something more akin to a platform over time.</li>
<li>Danny explained how Apple and Spotify are building paid podcast services &#8212; more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">here</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/spotify-launches-paid-podcasts-through-new-anchor-feature/">here</a>, respectively &#8212; and we have thoughts about which service is being more fair with the money. Natasha tied in how sentiment around the creator economy might be driving some of these individual-friendly business models.</li>
<li>Alex brought up TWiT&#8217;s <a href="https://twit.tv/subscribe">new business model</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All told there&#8217;s quite a lot of excitement around the spoken word. Which is good as Equity is a podcast? Right?</p>
<p><i>Equity drops every Monday at 7:00 a.m. PST, Wednesday, and Friday at 6:00 AM PST, so subscribe to us on </i><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1215439780"><i>Apple Podcasts</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1215439780/equity"><i>Overcast</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=rZDFHv2sQUul_g94iCRgpQ"><i>Spotify</i></a><i> and all the casts!</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the world takes its first steps back to relative normalcy, there remains a major question mark around how profoundly our day-to-day is going to be changed for good. Nowhere does that question loom larger than fitness. Connected home machines have undergone a seismic shift over the past year, but once gyms safely reopen, how much will that industry peter out?</p>
<p>The likeliest answer is that there will be some leveling off in the long run. However, investors still see a lot of growth potential in the category, extending beyond now-major players like Peloton, Mirror and Tonal. New York-based <a href="https://ergatta.com/">Ergatta</a> is the latest to receive some of that windfall, announcing a $30 million Series A this morning.</p>
<p>This latest round &#8212; led by Advanced Venture Partners with participation from Greycroft, Fifth Wall, Gaingels and Hans Tung (GGV) &#8212; brings the company’s total funding up to $35 million, including a $5 million seed round raised in July of last year. Ergatta says the funding will go toward developing new content, competition and social features for its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s primary hardware is a rowing machine. Built out of cherry wood in the U.S., the machine certainly offers a warmer aesthetic than a lot of home workout equipment. It’s a nice touch for people who don’t want a big, industrial-looking piece of equipment in their bedroom. Content-wise, the platform is built around a gamified exercise content.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York headquartered <a href="https://www.kaiahealth.com">Kaia Health</a>, which offers AI-assisted digital therapies via a mobile app for chronic pain related to musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders and for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), has raised a $75 million Series C.</p>
<p>The round was led by an unnamed leading growth equity fund with support from existing investors, including Optum Ventures, Eurazeo, 3VC, Balderton Capital, Heartcore Capital, Symphony Ventures (golfer Rory McIlroy&#8217;s investment vehicle), and A Round Capital.</p>
<p>The funding fast-follows a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/kaia-health-gets-26m-to-show-it-can-do-more-with-digital-therapeutics/">$26M Series B</a> closed last summer. The pandemic has accelerated the uptake of telemedicine, generally &#8212; and Kaia has, unsurprisingly, seen a particular surge of interest in its virtual treatments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After all, DIY home working set-ups are unlikely to have done much good for the average information worker&#8217;s back in the pandemic-struck year. Kaia&#8217;s real-time feedback generating motion coach is also able to offer treatment for neck, hip, knee, shoulder, hand/wrist, and foot/ankle pain.</p>
<p>A digital health solution may have been the only lockdown-friendly option for treating conditions considered &#8216;elective care&#8217; during COVID-19 &#8212; meaning suffers of chronic pain may have faced restrictions on accessing physical healthcare provision like in-person physiotherapy. Kaia says it grew its business book 600% in 2020.</p>
<p>Given the U.S. healthcare sales cycle is heavily focused on January onboarding of new medical benefits by employers &#8212; who are key customers for Kaia in the market, where it now has around 50 employer and health plan clients &#8212; it&#8217;s expecting another big onboarding bump next January. And while it hadn&#8217;t been looking to raise again so soon after the Series B, doing so was &#8220;a very easy process&#8221;, says co-founder and CEO Konstantin Mehl.</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually planned to start the raise in the end of this year and then the pandemic happened and of course we had a huge boost because the healthcare system was pretty much shut down for in person elected treatments and chronic diseases are considered to be elected treatments which I think is a bit of a mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing is that the big b2b partners they are really scared that they will have this big backlog of surgical interventions that are very expensive&#8230; Pre-pandemic I think 20% of employers in the US were even interested in offering a digital therapy and then that changed to 100% immediately. So that was a big boost,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;The other thing is that our market got really hot. We don&#8217;t really need the money right now but we met these investors and it was a very easy process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kaia says that globally its digital MSK platform is accessible to 60M patients &#8212; which it claims makes it by far the biggest player in the space in terms of covered lives. (Other startups in the space include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/hinge-healthy-d/">Hinge Health</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/tackling-the-190-billion-physical-therapy-market-sword-health-raises-8-million-from-khosla-ventures/">Sword Health</a> which are both also focused on MSK; and Physera, a virtual physical therapy provider that was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/19/omada-health-raises-57-million-acquires-physera-for-30-million.html">acquired by Omada last year</a>.)</p>
<p>The plan for Kaia&#8217;s (unexpectedly rapid) funding boost is &#8220;to be much more aggressive in building out our commercial team&#8221;, Mehl tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We are very proud of being a product focused company but it also gets a bit stupid at the point where you just need to bring the product in front of the relevant customer so we are investing a lot in that and also in computer vision because it&#8217;s still our USP.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kaia&#8217;s digital therapies rely on using computer vision to digitize proven treatments so they can be delivered outside traditional healthcare environments, with the app helping patients perform exercises correctly by themselves.</p>
<p>The user only needs a smartphone or tablet with a camera for the app to do real-time, posture-tracking and provide feedback. No wearables are required. Although Kaia is researching how 3D data from depth-sensing cameras which are now being embedded in higher end mobile devices may further feed the accuracy of its body tracking models.</p>
<p>&#8220;We basically can have the same correction functionality in your home that you have can have with a PT [personal trainer],&#8221; says Mehl. &#8220;We want to invest a lot more in computer vision and build out that team so we can also do that more aggressively now [with the Series C funding] which is cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kaia has started to use motion-tracking in another way in its patient-facing chronic pain app &#8212; as a way to track progress. So as well as asking patients to quantify their pain (which is a subjective measure) it can have an objective biomarker alongside patients&#8217; pain assessments by getting them to do regular tests that track their body movements.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started to use motion-tracking besides the correction-tracking functionality also as a biomarker. So we basically can measure your body functionality. Now we can, for example, see which body parts are less flexible and that&#8217;s how we can measure the disease progression, instead of asking you how is the pain level today,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;Pain is the number one cause for work disability and the reason is because your body functionality decreases so if we can measure that correctly then we can also escalate it to the right speciality doctor, for example.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kaia can also quantify the progress of COPD patients in a similar way &#8212; by tracking them performing a sit-down, stand-up test.</p>
<p>Care for COPD has had a particular imperative during the pandemic as people with the chronic inflammatory lung disease who catch COVID-19 have the highest mortality rate among COVID-19-infected patients, per Mehl.</p>
<p>At the same time, pulmonary rehabilitation centers have been shut down during the pandemic because of the risk of infection to patients. So, once again, Kaia&#8217;s app has provided an alternative for suffers of chronic conditions to continue their rehab at home.</p>
<p>In the US Kaia focuses on activation rate as a percentage of the employer population &#8212; and Mehl says this stands between 5%-10%, depending on how the app is communicated to potential users. &#8220;We also had a company that had 15% of their population active it one year but you always have these outliers,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the coming 12 months, he says he expects to be able to grow revenue 5x-10x as a number of bigger partnerships kick in.</p>
<p>In Germany, where Kaia plans to start prescribing its app (via doctors), he&#8217;s hopeful they&#8217;ll be able to get 10,000 prescriptions done over the same period, once it has approval to do so under a national reimbursement system.</p>
<h2>Plugging Kaia into wider healthcare provision</h2>
<p>Integrating into a wider care pathway by being able to loop in healthcare providers where appropriate has been a big recent focus for Kaia.</p>
<p>In February it kicked off a major integration of its patient-facing MSK therapy/pain-management app with a referral system that plugs into services offered by other healthcare providers &#8212; using an escalation algorithm and screening and triage system, which it calls Kaia Gateway &#8212; to identify patients at risk of needing more invasive or intense treatment than the digital therapies its app can provide. It&#8217;s working with a number of premium partners for this referral path (i.e. within an employer or health plan’s ecosystem).</p>
<p>Its partners can provide additional medical services to relevant patients, both general and specialty care solutions, including disease management programs, PT, telemedicine, care navigation, and expert medical opinion services. Partners also get access to detailed treatment history on referred patients from Kaia, including via APIs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides being just an app-based therapy we want to expand more down the treatment path,&#8221; explains Mehl. &#8220;And also work with external medical providers &#8212; doctors etc &#8212; and bring our users at the right point to the right doctor to prevent any deterioration in pain that we cannot treat in the app. I think that brings a lot of trust, also, to the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I think what&#8217;s happening now is that there&#8217;s so many digital therapies popping up everywhere. And one thing that is happening in the beginning when you&#8217;re small, like us three years ago, we just offered this app and said we don&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s happening before or after&#8230; Now we really want to integrate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have some cool partnerships coming up in the U.S. &#8212; partner with bigger medical providers that have thousands of medical providers on their payroll,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;And then integrate with them so we can optimize the full treatment path. Because then the patients can really feel safe and say hey they don&#8217;t keep me in the app-based therapy when they know I should actually see somebody else because it&#8217;s not the best care anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have this platform approach but then we saw now it really makes sense to go deeper in these two diseases,&#8221; Mehl adds. &#8220;We start with our chronic pain approach in the U.S. and say we really want to go down the treatment path. And because the main problem is if people then start to be frustrated in our app and say I need something else and then they get back to this, for example, pain killers, opioids, surgery, cycle, and then they&#8217;re back in the system where we actually wanted to help them getting out of it so that&#8217;s why we say it&#8217;s not really possible to not integrate with healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need to integrate them. If not you cannot always offer best care and then the patients realize at one point this app is not enough &#8212; but I also don&#8217;t get directed to a medical professional who could offer a new diagnosis or a different prescription. And then your trust is lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The other point is when you think about different levels of chronification, because we&#8217;re so scalable we can catch people much earlier in their chronification journey when the disease is still reversible. And even if our app is still the best treatment it helps to get an additional medical professional involvement to validate a diagnosis &#8212; or to just talk with a patient so that they really know that they&#8217;re safe here. So just reassuring, motivation and also diagnosis, to really say okay just to be sure we should make this diagnosis just to be sure you are getting best care. So I think that&#8217;s a huge product task and operational task for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kaia is starting by doing case referrals manually in-house &#8212; by setting up a medical case review team, staffed by doctors and therapies it employs &#8212; aided by a triage system that automatically flags patients for the team to review. But Mehl hopes this process will be increasingly assisted by AI.</p>
<p>&#8220;We assume yellow flags from what they told us in the entry test or from their exercise feedback or therapy feedback. Or from the interactions they have with their motivational coaches,&#8221; he explains of how the case review system works now. &#8220;Then [the case review team] has a look at them and decides if they should see an external medical provider partner and at what time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over time this should get more and more automated,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We hope that we can make this better and better with machine learning over time and show that we can optimize the treatment path much better than just having this manual oversight. And that&#8217;s a huge challenge. If you think about what you need to do to get there I think it will define our product roadmap for years&#8230; But that&#8217;s also where the most value is to increase the quality of care. If not you just have siloed solutions everywhere&#8230; and the patient suffers because the treatment path is torn apart and it doesn&#8217;t feel like one thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will always need this clinical oversight. But where we can use machine learning is to help these medical professionals to look at the right patients at the right time. Because they cannot look at everybody all the time so there needs to be some filtering. And I think that filtering &#8212; or that triage &#8212; that can be really done by machine learning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Would Kaia ever consider becoming a healthcare provider itself? Combining a telemedicine service with some digitally delivered treatments is something that Sweden&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/kry-launches-free-service-for-doctors-to-do-video-consultations-during-covid-19-crisis/">Kry</a>, for example, has done &#8212; launching online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatments in its home market back in 2018 while also offering a telehealth platform and running a full healthcare service in some markets.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Kry launches free service for doctors to do video consultations during COVID-19 crisis&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/kry-launches-free-service-for-doctors-to-do-video-consultations-during-covid-19-crisis/embed/#?secret=Ri9tansCpy" data-secret="Ri9tansCpy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mehl suggests not, arguing that telemedicine companies are by necessity generalists, since they are catering to &#8220;the top of the funnel&#8221;, handling and filtering patients with all sorts of complaints &#8212; which he says makes them less suited to focus deeply on catering to specific disease.</p>
<p>While, for Kaia, it&#8217;s deeply focused on building tech to treat a few specific diseases &#8212; and so, likewise, isn&#8217;t best suited to general medical service delivery. Partnering with medical service providers is therefore the obvious choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think about the patient journey and for the telemedicine companies&#8230; they might have some treatment paths integrated but they&#8217;re never as good as completely owning one chronic disease as we can be,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Most of chronic disease patients they just want to start a treatment because they talked with so many doctors. They want to find something that helps them and then at the right moment talk to the right medical professional. So that&#8217;s a difference in how telemedicine companies are doing it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other question is how much of the medical provider job of the treatment path do we want to internalize? And we really are a tech company. We&#8217;re not very keen on becoming a medical provider. And we see that there are so many amazing medical providers in the landscape here &#8212; in different countries &#8212; that during COVID-19 had to become more digital, so it&#8217;s easy to partner with them, and why would we want to learn how to run a hospital where there are all these people who did it for decades and are really good at it, and we are really good at tech.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really cool for the patient in the end. They know they get the best of both worlds and it&#8217;s optimized and ideally these offline medical providers get data from us so they can make better decisions &#8212; so they can also have a higher quality of decision-making because they have more data than just talking with a patient for two minutes. They can see our complete dashboard and how the patient progressed over time and everything &#8212; so the quality of decision-making gets higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. overtook Europe as Kaia&#8217;s biggest market in recent years so it&#8217;s inexorably been focusing a lot of energy on serving its growing number of U.S. customers. The size of the addressable market in the U.S. is also massive, with ~100M chronic pain patients in the country, or around a third of the population.</p>
<p>But Kaia continues to develop its proposition in a number of European markets, including Germany which was where the business started. Mehl says its team in Munich is looking at how to make a recent reimbursement law for app-based health treatments will work for it in practice. It hasn&#8217;t yet obtained the necessary reimbursement code for doctors there to start prescribing its tech to their patients but it&#8217;s taking steps to change that.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mehl concedes that learning how to make doctors want to prescribe its app is an &#8220;open challenge&#8221; in the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some startups started doing it but &#8212; at scale &#8212; I still think there have to be some learning to be made to really scale it up,&#8221; he says of the German app prescriptions, adding that it&#8217;s preparing to hand in its application in relation to its COPD app which it will be bringing to market in Europe with a pharma partner.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also closed a partnership with a pharma company for Germany, UK and France to distribute our app through the pulmonologists &#8212; which is pretty cool. So we&#8217;re launching that partnership now,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;That will be exciting to see where the prescriptions start.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mehl professes himself a fan of Germany&#8217;s approach to digital healthcare &#8212; saying that it makes it easy to obtain a general reimbursement code which then gives the app-maker a year to prove any cost savings and deliver the care they say they do &#8212; couching that as a compromise between the &#8220;really long&#8221; process of getting approval for a medicine and the data-driven needs of startups where founders need to be able to show traction to get investment to build and grow a business in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Healthcare&#8217;s already tough because you have to do clinical trials and it&#8217;s already a bit slower. So a longer approval process makes it even more difficult to launch something useful and I can see the UK, France, the Nordics bringing out some similar legislation to facilitate that,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect in other European countries &#8212; and in other countries in generally, like Canada, Australia and in Asia too &#8212; that they update their regulation to cover digital therapies. And then that will be good because we will know how to get apps prescribed and we know the other way, like in the U.S., [i.e. without needing to go through a doctor first]&#8230; And so with our app being so scalable we could easily launch in these countries compared to other companies in the market that are more reliant on one specific healthcare system or on hardware or anything that limits the scalability.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to building a successful startup, biotech and hardware happen to be two of the most difficult verticals in the tech industry. But Oura is doing it anyway.</p>
<p>The health and fitness tracking ring has been used in a number of studies around COVID-19 and been worn by NBA and WNBA players to help prevent outbreaks in the league. Oura has raised nearly $50 million from investors including Lifeline Ventures, Bold Capital Partners and Forerunner.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re thrilled to have Forerunner&#8217;s Eurie Kim and Oura CEO Harpreet Rai join us on a forthcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-forerunner-and-oura">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kim is herself a former entrepreneur and joined Forerunner in 2012. She sits on the boards of companies like The Farmer’s Dog, Curology, Attabotics, Oura Ring, Eclipse, Juni, among others, and found herself on the Midas Brink List in 2020.</p>
<p>Rai, for his part, is CEO at Oura, where he leads a team of over 150 employees. Before Oura, Rai was a portfolio manager at Eminence Capital for nine years.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-forerunner-and-oura">Extra Crunch Live</a>, the duo will talk about how Oura went about raising its $28 million Series B round and why Kim took a bet on the startup. We&#8217;ll also ask about tactical advice for founders looking to fundraise and grow their businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/en/">OpenClassrooms</a> has raised an $80 million Series C funding round led by Lumos Capital Group. The company operates an online education platform in French and English. Users can choose among 54 training programs and get a diploma at the end of the program — some of those program lead to French-state-recognized bachelor and master diplomas.</p>
<p>GSV, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) and Salesforce Ventures also participated in today’s funding round. Existing investors General Atlantic and Bpifrance invested once again in the company.</p>
<p>OpenClassrooms covers many different fields, from web development to digital marketing, product management, HR and sales. Those paths are quite demanding as it can take 6 to 12 months of full-time work to complete a training program. OpenClassrooms partners with mentors so that they can help you remain motivated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the end of the program, the startup guarantees that you’ll find a job. If you have a hard time finding a job, the company works with career coaches to make sure that you find a job that fits you. In 2020, 4,300 students found a job or received a promotion after participating in an OpenClassrooms program.</p>
<p>In France, people qualify for public subsidies in order to fund professional education programs. And students can pay for OpenClassrooms courses using those public subsidies.</p>
<p>The company says that the pandemic has had a positive impact on online education. Many people are looking for reskilling and upskilling opportunities and end up on OpenClassrooms. In addition to programs for individuals, the startup also offers courses to 1,400 companies.</p>
<p>Some companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/02/openclassrooms-and-capgemini-team-up-and-launch-an-online-apprenticeship-program/">such as Capgemini</a>, have teamed up with OpenClassrooms to offer apprenticeship programs. Students get to learn new skills and work for Capgemini at the same time. The apprenticeship program could be particularly attractive for companies with a high turnover that can’t find talent to fill open positions. There are currently 1,500 students following an apprenticeship program.</p>
<p>All of this has been working well as revenue during the first quarter of 2021 is 140% higher than Q1 2020 revenue. Recently, OpenClassrooms applied for the B-Corp certification. The company still offers <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses">free classes</a> if you’re looking for your next weekend project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was, I admit, slightly strange not feeling the extreme anxiety over the holidays at having to return to Las Vegas this past year. But nature is healing. Vaccinations have begun rolling out in much of the world, and CES is ready to return.</p>
<p>The massive consumer electronic show’s governing board, the CTA, announced this morning that the event will return to the City of Second Chances January 5-8 (with media days eating into that post New Year’s glow starting on the 3rd). Per a press release, roughly 1,000 companies have committed to returning.</p>
<p>The list thus far includes, Amazon, AMD, AT&amp;T, Daimler AG, Dell, Google, Hyundai, IBM, Intel, Lenovo, LG Electronics, Panasonic, Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics and Sony. Given how the past year has gone, however, it’s important to note that everything is always subject to change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our customers are enthusiastic about returning to a live event in Las Vegas,” CTA EVP Karen Chupka said in a release tied to the news. “Global brands and startups have shared that plans are already well underway and are committed to sharing the magic of an in-person CES with even more people from around the world.”</p>
<p>Of course, things will very much feel up in the air until our respective planes have landed at the Las Vegas Airport (and I may or may not still be wearing a mask). And the CTA is quick to note that there will continue to be a digital element. That will almost certainly continue to be an important aspect of these shows moving forward. Will it seemed unlikely that the pandemic would kill trade shows altogether (particularly hardware trade shows), like many things in life, there are some aspects that will simply never be the same.</p>
<p>In 2020, the CTA escaped the wrath of Covid-19 just under the wire, roughly two months before the virus really began doing damage stateside. CES&#8217;s first (and, for the foreseeable future, only) all-virtual event was greeted with&#8230;mixed results. Anecdotally, the experience left a lot to be desire &#8212; perhaps understandable, given sheer size and breadth of a show like this. Now that the infrastructure is in place, however, it would be silly to abandon it altogether &#8212; especially after the past year left many questioning their attendance of these sorts of events in general.</p>
<p>As for the 2021 shows &#8212; a number, including MWC and IFA in Europe &#8212; are still planning to go forward, with enhanced safety precautions. The size and scope of these shows, however, remain in flux, as a number of companies have announced their intention to only attend the show virtually.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We may still be a long way off from Level 5, fully self-driving cars on the open road, but companies building autonomous vehicles and shuttles for specific uses within closed-campus deployments say they are on their way to commercial operations and are raising money to get there. In the latest development, a startup out of Toulouse, France, called <a href="https://easymile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasyMile</a> &#8212; which builds shuttles for transporting both people and goods &#8212; has closed a Series B of €55 million ($66 million).</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Searchlight Capital Partners &#8212; the investor that just earlier this week appointed <a href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/searchlight-capital-partners-announces-appointment-133700322.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former FCC chairman Ajit Pai as its newest partner</a> &#8212; with McWin and NextStage AM also participating. Previous investors rail industry heavyweight Alstom, Bpifrance and auto giant Continental also participated. Searchlight is also an investor in Get Your Guide and Univision.</p>
<p>EasyMile claims to be the world leader in autonomous shuttles with 60% of the global market using its vehicles. It says that its vehicles have racked up 800,000 kilometers in over 300 locations in 30 countries. But as a mark of how small and nascent that market is today, EasyMile also says that it has just 180 vehicles deployed worldwide. (One big competitor, Navya, also happens to be based out of France, interestingly.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EasyMile said it will use the funds to scale its business, by securing and building out commercial deployments in closed-campus environments. It will also continue to invest in its longer term strategy, to deploy its vehicles and technology in public transportation networks, although the company said believes its focus on more immediate use cases is what has helped it grow and attract new investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have stayed focused on what we can deliver in a reasonable timeframe and partnered with leaders in niche markets that are addressable now,&#8221; said EasyMile Founder and CEO Gilbert Gagnaire in a statement. “The participation of all of EasyMile’s earlier investors in the round is a strong vote of confidence in our expansion plan, and we are very happy to welcome Searchlight, McWin and NextStage and look forward to accelerating our growth thanks to their expertise.&#8221;</p>
<p>EasyMile is not disclosing its valuation, nor how much it has raised to date in what it described as an oversubscribed round. We are asking the company and will update this post as we learn more.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">EasyMile&#8217;s vehicles include the EZ10 people shuttles and TractEasy, an autonomous &#8220;tractor&#8221; trailer system for moving goods, and its over the years inked deals with companies like </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.tld-group.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TLD</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (which runs ground transport and support in air cargo) and is currently working with the Peugeot, Chrysler and Fiat group Stellantis to build an autonomous vehicle using EasyMile technology.</span></p>
<p>The company has also had some setbacks. Last year, the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/self-driving-startup-easy-mile-injury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHTSA barred EasyMile from running any services with passengers</a> on board after the company had an accident. (It can still operate vehicles without passengers.) We have asked the company to update us on the latest developments on this front.</p>
<p>On that front, it will be interesting to see how and if its new investor will have an impact in terms of helping with regulatory issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to be investing in EasyMile at this critical juncture in the firm’s trajectory,&#8221; said Ralf Ackermann, a partner at Searchlight Capital, in a statement. &#8220;Having observed its robust, quality-driven approach and industry-leading technology, we are confident that it is well positioned to scale commercially and are delighted to be part of the journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fundraising is interesting in that it is coming at a time when we&#8217;re seeing some reshuffling and in some cases retrenchment in the autonomous driving space. Just this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyft sold off its Level 5 division to Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet for $550 million</a>. EasyMile believes that its continuing focus on specific markets around shuttles in closed-loops has helped it stay the course and build more traction and profile in what is still an early market and bound to go through more changes, and hiccups.</p>
<p>“This injection of capital validates EasyMile’s strategy and will allow us to finalize our technical development and finance our scaleup strategy. We’ll bring the technology up to a level that can be industrialized and deliver a real commercial service,&#8221; said GM Benoit Perrin, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every day in the United States, hundreds of thousands of people will dial 911 to seek help. Some of those calls are serious and require immediate emergency attention, but the reality is that most 911 calls are of a far simpler variety: concerns about a prescription, fear over a newly-developed symptom, or a general medical question.</p>
<p>When a 911 call taker receives that request for medical assistance, it sets into motion a series of responses. Ambulances and paramedics are sent, leading to skyrocketing costs for patients and insurers alike. What if instead of sending hyper-expensive emergency services to a non-emergency situation, call takers had an ally to guide patients to the resources they actually need?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdally.com">MD Ally</a> is a startup that triages 911 calls and reroutes non-emergency calls to telehealth medical services. The company closed $3.5 million in seed funding led by Hemant Teneja at General Catalyst, along with Tuoyo Louis of Seae Ventures. The company formerly raised $1 million in financing last March.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shanel Fields, the CEO and founder of the company, said that the impetus for the company came from a very early age. “It goes back to my own childhood — my father was a volunteer EMT when I was growing up on Long Island,” she said, and that interest in healthcare brought her to Athenahealth.</p>

Image Credits: MD Ally</p></div></p>
<p>She kept thinking about 911 calls though, and the disparities that exist between different communities when it comes to response times. “Whether you have $5 dollars in your pocket or $5 million — you call the same number,” she said. But I “read some research that in low-income and indigent communities, they had higher rates of ‘dead on arrival’ due to higher wait times.” The reason was simple: in communities with less access to healthcare, emergency services are often the only alternative, leading to higher volumes of 911 calls with many that would be considered low priority.</p>
<p>That gave her the idea for MD Ally — to improve the efficiency of dispatching so that emergencies got first care, and that non-emergency calls could also be helpfully routed to improve clinical outcomes. She officially started building the company in Fall of 2019, and joined up with Kojo DeGraft-Hanson, who is the company’s chief product officer. The two have known each other for a decade from Cornell, and they stayed in touch as each pursued their own careers.</p>
<p>The company integrates into the computer-aided dispatch systems used by 911 operations centers (known more formally as Public Safety Answering Points or PSAPs). Today, when a 911 call comes in, call takers determine the acuity of the medical danger involved using an Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System, a uniform process for coding each call by severity. MD Ally has established a range of codes that call takers can safely redirect to telehealth treatment options.</p>
<p>Best of all for cash-strapped 911 centers, MD Ally’s platform is free. The company instead intends to generate revenues on the provider side for telehealth referrals as well as from insurance companies looking to reduce the cost of emergency medical services. The company is integrating with centers in New York and Florida now and by the end of the year, hopes to also have centers on board in Louisiana, California, and Arizona.</p>
<p>Long-term, the company hopes to help deescalate situations where 911 callers, who might be experiencing mental illness, are sent police response rather than psychological services. We’re “really passionate about and excited to provide a range of resources to deescalate scenarios,” Fields said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data intelligence company <a href="https://near.co/">Near</a> is announcing the acquisition of another company in the data business — <a href="https://um.co">UM</a>.</p>
<p>In some ways, this echoes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/near-acquires-teemo/">Near&#8217;s acquisition of Teemo</a> last fall. Just as that deal helped Singapore-headquartered Near expand into Europe (with Teemo founder and CEO Benoit Grouchko becoming Near&#8217;s chief privacy officer), CEO Anil Mathews said that this new acquisition will help Near build a presence in the United States, turning the company into &#8220;a truly global organization,&#8221; while also tailoring its product to offer &#8220;local flavors&#8221; in each country.</p>
<p>The addition of UM&#8217;s 60-person team brings Near&#8217;s total headcount to around 200, with UM CEO Gladys Kong becoming CEO of Near North America.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the same time, Mathews suggested that this deal isn&#8217;t simply about geography, because the data offered by Near and UM are &#8220;very complementary,&#8221; allowing both teams to upsell current customers on new offerings. He described Near&#8217;s mission as &#8220;merging two diverse worlds, the online world and the offline world,&#8221; essentially creating a unified profile of consumers for marketers and other businesses. Apparently, UM is particularly strong on the offline side, thanks to its focus on location data.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144687" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144687" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2144687" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Near CEO Anil Mathews and UM CEO Gladys Kong" width="680" height="530" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=768,599 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=680,530 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2144687" class="wp-caption-text">Near CEO Anil Mathews and UM CEO Gladys Kong</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;UM has a very strong understanding of places, they&#8217;ve mastered their understanding of footfalls and dwell times,&#8221; Mathews added. &#8220;As a result, most of the use cases where UM is seeing growth — in tourism, retail, real estate — are in industries struggling due to the pandemic, where they&#8217;re using data to figure out, &#8216;How do we come out of the pandemic?'&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch readers may be more familiar with UM under its old name UberMedia, which created social apps like Echofon and UberSocial before pivoting its business to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/19/ubermedia-cross-media/">ad attribution and location data</a>. Kong said that contrary to her fears, the company had &#8220;an amazing 2020&#8221; as businesses realized they needed UM&#8217;s data (its customers include RAND Corporation, Hawaii Tourism Authority, Columbia University and Yale University).</p>
<p>And the year was capped by connecting with Near and realizing that the two companies have &#8220;a lot of synergies.&#8221; In fact, Kong recalled that UM&#8217;s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ubermedia-rebrands-to-um-to-deliver-data-intelligence-to-every-business-301258454.html">rebranding last month</a> was partly at Mathews&#8217; suggestion: &#8220;He said, &#8216;Why do you have media in your name when you don&#8217;t do media?&#8217; And we realized that&#8217;s probably how the world saw us, so we decided to change [our name] to make it clear what we do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 2010, UM raised a total of $34.6 million in funding, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ubermedia/company_financials">according to Crunchbase</a>. The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Opsera, a startup that&#8217;s building an orchestration platform for DevOps teams, today announced that it has raised a $15 million Series A funding round led by Felicis Ventures. New investor HMG Ventures, as well as existing investors Clear Ventures, Trinity Partners and Firebolt Ventures also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $19.3 million.</p>
<p>Founded in January 2020, Opsera lets developers provision their CI/CD tools through a single framework. Using this framework, they can then build and manage their pipelines for a variety of use cases, including their software delivery lifecycle, infrastructure as code and their SaaS application releases. With this, Opsera essentially aims to help teams set up and operate their various DevOps tools.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s two co-founders, <a href="https://www.opsera.io/author/chandra-ranganathan">Chandra Ranganathan</a> and <a href="https://www.opsera.io/author/kumar-chivukula">Kumar Chivukula</a>, originally met while working at Symantec a few years ago. Ranganathan then spent the last three years at Uber, where he ran that company&#8217;s global infrastructure. Meanwhile, Chivukula ran Symantec&#8217;s hybrid cloud services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2144506" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Insights.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144506" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2144506" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Insights.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="930" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Insights.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Insights.jpg?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Insights.jpg?resize=300,272 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Insights.jpg?resize=768,698 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Insights.jpg?resize=680,618 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Insights.jpg?resize=1536,1395 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Insights.jpg?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144506" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Opsera</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;As part of the transformation [at Symantec], we delivered over 50+ acquisitions over time. That had led to the use of many cloud platforms, many data centers,&#8221; Ranganathan explained. &#8220;Ultimately we had to consolidate them into a single enterprise cloud. That journey is what led us to the pain points of what led to Opsera. There were many engineering teams. They all had diverse tools and stacks that were all needed for their own use cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>The challenge then was to still give developers the flexibility to choose the right tools for their use cases, while also providing a mechanism for automation, visibility and governance &#8212; and that&#8217;s ultimately the problem Opsera now aims to solve.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144507" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144507" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2144507" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png" alt="" width="1024" height="604" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png 1712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png?resize=1536,905 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144507" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Opsera</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;In the DevOps landscape, [&#8230;] there is a plethora of tools, and a lot of people are writing the glue code,&#8221; Opsera co-founder Chivukula noted. &#8220;But then they&#8217;re not they don&#8217;t have visibility. At Opsera, our mission and goal is to bring order to the chaos. And the way we want to do this is by giving choice and flexibility to the users and provide no-code automation using a unified framework.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wesley Chan, a managing director for Felicis Ventures who will join the Opsera board, also noted that he believes that one of the next big areas for growth in DevOps is how orchestration and release management is handled.</p>
<p>&#8220;We spoke to a lot of startups who are all using black-box tools because they&#8217;ve built their engineering organization and their DevOps from scratch,&#8221; Chan said. &#8220;That&#8217;s fine, if you&#8217;re starting from scratch and you just hired a bunch of people outside of Google and they&#8217;re all very sophisticated. But then when you talk to some of the larger companies. [&#8230;] You just have all these different teams and tools &#8212; and it gets unwieldy and complex.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike some other tools, Chan argues, Opsera allows its users the flexibility to interface with this wide variety of existing internal systems and tools for managing the software lifecycle and releases.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is why we got so interested in investing, because we just heard from all the folks that this is the right tool. There&#8217;s no way we&#8217;re throwing out a bunch of our internal stuff. This would just wreak havoc on our engineering team,&#8221; Chan explained. He believes that building with this wide existing ecosystem in mind &#8212; and integrating with it without forcing users onto a completely new platform &#8212; and its ability to reduce friction for these teams, is what will ultimately make Opsera successful.</p>
<p>Opsera plans to use the new funding to grow its engineering team and accelerate its go-to-market efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By his own admission, Chris Thür wasn&#8217;t the most obvious person to start a music education startup.</p>
<p>Thür (previously a laser researcher) recalled an early meeting with an investor who asked whether he and co-founder Mikko Kaipainen (an electrical engineer) were music teachers or musicians, ultimately going &#8220;down the list of all the things that would somewhat qualify us for that world.&#8221; Each time, they had to tell him no.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were just two people who wanted to play an instrument and felt we were missing out,&#8221; Thür said. &#8220;Obviously, we were not the only ones.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While they didn&#8217;t convince that unnamed investor to write a check, Thür and Kaipainen did start <a href="https://yousician.com">Yousician</a>, which now reaches 20 million monthly users across its two apps — the music education app Yousician and the guitar tuning app GuitarTuna. And the Helsinki-based startup is announcing today that it has raised $29 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>Thür (Yousician&#8217;s CEO) said that it&#8217;s been &#8220;a bit of a journey&#8221; to get here. The company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/08/ovelin-funding/">previously known as Ovelin</a>, was founded a decade ago, and it originally focused exclusively on kids before finding success with a less age-specific strategy.</p>

<p>He described the Yousician app as providing an interactive, gamified approach to learning guitar, piano, ukulele, bass or singing — but not <em>too</em> game-like. Users advance through a standard syllabus, playing for 15 or 20 minutes a day, with the app listening to their performance and awarding one to three stars based on how many mistakes they made. Users get one lesson per day for free, but if they want access to more lessons and the full library of songs (or if they want to learn multiple instruments), they need to sign up for a Premium or Premium+ subscription, with pricing starting at $19.99 per month.</p>
<p>Thür said Yousician allows people to learn music on their own schedule, at a much lower cost than in-person lessons. At the same time, he suggested that it&#8217;s not a &#8220;zero sum&#8221; competition with music teachers; there are teachers who recommend Yousician to their students as a way to keep practicing and learning between lessons.</p>
<p>As an example of how Yousician can help its users, Thür pointed to the story of Karen Gadd, who (as told in the video below) &#8220;in one year went from never having played an instrument to performing on-stage&#8221; with her band — though he hastened to add that the app is beneficial even if you never perform for anyone else.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make musicality to be as common as literacy,&#8221; Thür said. &#8220;Everyone should play from time to time and get all those benefits [&#8230;] I think learning with a teacher works for many, but unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t work for everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rALbjWNpAG8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The past year, he said, has been &#8220;a difficult year and an interesting year for us.&#8221; With students largely shifting to remote learning, &#8220;a lot of music lessons didn&#8217;t happen,&#8221; so Yousician tried to make up for some of those lost lessons by providing free premium subscriptions to more than 100,000 teachers and students.</p>
<p>At the same time, many people became interested in learning an instrument during the pandemic as part of a general focus on self-improvement, leading to &#8220;a huge organic increase&#8221; in usage. Monthly users grew from 14.5 million to 20 million, while subscriptions increased 80%, with the company bringing in revenue of $50 million last year.</p>
<p>Yousician has now raised a total of $35 million. True Ventures led the round, with participation from new investors Amazon’s Alexa Fund and MPL Ventures, as well as Zynga founder Mark Pincus, LAUNCH Fund founder Jason Calacanis, Unity Technologies founder David Helgason, Trivago co-founder Rolf Schrömgens, Cooler Future founder Moaffak Ahmed and Blue Bottle Coffee Company executive chairman Bryan Meehan.</p>
<p>“Yousician has been the leading platform for music instruction for nearly a decade, and people – now more than ever – are turning to the pursuit of creativity and music with renewed vigor,” said True Ventures co-founder Jon Callaghan in a statement. “We’re proud to stand behind a company and team that brings the joy and excitement of playing an instrument into more homes and families.”</p>
<p>Thür said that with the new funding, Yousician will work the team, improve brand marketing, localize the product and build <a href="https://yousician.com/blog/jason-mraz-yousician-guest-teacher">more relationships with musical artists</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.messagebird.com/en/">MessageBird</a>, a communications platform out of the Netherlands, had a busy day today with two huge announcements. For starters, the company got an $800 million extension on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/messagebird-series-c/">$200 million Series C round</a> announced last October. It then applied $600 million of the extension to buy email marketing platform <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/">SparkPost</a>. The company&#8217;s C round now totals at least $1 billion.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the acquisition. MessageBird CEO Robert Vis says his company had an email component prior to the acquisition, but the chance to pick up the largest email provider in the world was too good to pass up.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you talk about infrastructure, we&#8217;re defining largest [&#8230;] as a matter of interactions, so basically the amount of emails sent. SparkPost sends about 5 trillion emails a year. And the second thing that&#8217;s very important to us is to be able to send high scale emails when it&#8217;s really critical,&#8221; Vis told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the company in the fold, it enables MessageBird, which has mostly been in Europe and Asia, to get a stronger foothold in the U.S. market. &#8220;So this is as much for us about the technology around SparkPost as it actually is for us to have market entry into the United States with a significant workforce instead of having to build that from scratch,&#8221; Vis said.</p>

<p>Rich Harris, CEO of SparkPost sees the deal as a way to expand SparkPost to multiple channels already available on the MessageBird platform and be a much more powerful combination together than it could have been alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;By joining forces with MessageBird, we will be able to bring broader, deeper value to all of our customers through any digital communications,&#8221; Harris said in a statement.</p>
<p>Vis agrees saying it gives his company the opportunity to upsell other MessageBird services to SparkPost customers. &#8220;SparkPost obviously only offers email. We can offer SmartPost customers way more channels. We can offer them texting, Instagram, WhatsApp or Apple Business Chat. So we feel very excited about leveraging them to go sell much more broad messenger products to their customers,&#8221; Vis said.</p>

<p>MessageBird announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/messagebird-series-c/">$240 million Series C on a $3 billion valuation</a> last October. The company&#8217;s whopping $800 million extension brings the round to around $1 billion. It&#8217;s worth noting that the round isn&#8217;t completely closed yet, so that&#8217;s not an official figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;The round isn’t completely closed yet as we are still waiting on some of the funds to come in, so we cannot give you 100% final figures on the round, but we can say with confidence that the round will close at $1B or slightly higher,&#8221; a company spokesperson explained. It is announcing the funding before everything is 100% done due to regulatory requirements around the acquisition.</p>
<p>Eurazeo, Tiger Global, BlackRock and Owl Rock participated in the extension along with Bonnier, Glynn Capital, LGT Lightstone, Longbow, Mousse Partners and NewView Capital, as well as existing investors such as Accel, Atomico (they led the Series A and B rounds) and Y Combinator. The mix is 70% equity and 30% debt, according to the company.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s acquisition <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2021/03/30/dutch-unicorn-messagebird-acquires-two-startups/?sh=417e7efbd743">comes on the heels of two others</a> just last month when the company announced it was acquiring video meeting startup 24Sessions and Hull, a synchronization technology startup. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/push-it-realtime-good/">also acquired Pusher</a>, a push notification company in January, as MessageBird is using its Series C cash to quickly expand the platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are lot of companies out there making robotic exoskeletons. In fact, it’s one of the more active categories in the space &#8212; and for good reason. These sorts of technologies have the ability to profoundly impact the future of how people work, move and rehabilitate.</p>
<p>The category also houses a surprisingly broad range of solutions, with something like the sci-fi Sarcos at one end and <a href="https://www.roamrobotics.com/">Roam</a> on the other. Roam’s solution is really putting the wearable back in wearable robotics. Specifically, the company makes assistive devices out of fabrics, rather than metal or plastic.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that means the loss of some of the strength of more industrial solutions, but it also means they’re more suited for every day use. That’s precisely why something like the robotic smart knee orthosis makes a lot of sense. The product, which recently cleared the FDA as a Class I medical device, utilizes AI for an adapted technology that senses the wearer’s movements and adjusts accordingly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“Roam is focused on a massively underserved market. More than 20% of the global population is limited by their body’s mobility, and as medical advancements help people live longer that number is only going to increase,” co-founder and CEO Tim Swift said in a release tied to the news. “Our approach to wearable robotics works seamlessly with the human body to help people lead healthier, happier and more active lives, unhindered by physical limitations.”</p>
<p>The product, which joins the company’s skier and military-focused offers, sports embedded sensors that can detect things like movement up and down stairs and standing up from a seated position. It utilizes a power source and air compressor to create motion to assist in movement.</p>
<p>The device is up for preorder and starts shipping later this summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merama, a five-month old e-commerce startup focused on Latin America, announced today that it has raised $60 million in seed and Series A funding and $100 million in debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money was raised “at well over a $200 million valuation,” according to co-founder and CEO Sujay Tyle.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are receiving significant inbound for a Series B already,” he said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LatAm firms Valor Capital and Monashees Capital and U.K.-based Balderton Capital co-led the “massively oversubscribed” funding round, which also included participation from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley-based TriplePoint Capital and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the CEOs of four unicorns in Latin America, including Uala, Loggi, Rappi and Madeira Madeira. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyle, Felipe Delgado, Olivier Scialom, Renato Andrade and Guilherme Nosralla started Merama in December 2020 with a vision to be the “largest and best-selling set of brands in Latin America.” The company has dual headquarters in Mexico City and São Paulo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merama partners with e-commerce product sellers in Latin America by purchasing a stake in the businesses and working with their teams to help them “exponentially” grow and boost their technology while providing them with nondilutive working capital. CEO Tyle describes the company’s model as “wildly different” from that of Thras.io, Perch and other similar companies such as </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valoreo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it does not aggregate dozens of brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will work with very few brands over time, and only the best, and work with our entire team to scale and expand these few businesses,” Tyle told TechCrunch. “We’re more similar to The Hut Group in the EU.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merama expects to sell $100 million across the region this year, more than two times the year before. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is currently focused on Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Already, the company operates “very profitably,” according to Tyle. So the cash raised will go primarily toward partnering with more brands, investing in building its technology platform “to aid in the automation of several facets” of its partners&#8217; brands and in working capital for product innovation and inventory purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 42-person team is made up of e-commerce leaders from companies such as Amazon, Mercado Libre and Facebook, among others. Tyle knows a thing or two about growing and building new startups, having co-founded Frontier Car Group, which sold to OLX/Naspers for about $700 million in 2019. He is also currently a venture partner at Balderton. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a fact that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin American e-commerce has boomed, particularly during the pandemic. Mexico was the fastest-growing e-commerce market in 2020 worldwide, yet is still in its infancy, Tyle said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the $85 billion e-commerce market in Latin America is growing rapidly, with projections of it </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/445860/retail-e-commerce-sales-latam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reaching $116.2 billion in 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Merchants are seeing hypergrowth but still struggle with fundamental problems, which creates a ceiling in their potential,” Tyle told TechCrunch. “For example, they are unable to expand internationally, get reliable and cost-effective working capital and build technology tools to support their own online presence. This is where Merama comes in. We seek to give our partners an unfair advantage. When we decide to work with a team, it is because we believe they will be the de facto category leader and can become a $1 billion business on their own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merama collaborates with e-commerce giants such as Amazon and Mercado Libre, and several executives from both companies have invested in the startup, as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is why we like Merama&#8217;s approach to partnering with these established brands and provide them unparalleled support to scale their operations in an efficient way,” he added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Group video calls will be coming to Telegram&#8217;s messaging platform next month with what&#8217;s being touted as a fully featured implementation, including support for web-based videoconferencing.</p>
<p>Founder Pavel Durov made the announcement via a (text) message posted to his official Telegram channel today where he wrote &#8220;we will be adding a video dimension to our voice chats in May, making Telegram a powerful platform for group video calls&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Screen sharing, encryption, noise-cancelling, desktop and tablet support &#8212; everything you can expect from a modern video conferencing tool, but with Telegram-level UI, speed and encryption. Stay tuned!&#8221; he added, using the sorts of phrases you&#8217;d expect from an enterprise software maker.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will Zoom Apps be the next hot startup platform?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/will-zoom-apps-be-the-next-hot-startup-platform/embed/#?secret=8SnlQyhgqN" data-secret="8SnlQyhgqN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Telegram often taunts rivals over their tardiness to add new features but on video calls it has been a laggard, only adding the ability to make one-on-one video calls <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/video-calls">last August</a> &#8212; rather than prioritizing a launch of group video calls, as it had suggested it would a few months earlier.</p>
<p>In an April 2020 <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/400-million">blog post</a>, to mark passing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/telegram-hits-400-million-monthly-active-users/">400M users</a>, it wrote that the global lockdown had &#8220;highlighted the need for a trusted video communication tool&#8221; &#8212; going on to dub video calls in 2020 &#8220;much like messaging in 2013&#8221;.</p>
<p>However it also emphasized the importance of security for group video calling &#8212; and that&#8217;s perhaps what&#8217;s caused the delay.</p>
<p>(Another possibility is the operational distraction of needing to raise a large chunk of debt financing to keep funding development: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/telegram-raises-150m-from-mubadala-and-abu-dhabi-cp-via-pre-ipo-convertible-bonds/">Last month</a> Telegram announced it had raised over $1BN by selling bonds &#8212; its earlier plan to monetize via a blockchain platform having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/telegram-abandons-its-ton-blockchain-platform/">hit the buffers in 2020</a>.)</p>
<p>In the event, rather than rolling out group video calls towards the latter end of 2020 it&#8217;s going to be doing so almost half way through 2021 &#8212; which has left videoconferencing platforms like Zoom to keep cleaning up during the pandemic-fuelled remote work and play boom (even as &#8216;Zoom fatigue&#8217; has been added to our lexicon).</p>
<p>How secure Telegram&#8217;s implementation of group video calls will be, though, is an open question.</p>
<p>Durov&#8217;s post mades repeat mention of &#8220;encryption&#8221; &#8212; perhaps to make a subtle dig at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/zoom-ftc-deceptive-security-claims/">Zoom&#8217;s own messy security claims history</a> &#8212; but doesn&#8217;t specify whether it will use end-to-end encryption (we&#8217;ve asked).</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/zoom-launches-end-to-end-encryption-for-free-meetings-with-a-catch/">Zoom does now offer e2e</a> &#8212; and also has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/zoom-launches-100m-zoom-apps-investment-fund/">designs on becoming a platform in its own right</a>, with apps and a marketplace, so there are a number of shifts in the comms landscape that could see the videoconferencing giant making deeper incursions into Telegram&#8217;s social messaging territory.</p>
<p>The one-to-one video calls Telegram launched last year were rolled out with its own <a href="https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end/voice-calls">e2e encryption</a> &#8212; so presumably it will be replicating that approach for group calls.</p>
<p>However the MTProto encryption Telegram uses is custom-designed &#8212; and there&#8217;s been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software)#Security">plenty of debate</a> among cryptography experts over the soundness of its approach. So even if group calls are e2e encrypted there will be scrutiny over exactly how Telegram is doing it.</p>
<p>Also today, Durov touted two recently launched web versions of Telegram (not the first such versions by a long chalk, though) &#8212; adding that it&#8217;s currently testing &#8220;a functional version of web-based video calls internally, which will be added soon&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said the Webk and Webz versions of the web app are &#8220;by far the most cross-platform versions of Telegram we shipped so far&#8221;, and noting that no downloads or installs are required to access your chats via the browser.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is particularly good for corporate environments where installing native apps is now always allowed, but also good for users who like the instant nature of web sites,&#8221; he added, with another little nod toward enterprise users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.wunderite.com/">Wunderite</a>, a Boston-based software startup, announced that it has raised $3 million in an early-stage round led by <a href="https://www.sparkcapital.com/">Spark Capital</a>.</p>
<p>Wunderite builds and sells software designed to help insurance agencies more rapidly process insurance applications, and automate some of their processes. With an industry-focus on insurance agencies while providing some API hooks, the startup fits into a number of startup trends, including vertical SaaS, developer-friendly tooling, and insurtech.</p>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petemacdonald">Peter MacDonald</a> (CEO) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephschnare/">Joe Schnare</a> (COO) about their company and its new investment. MacDonald previously worked for his family&#8217;s insurance business, while Schnare earned insurance experience by working for a large player in the market. The two met while at business school.</p>
<p>The pair told TechCrunch that most property and casualty insurance (car, pet, home, and other forms of popular coverage) is still sold by small and mid-sized agencies. That may surprise, but most of the United States is not the Bay Area, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Denver, or Seattle it turns out.</p>
<p>But while that market share point is good news for smaller insurance groups out there, it&#8217;s not great news for the staff of those firms as MacDonald and Schnare detailed that many are forced to work with archaic tooling. Like writing with their hands. Or email. A huge market &#8212; insurance is a monster industry &#8212; with a piecemeal competitive market and antiquated tooling could prove ripe for Wunderite, provided that it can reach a sufficient number of the companies that it hopes will comprise its revenue base.</p>
<p>Spark Capital&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sparkcapital.com/team-profiles/alex-finkelstein">Alex Finkelstein</a> is bullish on the company&#8217;s chances. In a conversation with TechCrunch concerning the round, he expressed an interest in what he called &#8220;unsexy&#8221; business categories that feature extensive fragmentation and either outdated software, or no software at all. That is precisely Wunderite&#8217;s thesis.</p>
<p>Finkelstein thinks that such companies can build workflow tooling, grow themselves into being the data hub of their industry customers, leveraging that perch into an even larger enterprise. So he has big hopes for startup past its current product remit.</p>
<p>Today the startup is just seven folks &#8212; four in the United States, three in the Philippines &#8212; but expects to grow to 15 to 20 this year.</p>
<p>Finally, why did the company raise $3 million in a market when it seems that every round is ten times the size it might have been three years ago? The founders said that they are at the &#8220;early stages&#8221; of product-market fit, so they want to start building their sales team without overspending. Asked the same question, Finkelstein said that the company had outlined a series of milestones that it wants to meet, and that $3 million was the number it needed to reach them. At which point it can raise more capital at a higher valuation.</p>
<p>Wunderite &#8212; a portmanteau of the German word &#8220;wonder,&#8221; which means wonder or miracle, and &#8220;underwrite,&#8221; which is English for taking on risk in exchange for a fee &#8212; has the funds it needs to stretch its sales legs a bit and put more revenue points on the board. Let&#8217;s see how well it can scales its revenue operation with its new capital.</p>
