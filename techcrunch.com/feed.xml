										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some more internal emails <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/23/facebook-really-doesnt-want-you-to-read-these-emails/">Facebook really doesn&#8217;t want you to see</a>: Turns out in 2017 COO Sheryl Sandberg had already known for years there were problems with a free ad planning tool the company offers to marketeers to display estimates of how many people campaigns running on its platform may reach, per newly unsealed court documents.</p>
<p>The filing also reveals that a Facebook product manager for the &#8216;potential reach&#8217; tool warned the company was making revenue it &#8220;should never have&#8221; off of &#8220;wrong data&#8221;.</p>
<p>The unsealed documents pertain to a US class action lawsuit, filed in 2018, which alleges that Facebook deceived advertisers by knowingly including fake and duplicate accounts in &#8216;potential reach&#8217; metric.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook denies the claim but has acknowledged accuracy issues with the &#8216;potential reach&#8217; metric as far back as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/09/facebook-corrects-more-metrics-affecting-ad-reach-streaming-reactions-plus-like-share-counts/">2016</a> &#8212; and also changed how it worked in 2019.</p>
<p>While the litigants have continued to accuse Facebook of continuing to misrepresent the ad reach estimate in updates to their 2018 complaint.</p>
<p>Redacted documents from the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-accused-in-amended-lawsuit-of-knowing-ad-audiences-were-inflated-11584745492">reported by the WSJ</a> last year, included the awkward detail that a Facebook employee had asked &#8220;how long can we get away with the reach overestimation?&#8221;</p>
<p>But sections of the filing pertaining to Sandberg and other Facebook executives were redacted.</p>
<p>Newly unsealed documents from the suit &#8212; which we&#8217;ve reviewed &#8212; now reveal that in fall 2017 Sandberg &#8220;acknowledged in an internal email she had known about problems with Potential Reach for years&#8221;.</p>

<p>They also show Facebook repeatedly rejected internal proposals to fix the issue of fake and duplicate accounts inflating the estimates its platform showed to advertisers of the number of people who could see their ads &#8212; citing impact on revenue as a reason not to act.</p>
<p>In early 2018 Facebook estimated that removing duplicate accounts would cause a 10% drop in potential reach, per the unsealed filing. While Facebook management rejected an employee&#8217;s suggestion to change the language the tool showed to advertisers, declining to swap out the words &#8220;people&#8221; and &#8220;reach&#8221; for the (more accurate) term &#8220;accounts&#8221; &#8212; on the grounds that &#8220;people-based marketing was core to Facebook&#8217;s value proposition&#8221;.</p>
<p>The filing also reveals that a product manager for &#8216;potential reach&#8217;, Yaron Fidler, proposed a fix for the tool that would have decreased its numbers. His proposal was rejected by Facebook&#8217;s metrics leadership on the grounds that it would have a &#8220;significant&#8221; impact on the company&#8217;s revenue &#8212; to which Fidler responded: &#8220;It&#8217;s revenue we should have never made given the fact it&#8217;s based on wrong data.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/09/facebook-corrects-more-metrics-affecting-ad-reach-streaming-reactions-plus-like-share-counts/">2016</a>, when Facebook published an <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2016/11/an-update-on-metrics-and-reporting/">update on metrics</a> &#8212; a few weeks after publicly disclosing it had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/22/facebook-miscalculation-significantly-inflated-average-video-view-times-for-years/?_ga=2.140390259.118496112.1613376463-1757155993.1533833482">over-inflating average video view times</a>, as it sought to regain advertiser trust in its reporting tools &#8212; the tech giant also announced a new channel for &#8220;regular information on metrics enhancements&#8221;, called <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/category/measurement-fyi/">Metrics FYI</a>.</p>
<p>This is where it made the aforementioned fuzzy disclosure of accuracy issues with &#8216;potential reach&#8217; &#8212; writing then that it was &#8220;improving our methodology for sampling and extrapolating potential audience sizes&#8221; to &#8220;help to provide a more accurate estimate for a given target audience and to better account for audiences across multiple platforms (Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network)&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;In most cases, advertisers should expect to see less than a 10% change (increase or decrease) in the audience sizes shown in the tool,&#8221; it added at the time.</p>
<p>However the December 2016 <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2016/12/metrics-fyi-estimated-reach-streaming-reactions-and-graph-api/">blog post</a> did not go into any detail about the nature of the accuracy problems Facebook thought needed improving &#8212; reading more like another classic slice of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html">Facebook crisis PR</a>.</p>
<p>The class action suit, meanwhile, alleges that rather than accepting internal proposals to fix the accuracy problems of &#8216;potential reach&#8217;, Facebook instead &#8220;developed talking points to deflect from the truth&#8221;.</p>
<p>The tech giant did announce some changes to the ad tool in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/567031670465069">March 2019</a> &#8212; when it said an advertiser&#8217;s campaign&#8217;s estimated potential reach &#8220;is now based on how many people have been shown an ad on a Facebook Product in the past 30 days who match your desired audience and placement criteria&#8221; (vs the estimates being previously based on &#8220;people who were active users in the past 30 days&#8221;).</p>
<p>But the litigants argue that the changes to the tool which displays an estimate to advertisers as they are beginning to create a campaign &#8212; and therefore when they&#8217;re deciding/considering whether/how much money to spend with Facebook &#8212; do not fully fix the issue of the metric not corresponding to the potential audience of people who could see the ad on Facebook.</p>
<p>An analyst report back in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-claimed-reach-in-the-u-s-is-larger-than-census-figures-analyst-finds-1504711935">2017</a> showed that Facebook&#8217;s ad platform claimed to reach millions more users among specific age groups in the U.S. than official census data indicated reside in the country.</p>
<p>At the time the company said the audience reach estimates &#8220;are based on a number of factors, including Facebook user behaviors, user demographics, location data from devices, and other factors&#8221;, per the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-claimed-reach-in-the-u-s-is-larger-than-census-figures-analyst-finds-1504711935">WSJ</a>, and claimed they are &#8220;not designed to match population or census estimates&#8221;. Facebook added then that it is &#8220;always working to improve our estimates&#8221;.</p>
<p>Asked about the latest batch of unsealed court documents pertaining to the lawsuit &#8212; including the revelation that Facebook&#8217;s COO had told staff she knew about &#8220;problems&#8221; with the ad tool &#8220;for years&#8221; as far back as fall 2017 &#8212; Facebook sent us this statement, attributed to a spokesperson: “These allegations are without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.”</p>
<p>Problems with self-reporting ad metrics have been a recurring theme for Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/facebooks-latest-ad-tool-fail-puts-another-dent-in-its-reputation/">Last year</a> the tech giant disclosed yet another issue on this front &#8212; saying its &#8216;conversion lift&#8217; ad tool had a code error that meant it had miscalculated the number of sales derived from ad impressions for a number of advertisers.</p>
<p>That &#8216;technical problem&#8217; with Facebook&#8217;s internal calculation of the efficacy of third parties&#8217; ad campaigns meant advertisers saw skewed data which they may have used to determine how much to spend on its platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.yext.com/products/answers">Yext Answers</a> allows businesses to provide a better search experience on their own websites — but as the name implies, the goal is really to make sure consumers get the answers they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we deliver a link [in response to a search query], we consider it a failure on our side,&#8221; Chief Strategy Officer Marc Ferrentino told me.</p>
<p>Ferrentino said the company will be able to do an even better job of that starting on March 17, with the launch of the &#8220;Orion&#8221; update to its search algorithm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yext will then be able to pull answers directly from unstructured pages on a business&#8217; website. The key, he said, is that Yext can &#8220;extract structured information&#8221; from an unstructured document — whether that&#8217;s a webpage, a blog post or a help document — rather than just searching for keywords. So instead simply presenting a link or a &#8220;blob of text,&#8221; it will offer a &#8220;rich snippet&#8221; that actually answers your question.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114459" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114459" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114459" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Yext Answers" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg 3250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?resize=2048,1153 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114459" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yext</p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good chance that you&#8217;re familiar with something similar from Google&#8217;s consumer search experience, where the results often include a widget with questions and answers. Ferrentino welcomed the comparison, saying this will allow Yext customers to close the &#8220;experience gap&#8221; between Google&#8217;s search experience and their own.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the technology, Ferrentino showed me how Yext Answers could crawl pages about presidential history and then return the correct answer when asked, &#8220;Who was the only U.S. president to be impeached twice?&#8221;</p>
<p>Or for a more commercial (albeit slightly meta) example, he showed me how it could answer questions about Yext&#8217;s technology. As another example, Yext says it could search a bank&#8217;s website to answer a question about the difference between a 401(k) and Roth IRA.</p>
<p>And Yext co-founder and President Jon Brod noted that this change won&#8217;t just improve things for business and their customers, but also Yext&#8217;s non-profit clients, including the World Health Organization, which is <a href="https://www.yext.com/about/news-media/2020-05-world-health-organization-and-yext-collaborate-to-answer-covid-19-questions-online/">using Yext to provide pandemic-related answers online</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Each year, millions of students in India rush to get an admission in universities abroad. Often they don’t know which program they should focus on, or the college that is right for their skillset and ambition.</p>
<p>Scores of legacy and newfound firms are attempting to offer counselling to these students. But despite India contributing more international students than any other country, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/edtechs-newest-unicorn-applyboard-lands-1-4b-valuation-with-fresh-funding/">most firms</a> aiming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/crimson-education-a-platform-to-help-students-get-into-top-universities-nabs-5m-at-a-245m-valuation/">address this challenge</a> are not focused on India, and struggle to understand some unique problems students in the world’s second most populous country face.</p>
<p>An Indian startup that is bridging this gap on Thursday said it has raised $6.5 million in a new financing round as it looks to scale its platform in the world’s second largest internet market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://leverageedu.com">Leverage Edu</a> said Tomorrow Capital led the Delhi-headquartered startup’s Series A financing round. Existing investors Blume Ventures and DSG Consumer Partners also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Akshay Chaturvedi, founder and chief executive of Leverage Edu, told TechCrunch in an interview that he believes that eventually the firm that is going to serve the students best and emerge most successful will be the one that is physically closer to them, and not to the universities.</p>
<p>Chaturvedi, 30, began exploring this idea for this startup in 2015 and spent a little more than a year experimenting with different models. One of the earliest iterations of Leverage Edu offered mentorship to students and rewarded counselors with points.</p>
<p>Today, the startup offers a broad range of services in addition to offering personalized mentorship. Through its workshops, it helps students find the right college, guides them with complex applications and grade conversions, as well as assists with education loan, VISA, and accommodation. &#8220;It&#8217;s one digital dashboard. You get everything from flight tickets to local phone numbers, to education loan in one place,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>“We believe it is inevitable that the next stellar brand in the global cross-border education space will be a home-grown one. We have a great belief in Akshay as a founder &#8211; he has a fantastic roadmap for scaling the business and the passion to build a truly global Indian edtech brand &#8211; and are excited about working with the Leverage Edu team on this journey,” said Rohini Prakash, chief executive of Tomorrow Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>Leverage Edu helps students land admission in the most prestigious colleges, but also works with those that didn’t score the most marks.</p>
<p>“Students going to the top colleges is just 10% of the potential audience,” explained Chaturvedi, who spent his teen years attending talks from startup founders and also made money by bringing more people to those talks.  “There are many universities that don’t have the best branding. To connect them with students, we have our SaaS offering <a href="https://univalley.com">Univalley.com</a>,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to help students find colleges in more geographies including the UK and Australia, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to focus on a few things and do them really really well. There is also this myth around foreign education being expensive that we&#8217;ve been busting for last four years. 18 months from now, we want to be among the top study abroad companies in India, both by number of students and a roof-hitting NPS &#8211; because a happy student is why we are all really motivated everyday to do this!”, he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With offline events now firmly moved to online for the foreseeable future, startups in the networking space had to pivot fast in the face of the pandemic. One of those was <a href="https://grip.events/">Grip</a>, previously better known as a networking app for physical conferences (including TechCrunch Disrupt, at one point). Since last year, Grip moved into an ‘omnichannel’ experience, combining various event types across virtual, hybrid, and live. That strategy appears to have paid off as it has now raised a $13 million Series A funding round, taking its total amount raised to $14.5 million.</p>
<p>The round was led by London-based growth equity fund Kennet Partners. The raise is reflective of the boom in online events, which saw London-based startup Hopin raise a $40m Series A last year. Founded in 2016, Grip counts some large event organizers as clients including  Reed Exhibitions and Messe Frankfurt.</p>
<p>In a statement Tim Groot, CEO and founder of Grip, said: “Our mission is to empower organizers to bring professionals together to advance industries. This funding round is going to enable us to take the experience to a new level, leveraging our extensive  industry-leading platform, offering unique value for Virtual, Hybrid and In-Person events.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said they would now be investing heavily in the product and looking to global expansion.</p>
<p>Other competitors to Grip have, in the past, included <a href="https://www.brella.io/">Brella</a> which raised $1.5m, and <a href="https://www.swapcard.com/">Swapcard</a> which raised $6m to date.</p>
<p>So why is it that Grip seems to have pulled away from pack in this way?</p>
<p>Groot told me: “We took a slightly different approach in that we managed to work in a plug-and-play method alongside other platforms. So grip gets used as a standalone virtual event platform by lots of these organizers. So they might use Hopin for the conference but Grip for the networking. So maybe we managed to get more traction that way, over the course of 2020.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2020, following the pivot to virtual events, Grip hosted over 100 events a month and was used by 1.5m people. As a result, the company says revenue grew almost 4x in 2020, and this year it expects to do over 10,000 events on its platform with over 5 million participants.</p>
<p>Grips AI-powered algorithms mean attendees get more personalized matchmaking recommendations based on their interests, including pre-event meeting scheduling. For exhibitors, the software captures business leads and provides post-event analytics.</p>
<p>People can be added to meetings to have group conversations and the startup is also working on a topic-based “speed networking” functionality to hold instant 3 minute conversations.</p>
<p>Grip integrates with various streaming platforms such as Vimeo, Youtube, Zoom, BlueJeans and others, unlike “full-service” platforms such as Hopin or Bizzabo.</p>
<p>Hillel Zidel, Partner at Kennet and Grip board member, added: “Grip’s ability to organize virtual events with a key focus on networking has meant that the company has seen tremendous growth over the last year. Event organizers and their clients have been able to remain connected with their customers despite the constraints on in-person events. As live events resume in the future, Grip is extremely well-positioned to continue to assist event organizers through the provision of software solutions supporting live, virtual and hybrid events.”</p>
<p>Brent Hoberman, co-founder of Founders Factory and a previous investor, said: “Grip was born out of a need we saw in running events at Founders Forum &#8211; how do you use smart technology to catalyze the most relevant and valuable connections between your guests?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/earlybird-digital-east-fund-i">Earlybird Digital East Fund</a> — a fund associated with Germany’s <a href="https://earlybird.com/">Earlybird</a> VC, but operating separately — has launched a €200m ($242m) successor fund. The fund’s focus will remain the same as before: a Seed and Series-A fund focusing on what’s known as ‘Emerging Europe’, in other words, countries stretching from the Baltics to Central and Eastern Europe, and Turkey. The firm has also promoted Mehmet Atici, who’s been with the firm for eight years, to Partner. The new fund has made four investments so far: FintechOS, Payhawk, Picus, and Binalyze.</p>
<p>The back-story to DEF is a fascinating tale of what happened to Europe in the last 15 years, as tech took off and Europeans returned from Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Following his exit from SelectMinds (where he was the Founder &amp; CEO) in 2005, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/csertoglu/">Cem Sertoglu</a> moved back to Turkey. Although he says he “accidentally became the first angel investor” there, he was clearly the right man, in the right place, at the right time. He told me: “I was very lucky and ended up writing the first checks in some of the first large outcomes in Turkey.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2013, Sertoglu partnered with Evren Ucok (the first angel in Peak Games and Trendyol), and Roland Manger (Earlybird). Dan Lupu, a Romanian investor who had covered the region for Intel Capital, joined them, and together they raised the ‘Earlybird Digital East Fund I’ set at $150m fund in 2014, focusing on CEE and Turkey. This was and is an area where there can be high-quality ventures to be found, but very little in the way of VC. </p>
<p>Thereafter, between 2014 and 2019, the fund invested in UiPath, Hazelcast, and Obilet. UiPath has become a global leader in the area known as ‘Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Hazelcast is a low latency data processing platform startup with Turkish roots. Obilet is a marketplace focused for the massive Turkish intercity bus travel market. DEF has also exited Vivense, Dolap, and EMbonds and in more recent times the fund has exited Vivense, the &#8220;Wayfair of Turkey&#8221; to Actera, the top local PE fund.</p>
<p>The team had spectacular early success. Peak Games, Trendyol, YemekSepeti and GittiGidiyor are the four largest Turkish tech exits to date. Digital East Fund was an investor in all of them. Peak games exited for $1.8 billion in cash to Zynga only last year.</p>
<p>As of Q4 2020, the fund’s metrics are:<br />
Investment Multiple: 24.9x<br />
Gross IRR: 104.4%<br />
Net IRR: 84.1%</p>
<p>So in VC terms, they have done pretty well.</p>
<p>I interviewed Sertoglu to unpack the story of Earlybird Digital East Fund.</p>
<p>He told me DEF has achieved a 17 times investment multiple on a $150 million fund. He thinks “this might be the biggest European VC fund performance in history, and it&#8217;s not coming from Berlin, it&#8217;s not coming from London, but it&#8217;s coming from Eastern Europe. We have been told by some of our LPs that they think we&#8217;re the top 2014 vintage VC fund in the world, nobody&#8217;s seen stronger numbers than this.”</p>
<p>“Peak Games turned out to be a phenomenal story. When you look at how tough it&#8217;s been for Turkey, macroeconomically. The fact that a single company with 100 people essentially sold for $1.8 billion in cash, was just… it was staggering for the local market here.”</p>
<p>DEF’s emergence from Turkey, together with its relationship with a fund in Berlin, was not the most obvious path for the VC fund.</p>
<p>“One thing we realized early one was that we could invest with our own capital and syndicating to our friends, but for follow-on funding, we&#8217;d always have to go global. And that made us feel vulnerable. It made us feel we were always dependent on others’ comprehension of the opportunity that we were facing. So that&#8217;s when the first fund idea came out this was,” said Sertoglu.</p>
<p>“We felt that there was this unusual dislocation between opportunity and capital in Eastern Europe. Our first fund was $150 million funds &#8211; I mean, a very quaint size compared to Western markets. But we became the largest fund in the region, and decided to focus on this series A gap where we felt that there was this big opportunity, because of the way we think series A is still very much a local play.”</p>
<p>“Being a local player that understands the region would be an advantage, so this was proven to be true. We could essentially see pretty much everything in Eastern Europe for the last eight years. And we caught the biggest one, fortunately, which was UiPath. I think very few funds around the world can say that they see the majority if not all of the opportunities that fall into their mandate,” he said.</p>
<p>“We have this dual strategy of backing local champions as well as contenders for global markets as well. 20 years ago you had to be in Silicon Valley. Now, Transferwise comes out of Estonia, UiPath comes out of Romania. And that was even before the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Sertoglu concluded: &#8220;So we now have fresh capital, coming on the heels of a very successful first fund, which we&#8217;re keen to deploy. We&#8217;re calling all the opportunities, seeing very ambitious, strong teams coming out of the region. And we have 200 million euros to focus on these types of opportunities in the region.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">There are over <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/03/the-global-unbanked-shoppers/">1.7 billion underbanked people globally</a>, the majority of which are from emerging markets. For them, accessing loans can be difficult, which is a problem fintechs try to solve. One way they do this is by promoting financial inclusion by underwriting credit via a proprietary algorithm.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One such company is <a href="https://www.fairmoney.ai/">FairMoney</a>, which describes itself as &#8220;the mobile banking revolution for emerging markets.&#8221; FairMoney, founded by <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/laurin-nabuko-hainy-03a5b862">Laurin Hainy</a>, <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/matthieu-gendreau-22661a3a/en-us">Matthieu Gendreau</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasberthozat/">Nicolas Berthozat</a>, is a licensed online lender that provides instant loans and bill payments to underserved consumers in emerging markets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Three years after launching <span style="font-weight: 400;">its mobile lending service in Nigeria</span>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">the company</span><a href="https://fairmoney.ng/fairmoney-now-live-in-india/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> set up shop in India</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Asia&#8217;s second-most populous country in August 2020. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before expanding, FairMoney experienced exponential growth in Nigeria in terms of loans disbursement. La</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st year,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it disbursed a total loan volume of $93 million, representing a 128% increase from 2019 and a staggering 3,189% growth rate from its first year of operation in 2018. As it stands, the company is projecting a $300 million loan disbursement volume by the end of 2021. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve been able to disburse 25-30% more than some of our competitors and I think we&#8217;re a market leader,&#8221; Hainy, the company&#8217;s CEO told TechCrunch. But compared with traditional banks, it was the seventh-largest digital financial services provider in that area.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigerian digital bank Carbon hit $240M in payments processed last year, up 89% from 2019&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nigerian-digital-bank-carbon-hit-240m-in-payments-processed-last-year-up-89-from-2019/embed/#?secret=kxNsgpSU89" data-secret="kxNsgpSU89" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">FairMoney has come a long way since its Nigeria launch in 2017. In its first year of operation, the company had little over 100,000 users. Now, it claims to have 1.3 million unique users who have made over 6.5 million loan applications. <span style="font-weight: 400;">FairMoney offers loans from ₦1,500 ($3.30) to ₦500,000 ($1,110.00) with its longest loan facility standing at 12 months. Annual percentage rates fall within 30% to 260% &#8212; the high APR, Hainy says, is due to higher default rates in Nigeria. That said, FairMoney also claims to have an NPL ratio lower than 10%. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CEO, data-driven insights was behind the choice to expand to India. The Indian market is quite similar to Nigeria&#8217;s. In the Asian country, only 36% of adults have access to credit, leaving an untapped market of about 141 million people microfinance banks do not serve. But unlike Nigeria, India has better unit economics for the lending business and a more friendly regulatory environment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If our ambition is to build the leading mobile bank for emerging markets, we need to start with very large markets,&#8221; Hainy said. &#8220;We tested our products in 10 different markets checking out for things like what the yield economics is like, NPLs, cost of risk, customer acquisition cost, cost of infrastructure and India stood out to us.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following its expansion six months ago, FairMoney claims to have processed more than half a million loan applications from over 100,000 unique users. This number trickles down to 5,000-6,000 loan applications per day with APR standing at 12-36%. Hainy says the company has achieved this with zero ad spend or marketing. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the daunting logistics behind international expansions, it&#8217;s challenging for an African-based startup to expand outside the shores of the continent. Although a rarity, there are a couple of startups to have undertaken such a task. Last year, Nigerian fintech Paga with 15 million users and a network of over 24,000 agents acquired Ethiopian software company Apposit to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/nigerias-paga-acquires-apposit-confirms-mexico-and-ethiopia-expansion/">fast-track its expansion</a> into Ethiopia and Mexico. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FairMoney is on a similar path, as well. And with over 100 staff spread across Nigeria, France, and Latvia, the company hopes to build an engineering and marketing team in India.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, it hired the services of <a href="https://id.linkedin.com/in/rohankhara">Rohan Khara</a> to become its chief product officer (CPO) and facilitate the expansion. Khara was the former head of product for financial services for Indonesian super app Gojek and held senior roles at Microsoft, Quikr and MobiKwik. Hainy says with Khara&#8217;s wealth of experience building consumer products in large emerging markets &#8212; India and Indonesia &#8212; FairMoney is poised for massive growth in Nigeria and India.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We both share the vision that financial services in emerging markets need fixing and for us, Rohan brings the expertise to see FairMoney scale from almost a million users to 10 or 20 million users.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113956" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113956" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2113956 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-France-1024x683-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-France-1024x683-1.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-France-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-France-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-France-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-France-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-France-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2113956" class="wp-caption-text">FairMoney French team</p></div></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born in Germany to a Nigerian father and German mother, Hainy began his entrepreneurial journey in 2015 by launching a food delivery company in Sweden. Seven months later, he founded Le Studio VC, a Paris-based startup studio and €15 million fund he ran as CEO for three years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After those three years, I realised that being an investor wasn&#8217;t for me yet. I felt I was too young and I wanted to build something myself,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neobanks like Revolut in the UK and N26 in Germany were picking up across Europe. Hainy wanted to create such for Nigeria after noticing how much people lacked access to affordable financial services during a visit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite studying other neobank models, Hainy and his team couldn&#8217;t replicate them in a developing market like Nigeria. Credit was still significantly underserved by Nigerian banks because of the strict methodology employed in allocating loans. Sensing an opportunity, they launched FairMoney as a neobank by leveraging a credit-first model. Like Nubank in Brazil, FairMoney started off offering loans to solve the access to credit problem. But its broader vision is not to be just a digital bank but also a commercial bank.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is working towards getting a microfinance bank license to operate as the former in Nigeria. However, according to the CEO, the commercial bank license will take longer maybe five to ten years. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the next five to ten years, I&#8217;d like to think two out of the five largest commercial banks in Nigeria will be neobanks. We want FairMoney to be one of them,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lagos and Paris-based company raised $11 million Series A in 2019. Between now and the time it will get a commercial bank license, Hainy says the company would&#8217;ve raised its Series B round to position itself for that task.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The advance of short videos is reshaping how information is created, disseminated and consumed online. Snappy 15-second videos aren&#8217;t just for entertainment. On Chinese short-video apps Douyin and Kuaishou, people can get their daily dose of news, learn to cook, practice English, hunt for jobs, and seek practically any type of information from the platforms&#8217; quickly expanding content library.</p>
<p>While people are increasingly used to being fed by machine-recommended videos, many users still have the urge and need for active searching. Douyin understood that and incorporated a search function back in mid-2018. More than two years later, the feature reached 550 million monthly active users. There&#8217;s still room for Douyin&#8217;s search feature to grow, as the app last reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/tiktoks-chinese-rival-kuaishou-becomes-a-popular-online-bazaar/">600 million</a> <em>daily</em> users in September, so its monthly user base should be above that.</p>
<p>Kelly Zhang, the young product manager credited for the rise of Douyin, TikTok&#8217;s Chinese version, <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/w/a6930056075249303552/">disclosed</a> Douyin&#8217;s search user figure for the first time this week on her microblogging account. Search is a territory that had long been dominated by Baidu in China. As of December, Baidu&#8217;s flagship app had 544 million monthly active users, so it&#8217;s safe to say as many people are searching on Douyin as on Baidu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zhang&#8217;s remark is telling of Douyin&#8217;s ambition in conquering the online video sector, and eventually how people receive information: &#8220;I have said this before: I hope Douyin could become the video encyclopedia for human civilization. Video search is, therefore, the index of the book, the gateway to finding answers and reaping new knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>She further added that Douyin&#8217;s search engine is hiring for research and development, product, and operational roles in the upcoming year (China has just observed the Lunar New Year) as the video app continues to ramp up investment in search capabilities.</p>
<p>Short video platforms are already the second-most popular method for Chinese users to search online, trailing only after general search engines like Baidu and coming ahead of social networks and e-commerce, data analytics firm Jiguang <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/RUyiG2o7YfSYvJHEMWsCLw">said</a> in a report last December. Baidu&#8217;s command of search is increasingly limited by the walled gardens built up by Chinese tech titans who block one another from free access to its sites and data. The status quo harms user experience but bodes well for vertical search engines on apps like Douyin and Alibaba&#8217;s Taobao marketplace, and consequently revenues from ad sponsorships.</p>
<p>ByteDance cut its teeth on using machine learning algorithms to recommend content through services like Douyin, TikTok and news aggregator Toutiao. The model proved highly efficient and lucrative, prompting its predecessors from Baidu to Tencent to introduce similarly algorithm-powered content feeds. ByteDance&#8217;s move into search, a realm with a longer history, is an intriguing yet natural step. The firm is just completing the puzzle for its digital media empire, giving people another option to find information. Users can receive machine recommendations and subscribe to content creators if they want. They can as well put in a search keyword if they have one in mind, the good old way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite efforts from companies to create equitable environments, it&#8217;s clear that employees of a certain demographics, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/">Black</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/pinterests-22-5m-settlement-highlights-techs-inequities-say-former-employees-who-alleged-discrimination/">women</a>, sometimes have very different experiences from their counterparts. Glassdoor aims to better surface those experiences through a new feature that allows folks to filter ratings by demographics.</p>
<p>Up until now, Glassdoor only presented an overall ranking for a specific company, so there was no way to easily determine if, for example, Black women feel the same as white men, or if Latino men feel similarly to Asian men. In addition to race, Glassdoor now allows people to filter by gender identity, parental or caregiver status, disability, sexual orientation and veteran status.</p>
<p>Overall, Black employees are less satisfied at work in comparison to all employees, <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/black-at-work-employee-satisfaction">according to new preliminary research from Glassdoor</a>. The research is based on the more than 187,000 employees across more than 3,300 companies who have provided demographic data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2114170" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114170" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2114170" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg?w=400" alt="" width="300" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg?resize=88,150 88w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg?resize=177,300 177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg?resize=400,680 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114170" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Glassdoor</p></div></p>
<p>That same research showed Apple had the highest overall company rating among Black employees, with an average rating of 4.2 out of five. Apple&#8217;s overall company rating from that sample size is 3.9.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because these data are so new — having been collected within just the last four months — it’s important to resist the urge to make sweeping claims based on early data,&#8221; Glassdoor Data Scientist Amanda Stansell and Chief Economist Andrew Chamberlain said in the report. &#8220;The averages we’ve reported above are not derived from representative probability samples of company workforces — they represent data shared anonymously by Glassdoor users at this time. Readers should therefore take some caution in making conclusive, company-wide inferences about the state of race and employee satisfaction.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever tried to hop on the bus in San Francisco and were bummed to find that Apple Pay wasn&#8217;t an option (unlike in New York, Beijing, and plenty of other major cities): good news! That&#8217;s changing. Apple has announced that support for Clipper (the payment system for BART, Muni, Caltrain, AC Transit, and a bunch of other Bay Area transit agencies) is officially on the way. You&#8217;ll soon be able to just tap your iPhone or Apple Watch to the card reader and be on your way.</p>
<p>Apple says that Apple Pay will work across all 24 agencies where Clipper is accepted, meaning it should play friendly with:</p>
<ul>
<li>AC Transit</li>
<li>BART</li>
<li>Caltrain</li>
<li>City Coach</li>
<li>County Connection</li>
<li>Dumbarton Express</li>
<li>FAST</li>
<li>Golden Gate Ferry</li>
<li>Golden Gate Transit</li>
<li>Marin Transit</li>
<li>Muni</li>
<li>Petaluma Transit</li>
<li>SamTrans</li>
<li>San Francisco Bay Ferry</li>
<li>Santa Rosa CityBus</li>
<li>SMART</li>
<li>SolTrans</li>
<li>Sonoma County Transit</li>
<li>Tri Delta Transit</li>
<li>Union City Transit</li>
<li>Vine</li>
<li>VTA</li>
<li>WestCAT</li>
<li>Wheels</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple does mention that it&#8217;ll work with the optional &#8220;Express Transit&#8221; feature built into Wallet, allowing you to make these relatively small transit transactions without requiring Face ID or Touch ID verification — a nice touch for when there&#8217;s 10 people waiting to get on behind you and you&#8217;d rather not have to deal with convincing your phone that you are, in fact, you.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So when will it officially roll out? Good question — and one that Apple isn&#8217;t answering yet. In an e-mail announcing the coming Clipper support, they say it&#8217;s &#8220;Coming soon,&#8221; but don&#8217;t get any more specific than that. A tweet from the @BayAreaClipper account, meanwhile, narrows it down to &#8220;this spring&#8221; and reiterates that Google Pay support is coming soon, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As part of the grant-making associated with the U.S. Department of Transportation&#8217;s Infrastructure for Rebuilding America program, the agency will for the first time carve out some of that program&#8217;s $889 million budget for projects addressing climate change and environmental justice.</p>
<p>The projects will be evaluated on whether they were planned as part of a comprehensive strategy to address climate change, or whether they support strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as deploying zero-emission-vehicle infrastructure or encouraging shifts in modes of transportation or vehicle miles traveled, <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOT/bulletins/2c222d8/">the agency said in an announcement</a>.</p>
<p>“As we work to recover and emerge from this devastating pandemic stronger than before, now is the time to make lasting investments in our nation’s infrastructure,” said Secretary Pete Buttigieg, in a statement. “We are committed to not just rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, but building back in a way that positions American communities for success in the future—creating good paying jobs, boosting the economy, ensuring equity, and tackling our climate crisis. The INFRA grant program is a tremendous opportunity to help achieve these goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Racial equity will also be considered, according to the agency&#8217;s announcement. Requirements will include equity-focused community outreach and projects designed to benefit underserved communities, along with projects that are located in opportunity, empowerment or promise zones or choice neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The new programs show just how quickly federal dollars could be made available to startups that are looking at electrification and provide more strength to the tailwinds already propelling the electric vehicle industry &#8212; and its attendant charging networks moving forward.</p>
<p>Large infrastructure projects could receive grants of $25 million or more while small projects must have grant requirements that meet a minimum threshold of at least $5 million, according to the DOT.</p>
<p>Eligible project costs could include: reconstruction, rehabilitation, acquisition of property (including land related to the project and improvements to the land), environmental mitigation, construction contingencies, equipment acquisition and operational improvements directly related to system performance.</p>
<p>Opportunities <a href="http://www.transportation.gov/INFRA">for applications are going to be open through Friday, March 19</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook plays hardball in Australia, Epic Games expands its fight against Apple and New York&#8217;s attorney general sues Amazon. This is your Daily Crunch for February 17, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Facebook cuts off news-sharing in Australia</strong></p>
<p>In response to a proposed law forcing internet platforms to pay news publishers directly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/facebook-restricts-users-in-australia-from-sharing-or-viewing-news-links-in-response-to-proposed-legislation/">Facebook announced today</a> that Australian users will not be able to share or view news links.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In its post, Facebook drew a direct contrast with the other big company targeted by the law, with managing director for Facebook Australia and New Zealand William Easton writing, &#8220;Google Search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content. On the other hand, publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook, as it allows them to sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue.”</p>
<p><strong>The tech giants</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/epic-games-takes-its-apple-app-store-fight-to-europe/">Epic Games takes its Apple App Store fight to Europe</a> — The Fortnite-maker has lodged a complaint with the bloc’s antitrust regulators.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/google-maps-users-can-now-pay-for-parking-or-their-transit-fare-right-from-the-app/">Google Maps users can now pay for parking or their transit fare right from the app</a> — This is part of an expanded partnership with transportation software companies Passport and ParkMobile.</p>
<p><strong>Startups, funding and venture capital</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/locus-robotics-has-raised-a-150m-series-e/">Locus Robotics has raised a $150M Series E</a> — The round values the robotics company at $1 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/spacaex-reportedly-raises-850m-in-new-funding/">SpaceX reportedly raises $850M in new funding</a> — This is a massive round by most standards, but not by SpaceX’s.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.artie.com">Artie</a>, a startup looking to rethink the distribution of mobile games, announced today that it has raised $10 million in funding.</p>
<p>There are some big names backing the company — its latest investors include Zynga founder Mark Pincus, Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman&#8217;s Thirty Five Ventures, Scooter Braun&#8217;s Raised In Space, Shutterstock founder Jon Oringer, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Susquehanna International Group, Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment + The Sixers Lab, Googler Manuel Bronstein and YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley.</p>
<p>This actually represents a pivot from <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/06/vr-veterans-found-artie-augmented-reality-avatar-company/">Artie&#8217;s original vision of creating augmented reality avatars</a>. CEO Ryan Horrigan said that he and his co-founder/CTO Armando Kirwin ended up building distribution technology that they felt solved &#8220;a much bigger problem.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problem, in part, is game developers &#8220;looking for ways outside of Apple&#8217;s App Stores rules and restrictions.&#8221; (That&#8217;s certainly something Fortnite-maker<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/epic-games-takes-its-apple-app-store-fight-to-europe/"> Epic Games seems to be fighting for</a>.) So Artie&#8217;s platform allows users to play mobile games without installing an app, from the browser or wherever links can be shared online.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114445" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114445" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2114445" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg?w=348" alt="Artie Beer Pong" width="348" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg?resize=77,150 77w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg?resize=154,300 154w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg?resize=768,1499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg?resize=348,680 348w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg?resize=787,1536 787w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114445" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Artie</p></div></p>
<p>Artie isn&#8217;t the only startup focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/playco-launch-funding/">the idea of app-less mobile gaming</a>, but Horrigan said that while other companies are limited by JavaScript and HTML5, Artie supports Unity, meaning it can build casual (rather than hyper-casual) games, and eventually games that might even go deeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Similar to cloud games, we’re running Unity games on our cloud, but rather than rendering their graphics on the cloud and pushing the video to players, we&#8217;re not running graphics on the cloud,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re streaming assets and animations that are highly-optimized and rendered in real-time through the embedded web browser.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ud2SD6Iwqu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/epic-games-takes-its-apple-app-store-fight-to-europe/">Epic Games takes its Apple App Store fight to Europe</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Epic Games takes its Apple App Store fight to Europe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/epic-games-takes-its-apple-app-store-fight-to-europe/embed/#?secret=ud2SD6Iwqu" data-secret="ud2SD6Iwqu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In other words, the goal is to get frictionless distribution outside of app stores, while avoiding some of the issues facing cloud gaming, namely <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/cloudmiles">significant infrastructure costs</a> and lag time.</p>
<p>The startup is developing and releasing games of its own, with an Alice in Wonderland game, a beer pong game and more on the schedule for later this year, then a massively multiplayer online game planned for 2022. But the company also plans to release an SDK allowing other developers to distribute through its platform as well.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/VphxhvWSiMc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Horrigan said Artie&#8217;s initial games will be free-to-play, monetized through in-game purchases. They&#8217;ll use cookies to remember where players were in the game, but players will also be able to create logins.</p>
<p>Artie is also developing games with a major music star and a superhero IP-owner, and he argued that by combining no-code/low-code authoring tools with Artie&#8217;s distribution platform, this could become a bigger trend.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be working with the next generation of influencers to make games using these low-code or no-code solutions, then publish to their audiences directly on YouTube,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Imagine what a branded game would look like from your favorite hip hop star. We think that&#8217;s coming, and we think Artie is the platform to make that happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a collector of audio gear (mostly effects pedals, old rim-drive tape machines and 1980s keyboards I’ve modified), I wish I could say my podcasting setup featured equipment that is extremely expensive and hard to come by. I would love to brag about using, say, hand-wired boutique preamps and a rare Soviet condenser microphone I bought at a military auction in Kazakhstan. Nothing would please me more than to share photographs of a massive reel-to-reel tape machine on which I record my ad reads (for “warmth”) before mixing them down on my laptop.</p>
<p>Alas, my podcasting setup is extremely normal. I have a Scarlett two-channel interface I bought at a chain store. I have a Rode microphone because I couldn’t afford a Shure SM7B. I record into GarageBand, which is the spiral-bound notebook of audio interfaces. The only slightly unusual thing about my podcasting setup is that on the rare occasion when I edit an episode I do so in Ableton Live, which I originally bought years ago when I was obsessed with making mashups.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114401" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114401" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2114401" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114401" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> David Rees</p></div></p>
<p>The only analog affectation I can claim is a shameful one: My laptop is so old the USB ports seem to be going slack &#8212; I’m surprised they don’t have hair growing out of them like old men’s ears &#8212; so I have to fix the line from my Scarlett into place using electrical tape.</p>

(My co-host Jon Kimball made enough money on the 2020 election to buy a new car; I made enough to buy a new tremolo pedal.) The only time we’ve done field recordings was last spring, when Jon and I went on a nerd / comedy cruise in the Caribbean the week COVID hit. We recorded daily dispatches at sea using a Zoom H4N, then wandered around Santo Domingo until we found a university library whose Wi-Fi we could use to upload the files to our co-host and editor Starlee. My phone tells me I walked 24,000 steps that day.</p>

<p>Because my podcasting setup is so boring, I have spiced up the photos by including some of my other audio gear in the shots! When the world is ready for cassette-based podcasts saturated in analog delay, I will be more than happy to oblige!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has suspended the Trump 2020 campaign app from the Google Play Store for policy violations, the company confirmed, following <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/17/donald-trumps-official-app-has-been-suspended-from-the-google-play-store-no-longer-works/">a report from Android Police</a> which noted the app was unable to load any content and appeared to have been taken down. Both the Android version of the app and its iOS counterpart have been left online since the November 2020 elections, but hadn&#8217;t received recent updates &#8212; which likely contributed to the app&#8217;s stability issues.</p>
<p>The Play Store version hadn&#8217;t been updated since October 30, 2020, for example, says app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower.</p>
<p>According to Android Police&#8217;s report, the app was hanging and couldn&#8217;t load content, and it reported connectivity issues. We understand the issue was as they described &#8212; when users downloaded the app, it would either hang on the initial loading screen with a spinning &#8220;T&#8221; logo or it would immediately report a server error at startup. In either case, it would never load the app experience at all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Recent user reviews on the Play Store noted these issues, saying things like &#8220;<em>will not open,&#8221; &#8220;the app doesn&#8217;t even work,&#8221; &#8220;absolutely terrible doesn&#8217;t even work,&#8221; &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t open keep saying check connections,&#8221;</em> and more. One user even asked the developer to respond to the numerous complaints, saying <em>&#8220;please reply to people commenting. It&#8217;s not loading.&#8221;</em> Another implied the issues were Google&#8217;s fault, noting <em>&#8220;worked great, until Google canceled it.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Google, though, did not cancel it. The Trump 2020 Android app has actually been experiencing problems for some time before Google took this action.</p>
<p>For example, a tweet from around a month ago described a similar set of issues:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is the Trump2020 app down?<a href="https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TrumpWarRoom</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DanScavino</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/JennaEllisEsq?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JennaEllisEsq</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DonaldJTrumpJr</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/EricTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EricTrump</a> <a href="https://t.co/YGTJrZB66h">pic.twitter.com/YGTJrZB66h</a></p>
<p>&mdash; TexanForTrump. God Bless Trump (@BlueWaterPalms) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlueWaterPalms/status/1351137646207266823?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Google told TechCrunch the app has not been banned from the Play Store, only suspended for its non-functionality. It can be reinstated if the problems are addressed. The company also said it attempted to reach out to the app&#8217;s developer before taking down the app, but never received a response.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Trump 2020 campaign app recently stopped working and we reached out to the developer multiple times in an attempt to get them to address the issue,&#8221; a Google spokesperson said. &#8220;People expect that apps downloaded from Google Play provide a minimum level of functionality and our policy is to remove non-working apps from the store if they are not fixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the issues on Android, we found the iOS version was still able to load upon first launch, and could send confirmation codes to a phone number at sign-up. But when you visited the app&#8217;s main screens, it also now presents an error message. This error doesn&#8217;t affect your ability to browse through the past content on iOS, however.</p>

<p>Sensor Tower tells us the Android version of the Trump 2020 app hadn&#8217;t seen any new installs since February 7, 2021. The firm also noted the Android app had around 840,000 installs compared with close to 1.5 million on iOS.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the Trump 2020 app&#8217;s issues have made headlines.</p>
<p>In the months leading up to last year&#8217;s presidential election in the U.S., a number of TikTok users decided to troll the app in its App Store user reviews. (For some reason, Gen Z users believe a lowly rated app will be automatically removed from the app stores. That&#8217;s not true.) But their efforts at the time were able to bring the app&#8217;s overall star rating down to just 1.2 stars, and eventually forced the Trump 2020 campaign <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/trumps-official-campaign-app-had-to-reset-its-rating-after-being-trolled-by-tiktokers/">to reset the app&#8217;s ratings</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="B2L8cYDJEj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/trumps-official-campaign-app-had-to-reset-its-rating-after-being-trolled-by-tiktokers/">Trump&#8217;s official campaign app had to reset its rating after being trolled by TikTokers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Trump&#8217;s official campaign app had to reset its rating after being trolled by TikTokers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/trumps-official-campaign-app-had-to-reset-its-rating-after-being-trolled-by-tiktokers/embed/#?secret=B2L8cYDJEj" data-secret="B2L8cYDJEj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Though the election is long over, users have still been leaving bad reviews on the app along with their 1-star ratings. Sometimes, the trolls even attempt a bit of humor in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;App attempted a coup to overthrow my phone&#8217;s operating system,&#8221; said one Play Store reviewer. &#8220;I&#8217;ve suffered enough since 2016,&#8221; said another on iOS.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Is there anything specific to SPACs that makes them a better route for edtech companies than a traditional IPO or direct listing?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Special purpose acquisition vehicles regained popularity in 2020 as an alternative way to take startups public, and now they are eyeing edtech companies.</p>
<p>So far, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/spac-churchill-capital-to-merge-with-skillsoft-in-13-billion-deal-2020-10-13">Skillsoft</a> has gone public through Churchill Capital, and Nerdy, parent company of Varsity Tutors, did the same through a reverse merger with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/?tpcc=ECTW2020">TPG Pace Tech Opportunities</a>. On the investor side, Edify and Adit EdTech Acquisition are both separate, $200 million <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/education-spac-edify-acquisition-files-for-a-%24200-million-ipo-2020-12-28">SPACs for education companies. </a></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			SPACs are not being used to prop up companies that can&#8217;t go public through traditional means.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But is there anything specific to SPACs that makes them a better route for edtech companies than a traditional IPO or direct listing? To explore the question, I reached out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlescohn">Chuck Cohn</a>, CEO of Nerdy, which is currently in the process of being SPACed by TPG, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-wolford-37b7915">Susan Wolford</a>, chairperson of Edify Acquisition, a $200 million SPAC for edtech companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/">Nerdy&#8217;s business is growing</a>, but the company doesn&#8217;t expect to be profitable until 2023 and wants to drive revenues up 31% and 43% from its 2020 and 2021 expectations, respectively. Cohn said the balance sheet looks the way it does because they are heavily investing in product and engineering, and focusing on being well-capitalized.</p>
<p>The SPAC, he said, is an opportunity to accelerate Nerdy’s core business: “It’s less about going into the public markets, and more about that this transaction allows us to take an offensive position and lean into the big opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cohn said they pursued a SPAC because it is a faster route to going public. As vaccines roll out, growth in remote learning will slow, which could hurt growth expectations — especially ones as ambitious as Nerdy’s. For that reason, it&#8217;s clear why some edtech companies want to get out to the public markets as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Despite some naysayers, Cohn said SPACs are not being used to prop up companies that can&#8217;t go public through traditional means.</p>
<p>“I think that perception was fair a year ago,” he said. “But if you look at companies that have taken this route recently, including OpenDoor, they are very high quality. There’s a fundamental perception change.” He added that “SPACs have been reaching out over the years,” but the timing felt more fortuitous due to TPG’s interest and track record.</p>
<p>On the other side of the table, Wolford said she is currently searching for an edtech company to bring public on behalf of Edify, a $200 million SPAC she has raised. She noted that PIPE instruments, aka private investments in public entities, have helped de-risk SPACs for the general audience. These instruments have been around for decades, but Wolford said they recently became more mainstream to use in SPACs.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like corporate financial accounting, the power grid never draws headlines when things are going well.

<p>Power grids are going to be in the news more and more in the coming years as global climate change intensifies storm activity and grids come under increasingly harsh strain. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/severe-weather-blackouts-shows-the-grids-biggest-problem-is-infrastructure-not-renewables/">As my colleague Jon Shieber wrote yesterday</a>, “Whether it’s heavily regulated markets like California or a free market like Texas, current policy can’t stop the weather from wreaking havoc and putting people’s lives at risk.” The grid is at the center of one of the toughest challenges facing us this century.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What’s needed are better sensors and tech for identifying the source of outages — and also preventing them in the first place. With millions of power poles and hundreds of thousands of miles of transmission wires scattered across the United States, how can utilities reliably verify the quality of their systems? How can they do that in an efficient way to avoid rate increases on users?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gridware.io/#beta-program">Gridware</a>, which is in the current batch of Y Combinator, is one company taking a shot at this critical need. Its approach is to use a small, sensor-laden box that can be installed to a power pole with just four screws. Gridware’s package contains microphones and other sensors to sense the ambient environment around a power pole, and it uses on-board AI/ML processing to listen for anomalies and report them to the relevant managers as appropriate.</p>
<p>It’s like “a guard standing next to the pole, listening to it, watching over it,” Tim Barat, CEO and co-founder, said, likening the box to a Fitbit for a power pole. When a tree branch breaks and cuts through a line, there’s “no way to detect them unless you are right next to the fault.” With Gridware, it’s “not the right place at the right time but the right place <i>all</i> the time,” he said.</p>
<p>What makes the founding team compelling here is the backgrounds of some of the company’s founders. Barat worked as a power pole worker himself in the field, evaluating equipment and searching for problems. “Every time we go up a pole, we hit it with a hammer, which tells us whether there is termite damage, etc. [ … and] that is still how inspectors investigate a pole,” he noted.</p>
<p>Barat eventually migrated to University of California, Berkeley, where he was mentored by Prabal Dutta, an electrical engineering professor who also joined the company early on as a co-founder. Dutta’s worked has focused on “industrial cyber-physical systems,” and he continues to research industrial control systems through digital interfaces <a href="https://www.icyphy.org">via the iCyPhy center</a>.</p>

<p>Barat also met Abdulrahman Bin Omar, who had worked for a number of years in the energy sector, in a class that eventually had a one-week hiatus due to California wildfires. The two began working together in 2019, joining Berkeley’s startup incubator <a href="https://citrisfoundry.org">Citrus Foundry</a> in 2020. The trio eventually linked up with co-founders Hall Chen and Riley Lyman as well, and <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/2020-10-14%20Agenda_ADA.pdf">snagged a $150,000 state grant</a> from the California Energy Commission <a href="https://calseed.fund">via the CalSEED program</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the startup has seven employees, and it’s currently in talks with utility grids of all sizes about deploying its product. Grids can be <i>very</i> slow to adopt new technology with very long testing and sales cycles, but there might just be an opportunity for the company to accelerate those normal timelines given the extensive and visible power outages we have witnessed the past few years. We need to “transition our grid to face the challenges of the new century,” Barat said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today introduced a suite of updates for its <a href="https://edu.google.com/">online education tools</a> whose adoption and further development have been accelerated by the pandemic, including <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/classroom-roadmap/">Google Classroom</a>, <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/google-meet-safety-and-engagement/">Google Meet</a> and the next generation of G Suite for Education, <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/google-workspace-for-education/">now rebranded as Google Workspace</a> for Education. In total, Google is promising more than 50 new features across its education products, with a focus on meeting educators&#8217; and admins&#8217; needs, in particular, in addition to those of the students.</p>
<p>When Google first introduced Google Classroom, it didn&#8217;t set out to create a Learning Management System (LMS), the company says. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, Google found that many educators had begun to use Classroom as the &#8220;hub&#8221; for their online learning activities. Today, the service is used by over 150 million students, teachers and school admins, up from just 40 million last year.</p>
<p>As a result of the pandemic-prompted adoption and user feedback, Google is introducing a range of new features for Classroom this year, some of which will be made available sooner than others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To better cater to those who are using Classroom as the hub for online learning, a new marketplace of Classroom &#8220;add-ons&#8221; will allow teachers later this year to select their favorite edtech tools and content and assign them directly to students, without requiring extra log-ins. Admins will also be able to install these add-ons for other teachers in their domains.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TCKRxg5cYO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/google-to-roll-out-its-digital-learning-platform-to-23-million-students-and-teachers-in-indias-maharashtra-state/">Google to roll out its digital learning platform to 23 million students and teachers in India&#8217;s Maharashtra state</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google to roll out its digital learning platform to 23 million students and teachers in India&#8217;s Maharashtra state&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/google-to-roll-out-its-digital-learning-platform-to-23-million-students-and-teachers-in-indias-maharashtra-state/embed/#?secret=TCKRxg5cYO" data-secret="TCKRxg5cYO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Also later this year, admins will be able to populate classes in advance with Student Information System (SIS) roster syncing and, for select SIS customers, students&#8217; grades from Classroom will be able to be exported directly to the SIS. Additional logging, including Classroom audit logs (to see things like student removals or who archived a class), as well as Classroom activity logs (to check on adoption and engagement) will be available soon.</p>
<p>When students attend in-person school, teachers can easily notice when a student is falling behind. A new set of Classroom tools aims to do the same for virtual learning, as well. With the new student engagement tracking feature, teachers will be able to see relevant stats about how students are interacting with Classroom, like which students submitted assignments on a given day or commented on a post, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114075" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114075" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114075" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LwG_Student-Engagement-Tracking.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114075" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Other tools will tackle the realities of working from home, where internet connections aren&#8217;t always reliable, or &#8212; for some low-income students &#8212; not available at all. With an updated Classroom Android app, students will be able to start their work offline, review assignments, open Drive attachments and write in Google Docs without an internet connection. The work will sync when a connection is again available. And when students upload assignments by taking a photo, new tools will allow students to combine photos into a single document, crop and rotate images and adjust the lighting.</p>
<p>Classroom will also gain support for rich text formatting &#8212; like bold, italics, underline and adding bullets across web, iOS and Android.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114074" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114074" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114074" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021-GDU-MET-UI-Rich-Text-Editing-in-Google-Classroom-AV-R2.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114074" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Originality reports, which help to detect plagiarism, will be available soon in 15 languages, including English, Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Swedish, French, Italian, Indonesian, Japanese, Finnish, German, Korean, Danish, Malaysian and Hindi.</p>
<p>And Google&#8217;s own free, introductory computer science curriculum, CS First, is immediately available in Classroom.</p>
<p>Beyond Classroom itself, Google Meet is also being updated with the needs of educators in mind.</p>
<p>One must-have new feature, rolling out over the next few weeks, <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/02/mute-all-google-meet-participants-at-once.html">is a &#8220;mute all&#8221; button</a> to give control of the classroom back to teachers. In April, teachers will also be able to control when a student can unmute themselves, as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114077" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114077" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2114077" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LwG_Moderator-Controls-on-Mobile.gif?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114077" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Other moderation controls will roll out this year, too, including controls over who can join meetings, chat or share their screen from their iOS and Android devices. Policies over who can join video calls will be able to be set by admins in April, as well, enabling rules around student-to-student connections across districts, professional development opportunities for teachers, external speakers visiting a class and more. Students will also not be able to join Meets generated from Classroom until their teacher has arrived. Teachers, meanwhile, will be made meeting hosts so multiple teachers can share the load of managing classes.</p>

<p>Google Meet is adding engagement and inclusivity features for students, too. Students will be able to select emoji skin tones to represent them and react in class with emoji, which teachers will be able to control.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114076" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114076" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114076" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LwG_Emoji-Reactions.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114076" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, Google&#8217;s &#8220;G Suite for Education,&#8221; which includes Classroom, Meet, Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides and more, will be rebranded as Google Workspace for Education. The tools themselves, now used by 170 million students and educators globally, won&#8217;t change. But the set will be available in four editions instead of just two to better accommodate a wider variety of needs.</p>
<p>The free version will be rebranded Google Workspace for Education Fundamentals, and will remain largely the same. The paid version, meanwhile, will become available in three tiers: Google Workspace for Education Standard and Google Workspace for Education Plus, as well as the Teaching and Learning Upgrade, which can be added on to Fundamentals or Standard to provide video communication in Google Meet, and other Classroom tools, like originality reports.</p>
<p>Standard has everything in Fundamentals, in addition to enhanced security through Security Center, audit logs and advanced mobile management. Plus has everything in the three other versions, as well as advanced security and analytics, teaching and learning capabilities, and more.</p>
<p>Fundamentals and Plus are available today and the others will go live April 14, 2021. Those who already have G Suite for Enterprise for Education will be upgraded to Education Plus.</p>
<p>Related to these changes, the storage model will be updated to a new, pooled storage option that aims to better allocate storage resources across educational institutions. The new model offers schools and universities a baseline of 100 TB of pooled storage shared by all users, which goes into effect for current customers in July 2022, and will be effective for new customers in 2022. Google says less than 1% of institutions will be impacted by the updated model, whose baseline supports over 100 million documents or 8 million presentations or 400,000 hours of video, to give an idea of size.</p>

<p>The company plans several updates for its Google Workspace for Education product line in the weeks to come, including saved drafts in Google Forms (in Fundamentals) Google Meet meeting transcripts (in the Teaching and Learning Upgrade) and more.</p>
<p>Outside of software product updates, Google is launching over 40 new <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/learning-with-google-chromebook/">Chromebooks</a>, including a set of &#8220;Always Connected&#8221; branded devices that have an LTE connectivity option built in. Chrome&#8217;s screen reader, ChromeVox, has also been improved with new tutorials, the ability to search ChromeVox menus and voice switching that automatically changes the screen reader’s voice based on the language of the text.</p>
<p>Parents, who are now participating in their child&#8217;s online learning in a number of ways, will be able to add their child&#8217;s Google Workspace for Education account to their child&#8217;s personal account with Family Link &#8212; Google&#8217;s parental control software. That means kids can still log into their school apps and accounts, while parents ensure they stay focused on learning by restricting other apps and overall device usage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Chen has a pithy pitch for his new startup <a href="https://www.gettaste.com">Taste</a>: &#8220;We made the Instagram of nice food.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, just as Instagram made it easy for regular smartphone users to look like talented photographers, Taste makes it easy for customers to prepare impressive meals at home.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the real preparation is being done by fine-dining restaurants — Chen told me there are 16 Michelin-starred and Michelin-rated restaurants currently on the platform — whose food doesn&#8217;t translate easily to a delivery or takeout experience. Taste offers &#8220;dinner kits,&#8221; which Chen said are neither standard takeout (where everything has been fully prepared but doesn&#8217;t necessarily travel well) or a regular meal kit (where &#8220;everything is separate and raw&#8221;).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead, he suggested Taste&#8217;s dinner kits are &#8220;this in-between thing&#8221; where the food is mostly, but not entirely, prepared in advance, allowing customers to &#8220;heat and assemble much faster.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114295" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114295" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114295" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Taste screenshot" width="680" height="661" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg 1860w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=150,146 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=300,292 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=768,747 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=680,661 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=1536,1493 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114295" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Taste</p></div></p>
<p>For example, when I tried out Taste last week, my girlfriend and I received three-course meals from <a href="https://www.intersect-nyc.com">Intersect by Lexus</a> and its &#8220;restaurant in residence&#8221; The Grey. A couple of the (delicious) courses and sides had to be heated in the oven or the microwave for five, 10 or 20 minutes, but there was no real prep or cooking required — the real work was cleaning up afterward.</p>
<p>Even the packaging was impressive (if a little overwhelming), with a large, fancy box for each kit, and then individual packages for each course, plus a separate package for spices. There are optional wine pairings, and some restaurants will also provide plating instructions and a Spotify playlist for the meal.</p>
<p>Taste — which is part of the winter 2021 batch of startups at Y Combinator — is currently New York City-only, where it works with restaurants including Dirt Candy, Meadowsweet and the Musket Room. As you might expect, these kits cost more than your standard dinner delivery. Many of them are in the $60-to-$100 per person range, although there are also dinners below $40, as well as a la carte options.</p>
<p>Chen (who sold <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/24/joyride/">his last startup Joyride</a> to Google) said that he and his co-founder Daryl Sew have been excited to help New York City chefs reinvent their offerings for delivery and weather the pandemic.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114300" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114300" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114300" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Taste founders Daryl Sew, Jeff Chen" width="680" height="511" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg 1278w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=768,577 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=680,511 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114300" class="wp-caption-text">Taste founders Daryl Sew and Jeff Chen. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Taste</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We also do a very key thing, which is pre-ordering and batching for the restaurant,&#8221; he added. &#8220;When a restaurant works with Taste, all the orders come in two days before to the restaurant, and we pick it up at designated times, which helps tremendously with capacity lift.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while Taste might seem particularly appealing now, when indoor fine dining options are either illegal, unsafe or transformed by social distancing and mask-wearing, Chen anticipates healthy demand even after the pandemic. After all, he suggested that before COVID-19, there were many people — busy parents, for example, or people who work long hours — who felt like they couldn&#8217;t take advantage of these restaurants as often as they wanted, or at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is getting moved into the home,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Movies are getting moved into the home with Netflix, workouts are getting moved into the home with Peloton and Tonal, and now we’re going to move nice dining experiences into the home.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australian Facebook users will be forced to go elsewhere to read news after the company announced Wednesday that they will be restricting users in the country from sharing or viewing news links on the platform. The drastic move follows the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/">debate on proposed legislation from the Australian government that seeks to push internet platforms</a> &#8212; with a particular focus on advertising giants Facebook and Google &#8212; to pay news publishers directly for access to share their content.</p>
<p>Pulling back entirely was a nuclear option for Facebook, which had previously floated the possibility. In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/">blog post</a>, the company sought to minimize the material impact of the decision to Facebook&#8217;s bottom line, while emphasizing what the move will cost users in Australia and around the globe. The company disclosed that just 4% of the content in Australian users&#8217; feeds was news, though the platform did not break out other engagement metrics tied to news consumption.</p>
<p>In their post, Facebook sought to drive a distinction between how news content was shared on Facebook by users while content is algorithmically curated by Google inside their search product. &#8220;Google Search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content,&#8221; William Easton, Facebook&#8217;s managing director for the region, wrote. &#8220;On the other hand, publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook, as it allows them to sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YwI0ihHGdB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/">Australia now has a template for forcing Facebook and Google to pay for news</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Australia now has a template for forcing Facebook and Google to pay for news&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/embed/#?secret=YwI0ihHGdB" data-secret="YwI0ihHGdB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Google has already begun working with publishers to drive lump sum payments so that they continue to surface news content in the country, striking a deal Wednesday with Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News Corp, despite their own earlier threats to shut down in Australia. Facebook&#8217;s action has ramifications for global users outside Australia who will be unable to share links on the platform to news publications based in the country.</p>
<p>This legislation is an aggressive example of regional legislation having the potential to drive global change for how internet platforms continue to operate. It&#8217;s clear that plenty of other countries are watching this saga play out. Facebook taking a hard line approach while Google seeks to strike private deals to stay active showcases different approaches from very different platforms being forced to reckon with how they operate in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security lapse by a Jamaican government contractor has exposed immigration records and COVID-19 test results for hundreds of thousands of travelers who visited the island over the past year.</p>
<p>The Jamaican government contracted Amber Group to build the <a href="https://jamcovid19.moh.gov.jm/">JamCOVID19 website</a> and app, which the government uses to publish daily coronavirus figures and allows residents to self-report their symptoms. The contractor also built the website to pre-approve travel applications to visit the island during the pandemic, a process that requires travelers to upload a negative COVID-19 test result before they board their flight if they come from high-risk countries, including the United States.</p>
<p>But a cloud storage server storing those uploaded documents was left unprotected and without a password, and was publicly spilling out files onto the open web.</p>
<p>Many of the victims whose information was found on the exposed server are Americans.</p>
<p>The data is now secure after TechCrunch contacted Amber Group&#8217;s chief executive Dushyant Savadia, who did not comment when reached prior to publication.</p>
<p>The storage server, hosted on Amazon Web Services, was set to public. It&#8217;s not known for how long the data was unprotected, but contained more than 70,000 negative COVID-19 lab results, over 425,000 immigration documents authorizing travel to the island — which included the traveler&#8217;s name, date of birth and passport numbers — and over 250,000 quarantine orders dating back to June 2020, when Jamaica reopened its borders to visitors after the pandemic&#8217;s first wave. The server also contained more than 440,000 images of travelers&#8217; signatures.</p>
<p>Two U.S. travelers whose lab results were among the exposed data told TechCrunch that they uploaded their COVID-19 results through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210215095341/https://www.visitjamaica.com/travelauthorization/">the Visit Jamaica website</a> before their travel. Once lab results are processed, travelers receive a travel authorization that they must present before boarding their flight.</p>
<p>Both of these documents, as well as quarantine orders that require visitors to shelter in place and several passports, were on the exposed storage server.</p>
<p>Travelers who are staying outside Jamaica&#8217;s so-called &#8220;resilient corridor,&#8221; a zone that covers a large portion of the island&#8217;s population, are told to install the app built by Amber Group that tracks their location and is tracked by the Ministry of Health to ensure visitors stay within the corridor. The app also requires that travelers record short &#8220;check-in&#8221; videos with a daily code sent by the government, along with their name and any symptoms.</p>
<p>The server exposed more than 1.1 million of those daily updating check-in videos.</p>

<p>The server also contained dozens of daily timestamped spreadsheets named &#8220;PICA,&#8221; likely for the Jamaican passport, immigration and citizenship agency, but these were restricted by access permissions. But the permissions on the storage server were set so that anyone had full control of the files inside, such as allowing them to be downloaded or deleted altogether. (TechCrunch did neither, as doing so would be unlawful.)</p>
<p>Stephen Davidson, a spokesperson for the Jamaican Ministry of Health, did not comment when reached, or say if the government planned to inform travelers of the security lapse.</p>
<p>In a brief statement after we published, the Jamaican government <a href="https://jis.gov.jm/jamcovid-security-protocols-strengthened/">issued a statement</a> confirming the vulnerability.</p>
<p>&#8220;A thorough investigation was immediately initiated to determine if there were any breaches in travelers’ data security, if the vulnerability had been exploited, and if there was a breach of any laws. At present, there is no evidence to suggest that the security vulnerability had been exploited for malicious data extraction prior to it being rectified,&#8221; the statement read.</p>
<p>Savadia founded Amber Group in 2015 and soon launched its vehicle-tracking system, Amber Connect.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20201030/amber-enters-four-more-markets-pandemic-tech">one report</a>, Amber&#8217;s Savadia said the company developed JamCOVID19 &#8220;within three days&#8221; and made it available to the Jamaican government in large part for free. The contractor is billing other countries, including Grenada and the British Virgin Islands, for similar implementations, and is said to be looking for other government customers outside the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Savadia would not say what measures his company put in place to protect the data of paying governments.</p>
<p>Jamaica has recorded at least 19,300 coronavirus cases on the island to date, and more than 370 deaths.</p>
