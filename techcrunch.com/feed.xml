										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thoma Bravo-owned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sophos/">Sophos</a> has announced its second takeover in as many weeks with the acquisition of Seattle-based <a href="http://DevSecOps">DevSecOps</a> startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/refactr-inc">Refactr.</a></p>
<p>Refactr was founded in 2017 and offers an automation platform that helps cybersecurity and DevOps teams to collaboratively operate. The platform, which is used by the non-profit Center for Internet Security and the U.S. Air Force’s Platform One, features a drag-and-drop low-code pipeline builder and DevOps-friendly features that encourage disparate teams to collaborate on the same agile workflow process, according to the company.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to enable DevSecOps to become the modern approach to automation, where cybersecurity use cases like Security Operation, Automation and Response (SOAR), Extended Detection and Response (XDR), compliance, cloud security, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/identity-access-management/">Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) become building blocks for DevSecOps solutions,” said Michael Fraser, CEO and co-founder of Refactr.</p>
<p>The deal, the terms of which were not disclosed, will see Refactr’s entire team of developers and engineers join Sophos. While Sophos says it will continue to develop and offer Refactr’s DevSecOps automation platform to existing customers, it will also embed its SOAR capabilities to its own managed threat response (MTR) and XDR solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Refactr, Sophos will fast track the integration of such advanced SOAR capabilities into our adaptive cybersecurity ecosystem, the basis for our XDR product and MTR service,” said Joe Levy, chief technology officer at Sophos.</p>
<p>Sophos’ acquisition of Refactr lands shortly after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/sophos-acquires-braintrace-to-supercharge-its-threat-detection-capabilities/">announced plans to buy Braintrace</a>, a cybersecurity startup that provides organizations visibility into suspicious network traffic patterns. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/thoma-bravo-completes-3-9b-sophos-acquisition/">Thoma Bravo completed its $3.9 billion takeover of Sophos in 2020</a> as the company continues to increase its reach in the cybersecurity space. Since then, the private equity firm has acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/">security vendor Proofpoint</a> for $12.3 billion and led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/zero-trust-unicorn-illumio-closes-225m-series-f-led-by-thoma-brava/">$225 million funding round in zero-trust unicorn Illumio</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.marvell.com/">Marvell</a> announced this morning it intends to acquire <a href="https://www.innovium.com/">Innovium</a> for $1.1 billion in an all-stock deal. The startup, which raised over $400 million according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/innovium-inc">Crunchbase data</a>, makes networking ethernet switches optimized for the cloud.</p>
<p>Marvell president and CEO Matt Murphy sees Innovium as a complementary piece to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/more-chip-industry-action-as-marvell-is-acquiring-inphi-for-10b/">the $10 billion Inphi acquisition</a> last year, giving the company, which makes copper-based chips, more ways to work across modern cloud data centers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Innovium has established itself as a strong cloud data center merchant switch silicon provider with a proven platform, and we look forward to working with their talented team who have a strong track record in the industry for delivering multiple generations of highly successful products,&#8221; Marvell CEO Matt Murphy said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Innovium founder and CEO Rajiv Khemani, who will remain on as an advisor post-close, told a familiar tale from a startup CEO being acquired, seeing the sale as a way to accelerate more quickly as part of a larger organization than it could on its own. &#8220;As we engaged with Marvell, it became clear that our data center optimized portfolio combined with Marvell’s scale, leading technology platform and complementary portfolio, can accelerate our growth and vision of delivering breakthrough switch silicon for the cloud and edge,&#8221; he wrote <a href="https://www.innovium.com/blog-post/marvell-to-acquire-innovium-for-1-1-billion-on-to-next-phase-of-growth/">in a company blog post</a> announcing the deal.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cwxxQpUZk7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/semiconductors-in-2021/">2021 will be a calmer year for semiconductors and chips (except for Intel)</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;2021 will be a calmer year for semiconductors and chips (except for Intel)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/semiconductors-in-2021/embed/#?secret=cwxxQpUZk7" data-secret="cwxxQpUZk7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2014, raised over $143 million last year on a post money valuation of $1.3 billion, <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/117920-17/company/profile#deal-history">according to Pitchbook data</a>. The question is was this a reasonable deal for the company given that valuation?</p>
<p>No company wants to sell for less than it was last valued by its investors. In some cases, such deals can still be accretive for early backers of the selling concern, but not always. In this case TechCrunch is not privy to all the details of the Innovium cap table and what its later investors may have built into their deals with the company in the form of downside protection; such measures can tilt the value of the sale of company more towards its later and final investors. This is usually managed at the expense of its earlier backers and employees.</p>
<p>Still, the Innovium deal should not be seen as a failure. Building a company that sells for north of $1 billion in equity value is impressive. The deal appears to be slightly smaller in enterprise value terms. In the business world, enterprise value is a useful method of valuing the true cost of an acquisition. In the case of Innovium, a large cash position, what was described as “Innovium cash and exercise proceeds expected at closing of approximately $145 million,” lowered the cost of the transaction to a more modest $955 million in net outlays.</p>
<p>Our general perspective is that the sale is probably not the outcome that Innovium’s backers had hoped for, but that it may still prove lucrative to early workers and early investors, and still works at that lower figure. It’s also notable how in today’s market of mega-rounds and surfeit unicorns, an exit north of the $1 billion mark in equity terms can be viewed as a disappointment in any terms. Innovium is selling for around the price that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/facebook-to-acquire-instagram-for-1-billion/">Facebook paid for Instagram</a> in 2012, a deal that at the time was so large that it dominated technology headlines around the world.</p>
<p>But with so much capital available today, private valuations are soaring and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">mega deals abound</a>. And recent rounds north of $100 million, much like Innovium’s 2020-era, $143 million round, can set companies up with rich valuations and a narrow path in front of them to beat those heightened expectations.</p>
<p>What likely happened? Perhaps Innovium found itself with more cash than opportunities to spend it; perhaps it simply needed a large partner to help it better sell into its market. With expected revenues of $150 million in Marvell’s fiscal 2023, its next fiscal period, Innovium did not fail to reach scale. It may have simply grown well as a private, independent company, and stalled out after its last round.</p>
<p>Regardless, a billion dollar exit is a billion dollar exit. The deal is expected to close by the end of this year. While both company boards have approved the deal, it still must clear regular closing hurdles including approval by Innovium&#8217;s private stock holders.</p>

<p><em><strong>Update 08/03/2021 @ 10:44 AM EST:</strong> The launch attempt has been officially scrubbed for today, and a new timeline for the next attempt is set to be confirmed. We&#8217;ll provide updates as they become available.</em></p>
<p>Boeing is all set to make a second attempt at flying its Starliner CST-100 commercial crew spacecraft to the International Space Station, performing a key demonstration ahead of actually putting astronauts on board for the final big launch before it can claim the spacecraft is certified for regular flight by NASA. Today&#8217;s &#8216;Orbital Flight Test 2&#8217; (OFT-2) mission is a re-do of one that Boeing and NASA first performed in December, 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That first try was meant to be the only one, but it didn&#8217;t go quite as planned, with software errors resulting in a mistaken fire of the craft&#8217;s engines, exhausting the fuel required to get to the Space Station for automated docking as planned. Boeing instead looked to salvage the test with a landing attempt, which also encountered a problem that was corrected before a good touchdown.</p>
<p>While Boeing originally wanted to re-fly the mission sometime last year, the schedule was pushed out for a variety of reasons, and a global pandemic occurring in the interim can&#8217;t have helped. Both Boeing and NASA conducted extensive investigations into not just the cause of the specific problem that the OFT-1 mission encountered, but the culture and processes of Boeing&#8217;s software development as well.</p>
<p>Space industry enthusiasts may already know that Boeing&#8217;s Starliner is one of two commercial spacecraft NASA contracted to ferry its astronauts to the International Space Station, the other being SpaceX. Elon Musk&#8217;s private launch company succeeded with its orbital flight test, and subsequently flew humans aboard its final demonstration launch, and is now a regular service provider for NASA, having carried two groups of astronauts to the ISS for standard tours of duty.</p>
<p>Accordingly, all eyes will be on Boeing to see if it can pull this off cleanly, especially given how much time it&#8217;s had since the last flight to correct any errors and prepare. The launch is set for 1:20 PM ET, with live coverage via the stream above kicking off around 12:30 PM ET.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Draper Esprit, another British venture capital firm, moved from the AIM to the LSE proper, with a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We cover a lot of venture capital news here at TechCrunch. New funds, partner changes, the funding rounds themselves &#8212; the list is long. Lately, we&#8217;ve had to touch on rolling funds, solo GPs and a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/"> faster-than-ever investing cadence</a> that has rewritten the rules of venture investing. Gone are the days when investors can take weeks, let alone months, to get into a hot deal in today&#8217;s turbocharged private markets.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another venture capital trend worth discussing: venture capital firms going public. This July, for example, London-based Forward Partners<a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/discover/news-and-insights/london-stock-exchange-welcomes-forward-partners-aim"> went public on the AIM</a>, a sub-market of the well-known London Stock Exchange. Augmentum Fintech is another example of a<a href="https://augmentum.vc/investors/results-and-analyst-coverage/#announcements"> London-listed venture capital firm</a>. The investing group focuses on European fintech.</p>
<p>Most recently, Draper Esprit, another British venture capital firm,<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/other/draper-esprit-floats-to-become-largest-tech-vc-on-londons-main-market/ar-AAMsV6K"> moved</a> from the AIM to the LSE proper, with a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin. TechCrunch has cited Esprit partners in our explorations of the European venture capital scene in the past, especially<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/late-stage-capital-is-having-a-cascading-effect-on-european-vc-activity/"> in our regular digs</a> through the startup hub&#8217;s numbers.</p>
<p>To understand why Draper Esprit not only decided to stay public but doubled down on its structure by moving to the main boards in London and Dublin, we got on the horn with the firm&#8217;s co-founder,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stuart-chapman-22a10a/"> Stuart Chapman</a>. What follows is an edited and condensed transcript of our call. Coming up, The Exchange has analysis and further interviews about whether the trend of floating venture capital firms may spread, and why other investing groups opted in. But first, highlights from our chat with Chapman.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: We have a bunch of questions about the change in listing, but let&#8217;s start with how long ago you began this transition.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stuart Chapman: </strong>I co-founded Esprit with<a href="https://draperesprit.com/news/thank-you-simon"> Simon Cook</a> back in 2006, and after a 10-year journey of raising conventional funds, we were coming to the point of raising our fourth fund. But we were having frustrating meetings with limited partners who were trying to pigeonhole us, and at the same time, the London market was getting more and more frustrated that private companies were staying private longer and they would not have access to them. I think we were down to ARM as the last true bastion of tech companies on the London Exchange, so we were approached by a group of City funds to raise our fourth fund through a public market listing.</p>
<p>The junior market in London was very helpful for that, and we spent five happy years on AIM, raising money annually &#8212; until we crossed over the billion [sterling] capitalization mark. By then, it was quite obvious that if we want to fulfill the same ambition and growth over the next five years, we were going to need to step up onto a bigger market that was going to give us wider access to funds and [expand our] attraction to a much larger group of people. Part of our mission at Draper Esprit is to democratize venture capital, as Simon would say; and [being listed on the main market] increases that opportunity.</p>
<p>When we started out on the AIM, we raised capital from professional funds&#8217; tech enthusiasts, who were positively biased. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s not very many of them, and once you have exhausted that, then you move down into the more general funds &#8212; maybe funds with an angle on the U.K., funds with an angle on technology. But by their very nature, they tend to be small-cap funds, and there&#8217;s not that many of them in the U.K. So, by stepping up, we enable ourselves to go into more generous funds as well as tech funds [that] have a minimum bar.</p>
<p><strong>And should we now expect to see Draper Esprit raise more capital per annum?</strong></p>
<p>In a perfect world, the answer is no, because realizations equal investments, so you are self-sustaining. The one thing I would say about Draper Esprit is that we are trying to be innovative. It shocks me that venture capital backs some of the most mind-blowing tech advances in our history over the last 70 years using the same legal structure as a 1958 property vehicle in New York. I don&#8217;t get it! Surely, we can reinvent and push ourselves forward as much as we push our entrepreneurs. So long story short, Simon and I never opted to rest. We always wanted to see if we could create the next thing that would help entrepreneurs be more successful.</p>
<p><strong>Talking about innovation in venture capital models, what&#8217;s the main motivation for your use of retail investment platform PrimaryBid? Is it to open the door for more regular folks to invest, or is it a really material way to add capital to Draper Esprit?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the former. If you go back to 2010, we launched our [Enterprise Investment Scheme] product &#8212; in the U.K., the EIS is a tax wrapper, where private individuals can invest into tech businesses and receive 30% tax credit; and then, if it goes well, it&#8217;s tax-free. It&#8217;s a great government initiative. However, whenever a government interferes in a market, it goes to the lowest denominator, and most people in the industry were using it to enable investors to gain tax credit. Whereas we said: That&#8217;s silly; you should use it to enable people to back the best possible businesses, and then the tax credit is just a bonus.</p>
<p>So what we did back in 2010 [was] we enabled X entrepreneurs, X people in the tech ecosystem, to participate in the Draper Esprit EIS program to be part of this democratizing equity. Today, that&#8217;s about £150 million in the EIS vehicle, and about £50 million in the VCT, which is another U.K. tax-related vehicle where you get the same benefits &#8212; so it&#8217;s now over £200 million from small individuals. The idea for us is to extend our ecosystem out into influential people.</p>

<p><strong>How do you feel about having opened the way for other funds to go public?</strong></p>
<p>Personally, and at Draper Esprit, we are big supporters of innovation, so we have helped Mark Boggett at Seraphim [and shared information and] our path. And then Nic Brisbourne &#8230; was an ex-colleague of mine and Simon&#8217;s, so we actually helped Nic, but we also invested in Forward Partners as a way of showing our support to what he was doing through our fund of funds program.</p>
<p>I think where we are very different is where we get confused with the more technology transfer shops. IP Group [for example is] a great model and it&#8217;s got real longevity [and has been] in the market much longer than us. But that&#8217;s not what we do. They’re looking to back computer science from an early stage in universities. And so, yes, we&#8217;re supportive of others following in our footsteps and we will be big fans of having much wider diversity.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you investing in other funds, and does it open up your capital’s geographic footprint? </strong></p>
<p>Two reasons, to be very honest with you. One is consistent with the previous point, which is [that] Europe wins when it has a really strong ecosystem. And, historically, Europe has founded seed funds in a haphazard way. Finland, for example, had 80 programs to raise early-stage capital. Regions were granted seed funds, but they had no follow-on capital.</p>
<p>No one realized that venture capital was an escalator, and unless you could pass the baton to the next person, [startups] have to do it themselves. But if you have to do it yourself, you don’t create an ecosystem.</p>
<p>The first point was how do we build an ecosystem, consistent with how we get more people into venture capital. If you have a solid ecosystem, then you bring in headhunters, you bring in talent, you bring in bankers, lawyers, you bring in advisers, you bring in the geniuses.</p>
<p>The second reason is that venture capital is quite constrained. If you raise a fund, it is very, very rarely permissible to invest it in other funds. Going back to Simon and I and our quest to be innovative, [we asked] well, why can&#8217;t we invest in early-stage funds, and work with them as partners, and [be their] go-to Series A, Series B fund.</p>
<p><em>[<strong>TechCrunch note</strong>: The firm then drew up a 2&#215;2 matrix, with geography on one side, and skillset on the other. Draper Esprit divided the world into niches where it was strong and weak, and geographies where it was strong and weak. Where it was weak twice, it would partner with other funds, perhaps investing in them. This helped ensure ready deal flow.]</em></p>
<p>By partnering, we put ourselves into an area where we could benefit from their talent [and geographic focus], and they benefit from our capital, and it has been a phenomenal success. We are now in about 42 funds across Europe. The first commitment was with £75 [million] and we&#8217;ve just committed a second £75 [million] to the program. So, we’re at £150 million, [making us] one of the largest private commercial investors.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your take on Ireland, and do you see it as more than a gateway to Europe? </strong></p>
<p>The Irish story has a very long heritage. They always used to be our largest shareholder, the Irish government, through the<a href="https://isif.ie"> Ireland Strategic Investment Fund</a>. They might be the second or third largest shareholder that we still have, but there is a very long relationship between Simon and I and the investment group over there.</p>
<p>And Ireland is renowned for great education, whether that be in the south through Trinity and UCD [in Dublin], or whether that be the north through Queen&#8217;s [University Belfast]. So, there&#8217;s been a great education system, great engineering infrastructure. They have greatly benefited from the Facebooks of the world, and the Googles of the world having [offices] in Ireland. That&#8217;s all the positives, and we have two investors in Ireland.</p>
<p>The downside is that it is relatively small. The numbers of Series A and later-stage growth deals that come out of Ireland are still a lot less than other cities. So we are fans of Ireland; the talent there is fantastic, but it’s a part of an ecosystem instead of another London or another Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>Where is Draper Esprit hoping to find the next great startups? Is there a sector or two that you find particularly exciting?</strong></p>
<p>In fintech, we&#8217;re taking an unfashionable approach. You have large incumbents with very outdated systems, but a very loyal and a very high degree of trust customer base. And then you have the regulators in Europe which are very positive towards innovation and incumbents and challengers. I hear my American colleagues are less complimentary about the SEC.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re in an environment where people are being encouraged to challenge the big banks. But they don&#8217;t have trust, and they don&#8217;t have the balance sheet. So, where we are currently attacking &#8212; we genuinely believe that the big guys need to update these legacy systems, and they&#8217;re not going to throw them away. And so, the only way you can update is you have to take off slivers of your book, of your market, and update it bit by bit. These projects are, if not tens, hundreds of millions [of pounds]. [It’s a] lucrative customer base that needs to adopt technology.</p>
<p><strong>But updating that old tech would likely require fintech startups?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s our strategy. The reason why I say it is not fashionable is because it doesn&#8217;t touch the consumer. It&#8217;s quite dull, and [it has] very long sales cycles. When you look at the genius within the teams that we&#8217;re backing, it&#8217;s that very in-depth [knowledge] where the sector views them as experts, the sector views and as the go-to people. So it&#8217;s a very high barrier to entry, which is why I think Europe does very well compared to [the U.S.] in this area because to actually try and attack those European startups from an overseas perspective is quite difficult.</p>
<p><em>More to come shortly; stay tuned.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three-and-half months after launching <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-brings-touch-id-to-the-magic-keyboard/">the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID</a>, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/mac/accessories">is finally breaking it out from its iMac bundle</a>. The accessory is now available as a standalone through Apple Stores and the company’s site.</p>
<p>There are two versions: the standard and a longer model with a numeric keypad (pretty much what the company offers with all of its Magic Keyboards), running $149 and $179, respectively. There’s also a $99 version that keeps the new rounded, compact design, but drops the Touch ID in favor of a key that locks the system. But where’s the fun in that?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184950" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184950" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2184950" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="183" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png 3674w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=150,27 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=300,54 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=768,138 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=680,122 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=1536,275 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=2048,367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=50,9 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184950" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of the models have keys devoted to Spotlight, Dictation, Do Not Disturb and Emoji (I ended up disabling the latter on mine, because I couldn’t avoid accidental presses <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />).</p>
<p>An important caveat in all of this: Touch ID only works on Macs running the M1 chip, which disqualifies a pretty massive chunk of the Macs currently on the market. If you do own one of those fancy new systems, the feature can be used for secure logins, purchases and the like. The limitation appears to be a result of Touch ID&#8217;s use of the Secure Enclave found on Apple&#8217;s new chip.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184951" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184951" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2184951" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="478" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png 3967w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png?resize=300,140 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png?resize=768,358 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png?resize=680,317 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png?resize=1536,717 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png?resize=2048,956 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicMouse2.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184951" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The keyboard includes a woven USB-C to Lightning cable, though Touch ID also works when the keyboard is connected wirelessly via Bluetooth. Also new are redesigned versions of the Magic Mouse and Trackpad, running $79 and $129 each.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After months of testing with upwards of 100,000 beta testers, Citizen today is launching its premium Protect offering for all users. The subscription service runs $20 a month and opens up a number of features on the app.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Chief among the new paid features is a “Get Agent” button, which offers access to a Citizen operator for a number of different scenarios. The company says it exists for instances where a user “may not want to be seen calling 911.” </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Whether that’s a matter of personal safety or other issues around calling the police no doubt depends on both the user and situation. The agents effectively work as a conduit to emergency operators.</span></p>
<p>For many, Citizen&#8217;s various controversies have overshadowed its features in recent years. Initially after its launch as &#8220;Vigilante,&#8221; the app made news earlier this year for launching a private <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7evbx/citizen-app-private-security-leaked-emails">&#8220;personal rapid response service&#8221;</a> fleet of vehicles and a<a href="https://twitter.com/cerisecastle/status/1393797781056225280"> reward for a person wrongly accused</a> of starting a Los Angeles wildfire.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our Protect Agents are highly trained safety experts who are equipped to help in a variety of stressful or uncertain situations,” the company write about the new service. “They personalize your experience to your situation. They can escalate to 911, provide first responders with your precise location, alert your designated emergency contacts, navigate you to a safe location or simply stay connected with you and monitor you until you feel safe again.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="h3rVoIwpm1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/banned-crime-reporting-app-vigilante-returns-as-citizen-says-its-report-incident-feature-will-be-pulled/">Banned crime reporting app Vigilante returns as Citizen, says its &#8216;report incident&#8217; feature will be pulled</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Banned crime reporting app Vigilante returns as Citizen, says its &#8216;report incident&#8217; feature will be pulled&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/banned-crime-reporting-app-vigilante-returns-as-citizen-says-its-report-incident-feature-will-be-pulled/embed/#?secret=h3rVoIwpm1" data-secret="h3rVoIwpm1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The other key feature here is a new Protect Mode, which again, offers quick access to the aforementioned agent. When enabled in a questionable situation, the app will live monitor the user’s audio feed, using AI to detect for things like screams, offering up a connection to the agent. If you don’t respond, it will auto connect you. Users can also shake the phone twice to access the agent directly.</p>
<p>A recent<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90639153/citizen-public-safety-surveillance"> job listing notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this role, you will be communicating with users who are in need of assistance in potentially unsafe conditions. You will be responsible for guiding difficult conversations and using your best judgement in determining the severity of these situations in real-time. You will be at the frontlines of helping users who feel unsafe in their surroundings and offer direct assistance and escalation to 911.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a potentially useful service for those looking for a panic button app of sorts &#8212; akin to an offering like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/match-group-invests-in-noonlight-to-power-new-safety-features-in-tinder-and-other-dating-apps/">Noonlight</a>. But the question remains whether Citizen is the service best positioned to provide such an offering, given the red flags in its history.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Launched in 2016, the app was initially</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/controversial-crime-reporting-app-vigilante-banned-from-app-store/"> banned from the App Store</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> over concerns about vigilantism (perhaps not a stretch, given its original name/positioning). As it has expanded beyond New York, the rebranded app has continued to raise flags on a national level.</span></p>
<p>Earlier this year, its crime-spotting crowdsourcing was expanded to include branded vehicles, which patrolled Los Angeles. &#8220;The broad master plan was to create a privatized secondary emergency response network,&#8221; a source <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7evbx/citizen-app-private-security-leaked-emails">told Motherboard</a> at the time. The company later added that it had no plans to extend the service after its initial pilot.</p>
<p>That same month, the service’s CEO offered a $30,000 reward for someone suspected of starting a Los Angeles wildfire. The service later apologized for sending out a photo of the wrong person that raked in more than 800,000 views. &#8220;We deeply regret our mistake and are working to improve our internal processes to prevent this from happening again,” the company <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/21/citizen-app-reward-falsely-accused/">wrote in a statement</a>.</p>
<p>Citizen is currently available in 20 U.S. cities. The new Protect Mode service launches today for iOS. An Android version is in the works.</p>

We’ve written about the company’s wireless charging a few times over the years, including the “FreePower” technology it has baked into Nomad’s charging pads, which brings a more streamlined version of the Apple’s abandoned AirPower.

<p>“This new round of funding is a game changer when it comes to accelerating our capacity for innovation,” co-founder and CEO Jake Slatnick said in a release. “With so many partnerships in our pipeline, a 2.0 version of FreePower on the horizon, and Jawad having just joined our board, this is an inflection point for Aira.”</p>

<p>As we noted late last year, Aira has already made some headway in automotive. Late last year, it announced funding from auto parts supply giant Motherson, which is also part of this round. The deal was a pretty clear indication that the firm was pushing into integrating its wireless modules into cars &#8212; a welcome addition, as many automakers have traditionally lacked consumer electronics-friendly amenities.</p>
<p>Neither party announced any specific car partners at the time &#8212; or now, for that matter. But Aira notes that it and Motherson are teaming up to create automotive-grade FreePower modules.</p>

<p>“Current wireless charging technology is not built for moving environments, leaving consumers and automakers underwhelmed,” Aira says in a release issued today. “In-car charging surfaces with FreePower, on the other hand, are able to support devices shifting around while driving, multi-device charging, surfaces of any size, and firmware updates for future enhancements and compatibility. They can also deliver high-power charging while maintaining stringent safety and regulatory standards.”</p>
<p>The news also sees Axon  CFO Jawad Ashan joining Aria’s board of directors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Constance Freedman and Liza Benson have built up a network of more than 700 executives across the real estate, finance, insurance and home services industries.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since 2015, Constance Freedman, founder and managing partner of <a href="https://www.moderneventures.com/">Moderne Ventures</a>, and partner Liza Benson have built up a network of more than 700 executives across the real estate, finance, insurance and home services industries.</p>
<p>Today, their early-stage venture capital firm buttoned up an oversubscribed second fund, raising $200 million this time, to infuse capital into startups in and around those industries. Moderne’s newest fund includes new and returning high-profile strategic partners like AvalonBay Communities, Camden Property Trust, Greystar, JBG SMITH, Leading Real Estate Companies of the World, funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management and Realogy. The Chicago-based firm now has $350 million in assets under management.</p>
<p>Freedman’s background is in real estate, technology and venture, spending three years in sales and leasing before the “dot-com” days. After getting her MBA at Harvard, she turned toward investing, launching a fund in 2008 that focused on information and media, as well as working with the National Association of Realtors, which wanted to invest in real estate tech. That $20 million fund became the predecessor fund to Moderne Ventures and where a lot of what the firm does now came from, Freedman told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, a big part of their strategy is looking at companies outside and bringing them in, Freedman said.</p>
<p>“Industries like real estate are cyclical, so you don’t want to be beholden to one industry,” she added. “If a company has that as its beachhead, but can expand into other industries, the bigger the market and bigger the returns for investors. We will also have a stronger fund as a result.”</p>
<p>Moderne Ventures writes first checks of between $4 million and $7 million, and its sweet spot is companies with revenue of $2 million to $10 million. Most of its investments are late seed to early Series B.</p>
<p>To date, the firm has investments in more than 100 companies, including five unicorns, three IPOs and dozens of accretive financing events in the past year, Freedman said. Notable investments in the portfolio include ICON, Porch, Better Mortgage, Hippo Insurance, Homesnap (acquired by Costar), MotoRefi, Super, EasyKnock and Kaiyo. For its new fund, Moderne Ventures has invested in seven companies so far.</p>
<p>In addition to its fund, Moderne runs an industry immersion program called the Moderne Passport, to connect startups with that network of over 700 industry executives and corporate partners that can benefit from their services.</p>
<p>The program includes about 80 companies, and Freedman said Moderne will “make meaningful investments in about a third of them.” There is a class open right now, and the firm will have another one in seven to 10 months.</p>
<p>The firm offers a hands-on approach aimed at affecting a company’s growth, including go-to-market strategy. Moderne facilitates over 1,000 meetings between companies and its network each year, often turning into pilot programs.</p>
<p>Speaking about the ton of artificial intelligence technology applications within its core focus industries, Freedman said more than $30 million is spent on marketing to people who aren’t real buyers, but are just looking. Rather, Moderne Ventures is using AI and data analytics to help companies market to the right people.</p>
<p>“We create a lower or no-cost way for partners to try before they buy to remove the sales friction,” she added. “In return, companies get exposure opportunities that they can’t buy to accelerate their growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/04/22/world-bank-predicts-sharpest-decline-of-remittances-in-recent-history">World Bank</a>, it is more expensive to send money to sub-Saharan Africa than to any region in the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is also the most expensive region to send money from. In Q1 2020, people spent an average of 8.9% to send money to the region, much higher than the global average of 6.8%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s much talk around sending money from Africa to the West, which has led to many startups using traditional (fiat) and nontraditional (crypto) means to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cross-border payments between the two corridors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there&#8217;s little noise about the corridors between Africa and other regions like Latin America or Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Asia, for instance, has the lowest average remittance costs across all regions at 4.95% (these percentages </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are reported</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a standard $200 transfer); therefore, it makes sense to tap into the opportunities the market presents. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://wapipay.com/">Wapi Pay</a>, a Kenyan startup with offices in China and Singapore, is carrying out this play and has carved a market for itself by facilitating payments between both extreme remittance worlds of Africa and Asia.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2019 by brothers <a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/mwaura-ndichu-paul-71060445">Paul Ndichu</a> and <a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/eddie-ndichu-%E4%B8%87%C2%A0-wan-7191a519">Eddie Ndichu</a>, Wapi Pay </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">provides a payments gateway for African businesses to receive and send money from Asia via mobile money platforms and bank accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the focus on remittance has been the flow of money into Africa for sustenance. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, digitizing has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around delivery rather than building new infrastructure and payment processing models for African individuals and businesses to make</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cross-border payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial institutions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with traditional systems and correspondence models to offer service to their customers. These transactions are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inherently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complex in nature, given their compliance requirements. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of new infrastructure or processes make them further opaque, longer to process and far too expensive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto remittance startups claim to solve this problem, but no one has successfully scaled to effective usage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We started Wapi Pay having seen how fragmented the payment infrastructure is and how horrifying the experience and expense of making or receiving a payment to and from Asia,&#8221; Paul Ndichu told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We spent some time in Asia, given the growing trade relationship between the two corridors [Africa and Asia], and saw the growing need to make this more efficient, faster and cheaper, evolving from remittances to global payments. These transactions are already complex in nature; how do we make them as simple and easy as mobile money?&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Q1 2021, Africa-China trade jumped 27%, to $52.1 billion compared, with 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the economic recovery from the pandemic, African merchants still find it expensive to send and receive money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In some cases, these costs can be as high as 20%, especially in Southern African regions. The wait time can also be ridiculous, with some spending up to a week before payment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is processed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Wapi Pay says it can process payments within a day and charges as low as 3%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wapi Pay bypasses traditional payment networks, optimizing efficiency and cost for our customers. Users choose the delivery channels they want, such as bank to bank, wallet to wallet, bank to wallet and wallet to bank options to transfer funds as well as make merchant payments, with settlement done within 24 hours,” said CEO Eddie in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Wapi Pay works with local banks and platforms in China, Indonesia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. The company claims to be growing at 396% year-on-year since 2019 and has hopes to continue in that fashion. By the end of next year, Wapi Pay wants to process $500 million in remittances and increase the number of African merchants and Asian suppliers to half a million and 100,000, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $2.2 million pre-seed investment announced today will be vital to meeting those targets to scale up global payments and remittances between Africa and Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round is one of the largest of its kind in East Africa and the continent. The venture firms that took part include China-based fund MSA Capital, known to have invested in unicorns Meituan, Nubank and Klarna; Pan-African and Africa-focused firms EchoVC, Kepple Africa and Future Hub; and Pan-Asian firms Transsion Holdings and Gobi Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wapi Pay will use the investments to engage regulators for licensing across Africa and for scale, product and geographical expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These funds will help Wapi Pay diversify our products range and drive growth so that we can evolve remittances into real-time global cross-border payments, starting with Africa and Asia. All while minimising the cost of transactions, it needs to be as easy as sending M-PESA,” Eddie added.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Africa to Asia is a large trading corridor overlooked and underserved by tech today. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wapi Pay is the best team to build the necessary infrastructure to support its growing trade volumes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to support them with our extensive China fintech network and playbook,” <a href="https://cn.linkedin.com/in/timothychen">Tim Chen</a>, vice president at MSA Capital, said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.rapyd.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rapyd</a> &#8212; which provides a range of financial services like payments, mobile wallets, money transfers, card issuing, fraud protection and more, all by way of an API for third parties to integrate quickly into their own services &#8212; has raised $300 million, a Series E that TechCrunch understands from reliable sources values the company at $8.75 billion.</p>
<p>The company has been on a fast pace of growth in the last year, spurred in no small part by the global shift to carrying out life and business online in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapyd&#8217;s total payment volume is on target to pass $20 billion this year, a four-fold increase on 2020&#8217;s volume of $5 billion.

<p>Rapyd&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Arik Shtilman said in an interview that the plan will be to use part of the investment for acquisitions, and part for R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Rapyd has been starting the M&amp;A march in earnest already this year, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rapyd-to-acquire-valitor-expanding-access-to-global-payments-for-its-european-customers-301324467.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring payments and card issuing company Valitor</a> in July for $100 million to expand deeper into Europe, and starting an investment arm called Rapyd Ventures. Acquisitions will likely be to continue getting deeper into its current markets.</p>
<p>On the R&amp;D front, the company already has some 900 different services that cover 100 countries within its API. I&#8217;ve likened Rapyd&#8217;s approach in the past to being akin to a &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Swiss Army knife&#8221; of services, and Shtilman says that these roughly fall into several distinct categories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;At the end of the day there are five things on planet earth for financial services, whether you are a bank or a mom-and-pop shop: payment collection, money dispersing, funds storage, card issuing and foreign exchange. From these you can build endless capabilities,&#8221; he said. One priority now, he added, will be to focus on expanding its technology related to identity management and fraud to complement what it already does. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Know your customer [KYC] and compliance tools will help us bring on more customers even faster,&#8221; Shtilman said.</span></p>
<p>The timing of this latest round is a big deal for Rapyd. For starters, it&#8217;s coming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rapyd-raises-300m-on-a-2-5b-valuation-to-boost-its-fintech-as-a-service-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just seven months</a> after Rapyd announced <em>another</em> $300 million round, its Series D (that round actually closed in November, I&#8217;ve found out). Notably, that last round was at a $2.5 billion valuation, and while the company is not disclosing its funding, Shtilman told me that revenues have grown 3.5 times since then. A source very close to the company told me that the valuation was, simply, the multiple of those two figures: $8.75 billion.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rapyd raises $300M on a $2.5B valuation to boost its fintech-as-a-service API&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rapyd-raises-300m-on-a-2-5b-valuation-to-boost-its-fintech-as-a-service-api/embed/#?secret=f0tejT8tS7" data-secret="f0tejT8tS7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Secondly, it&#8217;s important in the context of the wider market and where Rapyd fits into it.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re currently seeing a huge profusion of companies tapping into the potential of so-called embedded finance &#8212; financial services that are built and operated by one party and integrated by APIs into another party&#8217;s service &#8212; to build new products, ranging from neobanks around the world, to e-commerce companies building checkout services, or companies only tangentially in the business of commerce who are now launching products to improve customer engagement or make their first moves into the space.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s meant a lot of competition for Rapyd, with some other big players including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/fast-raises-102m-as-the-online-checkout-wars-continue-to-attract-huge-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fast</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/checkout-com-raises-450-million-and-reaches-15-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Checkout</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mambu-raises-135m-at-a-2b-valuation-for-an-saas-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mambu</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/railsbank-raises-70m-to-build-out-its-fintech-as-a-service-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Railsbank</a>, all of which have also raised huge rounds.</p>
<p>In other words, not only is this round a sign of Rapyd&#8217;s own growth, but a signal to the market of how it is positioning itself and faring in what is shaping up to be an interesting and competitive field.</p>
<p>Rapyd &#8212; which is now based in Silicon Valley but has its R&amp;D and CEO based in Tel Aviv &#8212; was one of the earlier players in this space, and Shtilman likes to recall how, when he first started the company, he was met with a lot of skepticism from others in the financial services community, not just because the idea sounded too hard to execute but because they saw financial infrastructure as essentially the crown jewels of most financial services companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started in 2016 everyone thought we were crazy because the concept was too big and too wide,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then, like mushrooms after the rain, everyone saw it. Everyone understands now that the future of fintech is fintech infrastructure. Like cloud computing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, it&#8217;s taken a little while, but these days most acknowledge that the basics of these services are, yes, super hard to build, but essentially work the same for everyone, so they can be built once, and then packaged and turned into something you can tap by way of cloud services, and thus turned into commodities that you can spend your resources, time, and strategy to personalize.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="369yRSQvzT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/maybe-neobanks-will-break-even-after-all/">Maybe neobanks will break even after all</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Maybe neobanks will break even after all&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/maybe-neobanks-will-break-even-after-all/embed/#?secret=369yRSQvzT" data-secret="369yRSQvzT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the crown jewels are, in fact, your customers. And therefore, building transactional services that either complement what you already do as a business, or augment it in an interesting and useful enough way, is how you end up deepening your engagement with them, and commitment from them.</p>
<p>The fact that this is something that might apply to just about any business online today means that the opportunities are vast as well, one reason investors are so keen to be in this market. (And that goes for more than just Rapyd, as it&#8217;s big enough not to be a winner-takes-all market.)</p>
<p>“Rapyd has built a borderless embedded fintech infrastructure critical to all digital businesses that operate globally. Their platform incorporates payments, compliance, FX, fraud management, escrow, virtual account and card issuing, and more. But now, as the world sees growing traction across global eCommerce, Gig Economy, Fintech Solutions and Technology platforms, Rapyd must take the next step,&#8221; said Mike Lobanov, General Partner at Target Global, in a statement. &#8220;There is currently an unprecedented need for a single partner serving as a bridge between a vast array of local payment services and merchants, providing them access to the flexible, fast-to-integrate, and scalable solutions they need to thrive. Having led Rapyd&#8217;s Series A in 2018, we are confident that Rapyd can be such a partner, and are now renewing our bet in this round.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In “Macbeth,” Shakespeare described sleep as the “chief nourisher in life’s feast.” But like his titular character, many adults aren’t sleeping well. <a href="https://reverylab.com/">Revery</a> wants to help with an app that combines cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia with mobile gaming concepts.</p>
<p>Founded in March 2021, Revery is currently in beta stealth mode and plans to launch its app in the United States later this year. The company announced today it has raised $2 million led by Sequoia Capital India’s Surge program. Participants included GGV Capital, Pascal Capital, zVentures (Razer’s corporate venture arm) and angel investors like MyFitnessPal co-founder Albert Lee; gaming entrepreneur Juha Paananen; CRED founder Kunal Shah; Mobile Premier League founder Sai Srinivas; Carolin Krenzer; and Josh Lee.</p>
<p>Lee, a mutual friend, first introduced Revery’s founders, Tammie Siew and Khoa Tran, to one another. Before launching the startup, Siew worked at Sequoia Capital India, Boston Consulting Group and CRED, while Tran was a former product manager at Google.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Revery plans to focus on other mental health issues in the future, but it’s starting with sleep because “it has such a strong correlation with mental health and we’re leveraging protocols, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, that’s robust and have been tried and tested for 30 years,” Siew told TechCrunch. “That is the first indication, but the goal is to build multiple games for other wellness indications as well.”</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sleep-aids-market-worth-114-15-billion-by-2025-exclusive-report-by-infinium-global-research-301060012.html">study by research firm Infinium</a> found that about 30% to 45% of adults in the world experience insomnia, a problem <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210121-the-coronasomnia-phenomenon-keeping-us-from-getting-sleep">exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. Chronic lack of sleep is <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/happens-body-dont-get-enough-sleep/">linked to a host of health issues</a>, including high blood pressure, strokes, depression and lowered immunity.</p>
<p>For Revery’s team, which also includes former Zynga and King lead game designer Kriti Sawa and software engineer Stephanie Wong, their focus on sleep is personal.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184876" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery-Team-30Jul21.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184876" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2184876" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery-Team-30Jul21.png?w=680" alt="A Zoom screenshot of startup Revery's team" width="450" height="341" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery-Team-30Jul21.png 1946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery-Team-30Jul21.png?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery-Team-30Jul21.png?resize=300,227 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery-Team-30Jul21.png?resize=768,582 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery-Team-30Jul21.png?resize=680,515 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery-Team-30Jul21.png?resize=1536,1164 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery-Team-30Jul21.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2184876" class="wp-caption-text">Revery&#8217;s team on a Zoom call</p></div></p>
<p>“Everyone on our team has a deeply personal connection to the mission, because everyone on our team has experienced, or had a family member or friends go through challenges in mental health,” said Siew. “They’ve seen how late intervention creates consequences that could have been avoided if they had gotten help earlier.”</p>
<p>When Tran was 15, he was diagnosed with hypertension and several other health conditions that needed medication. It wasn’t until he was 26 that Tran found out that sleep apnea was at the root of his medical issues. After getting surgery, Tran’s blood pressure became normal and many of his other conditions also improved.</p>
<p>“When I finally got treatment for my sleep disorder, only then did I realize the impact of sleep on mental health,” Tran said. “For me, I was really lucky that a doctor caught my sleep disorder and super lucky to have the time and resources to get treatment. For many people, it’s incredibly inaccessible.”</p>
<p>Revery&#8217;s medical advisory team includes the doctor who performed Tran&#8217;s surgery, Stanford Sleep Surgery Fellowship director Dr. Stanley Liu; Stanford professor and behavioral sleep medicine expert Dr. Fiona Barwick; and Dr. Ryan Kelly, a clinical psychologist <a href="https://variety.com/2019/gaming/features/clinical-psychologists-see-positive-potential-in-video-games-as-therapy-1203175911/">who researches how video games can be used in therapy</a>.</p>

<p>When people think of sleeping apps, ones that focus on meditation (Calm and Headspace, for example) or soothing noises usually come to mind. The Revery team isn’t sharing a lot of details about its app before launch, but says it draws from casual mobile games, which are designed to get people to return for short play sessions over a long period of time. The goal is to use gamification to make CBT practices interactive and fun, so it becomes part of users’ daily routines.</p>
<p>“That’s the same kind of gameplay that Zynga and King have used, which is why Kriti’s experience is super helpful,” said Siew. Casual games revolve around rewarding people for small actions, and for Revery app, that means positive reinforcement for habits that contribute to better sleep. For example, it will reward people for putting down their phones.</p>
<p>“I think a lot of people have the misconception that solving sleep is only at the time you fall asleep. They don’t realize that sleep is impacted by what you do throughout the day,” Siew said. “A big part is also what are your thoughts, behavior and the other things that you do, so in order to effectively and sustainably improve sleep, we also have to change your thoughts and behaviors outside of the time you’re trying to fall asleep.”</p>
<p>In a statement, GGV Capital managing director Jenny Lee said, “We are excited about the growing mental wellness market, and believe that Revery’s unique mobile game-based approach has the opportunity to create immense impact. We are happy to back such a mission-driven team in this space.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Inequalities between women and men in the workplace have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic and are likely to persist in the near future, according to the <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---gender/documents/publication/wcms_814499.pdf">International Labour Organization</a> (ILO). The World Economic Forum estimates globally it will take 267.6 years to close the gender gap in economic participation and opportunity.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s even more crucial that the global gender and ethnicity pay gap be &#8216;squared away&#8217; by entrepreneurs passionate about the issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gapsquare.com/">Gapsquare</a>, a UK startup that&#8217;s been addressing this issue since 2017, has been among a handful of startups addressing these concerns via machine learning around the issue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its analytics software, which analyses and tracks pay disparity, pay equality and pay gap data, has now been acquired by <a href="https://www.xperthr.co.uk/">XpertHR</a>, a part of RELX, for an undisclosed sum. TechCrunch understands from sources that Gapsquare never raised institutional venture funding.</p>
<p>The Gapsquare platform &#8211; along with co-founders Dr. Zara Nanu and Ion Suruceanu &#8211; will be joining the XpertHR team. Gapsquare previously counted Vodafone, Condé Nast, and Serco as clients, amounting to data from tens of thousands of employees.</p>
<p>Gapsquare’s model is to provide HR and Reward professionals with actionable insights about their company’s existing pay gaps.</p>
<p>Through its &#8216;FairPay Pro&#8217; platform, Gapsquare says it can identify variables for employee demographics such as gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disability, identifying the causes of pay gaps, and proposing and tracking remedial actions.</p>
<p>In a statement, Nanu said: “We know for many businesses transparency around compensation fairness and pay reporting is high on the agenda. Gartner research indicates that over 80% of businesses globally are driven to take action around pay equity and pay gaps as the workforce is changing and younger generations entering the workforce are increasingly interested in transparency, sustainability, and equality. By joining forces, XpertHR and Gapsquare are better equipped to support our customers’ evolving needs and those of the businesses around the globe.”</p>
<p>Scott Walker, Managing Director XpertHR, said: “I am excited to bring Gapsquare into the XpertHR family. Our mission is a simple one: to create purposeful workplaces for every person in every organization. Both businesses are dedicated to improving the experiences of millions of working professionals around the globe. By combining Gapsquare’s advanced technology with XpertHR’s expertise in reward data, we can better equip employers to build a world where work is inclusive, where pay meets value and diverse talent thrives.”</p>
<p>The child and grandchild of teachers, Nanu was inspired to look more deeply into the issue of the gender pay gap after working with a female trafficking prevention program in Moldova, a small country in Central Europe. She realized women were being thrown into sweatshops and paid a minimum wage, thus trapped in poverty.</p>
<p>After growing up in Chișinău, the capital of Moldova, she relocated to Bristol, UK, and started Gapsquare. Nanu has previously talked about how Soviet attitudes to gender equality &#8211; where the Communist system dictated that men and women should be equally treated &#8211; made her realize that Western practices had actually become retrograde by comparison.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Guardian in 2018 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2018/nov/28/can-software-bring-womens-pay-up-to-mens-this-tech-entrepreneur-thinks-so">she said</a>: “We had quotas around women in parliament, quotas around the representation of women in any sector. Childcare was free, so my mum could go back to work six months after giving birth. When I came to the UK [in 2007] it felt like, to some extent, I was going back in time in terms of gender equality.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, the background to the Gapsquare story is reflective of the environment Nanu operated in. Raising venture capital to highlight gender disparity in a male-dominated corporate and venture environment was a tough gig. Perhaps one of the toughest. It&#8217;s a testament to Nanu&#8217;s persistence that she bootstrapped, got this far, and exited with her team. But it&#8217;s also an indictment of the VC industry. We haven&#8217;t seen the last of this entrepreneur.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Infra.Market, an Indian startup that is helping construction and real estate companies in the world’s second-most populated nation procure materials and handle logistics for their projects, said on Tuesday it has secured its third financing round in the past nine months.</p>
<p>Tiger Global, which led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/infra-market-becomes-newest-indian-unicorn-with-100-million-fundraise/">the startup’s Series C round in February</a> this year, has led the $125 million Series D financing round in the five-year-old startup. The new round valued Mumbai-headquartered Infra.Market at $2.5 billion (post-money), up from $1 billion in February and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/infra-market-raises-20-million-for-its-b2b-marketplace-in-india/">$200 million in December last year</a>. The startup, which counts Nexus, Foundamental, and Accel Partners among its investors, has raised about $275 million to date.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to double-down on our investment in Infra.Market. The team has demonstrated exceptional growth and continues to disrupt the construction materials industry. Over the past year, Infra.Market has become the go-to partner, especially during the pandemic when the traditional supply chains were disrupted,” said Scott Shleifer, Partner, Tiger Global Management, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Infra.Market, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/zetwerk-raises-120-million-to-scale-its-b2b-marketplace-for-manufacturing-parts/">competes with Lightspeed-backed Zetwerk</a>, helps small businesses such as manufacturers of paints and cements improve the quality of their production and meet various compliances.</p>
<p>The startup adds its load cells to the manufacturing facilities of these small businesses to ensure there is no lapse in quality, and also helps them work with other businesses that can provide them with better raw material and provide guidance on pricing. It also works closely with businesses to ensure that their deliveries are made on time.</p>
<p>These improvements, explained co-founder Souvik Sengupta, help small manufacturers land larger clients that have higher expectations from the businesses with which they engage. He said the startup has helped small manufacturers reach customers outside of India as well. Some of its clients are in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore and Dubai.</p>
<p>“We continue to build on our vision of creating India’s largest multi-product construction materials brand and transform the construction materials supply chain, not only in India, but also globally,” he said.</p>
<p>“We are also embarking on new business verticals within the construction ecosystem beyond materials to enable us to provide end to end solutions to our customers across the lifecycle of a construction project. We are seeing huge growth in buyer wallet share as we are rapidly expanding our product portfolio and market presence and the launch of new verticals will help us fulfill our vision of creating a technology backed end to end construction solutions company.”</p>
<p>The startup, which said it expects to surpass $1 billion in sales by the end of this calendar year, plans to deploy the fresh fund to expand to new markets and also expand into new categories. It&#8217;s also looking to acquire younger firms, the startup said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The myriad challenges faced by farmers in Africa &#8212; inadequate financing, education and input distribution &#8212; persist and greatly affect the agricultural output on the continent. But startups are providing innovative solutions to these problems, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Africa&#8217;s <a href="https://www.khula.co.za/">Khula</a> is an example. The startup, launched in 2018, is finding its niche in the ever-growing industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it announced a $1.3 million seed round to scale operations across the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the surface, it would seem agritech in Africa hasn&#8217;t taken off as exponentially as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other tech-operated industries. But it has: The agritech sector grew 44% year-on-year between 2016 and 2019, and the continent has the highest number of agritech services in the developing world, reaching more than 33 million smallholder farmers, according to a <a href="http://farmersreviewafrica.com/africa-to-become-a-global-hub-for-agritech/">report</a> from Farmers Review Africa. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/karidas-tshintsholo-0301bb78">Karidas Tshintsholo</a>, <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/matthew-piper">Matthew Piper</a> and <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/jackson-dyora-169362189">Jackson Dyora</a> founded Khula three years ago. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khula provides small-scale and commercial size farmers with software and a marketplace to grow their business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this description doesn&#8217;t do justice to the painstaking problem Khula is solving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Khula, Tshintsholo and Piper were school and business partners. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They worked on consulting gigs after dropping out of college a year before graduation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But while it allowed them to meet with clients in various disciplines, the consulting business wasn&#8217;t exhilarating enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We always wanted something to do something more impactful, something more meaningful, something that could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> change the way that the world works,&#8221;  Tshintsholo told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As time went on, agritech seemed like the path to take due to both founders&#8217; experiences</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa is home to 60% of the world&#8217;s arable land. <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-xm/2021/06/15/africa-is-set-to-become-a-global-hub-for-agritech/">Research</a> also shows agritech in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is projected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach a value of $1 trillion by 2030. But a trip to Israel made Piper wonder why the country &#8212; although half of its land is considered a desert &#8212; had more agricultural produce than African countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It didn&#8217;t make sense that we have more land than any other continent,&#8221; Tshintsholo said. &#8220;And pretty much everyone on the continent is a farmer and we&#8217;re buying food more than we were selling. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wondered how that was possible, considering how big of competitive advantage agriculture is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further research and spending time with farmers exposed another problem: how intermediaries ripped off farmers in the country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agricultural industry in South Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to favor industrial agriculture. And like most parts of Africa, smallholder farmers have it rough as they face a plethora of challenges, from marketing and selling to transportation of their goods and produce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, farmers take their produce to a large warehouse where big aggregators pick up the produce and sell it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem here is that most products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are sold</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on consignment, which means there are no guarantees farmers will make a sale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goods, mostly perishable, are also bound to experience drops in price, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd there&#8217;s a huge lack of transparency, allowing middlemen to rip off farmers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the penny dropped for us was when we started playing detective. We followed these farmers and noticed what big companies listed on the stock exchange did: Go to these physical markets, pick up the produce and then sell to the formal market. They&#8217;d pick it up for R3.50 and sell it for R11.00. They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">literally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> added nothing to the value chain other than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> picking it up and dropping it off.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, farmers could sell their produce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a processor who subsequently sells it to a supermarket at a much higher price. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supermarket also makes a profit by selling to individual consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So what a farmer sold for R3.50 ($0.24) might end up at R30 ($2.07) in an individual consumer&#8217;s hands. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s not all; farmers must also pay commissions to these middlemen and municipalities they operate in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This was when we knew that this was a struggle, and this was the problem we wanted to address,&#8221; Tshintsholo said. &#8220;But then, in addressing that problem, we didn&#8217;t go live </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Agriculture can be very complex. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we have now is something that we call the Khula ecosystem, and this is because the industry is very interconnected.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khula wants to tackle all these issues at once and provide farmers with liquidity, access and a market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The platform is an ecosystem made with three products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Inputs App allows farmers to access approved agricultural inputs and services from local and international suppliers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second is the Fresh Produce Marketplace, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">targeted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at farmers with challenges cited earlier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It allows farmers to sell produce </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to local and international formal bulk buyers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By allowing farmers to engage and negotiate prices with suppliers, the platform aims to reduce the access middlemen have that has led to the exploitation of farmers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the Funder Dashboard connects institutional investors with farmers who meet their funding mandates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The reason we&#8217;ve gone with this ecosystem approach is that it&#8217;s more of a sticky business model,&#8221; Tshintsholo said. &#8220;So we want to allow farmers to use our ecosystem to buy the products they need and get the services they need.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khula has seen reasonable traction since launching. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has signed up more than 3,000 farmers, and over 100 suppliers now work with the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This year, the startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2021/06/21/15-startups-selected-for-6th-google-for-startups-accelerator-africa/">accepted</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the Google for Startups Accelerator Class 6 alongside 14 other African companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announcing this investment, it closed the round last year. It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.aeciworld.com/"> AECI</a>, one of the continent&#8217;s biggest agrochemical companies. South African impact investor E Squared Investments also participated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the financial firepower Khula receives from its lead investor, it will also get access to AECI&#8217;s wide distribution network to scale its inputs app. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 132 depots across the country, Khula says it can deliver products in every province, in every major agriculture region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tshintsholo says AECI is the kind of investor Khula hopes to have as it progresses: a long-term partner interested in execution and not quarterly updates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We did not want an investor at the table who was only going to ask us how we’d performed in a specific quarter. We wanted a long-term partner that would execute with us. A partner with a great reputation in the industry and an incredible distribution network, a partner whose long-term success </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was tied</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a business model like ours. And AECI fits that description </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">perfectly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Khula has very attractive fundamentals, a sizable addressable market, app development capabilities, key agri-business networks and a management team that wishes to work with AECI as their preferred agri-input and technical advisory partner,&#8221; Quintin Cross, the managing director of AECI Plant Health, said in a statement. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.creoate.com/">Creoate</a> is a startup, which lets independent retailers buy sustainable products from brands and wholesalers, has raised a $5m Seed round led by Fuel Ventures with participation from Vinted founder, Justas Janauskas. </p>
<p>Its competitors include traditional wholesalers who’ve supplied independent retailers for decades, and other startups such as Faire (US, raised $696M) and Ankorstore (FR, raised €115M). </p>
<p>Founders Ashley Horn and Fahad Khan say the company aims at helping independent businesses and &#8220;reclaims the supply chain from global giants&#8221;. Khan says ‘Mom and Pop’  are “faced with poor information, discriminatory pricing and unpredictable cash flows.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Creoate, which doesn’t own inventory, says it helps retailers forecast which products will sell well so that they can buy and manage inventory levels more easily. It says its cataloging software allows retailers to deal with fewer middlemen.</p>
<p>Launched in January 2020 the platform now claims 25,000 retailers across the UK, France, and Netherlands.</p>
<p>Creoate co-founder Horn said: “Sourcing brands as an independent retailer is close to impossible… We could see that this system was not sustainable and there had to be a better way”. </p>
<p>Mark Pearson, founder and managing partner at Fuel Ventures said: “Unless you’re in the world of retail, it can be difficult to truly grasp just how broken the system is for the 2.5 million retailers and 30 million emerging brands that Creoate serves. We are captivated by Creoate’s technology which is inspired by the founding team’s real-world experience and empathy.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Monday, August 2, 2021. What a day. Square kicked off this week’s news cycle with a megadeal, Google popped up with new hardware, and there are new VC funds aplenty. It’s busy, but before we get started, there’s a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/hear-startup-alley-companies-pitch-expert-vc-judges-on-the-next-episode-of-extra-crunch-live/">special summer edition of Extra Crunch Live this week that’s 100% pitch-off</a>. It’s on Wednesday, so be there or be square. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/google-is-building-its-own-chip-for-the-pixel-6/"><strong>Google pursues custom silicon:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Alphabet’s Google subsidiary is getting into the custom silicon game, TechCrunch reports. Akin to what Apple did with its A and M chips, Google hopes that its Tensor SoC (system on a chip) “will differentiate itself in a crowded smartphone field,” Brian Heater writes. For more on Google’s new hardware, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/google-gives-the-world-its-first-glimpse-of-the-pixel-6/">head here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/"><strong>Square buys Afterpay:</strong></a> U.S. fintech giant Square is buying the Australian buy now, pay later company Afterpay for $29 billion in stock. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/">dug into the deal’s numbers</a>, but the gist is that Afterpay brings merchants, global users and a new fintech product to Square. The deal isn’t cheap, but it does make sense.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/cloud-infrastructure-market-kept-growing-in-q2-reaching-42b/"><strong>Cloud infra spend accelerates:</strong></a> Want to know why investors are so hot and bothered by the tech industry these days? In part because demand just keeps accelerating. TechCrunch covered new data today indicating that the cloud infra market &#8212; which underpins so very many services that consumers and corporates depend on alike &#8212; saw spending grow 39% in Q2 2021 compared to the year-ago quarter. The total for the second quarter? $42 billion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/reese-witherspoons-hello-sunshine-sold-to-new-media-firm-from-former-disney-execs/"><strong>Reese Witherspoon’s media company sells for $900M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>This is not our usual startup fare, but when a media company sells for nearly $1 billion, we have to pay attention. Per TechCrunch, the company, Hello Sunshine, made content for major streaming firms. What’s weird is who bought it. A “yet-unnamed new media firm run by former Disney execs,” TechCrunch writes. Mysterious.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/the-next-generation-of-global-payments-afterpay-square/"><strong>Afterpay investor bullish on Afterpay:</strong></a><strong> </strong>TechCrunch published an op-ed by Dana Stalder, an investor at Matrix Partners and self-described “only institutional venture investor” in Afterpay. Their take? That Square + Afterpay will be greater as a sum than the mere addition of their parts. We’ll see.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/singapore-based-nektar-ai-gets-6m-to-help-b2b-sales-team-collaborate-more-effectively/"><strong>Nektar.ai wants to consolidate B2B sales data:</strong></a> Selling software is no easy game, and there are myriad tools that every SDR and AE is expected to use. Nektar wants to be the central collection point <em>and</em> brain for all that data, and it just raised $6 million to grow its operation. Frankly, the salesops market is big, and I am surprised we don’t hear about even more companies pursuing similar lines of work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/yaydoo-secures-20m-aims-to-simplify-b2b-collections-payments/"><strong>Investors back startups making B2B payments simpler:</strong></a> Sticking to the B2B world, Yadoo has raised a $20 million round to power business-to-business payments. In short, while Venmoing your friend beer money is as easy as drinking said beer, it’s not the same with corporations. Yadoo is one of the startups looking to take the problem on, in this case from the startup’s Mexico City HQ.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, some venture capital news:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/element-ventures-pulls-in-130m-to-double-down-on-the-fintech-enterprise-trend/"><strong>Element Ventures raises $130M:</strong></a> It’s a sign of the times that I am not at all surprised that a B2B-focused fintech venture capital firm just raised nine figures. Of <em>course</em> that’s a big enough problem space to deploy that amount of capital. And of <em>course</em> there are enough startups that fit its parameters to fill its book with deals. Element will invest in 15 companies each year, focusing on deals in Europe, the U.S. and Asia.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/singapore-based-nektar-ai-gets-6m-to-help-b2b-sales-team-collaborate-more-effectively/"><strong>More money for</strong><strong> LatAm:</strong></a> Newtopia is a new fund focused on Latin America that just put together a fresh $50 million fund. It will invest in pre-seed companies ($100,000 checks) and larger rounds ($250,000 to $1 million) in startups scaling toward their Series A. Early-stage investing is its own beast, so it’s nice that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/?tpcc=ECTW2020">the burgeoning Latin American market</a> is getting its own dedicated vehicles to tackle the task.</li>
<li>From the podcast today, if you are into edtech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/the-tale-of-two-edtech-ipos/">boy do we have the show for you</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Demand Curve: Questions you need to answer in your paid search ads</h2>
<p>At some point, almost every early-stage startup will use paid search ads to connect with customers and throw down the gauntlet with their competitors.</p>
<p>Most of these initial attempts at paid search are unsuccessful. There&#8217;s a steep learning curve when it comes to transforming passive searchers into paying customers, and almost no one gets it right the first time.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive guest post, growth marketing expert Stewart Hillhouse identified &#8220;14 questions your paid search should answer to ensure you&#8217;re only paying for the highest-intent shoppers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Question 1? “What’s in it for <strong>me</strong>?”</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/zoom-reaches-85m-settlement-in-zoombombing-lawsuit/"><strong>Zoombombing costs Zoom $85M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today’s immaterial technology fine comes via Zoom, the video product that became ubiquitous during the pandemic. It was sued by users claiming that it was “violating users’ privacy by sharing their data with third parties without permission and enabling ‘Zoombombing’ incidents,” per TechCrunch. The settlement is worth a total of 0.07% of the company’s $112 billion market cap. Oh no.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/"><strong>Amazon will pay you $10 for your palm print:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Speaking of sums of money so small that they should not induce any sort of behavioral changes, Amazon wants to give people $10 in credit if they give the company their palm print so that they can better check out at the e-commerce giant’s physical stores. Hard pass on this one.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/salesforce-steps-into-rpa-buying-servicetrace-and-teaming-it-with-mulesoft/"><strong>Salesforce buys Mulesoft an RPA firm:</strong></a> CRM giant Salesforce is investing in Mulesoft, a company that it bought a ways back, in the form of German RPA company Servicetrace. Servicetrace will link up with Mulesoft, not Salesforce proper.</li>
<li><strong>I asked TechCrunch reporter and genial human </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller"><strong>Ron Miller</strong></a><strong> why the deal matters</strong>. He said that the deal, “while not on par with the Slack megadeal, is probably the kind of smaller deals the company will make in the next year.” He explained that the Servicetrace acquisition gives SFDC an “entry into the growing RPA market without spending a ton of money.” Ron’s also bullish on the planned Mulesoft integration.</li>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">One of the big reasons you’re giving 110% of your talent and effort to your private company is because you’re hoping to eventually cash in on all those vested incentive stock options (ISOs) that have been sitting in some account, waiting for the day your company goes public.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with that. Who doesn’t dream of reaping an options windfall and using it to retire early, buy a house, pay off their college loans, travel around the world or become a full-time philanthropist?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to figuring out how to cash in their stock awards, most employees are on their own.</p>
<p>Their employers can’t always provide the answers they need &#8212; especially when the questions relate to personal finances. Most companies admit they need to be better at explaining how ISOs work in general, but they can’t legally work one-on-one with employees to help them exercise and sell shares the right way.</p>

		<blockquote>
			Most companies admit they need to be better at explaining how ISOs work in general, but they can’t legally work one-on-one with employees to help them exercise and sell shares the right way.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That’s why, when the time is right, many employees actively look for help from a qualified fiduciary financial adviser who can walk these could-be “options millionaires” through various cash-in scenarios.</p>
<p>Here’s a real-life example (using a pseudonym).</p>
<p>Kurt is a 50-year-old VP of product management at a healthcare startup that just went public. Over his three years with the company, Kurt had amassed 350,000 ISOs worth approximately $6 million. Unlike many options millionaires, he didn’t intend to cash in everything and retire early. He planned to stay with the firm but wanted to liquidate enough ISOs to pay for a vacation home and add greater diversification to his investment portfolio. This presented significant tax risks that Kurt wasn&#8217;t aware of.</p>
<p>If Kurt exercised his ISOs and sold the shares before a year had passed, his profits would be characterized as short-term capital gains, which are taxed as ordinary income.</p>
<p>To illustrate the potential tax implications of this action, we created a hypothetical scenario that showed if Kurt exercised all of his ISOs and sold the shares immediately, he would incur approximately $6 million in ordinary income, which would push him into the top tax bracket and put him on the hook for almost $3 million in combined federal and state taxes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/bringing-more-reliable-context-to-conversations-on-twitter">announced</a> today it&#8217;s partnering with news organizations The Associated Press (AP) and Reuters to expand its efforts focused on highlighting reliable news and information on its platform. Through the new agreements, Twitter&#8217;s Curation team will be able to leverage the expertise of the partnered organizations to add more context to the news and trends that circulate across Twitter, as well as aid with the company&#8217;s use of public service announcements during high-visibility events, misinformation labels and more.</p>
<p>Currently, the Curation team works to add additional information to content that includes Top Trends and other news on Twitter&#8217;s Explore tab. The team is also involved with how certain search results are ranked, to ensure that content from high-quality searches appear at the top of search results when certain keywords or hashtags are searched for on Twitter.</p>
<p>The team may also be involved with the prompts that appear in the Explore tab on the Home Timeline related to major events, like public health emergencies (such as the pandemic) or other events, like elections. And they may help with the misinformation labels that appear on tweets that are allowed to remain visible on Twitter, but are labeled with informative context from authoritative sources. These include tweets that violate Twitter&#8217;s rules around <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/manipulated-media">manipulated media</a>, <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/election-integrity-policy">election integrity</a>, or <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/medical-misinformation-policy">COVID-19</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, the team operates separately from Twitter&#8217;s Trust and Safety team, which determines when tweets violate Twitter&#8217;s guidelines and punitive action, like removal or bans, must be taken, Twitter confirmed that neither the AP nor Reuters will be involved in those sorts of enforcement decisions.</p>

<p>By working more directly with AP and Reuters, who also partner with Facebook on fact checks, Twitter says it will be able to increase the speed and scale to which it&#8217;s able to add this additional information to tweets and elsewhere on its platform. In particular, that means in times where news is breaking and when facts are in dispute as a story emerges, Twitter&#8217;s own team will be able to quickly turn to these more trusted sources to improve how contextual information is added to the conversations taking place on Twitter.</p>
<p>This could also be useful in stopping misinformation from going viral, instead of waiting until after the fact to correct misleading tweets.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s new crowdsourced fact-checking system <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/twitter-is-building-birdwatch-a-system-to-fight-misinformation-by-adding-more-context-to-tweets/">Birdwatch</a> will also leverage feedback from AP and Reuters to help determine the quality of information shared by Birdwatch participants.</p>
<p>The work will see the Curation team working with the news organizations not just to add context to stories and conversations, but also to help identify which stories need context added, Twitter told us. This added context could appear in many different places on Twitter, including on tweets, search, in Explore, and in curated selections, called Twitter Moments.</p>
<p>Twitter has often struggled with handling misinformation on its platform due its real-time nature and use by high-profile figures, who attempt to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/trump-tweet-steal-election-vote-by-mail/">manipulate the truth</a> for their own ends. To date, it has experimented with many features to slow or stop the spread of misinformation from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/twitter-retweet-changes-quote-tweet-election-misinformation/">disabling one-click retweets</a>, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/twitter-5g-coronavirus-labels/">adding</a> fact checks, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/twitter-bans-james-okeefe-of-project-veritas-over-fake-account-policy/">banning</a> accounts, and more. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/twitter-starts-rolling-out-birdwatch-fact-checks-inside-tweets/">Birdwatch is the latest effort</a> to add context to tweets, but the system is a decentralized attempt at handling misinformation &#8212; not one that relies on trusted partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;AP has a long history of working closely with Twitter, along with other platforms, to expand the reach of factual journalism,&#8221; noted Tom Januszewski, vice president of Global Business Development at AP, in a statement about the new agreement. &#8220;This work is core to our mission. We are particularly excited about leveraging AP’s scale and speed to add context to online conversations, which can benefit from easy access to the facts,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust, accuracy and impartiality are at the heart of what Reuters does every day, providing billions of people with the information they need to make smart decisions,&#8221; added Hazel Baker, the head of UGC Newsgathering at Reuters. &#8220;Those values also drive our commitment to stopping the spread of misinformation. We&#8217;re excited to partner with Twitter to leverage our deep global and local expertise to serve the public conversation with reliable information,&#8221; Baker said.</p>
<p>Initially, the collaborations will focus on English-language content on Twitter, but the company says it expects the work to grow over time to support more languages and timezones. We&#8217;re told that, during this initial phase, Twitter will evaluate new opportunities to onboard collaborators that can support additional languages.</p>

<p>If you’re trying to develop fluency in a non-native tongue, language immersion is a crucial part of the learning process. Surrounding yourself with native speakers helps with pronunciation, context building, and most of all, confidence.</p>
<p>But what if you’re an eight-year-old kid in Spain learning English and can’t swing a solo trip to the United States for the summer?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.novakidschool.com/">Novakid</a>, founded by Maxim Azarov, wants to be your next best option. The San Francisco-based edtech startup offers virtual-only, English language immersion for kids between the ages of four through 12, by combining a mix of different services from live tutors to gamification.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/novakids-esl-app-for-children-raises-4-25m-series-a-led-by-portfolio-and-learnstart-investors/">After closing its $4.25 million Series A</a> round last December, Novakid announced today that it is back with a $35 million Series B financing, led by Owl Ventures and Goodwater Capital. Existing investors also participated in the round, including PortfoLion, LearnStart, TMT Investments, Xploration Capital, LETA Capital and BonAngels.</p>
<p>The startup is raising capital in response to an active start to its year. The company’s active client base grew 350% year over year, currently at over 50,000 paying students. The money will be used to get more students into its universe of tools, as well as help Novakid expand into international markets with high populations of speakers who want to learn English.</p>
<p>The company’s suite of services are built around two principles: First, that it can immerse early-age learners into the world of English at scale, and second, that it can actually be fun to use.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Novakid&#8217;s ESL app for children raises $4.25M Series A led by PortfoLion and LearnStart investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/novakids-esl-app-for-children-raises-4-25m-series-a-led-by-portfolio-and-learnstart-investors/embed/#?secret=qRWEU5CA3O" data-secret="qRWEU5CA3O" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When a user signs up, they are first connected to one of Novakid’s 2,000 live tutors for their first class. Tutors must be native English speakers with a B.A. degree or higher, as well as an international teaching certificate such as DELTA, CELTA, TESOL or TEFL.</p>
<p>“One of the things that is really important, even psychologically, is to start listening to the language, start interacting with a live person, and remove being afraid of not understanding something,” Azarov said. The company wants to recreate the conditions of how a kid likely learned their first language.</p>
<p>In the class, the tutors only speak English, and users are encouraged to do the same to slowly build and mistake their way into confidence. While the live, video-based classes are a key part of Novakid’s product, Azarov said it was important that his company “was not just giving you access to a teacher” as its main value proposition.</p>
<p>“Most of the competitors are taking teachers and making them available remotely so you don&#8217;t have to travel and you have a bigger selection,” he said. But if you look at the industry in the bigger picture, guys like Oxford, Cambridge, Pearson who provide content for the language learning industry, their product basically sucks. It’s really bad.” So, Novakid puts most of its energy into rebuilding a curriculum that works with better design, and includes games.</p>
<p>Gamified content lives both in and out of classes. Within the classroom, a teacher may take a student on a VR-enhanced tour through famous landmarks and museums to practice vocabulary. Self-paced content could look like a multiplayer “battle” between two students answering questions within a certain time period to get a better score. Novakid has an entire team dedicated to game design and development.</p>
<p>Students are clicking in. Novakid users spend two-thirds of their time on the website with tutors, and one-third with self-paced content that the company built in-house. The company wants to switch those concentrations because more students are spending time with the asynchronous content around grammar and vocabulary, and teachers are reserved for more complex information like speaking and conversation.</p>
<p>Part of the difficulty of scaling up a language learning business is that users need to stay motivated. Gamification helps with engagement, but Novakid’s clientele of children could also be fast to churn compared to adult learners, simply due to priorities. Azarov said that he sees how some would view selling exclusively to children as a disadvantage, but he views their focus as differentiation.</p>
<p>“You get better brand equity when you’re more focused,” he said. “The way kids learn language is vastly different from the way adults learn language, and I don’t think the general players who do ‘everything from everybody’ will be able to do [the former] as well as we are.” Duolingo recently launched <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/abc">Duolingo ABC</a>, a free English literacy app with hundreds of short-form exercises. While the now-public company has strong branding, Novakid&#8217;s strategy differs by adding in more services around live learning and speaking.</p>
<p>So far, the company has proven that its strategy is sticking. Its revenue in 2020 was $9 million, and in 2021 it is expected to hit between $36 million to $45 million in revenue. It declined to disclose the specifics around diversity of the team, but plans to kick off a quite intensive recruiting spree going forward. Azarov plans to add 200 people to his 300-person company in the next six months.</p>
