										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Book sales during the pandemic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/25/bookshops-defy-pandemic-to-record-highest-sales-for-eight-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went up</a>, and it seems the <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-reading-habits-have-changed-during-the-covid-19-lockdown-146894" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amount we are reading did, too</a>. And <a href="https://www.inkitt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inkitt</a>, the startup that operates a free, popular platform of the same name for anyone to write and publish stories &#8212; stories that Inkitt then analyses using data science to determine which of them to take to the next level to produce longer works for its separate paid app, Galatea &#8212; has raised $59 million in funding that could help it capitalize on this moment. Valuation with the Series B is not being disclosed, but from what I understand from a reliable source, it is in the region of $390 million.</p>
<p>The funding will be used by Berlin-based Inkitt to continue building out its algorithms and technology, hire more people in particular to expand further into the North American market, and to work on how it might extend the platform in the longer term. That could involve more formats beyond reading (it&#8217;s now taking early steps into audio, for example), and it could also involve building APIs and SDKs so that other parties, such as other publishers, might be able to use its tools to also test out shorter works to see what might work as books.</p>
<p>Inkitt has been on a growth tear in the last couple of years &#8212; the company now has 7 million users (AKA readers) and a community of 300,000 writers, up nearly threefold on the 1.6 million readers and 110,000 writers it had when I covered its last funding round in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/28/inkitt-raises-16m-led-by-kleiner-perkins-to-publish-crowdsourced-novels-in-mini-episodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a>.</p>
<p>The startup has also been catching the eye of others in the industry, underscored by who is investing in this round. Scott Sandell, managing general partner of NEA, co-led the investment with German publishing giant Axel Springer. Michael Lynton, the chairman of Snap (and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lynton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous lives</a>, the CEO of Penguin Books and a senior executive at Disney who started Disney Publishing); and <span class="s1">Stefan von Holtzbrinck, the chairman of the eponymous publishing giant (which owns Macmillan, among others), also participated, alongside Kleiner Perkins, HV Capital, Redalpine and Speedinvest. Kleiner led Inkitt&#8217;s Series A.Â </span></p>
<p>Writers on the platform &#8212; at least those whose initial chapters chime well with Inkitt&#8217;s algorithms, which they then turn into longer works that resonate with readers &#8212; are also seeing some big numbers, with a few notable fairytales among them.</p>
<p>Seemran Sahoo, from one of the more impoverished states in India, Odisha, has made $2.7 million to date from <em>The Arrangement</em>, a novel she wrote and published on Inkitt entirely on her smartphone. Sapir Englard from Israel originally wanted to use the proceeds from her Inkitt-germinated book, <em>The Millennium Wolves</em>, to finance her tuition at Berklee College of Music in Boston; she has made $8 million to date from the novel. (Both of these were published before Inkitt&#8217;s last funding round: they have continued to rake in a lot in sales.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These are outliers, but Ali Albazaz, Inkitt&#8217;s founder and CEO, says those who make the cut for Galatea can still do very, very well. &#8220;The majority of our Galatea writers made more than $100,000 in sales,&#8221; he said. But if books are at the heart of what Inkitt does today, Albazaz is given to describing his bigger vision for Inkitt as much more than just reading: the company has started to make small steps into audio books, and there are plans for developing films, TV shows, merchandising, games, and maybe even a theme park: &#8220;the Disney of the twenty-first century,&#8221; in his words.</p>
<p>That journey is consistent but it isn&#8217;t being taken at a breakneck speed: this was almost exactly what Albazaz told me was his plan in 2019, too. (Some things have not remained as prominent: the company&#8217;s unique selling point originally on Galatea was a set of &#8220;effects&#8221; that it would add to books, sounds and jolts, that would make the reading experience more immersive. These are still there but it seems that they are no longer central to every experience, and even Albazaz referred to the effects in our conversation only as an afterthought.</p>
<p>As for why the Disney vision has yet to be realized, to be fair we <em>have</em> been in a pandemic, and move fast, break things isn&#8217;t always the best way forward. Also, even though Albazaz said the company is getting &#8220;between two and four requests every week from TV and movie and production companies,&#8221; to make content based Galatea/Inkitt books (as the publisher, Inkitt owns the rights for film and other options) it has yet to sign any deals. Partly it&#8217;s because of this Disney idea: Inkitt wants a role in what comes next.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are figuring out what is the best for us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to leave the option open that we might have video on Galatea.&#8221; That is also another area where Lynton, who also spent years as the CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment, might help.</p>
<p>Like other self-publishing platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/storytelling-app-wattpad-raises-51m-at-a-398m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wattpad</a> &#8212; which has gone further along in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/storytelling-app-wattpad-raises-51m-at-a-398m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its own &#8220;Disney&#8221; ambition</a>, with a wide range of content spun out from works that got their first oxygen on its platform; Wattpad earlier this year was <a href="https://betakit.com/wattpad-to-be-acquired-by-south-koreas-naver-corp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Korea&#8217;s Naver for about $600 million</a> &#8212; Inkitt has paved the way for a new route to the market for creative people who want to write for a living, or just want to get their work out there into the world.</p>
<p>Built as an alternative to Amazon &#8212; Albazaz is unequivocal about his disdain for the e-commerce giant, which &#8220;took away all the margins and pushed down profits&#8221; on books and ruined the reading experience with its Kindles &#8212; Inkitt also has its own quirks that don&#8217;t sit right with everyone. One prominent author &#8212; name undisclosed &#8212; was curious about how a new work might fare through the Inkitt machine and submitted it for publishing. The Inkitt data science engine &#8212; which is unsentimental about who is writing, just what might &#8216;do well&#8217; &#8212; made a lot of suggestions for how the story should be altered in order to do well with readers. The author was &#8220;furious,&#8221; Albazaz said, and so was the author&#8217;s publisher &#8212; not least because of what the author had done with <em>their</em> book. The author ignored the suggestions and the book published as the author wrote it. The book sold 1 million copies, definitely okay for some, but nothing like the author&#8217;s previous blockbusters.</p>
<p class="p11">&#8220;Those 1 million bought it because of the author&#8217;s name,&#8221; he said flatly.</p>
<p>Longer term, it will be interesting to see whether Inkitt not only can sustain its growth, and leverage it, as it wants to, in a bigger media play. Because so many ideas for other content germinate from stories that you read, it&#8217;s inevitably an area that Amazon, and others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/bytedance-to-pump-170-million-into-e-book-reader-zhangyue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ByteDance</a> (already giving <a href="https://thenewpublishingstandard.com/2021/04/18/be-afraid-be-just-a-tiny-bit-afraid-tiktok-owner-bytedance-targets-3-fold-growth-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some in the publishing world the shivers</a>), might also want to explore over time, too. Amazon has extensive A/B testing for other parts of its operations, although it hasn&#8217;t made huge inroads in building a product to take this to its self-publishing efforts&#8230; not yet, at least.</p>
<p>All this also speaks to big opportunities, and present traction, both of which is what investors like to see.</p>
<p>âInkitt is well-positioned to become the future of storytelling, having already moved beyond traditional content forms to new formats that are innovative and engaging for millions of readers,&#8221; said Sandell in a statement. &#8220;A critical shift is taking place in how people consume stories, and Inkitt understands that. We are thrilled to partner closely with Ali and the rest of the Inkitt board to help drive what is sure to be an exciting and exponential phase of growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Inkitt&#8217;s technology is extraordinary, very successful and truly illustrates the future of storytelling,&#8221; added DÃ¶pfner. &#8220;WhenÂ you consider how many Inkitt authors are achieving great commercial success, you can clearly see how deeply this company has disrupted the way people consume books. We are excited to become part of the further development and work with them as they continue on their journey.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Licious, a Bangalore-based startup that sells fresh meat and seafood online, said on Tuesday it has raised $52 million in a new financing round and become the first direct-to-consumer startup to attain the unicorn status in the worldâs second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The new round &#8212; a Series G &#8212; was led by Mumbai-headquartered IIFL. It comes just three months after Licious &#8212; which counts 3one4 Capital and Temasek among its investors &#8212;Â <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/indias-licious-raises-192-million-for-international-expansion/">raised $192 million at a valuation of about $650 million</a>, TechCrunch reported earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.licious.in/">Licious</a> operates an eponymous e-commerce platform where it sells meat and seafood in 14 Indian cities. The startup has built a supply chain network across several Indian cities to be able to procure meat and seafood, keep them fresh, and deliver within hours of the order.</p>
<p>âEven though the funding for the D2C sector has grown significantly, FMCG is still not considered the most attractive category,â said Vivek Gupta and Abhay Hanjura, founders of Licious, in a joint statement. âWe expect that Licious&#8217; unicorn status will change that. The fresh meats and seafood sector is still largely underserved and unorganised that holds a vast opportunity of $40 billion. As the category leader, we aim at paving the way for a second wave of young start-ups that can join hands in fully harnessing the potential that the industry has to offer.â</p>
<p>Licious has not disclosed several of its performance metrics &#8212; such as its sales and margin figures &#8212; but says it has grown over 500% in the past one year. It also says it has amassed over 2 million unique customers. In recent months, the startup has spoken about its intentions to expand to international markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Licious has disrupted the meat and seafood category, which has largely been unorganized and underserved,&#8221; said Chetan Naik of IIFL AMC. &#8220;Today, Licious is amongst the fastest growing D2C brands and is one of the few consumer businesses in India with very strong revenue retention metrics. We are excited to partner with them in this journey of creating Indiaâs most-loved meat and seafood brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The arrival of IIFL, based on the firm&#8217;s historical track record, on Licious&#8217; captable suggests that the startup is planning for its IPO within the next two years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Bangalore-based firm joins another two-and-a-half-dozen startups in India that have attained the unicorn status this year. Scores of high-profile investors including Tiger Global, SoftBank, Falcon Edge Capital, and Temasek, as well as local giants such as Sequoia Capital India have significantly increased the pace of their investments in recent quarters as they double down in the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jonathan Abrams and Kent Lindstrom have partnered on a lot of things over the years. Lindstrom was an advisor and investor at the early social networking service Friendster, founded by Abrams. He was also the COO of social news aggregator Nuzzel, which was founded by Abrams and that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/scroll-acquires-nuzzel/">sold</a> to a subscription startup called Scroll in 2019. (Scroll later sold to Twitter, which <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/05/04/twitter-buys-scroll-new-aggregator-nuzzel-way">shut down Nuzzel </a>in May.)</p>
<p>Because both have been angel investing all the while, and because there&#8217;s still a lot of money looking to find its way into startups, it isn&#8217;t surprising that they decided more recently to raise an actual seed-stage fund from outside investors, or that they decided to invest it together.</p>
<p>Thus was born <a href="https://8bitcapital.com/">8-Bit Capital</a>, a brand that refers to a time when computers were only able to store a maximum of 8 bits per data block, resulting in the blocky graphics that people who grew up on Atari remember well. Now, the duo is taking the wraps off 8-Bit&#8217;s first fund, a $40 million vehicle that they raised from a wide number of well-known VCs and entrepreneurs, as well as several institutional investors.</p>
<p>We talked with Abrams earlier about some of those backers, who he asked we not name publicly (to shield them from more capital requests). We also talked about how he and Lindstrom are thinking about competing in the frothiest venture market ever and how focused &#8212; or not &#8212; the duo will be on social platforms, given their history. Our chat, below, has been edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why jump into VC full time right now?</strong></p>
<p>JA: We&#8217;ve been helping other entrepreneurs for a long time, and the feedback from a lot of entrepreneurs over the years is that they really appreciated he advice that we&#8217;ve given them. Part of that may be because the venture capital &#8220;value add&#8221; may may be a little overhyped in the industry, and part may be that Kent and I are just good at it. So even though there&#8217;s a lot of investors out there, we thought it did make sense for us to do this.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are your most successful &#8220;exits&#8221; as an angel investor?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>JA: I would say that the best companies, or the most successful ones, still haven&#8217;t exited. That&#8217;s the crazy thing about about doing angel investing or venture capital &#8212; the early exits can be good but the the real winners take a long time. I was an investor in [the e-signature company] Hello Sign, which was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-28/dropbox-to-acquire-e-signature-software-company-hellosign?sref=gni836kR">acquired</a> by Dropbox [in 2019 for $230 million in cash]. I was invested in [the content sharing platform] SlideShare, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/03/linkedin-acquires-professional-content-sharing-platform-slideshare-for-119m/">acquired</a> by LinkedIn [in 2012 for $119 million in cash and stock], and those were very profitable exits. But some of the companies I invested in, like Instacart or Front or AngelList, are still not exited, and they&#8217;re doing extremely well and will be extremely profitable investments.</p>
<p>It does require patience. There are companies that are worth tens of billions [of dollars], but oftentimes, the entrepreneurs have been working on those companies for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re obviously a pioneer in social media, having started Friendster more recently started Nuzzel. Meanwhile, social media is hot again. How interested are you in social as an area of investment?</strong></p>
<p>JA: We&#8217;re open to it, but it&#8217;s not the area we&#8217;re most focused on right now, and I think that&#8217;s because of opportunity. Every week, somebody sends us some new social media pitch, but I&#8217;m still waiting to see something that&#8217;s crazy and innovative. Usually we just see things like, &#8216;We don&#8217;t like Facebook; we&#8217;ll somehow be better. &#8216;</p>
<p>What we invest in is <a href="https://8bitcapital.com/portfolio">software</a>. We&#8217;re not investing in biotech or mattresses or coffee or spaceships. Software that connects people or businesses in new ways is what Kent and I are really passionate about.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How can founders reach you? Do they need a warm introduction?</strong></p>
<p>JA: introductions are great. We like to see an entrepreneur who can network. If nobody on the founding team of a company has the ability to get introductions to investors, then how are you going to get introductions to customers and build your team and all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&#8217;m on the board of <a href="https://girlsintech.org/">Girls in Tech</a>, and Kent and I really care about diversity and we know that requiring an intro can be an impediment to improving the diversity numbers in an industry that really needs improvement. So if somebody sends me a cold email, I&#8217;m going to look at it. The problem is, I get a lot of cold emails, and they&#8217;re all terrible. They&#8217;re generally really long and don&#8217;t contain any of the information you need. So If [we&#8217;re sent] a cold email, we would probably read it, but in general, the cold emails we get are just not compelling.</p>
<p>Most of the companies that we&#8217;ve invested in, some of them have been entrepreneurs who we already know, and many of them have been referrals. Generally, we like to get deal flow directly from entrepreneurs, and when other VCs send us deals, we usually don&#8217;t do them for various reasons.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Because they are probably sending the same deal to everyone at once?</strong></p>
<p>JA: One issue is adverse selection where, if this is something that a VC is sharing around and didn&#8217;t gobble up that allocation themselves, there may be an issue there. Another issue is timing. We like to know a company super early &#8212; ideally before other VCs really know about it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span class="s1">European VC Eight Roads is launching its fourth fund of $450 million for European and Israeli tech companies , aiming for another 15-20 across a broad range of consumer, software-as-a-service, fintech and healthtech areas. Cheque sizes wil range from around $5 million to $50 million per company, and as such, it tends to play more in growth funding rounds. 10-year old Eight Roads is backed by Fidelity, and was formerly known as Fidelity Growth Partners and before that Fidelity Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Eight Roads has previously invested in companies such as AppsFlyer, Cazoo, Fireblocks, Hibob, <a href="http://made.com/"><span class="s2">Made.com</span></a>, Spendesk, Red Points, and Neo4j, and now manages over $8 billion of capital across Europe, Asia and the US.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></span></p>
<p><span class="s1">To give you an idea of how the fund has grown, the first Eight Roads fund was 1st was Â£100m, the second Â£150m, the first $375m, and the latest is $450m.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Davor Hebel, Managing Partner and Head of Eight Roads Ventures Europe said: âItâs great to be launching our latest fund at a time when there is so much entrepreneurial energy and ambition in both Europe and Israel and weâre now firmly on a path to building global technology champions out of the region. This additional capital enables us to continue helping ambitious founders scale, win and have a lasting impact on the way we live.âÂ <span class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></span></p>
<p><span class="s1">I asked the firm whether it will also have a climate focus, given the scale of the problems facing the planet. A spokeperson said the focus on climate cuts across all of its sectors but as an investment theme Eight Roads looks at three main focus areas:<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Clean energy &#8211; so it has an investment in a Nordic company <a href="https://tibber.com/en"><span class="s2">Tibber</span></a> which helps people run their homes more sustainably.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Sustainable products â Eight Roads has invested in <a href="https://www.otrium.co.uk/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwwNWKBhDAARIsAJ8HkheWwa8IemPuNWtjLwxVyqwUdcZGeIoWzfc3JrShWzsll1fmUU_7b40aAl4xEALw_wcB"><span class="s2">Otrium</span></a> (fashion marketplace aiming to get every item to be worn), <a href="https://smolproducts.com/"><span class="s2">Smol</span></a> (environmentally friendly house products), <a href="https://lafourche.fr/"><span class="s2">La Fourche</span></a> (organic and sustainable produce), <a href="https://shopviu.com/en_int/"><span class="s2">VIU</span></a> (eyewear brand), and <a href="https://www.made.com/"><span class="s2">Made.com</span></a> (online furniture brand)<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Climate change tools and enablers &#8211; e.g. carbon footprint measurement and reduction<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1">During an interview, Hebel told me a major investment theme last year and this had been the shift to remote working, HR systems to support that, and: âEvery company needs FinTech now.â</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The fourth biggest category for Eight Roads is digital health, also supercharged by the pandemic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span class="s1">Enabling technologies, like AI, are also being applied: âI wouldn&#8217;t call it a sector, but the machine learning aspect. Like Glovo, which is a company that does internal talent marketplaces for large companies, where you can match people&#8217;s talents with opportunities in other parts of the organization.â</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">I asked Hebel if his company was returning to the office. He said: âI think we&#8217;re still feeling our way, you know. I think we said we&#8217;ll be two days a week, and then see how it goes. It&#8217;s good to see people again.â</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.foundershk.com/">FoundersHK</a> was created to strengthen Hong Kongâs startup community, which has weathered more than two years of political turmoil, along with the COVID-19 pandemic. Today the non-profit, which started as an events and mentoring network, held the first demo day of FoundersHK Accelerate, its equity-free accelerator program, which was created to help prepare Hong Kong startups to raise funding and scale globally.</p>
<p>Eleven startups (a full list is below) representing diverse sectorsâpet care, fintech, insurance and education, to name a fewâpitched an audience of about 500 mentors and investors. They were chosen from a pool of 150 applicants by FoundersHKâs creators, including Alfred Chuang, co-founder of BEA Systems, which was acquired by Oracle for $8.5 billion in 2008, Edith Yeung, former 500 Startups general partner and Phil Chen, founder of HTC Vive. All three are also partners in Hong Kong-based venture firm Race Capital.</p>
<p>One of FounderHKâs goals is to restore hope to Hong Kongâs startup ecosystem. When asked what that means to her, Yeung said, âIn 2019, I landed at the airport in Hong Kong, where thousands of young people were protesting. I was overcome with sadness and even took a photo so I wouldnât forget how I felt about the turmoil there. As a person born and raised in Hong Kong, I couldnât just stand by and do nothing. I realized mobilizing entrepreneurship and helping founders build their startups was the best way to contribute and help, so FounderHK was born to do just that.â</p>
<p>One of its goals is to help Hong Kong startups secure more funding. âA lot of active investors in Hong Kong donât invest in local Hong Kong companies. The part that is very ironic is that all unicorns in Hong Kong raised money from overseas,â Yeung said.</p>
<p>FoundersHK connects startups with mentors, many of whom are from Hong Kong, and work at major venture firms and tech companies like Facebook, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Apple and Grab. It held its first event in 2019, before the pandemic hit, and has since continued hosting educational events online.</p>
<p>One reason why FoundersHK is equity-free is because it wants to focus first on creating a culture change. âHong Kong is a very money-driven place, so when you say that none of this will be money-driven, people are shocked,â said Chuang. âOne of the things we really want to fix first is the networking issue, because people learn from other people, but they are not connected and itâs very hard to learn.â</p>
<p>Even though Hong Kong founders might be reluctant to talk about their challenges at first, they are eager for the opportunity, he added. âAfter the first person has shared what their biggest problem is, everyone else shares, because they now know they all have common problems. That brings a lot of teams together and thatâs a culture changing thing.â</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chuang says that hundreds of startups have gone through FoundersHKâs mentorship program. One reason it started its accelerator program was because many teams wanted more support before approaching investors. Bonnie Cheng, a former venture partner at 500 Startups, was recruited to run FoundersHK Accelerate. The program includes weekly check-ins with FounderHKâs leaders, and a mentorship network that includes people from Sequoia Capital, Goldman Sachs, Alibaba, Monks Hill and Matrix Partners.</p>
<p>âWeâre finding a lot of Hong Kongers from everywhere who want to help support the community and check out these companies,â said Yeung.</p>
<p>The past few weeks were spent prepping startups for demo day, and making sure they donât sell themselves short in pitches, another culture change FoundersHK wants to encourage. âFundraising is a really big part of this accelerator, really the main thing is to teach them what they need to do, what attractions do they have and how to do pitch it,â Chuang said. âA lot of our work is connecting them with investors to pitch.â</p>
<p>Part of FoundersHKâs work is helping startups find partners in the right markets. Since Hong Kong is a small market, most startups begin thinking about international expansion from the start, including Southeast Asia, the United States and mainland China.</p>
<p>More than 100 investors from those markets attended FoundersHK Accelerateâs demo day.</p>
<p>âTo get 100 investors from around the globe in front of a bunch of Hong Kong startups, thatâs never happened before,â said Chuang. âThis is a first and weâre hoping this will lead into future programs. Bonnie is a mastermind and our goal is to spiral these kind of events and do more and more.â</p>

<p><strong>Meet FoundersHKâs first batch:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sleekflow.io/">Sleekflow</a> is a B2B sales platform created specifically for social commerce companies. Most social commerce sellers rely on WhatsApp and other messaging apps to talk to customers and close sales. Since they donât have a centralized hub, that means social commerce sellers need to do a lot of busywork, while missing out on valuable data that can boost conversion rates. Sleekflow is a SaaS selling platform for businesses that enables them to build customer flow automation (for example, sending offers if a shopping cart has been abandoned) and analytics to keep track of sales performance. It integrates with messaging apps, social media networks and CRM software like Salesforce. Sleekflow, which works primarily with mid-market and enterprise companies, plans to expand internationally by working with channel partners.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dimorder.com/">DimOrder</a> is a âsuper app for restaurant managementâ that says it is now used by 5% of restaurants in Hong Kong. Co-founder Ben Wong comes from a family of restaurant owners and said he wanted to create a solution to reduce the amount of labor spent on operations, while increasing profit margins. DimOrderâs frontend includes ordering, delivery with integrated logistics providers throughout Hong Kong and marketing tools. On the back end, it can handle inventory purchasing, payment and analytics. DimOrder plans to add central kitchen and school lunch box ordering for 108 schools in Hong Kong next year to its frontend, along with working capital loans, inventory management and an HR system to its back end. It will expand to Southeast Asia next year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spaceshipapp.com/en-hk">Spaceship</a> is a logistics platform focused on the fragmented cross-border courier, express and parcel services market. With more than 100,000 customers so far, Spaceship lets sellers compare providers, declare shipment content, chose time slots for shipments, make payments and track packages end-to-end. It also offers consumer services like logistics booking and relocation and moving services, and will launch other verticals, including a marketplace and travel planning. Spaceship plans to expand into Taiwan before entering other markets like Singapore, Thailand and Japan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.findrecruiter.com/">FindRecruiter</a> is a bounty recruiting platform to help businesses find talent much more quickly than traditional recruiting methods. Co-founder Lawton Lai was a recruiter for a decade before launching the startup, and said it typically takes about 52 days to fill an opening. FindRecruiter can reduce that to about 17 days by working with more than 500 on-demand recruiters across six Asian countries who specialize in particular fields. The platform broadcasts job openings and matches employers with recruiters based on their sector, expertise and needs. FindRecruiter says its recruiters can earn 25% more in commissions and save 30 hours on cold-calling every month. Its clients include startup unicorns and bluechip companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.powerarena.com/">PowerArena</a> is a deep-learning analytics platform to help monitor manufacturing operations. It currently focuses on the electronics and automotive sectors, with clients like Wistron and Jabil. Even on manufacturing floors with many automated machines, more than 72% of the work is still done by people, says PowerArenaâs founders. To use PowerArena, manufacturers install 1080p cameras and connect them to the platform for real-time analytics. For example, if there is a sudden slowdown in production, PowerArena can hone in on the cause, like maintenance being performed in one part of the factory.</p>
<p><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://wadabento.com/en">WadaBento</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> helps restaurants expand their operations and increase profit margins with automated vending machines in well-trafficked areas. It has sold 140,000 bento boxes in Hong Kong so far. Restaurants that want to expand usually have two costly optionsâopening new locations or delivery apps. WadaBento takes lunch boxes prepared by restaurants and puts them into their patented vending machines. Food is kept above 65 degrees during delivery and while they are in the machines, and hygiene is monitored through IoT devices. WadaBento has received patents in Japan, U.S. and China and recently signed a deal with Hong Kongâs largest fast food chain. It also recently shipped a machine to Japan, its first overseas market. It plans to deploy more than 200 machines by the first half of 2022.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://retykle.com/">Retykle</a> wants to reduce fashion waste by making it easier to resell maternity and childrenâs wear. Co-founder Sarah Garner, who spent 10 years working at luxury fashion companies including LVMH, said kids on average outgrow 1,700 of clothing by the time theyâre 18, but only about 5% of childrenâs clothing reaches the secondary market. Retykleâs goal is to keep as many items in circulation as possible. Retykle carries items for babies to mid-teens. All items are sold on consignment: sellers send clothing to Retykle, which then inspects each piece before listing it on the site. When an item sells, users get an email alert and cash or credit transfers. The company plans to launch in Singapore next month and in Australia in 2022.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.preface.ai/">Preface Coding</a> is a tech education platform that provides scalable but customizable coding classes. Students can make on-demand bookings with teachers, and either meet with them virtually or at an offline location. The platform helps train teachers and most classes are 1:1. It serves a wide range of students, including kids aged 3 to 15, university students (especially Asian overseas students in the U.S. and Australia) and senior professionals in the financial, management and consulting industries. It&#8217;s also made partnerships with universities and banks, and plans to scale globally.</p>
<p><a href="https://zumvet.com/">ZumVet</a> is a pet care startup that offers video vet consultations, house visits and pharmacy deliveries, including medication and home-based diagnostic tests. Co-founder Athena Lee said ZumVet was created to help pet owners who donât have a regular vet or live in areas where there arenât a lot of veterinarian clinics. Vets perform consultations, create treatment plans and offer support remotely, or make house calls. Zumvet works with a network of independent vets and offers subscription plans to make pet care more affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigbangacademyhk.com/en/">Big Bang Academy</a> was created to address increasing demand for STEAM education and wants to make learning as âcompelling as a movie, fun as a theme park and educational as a classroomâ for kids. Its accredited curriculum includes videos and personalized lesson plans for each student. It also encourages a hands-on approach with experiment kits that are delivered to kidsâ homes. The platform currently has 200 interactive sessions and a 70% course completion rate, a high number for an edtech platform. It business models include B2B, partnering with educational organizations, and B2C subscription models, and about 80% of its customer base is recurring. Big Bang Academy plans to diversify its content and create learning toys, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro-insurance.yas.com.hk/">YAS Microinsurance</a> is an insurtech startup with policies that can be activated in as little as five seconds, including coverage for running, biking or hiking accidents. It also recently signed its first partnership with Kowloon Motor Bus, one of the largest public bus companies in Hong Kong, to cover its passengers, including loss or theft or accidental medical expenses. YAS Microinsurance launched four months ago and says it now has $800,000 in committed revenue. About 6,300 policies were activated over the past couple of months, and it currently activates about 600 new policies per week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A pair of new e-readers from Kobo iterate on the company&#8217;s high-end options, adding Bluetooth audiobook and stylus support to the now familiar asymmetrical design of its larger devices. The Sage and Libra 2 also gain a new charging cover so you only have to plug the device in every few months rather than every few weeks.</p>
<p>The Sage is the higher-end of the two models, being an evolution of the Forma, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/kobos-forma-e-reader-takes-on-kindle-oasis-with-an-asymmetric-design-and-premium-price/">which I reviewed here</a>. The excellent 8&#8243;, 300 PPI screen and color-adjustable screen light are the same, so rest assured the reading experience will continue to be great. Likewise the Libra 2 is the sequel to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/kobo-brings-brings-the-forma-form-factor-to-a-cheaper-model/">Libra H2O</a> (they&#8217;re dropping the H2O, but it&#8217;s still waterproof), with the same type of display and light at 7&#8243; instead. (If you want smaller, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/29/kobos-new-entry-level-clara-hd-e-reader-has-a-crisp-color-adjustable-display/">Clara</a> is still the best move.)</p>
<p>New in both the readers is Bluetooth audio that can be used exclusively for sending Kobo audiobooks to your wireless headset of choice. While it&#8217;s always nice to have new capabilities, it&#8217;s a little surprising that Kobo decided to limit this to its own service. The company has generally been very open to different formats and services, letting you load whatever document formats you want on its readers â so it&#8217;s surprising that the approach here is more restricted. It&#8217;s possible that tie-ins with other services (like the devices&#8217; solid Pocket integration) are simply forthcoming. Both readers come with 32 gigs of storage built in to accommodate this new space-hogging feature.</p>

<p>Only the Sage gets support for Kobo&#8217;s new stylus, however, which was first put to use on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/kobo-elipsa-review-a-sized-up-e-reading-companion-with-clever-note-taking/">new, large-type Ellipsa</a>. It was useful there but mainly due to the larger format allowing the necessary space for sketching and jotting down notes. Whether that utility makes the jump to the smaller (but still on the large side for an e-reader) Sage is tough to predict â but we should be able to evaluate that when we review it.</p>
<p>The form factor of the devices has, unfortunately, gained somewhat in size and weight. The Forma and Libra H2O were notable for what you might call their &#8220;side chin,&#8221; a wedge-shaped bezel you could use to hold and operate the e-reader one-handed. Although as a rule I prefer symmetrical things, the form factor (pioneered, it must be said, by Amazon with the Oasis) has grown on me, partly because the screen part of the device is so thin that it feels rather futuristic and of course takes up very little space.</p>

Truly the differences seem smaller than I made them out to be." width="947" height="307" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sage_Side.jpg 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sage_Side.jpg?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sage_Side.jpg?resize=300,97 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sage_Side.jpg?resize=768,249 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sage_Side.jpg?resize=680,220 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sage_Side.jpg?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212042" class="wp-caption-text">Side view of the Sage (top) and Forma (bottom). Truly the differences seem smaller than I made them out to be.</p></div></p>
<p>The new Sage and Libra 2 are definitely chunkier, with no extra-thin screen part, instead being as thick as thickest section all the way through. It&#8217;s a clean design in some ways and for all I know it may even be more comfortable to hold, but it&#8217;s already tough enough to find a pocket the Forma fits in. And it doesn&#8217;t help that both are about 20 percent heavier. While technically that only amounts to a few dozen grams and 3 or 4 millimeters, part of the draw of e-readers to begin with is that they are thin and light.</p>
<p>Anyway it might not matter once you put a case on these things â there&#8217;s a new evolution of the SleepCover, which automatically turns the device on or off when you open it, in the PowerCover, which also charges the device it protects. Of course that&#8217;ll probably add another few hundred grams too&#8230;</p>
<p>Though I grouse about these small changes to design and dimensions, the screen and frontlight are still class-leading and Kobo&#8217;s software is great and straightforward for reading. We&#8217;ll see how these new devices stack up to the old ones as soon as we have the chance to review them.</p>
<p>The Kobo Sage will cost $260, and the Libra 2 will cost $180 when they ship on October 19. You can pre-order them now if you&#8217;re feeling lucky.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">day-long outage</a> is by far its longest and most extreme in years. At around 9 a.m. PDT on the U.S. West Coast &#8212; where the social giant is headquartered &#8212; Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger seemed to vanish from the internet.</p>
<p>The outage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-stock-falls-as-global-outage-continues/">continued through market close</a>, with the company&#8217;s stock dropping around 5% below its opening price on Monday. By midafternoon, services were beginning to resume after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/technology/facebook-down.html">Facebook reportedly</a> dispatched a team to its Santa Clara data center to &#8220;manually reset&#8221; the company&#8217;s servers.</p>
<p>But what makes the outage unique is just how extremely offline Facebook was.</p>
<p>In the morning, Facebook sent a brief tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/Facebook/status/1445061804636479493">to apologize</a> that &#8220;some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products.&#8221; Then, reports emerged that the outage was affecting not just its users, but the company itself. Employees were reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/sheeraf/status/1445099150316503057?s=20">unable to enter their office buildings,</a>Â and staff called it a &#8220;snow day&#8221; &#8212; they <a href="https://twitter.com/rmac18/status/1445069187664293895">couldn&#8217;t get any work done</a> because the outage also affected internal collaboration apps.</p>
<p>Facebook hasn&#8217;t commented on the cause of the outage, though security experts said evidence pointed to a problem with the company&#8217;s network that cut off Facebook from the wider internet and also itself.</p>
<p>The first signs of trouble <a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445065270272434176">were around 8:50 a.m</a>. PDT in California, according to John Graham-Cumming, CTO at networking giant Cloudflare, who said Facebook &#8220;disappeared from the internet in a flurry of BGP updates&#8221; over a two-minute window, referring to BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, the system that networks use to figure out the fastest way to send data over the internet to another network.</p>
<p>The updates were specifically BGP route withdrawals. Essentially, Facebook had sent a message to the internet that it was closed for business, like closing the drawbridge of its castle. Without any routes into the network, Facebook was basically isolated from the rest of the internet, and because of the way Facebook&#8217;s network is structured, the route withdrawals also took out WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Messenger and everything inside its digital walls.</p>
<p>A few minutes after the BGP routes were withdrawn, users began to notice issues. Internet traffic that should have gone to Facebook essentially got lost on the internet and went nowhere, Rob Graham, founder of Errata Security, said in <a href="https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/1445132412283981835">a tweet thread</a>.</p>
<p>Users began to notice that their Facebook apps had stopped working and the websites weren&#8217;t loading and reported experiencing issues with DNS, or the domain name system, which is another critical part of how the internet works. DNS converts human-readable web addresses into machine-readable IP addresses to find where a web page is located on the internet. Without a way into Facebook&#8217;s servers, apps and browsers would keep kicking back what looked like DNS errors.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known exactly why the BGP routes were withdrawn. BGP, which has been around since the advent of the internet, can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/19/cloudflare-wants-route-leak-internet-outages-to-be-a-thing-of-the-past/">manipulated and maliciously exploited</a> in ways that can lead to massive outages.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more likely is that a Facebook configuration update went terribly wrong and its failure cascaded throughout the internet. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/q181fv/looks_like_facebook_is_down/hfd4dyv/?context=3">now-deleted Reddit thread</a> from a Facebook engineer described a BGP configuration error long before it was widely known.</p>
<p>But while the fix might be simple, the recovery may stretch from the next few hours into the following days because of how the internet works. Internet providers usually update their DNS records every few hours, but they can take several days to fully propagate.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the huge community of people and businesses around the world who depend on us: we&#8217;re sorry,&#8221; Facebook tweeted around 3:30 p.m. local time. &#8220;Weâve been working hard to restore access to our apps and services and are happy to report they are coming back online now. Thank you for bearing with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 4, 2021. A lot is going on today in the world of major tech companies â as you may have noticed â but donât worry, we have lots of startup news on deck as well to keep you up to speed! Now if someone could help Facebook fix its series of tubes â¦ â <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<p>P.S. Our upcoming SaaS event is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/jared-spataro-will-talk-about-building-microsofts-saas-business-at-tc-sessions-saas/">going to flat-out rule</a>.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">Facebook goes down:</a></strong> The biggest news item in all of tech today was the fact that Facebook was unable to provide its services for hours and hours. Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are all still offline as we write to you. Given Facebookâs enormous scale, the financial damage is piling up for the social giant and its myriad customers. In other Facebook news, the European Parliament is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/leak-shows-facebooks-business-model-needs-regulating-says-mep/">less than pleased with the company</a>, TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/informaticas-ipo-will-test-public-markets-appetite-for-slower-growing-tech-offerings/"><strong>Inside Informaticaâs IPO:</strong></a><strong>Â </strong>As technology stocks took a battering today, TechCrunch sunk its teeth into data-focused Informaticaâs S-1 filing. The company went private back in 2015, moving to the cloud over the intervening half-decade. What does it look like now that it is coming back to the public markets? Indebted, for one.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/apple-watch-series-7-arrives-october-15-starting-at-399/"><strong>New Apple Watches drop this month:</strong></a><strong>Â </strong>If you were hoping to snag a new Apple Watch in October, good news: The companyâs Series 7 device should arrive on the 15th. As a reminder, the new Watch has a 20% larger screen, which means it can hold more text. In case you love reading from your wrist.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we dive into a bevy of venture capital rounds, take a peek at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/index-sequoia-and-canvas-investors-weigh-in-on-how-to-raise-your-first-dollars/">this Mary Ann Azevedo post</a> digging into advice from Index and Sequoia concerning how to go about raising your first dollars. Itâs very good.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/nft-startup-dapper-labs-acquires-virtual-influencer-startup-brud/"><strong>An NFT and a virtual avatar walk into a bar:</strong></a><strong>Â </strong>OK so thatâs the setup for a lame joke I couldnât figure out how to finish (<em>The barkeep asks, âWhat do you think this is, the metaverse?â</em>) but in real news, NFT impresario Dapper Labs is buying virtual avatar startup Brud. Per TechCrunch, Brud has 32 staff, all of which will make a move to Dapper. Recall that Dapper Labs was last valued at $7.5 billion, so it 100% has some stock to throw around.</li>
<li>We had <strong>two insurtech rounds today</strong> worth discussing. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/insurtech-stable-raises-46-5m-in-greycroft-led-round-to-help-businesses-manage-volatile-commodity-prices/"><strong>The </strong><strong>first is from Stable</strong></a>, which is building an insurance product concerning the price of commodities. The value of oil, soybeans and pig bellies â not to mention copper, silicon metal and corn â can jump around quite a lot. For many producers, thatâs suboptimal. Stable has raised more than $46 million to help provide more price stability â get it? â to folks previously at the vicissitude of the markets, who we presume were too small to hedge their own risk.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/ladder-raises-100m-on-a-900m-valuation-for-a-platform-selling-flexible-term-life-insurance/"><strong>The second is from Ladder</strong></a>, which just put together a $100 million funding round to remake the life insurance industry. That we have two large insurtech rounds land in a single day implies that venture sentiment around startups in the space has not waned to quiescence in the wake of public markets devaluing several public neoinsurance companies that went public in the last year.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/yc-grads-wasp-land-1-5m-seed-to-help-developers-build-web-apps-faster/"><strong>Wasp raises $1.5M for faster web app construction:</strong></a><strong>Â </strong>Recent Y Combinator graduate Wasp has put together a nice little round for its technology that aims to âhelp programmers code the business logic side of the application faster,â TechCrunch reports. Itâs always nice to see a smaller round, reminders that not every company is raising nine figures in a single go these days.</li>
</ul>
<h2>As Apple messes with attribution, what does growth marketing look like in 2021?</h2>
<p>Cupertino introduced app tracking transparency in April, giving users the ability to prevent their iPhones from sharing data about their behavior. Later changes in iOS 15 permit consumers to opt into mail privacy protection and exert greater control over app permissions.</p>
<p>This is all good news for privacy-minded consumers, but for startups that live and die by their ability to measure growth and engagement, there&#8217;s widespread confusion and uncertainty.</p>
<p>To learn more about how growth marketers are recalibrating data collection, <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Managing Editor Danny Crichton</a> interviewed three experts at TechCrunch Disrupt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jenifer Ho, marketing VP, Elation Health</li>
<li>Shoji Ueki, head of marketing and analytics, Point</li>
<li>Nik Sharma, owner, Sharma Brands</li>

It turns out that inside of iOS 15 thereâs now a way to report apps to Apple. Which is good, if Apple will, you know, ever email you back.</li>
<li>To wrap up news for the day, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/qualcomm-acquires-veoneer-for-4-5-billion-canceling-its-agreement-with-magna/"><strong>Qualcomm intends to buy Veoneer for $4.5 billion</strong></a>, which means that the smaller companyâs deal with Magna is kaput. Veoneer is a âSwedish automotive tech company,â TechCrunch writes, which helps put the deal in context. Qualcomm makes chips &#8212; and cars, as we have learned in the last few months, really do need them.</li>

First, an introduction: I&#8217;m Aria Alamalhodaei, the resident space and transportation reporter here at TechCrunch.

<h2>Bezos&#8217; labor woes</h2>
<p>Jeff Bezos is back in the news this week, this time over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/current-and-former-employees-raise-major-safety-concerns-allegations-of-sexual-harassment-at-blue-origin/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">allegations of a hostile work environment and a lack of focus on safety</a> from 21 current and former employees of his space company, Blue Origin. The news couldn&#8217;t come at a worse time for the company, which is currently mired in a lawsuit against NASA over its decision to award a lunar lander contract to rival SpaceX.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/bezos-wants-to-create-a-better-future-in-space-his-company-blue-origin-is-stuck-in-a-toxic-past">The essay jointly composed by the employees</a>Â paints a vivid picture of Blue Originâs work culture as one marred by sexual harassment, in which professional disagreement is stifled, environmental concerns are left unaddressed and speed of execution takes precedence over human safety.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KsJJIWLtUe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/current-and-former-employees-raise-major-safety-concerns-allegations-of-sexual-harassment-at-blue-origin/">Current and former employees raise major safety concerns, allegations of sexual harassment at Blue Origin</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Current and former employees raise major safety concerns, allegations of sexual harassment at Blue Origin&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/current-and-former-employees-raise-major-safety-concerns-allegations-of-sexual-harassment-at-blue-origin/embed/#?secret=KsJJIWLtUe" data-secret="KsJJIWLtUe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Blue Origin disputed the allegations of sexual harassment in a comment to TechCrunch, but they did not respond to a follow-up inquiry regarding safety and whether the company has inserted stifling non-disparagement clauses in employee contracts.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke to the sole named author of the letter, Alexandra Abrams, who said she decided to go public with her identity because she felt a sense of responsibility for other employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>âI really felt like I had compromised my integrity at Blue Origin,â she said. âI did my best, but I was Bobâs executive communicator and helped make him look good.â</p>
<p>Itâs hard to imagine how this essay couldÂ <em>notÂ </em>affect Blue Originâs bottom line. After the successful launch of New Shepard in July, in which Bezos and three others went to space during an 11-minute flight, the company intends to start welcoming more paying customers on flights.</p>
<p>The situation was made even more sticky when the Federal Aviation Administration confirmed to TechCrunch that &#8220;the agency is reviewing the information&#8221; in the essay. âThe FAA takes every safety allegation seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Abrams confirmed that the FAA had not yet reached out to her, she said she would âvery much welcomeâ that.</p>
<p>âI feel like Iâm fulfilling my job description as employee communications for the first time.â</p>

<h2>U.S. Space Force grants funds for next-gen rocket development</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/u-s-space-force-awards-87-5m-to-rocket-lab-spacex-blue-origin-ula-for-next-gen-rocket-testing/">U.S. Space Force</a> has awarded a collective $87.5 million in funding to SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab and United Launch Alliance for projects related to next-gen rocket engine testing and upper-stage improvements &#8212; that includes Rocket Lab&#8217;s mysterious Neutron rocket and Blue Origin&#8217;s heavy-lift launch vehicle New Glenn.</p>
<p>SpaceX and ULA are already established launch providers for the U.S. government under the Space Forceâs National Security Space Launch program. Both Rocket Lab and Blue Origin will be able to compete for the next series of launch procurement contracts in 2024, and contracts like these are signs that the two companies are gearing up to do so.</p>

<h2>Blue Origin&#8217;s next manifest</h2>
<p>One last story related to Blue Origin this week&#8230; the company announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/dcvc-partner-and-planet-labs-co-founder-chris-boshuizen-bound-for-space-on-blue-origins-second-human-flight/">the next two people</a> that will take a ride on the New Shepard rocket: Dr. Chris Boshuizen, co-founder of Planet Labs and current partner at venture capital firm DCVC; and Glen de Vries, co-founder of the clinical trial software company Medidata Solutions.</p>
<p>The flight is scheduled to take off on Tuesday, October 12, at 9:30 AM EST from Blue Originâs sprawling Launch Site One just outside of Van Horn, Texas. The company has not released details regarding the identities of the remaining two crew members but we&#8217;ll certainly be keeping our ear to the ground. (Read our story on Blue&#8217;s first crewed launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">here</a>.)</p>
<h2>Orbital servicing startup raises $7M</h2>
<p>In-orbit satellite servicing company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/starfish-space-raises-7m-for-in-orbit-servicing-space-tug/">Starfish Space</a> raised $7 million to accelerate the development of its Otter &#8220;space tug,&#8221; a spacecraft that the company says will be able to clean up orbital debris and extend the useful life of satellites in geostationary orbit. In the longer-term, Starfish even says the space tug could be usedÂ as autonomous in-orbit robots for a whole range of purposes related to the future space economy, including mining, manufacturing and recycling.</p>

<h2>A $300M satellite manufacturing facility for Florida&#8217;s Space Coast</h2>
<p>Florida&#8217;s Space Coast economy got a major boost this week when it was announced that contract manufacturer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/terran-orbital-to-open-a-300m-satellite-manufacturing-and-component-facility-on-floridas-space-coast/">Terran Orbital</a> would build a $300 million satellite manufacturing facility at Kennedy Space Center. The 660,000-square-foot facility will be the world&#8217;s largest, according to the company, and that&#8217;s not too hard to believe, considering the anticipated output: 1,000 complete satellites and over 1 million satellite components per year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube announced on Monday that itâs expanding video action campaigns (one of Google&#8217;s interactive ad types for video) to connected televisions (CTV) to make YouTube ads more shoppable. The company says this new move will help advertisers drive more online sales and grow their businesses.</p>
<p>For context, when viewers see a video action campaign on their TV, they are invited through a URL at the bottom of their screen to continue shopping on the brandâs website from their desktop or mobile device. All of this is done without interrupting users&#8217; viewing sessions.</p>
<p>âWith a quarter of logged-in YouTube CTV viewers watching primarily on TVs, the living room is becoming an essential place for brands to drive incremental conversions with new audiences. In early experiments for video action campaigns on TV screens, over 90% of conversions coming from CTV would not have been reachable on mobile and desktop devices,â said Romana Pawar, the director of product management for YouTube ads, in a <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/expanding-video-action-campaigns-to-ctv/">blog post.</a></p>
<p>Pawar notes that more people are choosing to view YouTube on the big screen, as more than 120 million people streamed YouTube or YouTube TV on their TVs last year in December in the U.S. Further, Pawar outlined that businesses with the goal of driving online sales should use video action campaigns in order to find new customers in a single campaign by combining inventory from across YouTube and Google video partners.</p>
<p>âFor the first time, performance advertisers can take advantage of YouTube on CTV to drive and measure conversions,â Pawar outlined in the blog post. âVideo action campaigns on TV screens are now globally available through Google Ads.â</p>
<p>Google first announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/a-new-youtube-feature-will-make-its-connected-tv-ads-more-shoppable/">plans to make its connected TV ads more shoppable</a> earlier this year (in May). Consumers, particularly younger users, like to watch videos and engage while they shop. As a result, YouTube and other platforms like Facebook and Instagram have invested in live shopping and video-based shopping features.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA has a launch date for that most Hollywood of missions, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, which is basically a dry run of the movie &#8220;Armageddon.&#8221; Unlike the film, this will not involve nukes, oil rigs or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujMxXOHJloI">Aerosmith</a>, but instead is a practical test of our ability to change the trajectory of an asteroid in a significant and predictable way.</p>
<p>The DART mission, managed by the Planetary Defense Coordination Office (!), involves sending a pair of satellites out to a relatively nearby pair of asteroids, known as the Didymos binary. It&#8217;s one large-ish asteroid, approximately 780 meters across â that&#8217;s Didymos proper â and a 160-meter &#8220;moonlet&#8221; in its orbit.</p>
<p>As the moonlet is more typical of the type likely to threaten Earth â there being more asteroids that are that size and not easily observed â we will be testing the possibility of intercepting one by smashing into it at nearly 15,000 miles per hour. This will change the speed of the moonlet by a mere fraction of a percent, but enough that its orbit period will be affected measurably. Knowing exactly how much will help us plan any future asteroid-deflection missions â not surprisingly, there isn&#8217;t a lot of existing science on ramming your spacecraft into space rocks.</p>
<p>A companion spacecraft, called the Light Italian CubeSat for Imagine Asteroids, or LICIACube, just had the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/dart-gets-its-cubesat-companion-its-last-major-piece">finishing touches put on it</a> last week and will be launched shortly before the operation and will attempt to fly by at the very moment of impact and capture &#8220;the resultant plume of ejecta and possibly the newly-formed impact crater.&#8221;</p>
<p>A very exciting and interesting mission to be sure, but had to be delayed past its original launch window of this summer, and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-invites-media-to-launch-of-double-asteroid-redirection-test">November 23 marks the first day of the new launch window</a>. DART is scheduled to launch from Vandenberg in Southern California at 10:20 PM on that date, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9.</p>
<p>With Osiris-Rex and Japan&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/21/japans-hayabusa-2-has-landed-on-an-asteroid-shot-it-with-a-special-bullet-and-returned-to-space/">Hayabusa-2</a> missions, Earth authorities are getting pretty good at reaching out and touching asteroids. We&#8217;ll know more about the plan of attack on the Didymos binary in the run-up to launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration rejected a 2019 petition requesting the agency open a formal investigation into Tesla&#8217;s battery management software over allegations that an over-the-air update was defective and caused fires in five vehicles.</p>
<p>The agency decided not to open a formal investigation in part because the majority of those incidents occurred outside of the United States, according to a <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2019/INCLA-DP19005-2413.PDF">document posted on its website</a>. None of these were related to crashes and most were parked.</p>
<p>As part of its evaluation, NHTSA reviewed 59 complaints out of the total 61,781 Model S and Model X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 included in the petition before it decided to reject it. Out of the 59 complaints, 52 alleged reductions in battery capacity and seven alleged reductions in charging speed after the software was updated. Log data from the vehicles showed that the voltage limiting firmware was enabled in 58% of the complaints, but that subsequent updates restored some or all battery capacity to those vehicles, according to the report summary.</p>
<p>The agency did find that a perfect storm caused two of the fires that occurred in China in 2019. The vehicles had recently completed fast-charging sessions, the batteries were at a high state-of-charge and were parked with the battery cooling systems shut off. The two vehicles also had histories of high-stress usage.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with Tesla&#8217;s battery management system say if there were truly a systematic software issue, way more than five cars would have caught fire. The more likely causes of such infrequent issues would be physical defects from manufacturing or physical damage in the course of use, like putting recently Supercharged vehicles under high stress, which NHTSA says is more common in China where those fires occurred.</p>
<p>There were also two fires that occurred in the U.S., but one involved a vehicle with no Supercharging history that was driving at the time of the fire, and another that couldn&#8217;t be linked back to the high-voltage battery system. The fifth fire happened in Germany with a vehicle that had been parked at a low state of charge for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the absence of any incidents in the United States related to fast charging, and the absence of any such incidents globally since May 2019, it is unlikely that an order concerning the notification and remedy of a safety-related defect would be issued due to any investigation opened as a result of granting this petition,&#8221; the petition concluded. &#8220;Therefore, upon full consideration of the information presented in the petition, and the potential risks to safety, the petition is denied.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The report did say that the agency would take further action if warranted, despite the denial of this current petition, if future findings identify safety-related defects.</p>
<p class="paywall">Even as NHTSA rejects this petition, it is still moving forward with a different<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/tesla-ordered-to-share-autopilot-data-with-the-us-traffic-safety-agency/"> investigation into Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot software</a> after certain cars that had activated the advanced driver assistance system crashed into 12 parked first responder vehicles with flashing lights, resulting in 17 injuries and one death since 2018. Tesla has until October 22 to hand over detailed Autopilot data or face fines up to $115 million, a slap on the wrist, really, considering the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-quarterly-profit-surpasses-1-billion/#:~:text=Tesla%20reported%20revenue%20of%20%2411.96,and%20%24600%20million%20in%20profit.">second quarter net income of $1.14 billion</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile website building platform <a href="https://onuniverse.com/">Universe</a> has launched a new update that brings advanced creative controls, enhanced themes, block features and more to its grid-based web builder. Universe allows users to create a custom site or open an e-commerce store directly from a mobile phone through a simplified grid system without the need for coding. The new update, GRID System II, aims to simplify previously complex coding processes into intuitive gestures to make the website-building process easier.</p>
<p>âWhat makes Universe special is the grid system and what weâre announcing today is a big upgrade of that grid system. Itâs going to allow people to do a lot more without any technical knowledge,â Universe CEO and founder Joseph Cohen told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>The website building process is based on simple building blocks, where the platform gives users a wide grid into which they can drop content. The new update brings redesigned creative controls with an improved graphical interface, which allows for control around block padding in the grid, along with granular text spacing. Cohen stated that users are now able to make the grid denser and can go up to seven columns wide. The new interface also includes enhanced color selection tools.</p>
<p>Further, Universe users can now also select from 30 new themes for their site or create their own. Prior to the addition of themes, every block was independently styled on a case-by-case basis. Now with the introduction of themes, users are able to apply consistent design elements across fonts, page backgrounds and button colors. The themes are applied to all surfaces of usersâ sites, including text, backgrounds, headlines and colors.</p>
<p>âWe have made 30 amazing themes that you can apply to your whole site. You could also go in and create your own theme from scratch. You can match or customize any of the ones that we give you out of the box. And any of the changes that you make will be applicable to your whole site. It&#8217;s basically a way of changing all the styles across the whole site in a visual and easy-to-use way,â Cohen stated.</p>
<p>Users can also now access new text styles, which allow them to classify text as titles, subtitles, captions and more. The company outlines that users can use the title indicator to boost SEO and enhance accessibility for their sites.</p>
<p>The new update also introduces a new layers feature that allows users to overlay blocks on top of each other. Previously, creators were unable to put two blocks, such as an image block and text block, on top of each other. With this new layers feature, users are given a lot more creative freedom with the design of their website.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Universe has also launched a new grid block feature that allows creators to combine different blocks in a sub-grid to create a cluster. It essentially lets you add a block to your site that creates another grid within that block, which can be used to add things like a photo gallery. Grid blocks allow for precise block arrangements to be placed on the grid. The sub-grid can then be dragged to any location on the page.</p>
<p>Although some may see Universe as a competitor to other popular website-building tools such as Shopify and Wix, Cohen says Universe is quite different.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212174" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FINAL_GRIID_Subgrid_Phone-Only.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212174" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2212174" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FINAL_GRIID_Subgrid_Phone-Only.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212174" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Universe</p></div></p>
<p>âWe invented a new interface called the grid, which basically allows someone who isn&#8217;t technical or isn&#8217;t a professional designer to create a totally custom website. There are other systems like Squarespace, Shopify, Weebly and Wix, but those are website builders that are desktop-based and template-based. Universe is not template-based, we do have templates available but it is not a template-based system. It&#8217;s not constrained by templates, so the grid itself is our interface for creation.â</p>
<p>In terms of usage, Cohen outlined that Universe has seen an increase in users amid the COVID-19 pandemic as many people started new businesses or side hustles and were looking to create websites. Early on in the pandemic, Universe released the ability for users to sell and ship products on their sites. As a result, users arenât required to sign up for a third-party e-commerce tool, such as Shopify.</p>
<p>âSince the pandemic started, our business has really ballooned over the past year and a half. In terms of overall growth, we have more or less 10x the business in terms of the number of active sites that are created,â Cohen noted.</p>
<p>Further, Cohen outlined that Universe saw an increase in users from the influencer community who want a âlink in bioâ site, which is essentially a URL at the end of an Instagram profile&#8217;s bio that redirects users to a website outside of Instagram. The redirected site is often used to sell products, link to other social media accounts, showcase a portfolio and more. Cohen saidÂ that 40% of the sites created on Universe are for âlink in bioâ purposes and that these types of sites are Universeâs biggest growing areas of business, in addition to commerce.</p>
<p>Cohen says that Universe currently has hundreds of thousands of active sites and that the company plans to continue to launch more consumer-friendly updates in the future as the platform continues to grow.</p>
<p>âWith this update, weâre leaping forward but we will continue to iterate this grid system for decades and in the fullness of time, anything thatâs possible on the internet will be possible with our grid system. This includes the core creative elements but also the commerce capabilities around building a business,â Cohen stated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s stock took a dive Monday as the site suffered one of its worst outages of the past decade with services across its entire suite of products going offline while the tech company struggled to even bring its own internal services back online.</p>
<p>The stock ended the day down nearly 5%, with Facebook shedding tens of billions in market cap value as the company sorted through the pieces attempting to diagnose what triggered the outage, and investors looked to calculate what lasting damage to the site could look like. Facebook stock has been on a tear in 2021, reaching a $1 trillion market cap in early July, though the share price has stalled in recent months with the market cap currently resting just south of $920 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear, a company pursuing needle-free approaches to glucose monitoring, has closed a $20.5 million Series B round. This Series B round is a vote of confidence by investors in GraphWearâs approach: to monitor key metrics in the body, like glucose, without breaking the skin at all.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear Technologies was founded in 2015 by Rajatesh Gudibande and Saurabh Radhakrishnan, who had both completed masterâs degrees in nanotechnology at the University of Pennsylvania. Specifically, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear is developing a skin-surface-level wearable made of graphene (more on this material later). The sensor is small, about the size of an Apple Watch &#8212; but the key piece of technology is actually housed on the bottom. Itâs a thin slice of graphene that fits onto the back of the watch, or onto a sticker that can be worn on the abdomen.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Series B round, says Gudibande, will be focused on helping the company build upon previous validation studies of the wearable, completing a pivotal trial and submitting for FDA clearance. The round was led by Mayfield, with participation from MissionBio Capital, Builders VC and VSC Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThe Holy Grail problem has been: can you really know what is happening in your blood without using things to prick your skin and draw blood out,â says Ursheet Parikh the co-leader of Mayfield&#8217;s engineering biology investment practice. âWe think GraphWear has made progress and is likely to be one of the first companies to actually bring a product that can get to hundreds of millions of people.âÂ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuous glucose monitoring has been a recent push within the diabetes community. There have been several continuous glucose monitors approved in recent years, like the FreeStyle Libre, <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpma/pma.cfm?id=P160030">approved by the FDA in 2017</a>. That device still uses a subcutaneous filament on an arm patch to measure glucose levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These devices have clear upsides for people with Type I diabetes (people whose bodies make little or no insulin). Thatâs about </span><a href="https://www.diabetes.org/resources/statistics/statistics-about-diabetes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.6 million people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. alone. The American Diabetes Association notes that most people who regularly inject insulin âshould be encouragedâ to use self-monitoring glucose technologies, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">including </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">continuous glucose monitors, in </span><a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/43/Supplement_1/S77"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its 2020 guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for people with Type II diabetes (</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/type2.html#:~:text=Healthy%20eating%20is%20your%20recipe,adults%20are%20also%20developing%20it."><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 34 million Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), or for people who donât regularly inject insulin, thereâs a bit more debate. <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/continuous-glucose-monitoring-blood-sugar-little-evidence-beneficial-type-2-diabetes-patients/">Some argue</a> that regularly monitoring glucose (which is what continuous glucose monitors do) isn&#8217;t worth it for these populations. For example <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2630691">one 2017</a> JAMA Internal Medicine study found that routine self-monitoring of glucose didn&#8217;t lead people to improve their A1c levels (a key diabetes biomarker) after one year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That study, though, evaluated people who regularly used finger-stick tests, rather than non-invasive continuous glucose monitors.Â </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the American Diabetes Association </span><a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/43/Supplement_1/S77"><span style="font-weight: 400;">notes that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if used properly, continuous glucose monitors in conjunction with insulin therapy, can be useful tools for these people as well.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWearâs sensor takes a nanotechnology-based approach to continuous glucose monitoring. And, unlike other continuous glucose monitors, which may require a small retractable filament or finger sticks to evaluate blood glucose, the device doesnât break the skin at all, says Gudibande.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThe graphene has an electric field that drags the molecules up,â Gudibande explains.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âYouâre talking about about 200 molecules,â he continues. âIt then âtastesâ it, converts it to an electrical signal, and then transports via Bluetooth to your phone that can chart and display glucose values continuously.âÂ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that these sensors are actually measuring the glucose present in interstitial fluid, not the glucose present in blood. However, thereâs evidence glucose measured from the interstitial fluid </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">â<a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/43/Supplement_1/S77">correlates well with plasma glucose</a>â</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, per the American Diabetes Associationâs 2020 guidelines, so measurements taken this way are still clinically relevant for people with diabetes. Gudibande adds, &#8220;our own empirical clinical data suggests the same.&#8221;Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear has already completed one </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04226846"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feasibility study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the wearable sensor on 40 patients with both Type I and Type II diabetes. They tested the deviceâs glucose monitoring against glucose measures collected from venous blood draws. Results have not yet been released. However, Gudibande says that GraphWearâs accuracy was âcomparableâ to that of the traditional sensor.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glucose monitoring aside, another big picture element to consider when it comes to GraphWear is the material the sensor is made of: graphene.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphene is a single-atom thin carbon sheet. It happens to be an </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2014.14676"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exceptional conductor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of electricity, and is strong, light and flexible. Since graphene was <a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200910/physicshistory.cfm#:~:text=The%20man%20who%20first%20discovered,State%20Physics%20in%20Chernogolovka%2C%20Russia.">discovered in 2004</a>, the material has generated a lot of hype &#8212; it was </span><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/9491789.stm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supposed to be the next silicon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though that hasnât quite happened yet.Â Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/27/graphene-wonder-material-national-security-china-uk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.K.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, China and </span><a href="https://graphene-flagship.eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the EU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are investing heavily in production of graphene at an industrial scale. And there are some graphene products leaking on the market already (itâs in bikes, shoes, sensors and tennis rackets, to name a few applications highlighted in a </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-019-0555-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 review paper)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear can keep the graphene used in its sensors âpristine,â says Gudibande, which allows it to be highly sensitive to glucose molecules that it may encounter. The company, says Parikh, can also manufacture the material at scale, and is developing new applications of nanotechnology that could be useful beyond sensing glucose. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the team has patented a way to use </span><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2017216641A3/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">polarized fluids as transistors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âIf your glucose molecules are on the skin, it becomes like a transient transistor that shows up,â says Parikh. âThat is a new class of transistor, and thatâs a fundamental innovation.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The glucose monitoring, though, is a smart first step for the company, because there&#8217;s a decently clear pathway to approval. If the companyâs upcoming pivotal trial demonstrates that itâs similar to other continuous glucose monitors it could pursue FDA 510(k) clearance. Though, as Gudibande acknowledges, there could be some unforeseen pitfalls. For instance, it&#8217;s possible that GraphWear&#8217;s noninvasive approach could put it in a class of its own.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âSo thereâs a risk to that, of whether we will be 510(k),â Gudibande says. âBut the process for that will be anywhere from six to 14 months. Our goal is to get through the trials and submit to the regulatory body.âÂ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If GraphWear can deliver on measuring other biomolecules using its graphene platform, they could use the platform to detect other molecules or continuously monitor whatâs going on inside the body. This Series B round, though, will be focused on delivering the first step: a clinically evaluated, graphene-based sensor.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Infrastructure as code (IaC) has been gaining wider adoption among DevOps teams in recent years, but the complexities of data center configuration and management continue to create problems â and opportunities.</p>
<p>We surveyed top investors in IaC startups to find out more.</p>
<p>Overall, they see a lot of room for growth given all of the manual work still done by DevOps teams across organizations of all sizes.</p>
<p>However, IaC itself requires highly trained engineers to implement and manage within organizations, and thereâs a shortage of software infrastructure engineers with IaC skills. This could favor IaC startups that are trying to offer complete solutions to customers.</p>
<p>At the same time, some large companies will continue to manage data centers internally and thus build out automation internally instead of with outside startups.</p>
<p>We spoke to:</p>

<h2><strong>Sheila Gulati, managing director, Tola Capital</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Can infrastructure as code be the solution for the implementation and configuration of servers, similar to how cloud was the solution for physical servers? Which areas do you think IaCâs capability to set up any cloud resource will be most used?</strong></p>
<p>The world of the modern cloud has shifted how we think about infrastructure altogether. We live in a multicloud and many-cloud world and these paradigms are redefining the modern cloud era. IaC can be used for any type of cloud workload or architecture, but it is a necessity for anyone building on the modern cloud. This is especially true for modern cloud architectures such as serverless applications, containerized applications running Kubernetes, AI/ML and more. Modern cloud architectures provide many benefits such as increased innovation, faster time to market, improved reliability and reduced costs. However, this has increased the burden of managing cloud infrastructure. The number of cloud services available is growing every year and modern architectures are composed of many loosely coupled, interdependent services and APIs. The result is that the number of cloud resources that people must manage is going up at a tremendous pace. The only way to manage this complexity is with IaC.</p>
<p>Today, we are seeing a new generation of IaC platforms that are designed from the ground up to meet the demands of the modern cloud. For example, <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a> and its cloud engineering platform is helping infrastructure teams and developers tame cloud complexity by enabling them to write code in the languages that they know and love, and use software engineering practices to build, deploy and manage cloud infrastructure. In contrast to legacy IaC tools that use domain specific languages, modern IaC platforms give practitioners the full power of programming languages, which make it easier to manage the complex interdependencies of modern cloud applications. They allow developers to use existing software development tools, including IDEs, package managers and test frameworks, which enable them to build faster and reuse best practices, while testing more frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Do you see IaCâs ability to streamline processes attracting startups in competitive sectors looking to get their product across the line first?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The companies in our portfolio who have embraced IaC and cloud engineering principles are also the ones most intent on rapid product development and streamlining their ability to bring new products to market faster. This requires investment in engineering talent, the platform and engineering practices.</p>
<p>It is important to take advantage of new cloud innovation to accelerate innovation and leverage IaC to more build products to efficiently meet customer needs. To support this it is critical for there to be partnership across providers within the IaC space to deliver the components that work together to support engineering teams.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have seen teams that lean into more modern development platforms able to hire better developers more easily â a concern of every tech company today. The cultures that are more dev-forward and that are truly embracing the shift-left movement are where the best developers want to work!</p>
<p><strong>Why are companies hesitant to adopt infrastructure as code? Can you outline the different ways IaC providers can market themselves to build their appeal?</strong></p>
<p>IaC should be the obvious choice for any company thatâs interested in delivering cloud applications at scale, reliably, and at high velocity. The concerns of the past are now obsolete. However, companies may hesitate to adopt it due to the cultural and process changes required, the risks of migrating an existing application, or they may not have the right skills on their team. In the past, we also had IaC platforms that required the use of domain-specific languages. All of this taken together can make the ramp to productivity seem steep.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Homo sapiens is truly a diverse species. We appear distinct from each other based on our origins in various regions of the planet; we communicate using thousands of languages; we have different thought patterns based on our experiences, heritage and cultures. Our brains are all unique; we analyze issues and make decisions using all of these properties &#8212; and many others.</p>
<p>These factors all directly affect how we do business and how we use tools to execute our duties. Doing business well is challenging enough for most people, but people with neurodiverse characteristics &#8212; professionals who &#8220;think different,&#8221; as the late Steve Jobs used to say &#8212; are a unique breed whose talent is too often underappreciated or untapped inside companies, which often value standardization and prefer limited deviations from normal work patterns.</p>
<h2>The role of neurodiversity</h2>
<p>Neurodivergent people process information differently from the way the mainstream does. Examples of this are people on the autism spectrum, with dyslexia, or those with attention deficit disorder, or ADD. Experts believe as much as <a href="https://adhdaware.org.uk/what-is-adhd/neurodiversity-and-other-conditions/">40% of the population</a> is neurodivergent.</p>
<p>Many think the percentage is even higher in the sales profession, given that good salespeople often are more persistent and think &#8220;out of the box.â Itâs not unlikely that someone on any given sales team is a superstar salesperson but has neurological variants affecting how they interact with information and with others. That makes a particularly interesting argument for the wisdom of integrating neuroatypical people into sales organizations and enabling them to thrive.</p>
<p>For example, salespeople use customer relationship management (CRM) software systems, where all records, workflows and analytics are standardized and the user experience is constrained to the <em>one</em> way the system was configured.</p>
<p>But not everybody can use such a complicated and rigid system optimally, especially when the user interaction layer is so strictly limited. Most neurodiverse people especially have difficulty with âopinionatedâ applications that tend to impose a certain way of working on the user, sometimes without considering all aspects of the userâs humanness &#8212; their unique way of processing information and navigating workflows. This is why in most sales organizations, the top-performing sales reps are often the ones who update the CRM least and why most salespeople use basic note-taking applications, tasks and spreadsheets to manage their own pipeline of deals.</p>
<p>Neurodiverse professionals bring different perspectives and strengths to the table and often challenge the status quo. It is this diversity of thought that gives an organization strength in special ways.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>What do companies have to gain from neurodiverse talent?</h2>
<p>JP Morgan created a neurodiversity pilot program in 2015 called Autism at Work, and the <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/news-stories/neurodiverse-hiring-brings-social-and-business-benefits">results were notable</a>. Employees in the program were 48% faster at completing tasks and 92% more productive than their peers. Preliminary <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/neurodiversity-as-a-competitive-advantage">results from another pilot program</a> at Australiaâs Department of Human Services found that the organizationâs neurodiverse software testing teams were 30% more productive than neurotypical teams.</p>
<p>Most autistic people are known to possess intense attention to detail. A 7-year-old boy on the autism spectrum, for example, has memorized the details of every shipwreck in history. This type of focus and appetite for information has remarkable potential when harnessed in the right roles. Autistic talent is often ideally suited to some of the fastest-growing segments of the knowledge economy, including data analytics, tech services and software engineering. In fact, Tesla CEO Elon Musk<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/12/business/elon-musk-aspergers/index.html"> recently revealed</a> that he has Aspergerâs syndrome, a form of autism.</p>
<p>In another neurodiversity area, out-of-the-box thinkers are often dyslexic. Consider some of the dyslexic people who have changed the world: Steve Jobs, Richard Branson and Bill Gates, to name a few. What they have in common is the ability to look at the world differently.</p>
<h2>The software dilemma</h2>
<p>More and more companies are getting the message: Neurodivergent employees should be appreciated as a huge source of talent and contributions. At the same time, increased awareness of social injustices of all kinds in the wake of the events of 2020 has spurred more organizations to recognize neurodiversity as part of their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p>
<p>But to this point, the focus has largely been on how hiring, training, onboarding processes, and even office design (when we all return to offices) can be more inclusive for neurodivergent people. For example, SAP and Microsoft have expanded efforts to hire more neuroatypical employees.</p>
<p>Those initiatives are important, but we believe software companies need to go a step further and change their approach at the core design level.</p>
<p>A lot of software imposes a certain way of working on users, with little to no care about how everything feels and flows from the userâs perspective. And along the way, this rigid system ends up excluding many people who are neurodiverse. As a result, users face challenges in their day-to-day jobs because the tools theyâve been provided don&#8217;t fit with how they process information and navigate their workflows, all in the name of standardization, and organizations then suffer from poor adoption of their tools and systems.</p>
<p>No vendor does this intentionally; itâs just that itâs difficult to do and do well. But it should become a core value for every software company to pursue empathetic software design that imagines and caters to all users, and helps everyone be equally efficient and productive. It starts with recognizing and appreciating that not all âusersâ are the same, which then leads to designing more flexible and approachable software that a larger percentage of people can use naturally.</p>
<p>If sales organizations have more than their share of neurodivergent people, imagine the effect that the wrong kind of tools can have â say, CRM software that demands a person with ADHD handle a plethora of tedious data entry tasks. Imagine all the frustration, lost potential and damaged morale because a skilled, neurodiverse salesperson simply was given the wrong tools for them to demonstrate their full potential.</p>
<p>The time has come for the industry as a whole to expand its thinking about software user experience and include flexibility as a key design principle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Informatica <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1868778/000119312521289749/d169828ds1.htm">filed to go public</a> late last week, some six years after it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/08/informatica-could-feel-a-tight-squeeze-from-its-new-owners/">taken private by two private equity teams for $5.3 billion</a>. The data-focused company used its passage through the private markets to execute a move to the cloud, work that came to a head in early 2021, when Informatica announced its <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/informaticas-journey-to-the-cloud/">dive into the lakehouse market</a>, where Databricks plays today.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll explore the company&#8217;s IPO filing to figure out just how strong of a cloud business it has managed to build and how winsome its overall economic profile appears. While the company has yet to set an initial IPO price range giving us an indicator of where it might be valued, there are media reports of a valuation <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-01/permira-backed-technology-company-informatica-files-for-ipo">as high as $10 billion</a>.</p>
<p>A number that big demands exploration. Let&#8217;s get into the numbers.</p>
<h2>Inside Informatica&#8217;s business</h2>
<p>Turning back the clock to 2015, the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2015/04/22/727263/11123/en/Informatica-Reports-First-Quarter-Results.html">final Informatica earnings release</a> that we could find from its last run at being a public company is dated April 22, 2015. That was just days after the company&#8217;s takeover was announced, so the timing makes sense.</p>
<p>At the time, Informatica reported revenues of $250.5 million, up 3% from its year-ago comp. That revenue growth number was more than anemic but did contain an interesting seed of good news, namely that &#8220;subscription revenues&#8221; at the company were up 47% on a year-over-year basis. Sure, every company wants you to focus more on its growth business than its overall performance, but the subscription result was pretty strong, even if it was from a modest base figure ($21.3 million).</p>
<p>And in that final period &#8212; the quarter ended March 31, 2015 &#8212; Informatica generated $32.2 million in operating income and $21.6 million worth of net income. At the time it went private, Informatica was profitable and slow growing, albeit with a new business arm that was putting up pretty notable revenue expansion.</p>
<p>What happened over the last half-decade or so?</p>
