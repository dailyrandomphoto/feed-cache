										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok released a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/tiktok-transparency-report-2021-q-2?lang=en">transparency update</a> about content that was removed from the platform between April 1 and June 30, 2021. The platform says it removed 81,518,334 videos for violating its community guidelines or terms of service during that time period, which represents less than 1% of the total videos posted. This also means that during that quarter, 8.1 billion+ videos were posted on TikTok, averaging out to about 90 million videos posted each day.</p>
<p>TikTok <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/advancing-our-approach-to-user-safety">rolled out technology</a> in July that automatically removes content that violates its policies on minor safety, adult nudity and sexual activities, violent and graphic content, and illegal activities. The app uses automation for these kinds of content in particular, because it says these are the areas where its technology has the highest degree of accuracy. TikTok also has human content moderators on its safety team that reviews reported content.</p>
<p>When the automated technology was announced, TikTok said its false-positive rate for removals &#8212; when it removes content that actually doesn&#8217;t violate rules &#8212; is 5%. This number is reflected in the transparency report released today, as about 4.6 million of the 81 million removed videos were reinstated. The most common reason for content to be removed, encompassing 41.3% of removed videos, was for violation of minor safety guidelines. TikTok says that 94.1% of all removed content was identified and taken down before a user reported it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217561" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Still, within that 5% of falsely removed content lies some troubling examples of failed content moderation, like when popular Black creator </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ziggityler?lang=en">Ziggi Tyler</a> <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tiktok-algorithm-prevents-user-declaring-support-black-lives-matter-n1273413">pointed out</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> that the app would flag his account bio as &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; when he included phrases like &#8220;Black Lives Matter&#8221; or &#8220;I am a black man.&#8221; Meanwhile, phrases like &#8220;supporting white supremacy&#8221; weren&#8217;t immediately censored.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pHc5h3rjd7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/">TikTok reached 1 billion monthly active users</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok reached 1 billion monthly active users&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/embed/#?secret=pHc5h3rjd7" data-secret="pHc5h3rjd7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/youtube-will-now-ban-content-with-vaccine-misinformation/">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/08/facebook-bans-vaccine-misinformation">Facebook</a> move to ban content with vaccine misinformation, other prominent social media companies like TikTok must decide how to tackle similar issues. TikTok&#8217;s community guidelines <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en/covid-19/">ban content</a> that&#8217;s false or misleading about COVID-19, vaccines and more broad anti-vaccine disinformation.</p>
<p>In Q2, TikTok removed 27,518 videos due to COVID-19 misinformation. TikTok says that 83% of these videos were removed before they were reported by users, 87.6% of these videos were removed within 24 hours of posting, and 69.7% of the videos had zero views. Meanwhile, TikTok&#8217;s COVID-19 information hub, developed with information from the WHO and CDC, was viewed over 921 million times globally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Numbers-wise, it&#8217;s no secret that TikTok continues to grow, as the app crossed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/">1 billion monthly active user</a> landmark last month. The numbers in these transparency reports also reflect that growth &#8212; in the first half of 2020, TikTok removed 104 million videos, which represented 1% of all content posted. That 1% removal rate is consistent with the data published today, but today&#8217;s report accounts for 81 million videos posted in just one quarter, rather than two quarters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Here&#8217;s another edition of “Dear Sophie,” the advice column that answers immigration-related questions about working at technology companies.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My fiancé and I got engaged early this year. We’re planning a wedding for later in the year when my family can travel to the U.S. from Estonia, where I’m originally from. I’ve been living and working in the U.S. for almost two years on an L-1A visa. </strong></p>
<p><strong>My company is sponsoring me for an EB-1C green card, but the process has been slow. I’m thinking about getting a green card through my spouse when we’re married. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there anything in particular that I should keep in mind? Also, would it be a problem if I keep my maiden name after my fiancé and I get married?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Fantastic Fiancée</strong></p>
<p>Dear Fantastic,</p>
<p>Congratulations on your engagement!</p>
<p>My law partner, Anita Koumriqian, and I recently chatted about how our first clients as new immigration lawyers were in the process of obtaining <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/marriage-based-green-cards/">marriage-based green cards</a>, and the joy that supporting couples brings us! On our <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/092-marrying-a-u-s-citizen/">podcast</a>, we also talked about the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/k-1-visa/">K-1 Fiancé(e) Visa</a>. Take a listen!</p>
<p>I can understand why you may be considering alternative green card options since one of the requirements of the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/021-intracompany-transfers-l-1-visas-and-eb-1c-green-cards-for-multinational-managers-executives-and-people-with-specialized-knowledge/">EB-1C</a> green card for multinational transferee executives and managers is you must have been employed with your multinational company outside of the U.S. for at least one of the last three years and there’s no premium processing yet. Since this particular category is company-specific, it can make changing companies challenging.</p>
<p>As always, I recommend consulting an immigration attorney who can discuss your options based on your particular situation and goals, as well as help you through the marriage-based green card process and accompany you and your husband to the green card interview if you decide to take that route.</p>

<h2>Can I keep my maiden name?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can keep your maiden name! This should have no impact on your prospects for a green card through marriage. The key to a marriage-based green card is demonstrating that you married for love, not a green card — a “bona fide” marriage in legal terms. You will have to demonstrate that your marriage is in good faith and that you’re braiding your lives together.</p>
<p>The immigration officer evaluating your case will look for evidence such as photos from your wedding, a lease agreement or a mortgage loan signed by both of you, your 401(k) plans that list each other as the beneficiary, a joint bank account that’s frequently used to pay for household expenses, automobile or homeowners insurance policies listing both of your names, photographs and other possible evidence of your good faith marriage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Payments company <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> announced it&#8217;s building out a new crypto team to help build out the &#8220;future of Web3 payments,&#8221; according to public statements posted to Twitter on Tuesday. Stripe, which had once been among the first to support Bitcoin payments before <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support">leaving</a> the market a few years ago, has been watching for the right time to get back in.  But how those plans will play out is still largely unknown.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Stripe declined to share any additional insights or details about its strategy, pointing only to its new public statements and its <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support">earlier blog post</a>.</p>
<p>In January 2018, Stripe had <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support">announced</a> it was ending support for Bitcoin payments that April, saying that the cryptocurrency had become less useful for payments for a variety of reasons.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217522" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company noted then that transaction confirmation times had risen, leading to increased failure rates, and fees had also grown substantially. However, Stripe said then that it still remained &#8220;very optimistic&#8221; about cryptocurrencies overall and particularly projects like <a href="https://lightning.network/">Lightning</a> and others that could enable faster payments. It also referenced other developments like <a href="https://cdn.omise.co/omg/whitepaper.pdf">OmiseGO</a> and said there were a number of high-potential projects based on Ethereum in the works, as well.</p>
<p>Now, after sitting on the sidelines for years, Stripe is re-entering the crypto space.</p>
<p>According to a post by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwinwee1/">Edwin Wee</a> on Stripe&#8217;s user relations team, Stripe is looking for Web3 engineers and designers to flesh out its new crypto team. While Stripe didn&#8217;t want to explain its vision, Wee&#8217;s post offers a bit more insight into how the company sees the market today.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crypto holds the potential of faster and less expensive payments, particularly in underserved markets,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2018, we said that Stripe would &#8216;look for opportunities to help our customers by adding support for crypto in the future.&#8217; That time has come,&#8221; Wee announced.</p>
<p>The team is being led by Stripe&#8217;s Head of Engineering, <a href="https://twitter.com/gponcin">Guillaume Poncin</a>, who also posted about the job openings. There are currently four roles listed for crypto engineers in New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and in remote positions, but Stripe isn&#8217;t saying how many total employees it is looking to bring on out of the pool of job applicants.</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s no harm in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/">$95 billion company</a> dabbling in crypto once again, it&#8217;s unclear at this time how significant this announcement is in terms of Stripe&#8217;s broader corporate strategy.</p>
<p>That said, the market for crypto payments has heated up since Stripe&#8217;s exit in 2018. In addition to <a href="https://tracxn.com/d/trending-themes/Startups-in-Crypto-Payments">numerous</a> crypto payment startups entering the space and increased <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/7-companies-where-you-can-pay-with-crypto/">acceptance</a> by larger brands and retailers, payments giant PayPal has also taken major steps to embrace crypto in recent months.</p>
<p>In November 2020, PayPal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/paypal-says-all-users-in-u-s-can-now-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies/">announced</a> it was now possible for all U.S. users to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies on its platform. It recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/paypal-expands-the-ability-to-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrency-to-the-u-k/">expanded</a> that to international markets and to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/venmo-adds-support-for-buying-holding-and-selling-cryptocurrencies/">payments</a> app Venmo. More importantly, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/paypals-new-feature-allows-u-s-consumers-to-check-out-using-cryptocurrency/">launched a feature</a> that would allow U.S. consumers to check out using their cryptocurrency at any PayPal merchant, significantly broadening the potential for using crypto for online payments.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, cryptocurrency exchange Binance has <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/04/binance-pay-bringing-crypto-payments-to-shopify-others/">partnered</a> with e-commerce giant Shopify on crypto payments, while Coinbase has been making buying and spending crypto more accessible through integrations with <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/a-new-way-to-buy-crypto-on-coinbase-using-paypal-e9162f735dcb">PayPal</a>, <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/now-use-your-coinbase-card-with-apple-pay-and-google-pay-df951ad52c89">Apple Pay and Google Pay</a>, as consumer adoption grows.</p>
<p>Stripe, meanwhile, is not alone in thinking about crypto&#8217;s potential in &#8220;underserved&#8221; markets. <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/equityinvestment">Square this summer announced</a> it was allocating the remaining $25 million of its $100 million investment in support of minority and underserved communities, with $5 million of that total going to the Square, Inc. Bitcoin Endowment.</p>
<p>&#8220;From those with no credit history who cannot open bank accounts, to people living in places with limited access to banks, to populations that have historically been discriminated against, Bitcoin can help level the playing field and build a more inclusive future,&#8221; Square had said. Perhaps Stripe now agrees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a rather surprising move, the makers of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/the-remarkable-2-improves-on-the-original-in-every-way-but-remains-firmly-in-its-niche/">reMarkable</a> line of e-paper tablets have <a href="https://remarkable.com/blog/introducing-connect-a-new-chapter-for-remarkable/">added a subscription service</a> to their latest device that enables several of its more advanced features. All current users are provided a lifetime subscription, and new users get about a year for free, so nothing will change for most, but it&#8217;s still a considerable pivot for the startup.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://remarkable.com/store/connect">reMarkable Connect</a> service comes in two tiers, a basic $5/month one that upgrades you to unlimited cloud storage for your documents, then an $8/month tier that adds access to Google Drive and Dropbox integration, handwriting conversion, screen sharing, send by mail and fast sync. With no subscription, devices will still sync but not for files left unopened for 50 days (so basically, you can&#8217;t use it as an archive). Anyone buying a reMarkable will get up to $150 off if they purchase a Connect subscription with it, which is pretty much break-even at a year or so.</p>
<p>On one hand, it&#8217;s an unexpected and somewhat dubious move: to charge for features that were essentially announced as simply part of the reMarkable suite of tools months back. And in fact those features were launched as ordinary free ones in recent weeks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216860" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>On the other, it&#8217;s somewhat understandable in terms of revenue and just about the best way to implement this: every current user gets it free, and everyone else gets a free year, plus there&#8217;s a free option that doesn&#8217;t hurt much if you use your device pretty casually.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked the company for comment on the reasoning behind this decision and will update this post when I hear back.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/the-remarkable-2-improves-on-the-original-in-every-way-but-remains-firmly-in-its-niche/">When I reviewed the reMarkable 2 last year</a>, I was impressed by the hardware, the responsiveness of the screen, and the simplicity of the interface. But as I noted then, despite its strengths the tablet really is still very much a niche device. Having spoken with the creators several times I&#8217;m convinced of their dedication to the vision of a sort of future paper that has an emphasis on focus and zero distraction. I get that, and I&#8217;m definitely into it — but the digital economy basically runs on distraction and overload, so it must be hard to carve a piece of that pie.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has shipped well over 100,000 units and raised capital as well, but dedicated hardware startups are few and far between. It&#8217;s not too surprising that the company would be looking for ways to bolster its income as hardware sales approached saturation.</p>
<p>Who knows but it might be a play for a broader &#8220;focused productivity&#8221; suite, something I would definitely use. My criticisms of the device and service were that while what it did, it did well, but it didn&#8217;t do enough. A Chrome extension added article saving, but as a Pocket user I wish I could just connect that. Same for other content that would simply feel better to experience on the reMarkable. While I appreciate the minimalist philosophy, it felt arbitrarily limited, and now that there&#8217;s screen sharing and Drive/Dropbox integration, they can hardly argue against inclusion of other services.</p>
<p>By all means no email, no chat, no social functions, nothing like that — let me focus! — but let me focus on anything, not just stuff that fits through the bottleneck of reMarkable services. Everyone could use a little more focus in their lives, but it helps to reduce the friction to achieve that focus as well.</p>
<p>Oh, and a front light would be nice too, while I&#8217;m making feature requests. Look, my eyes aren&#8217;t what they used to be. Help me out.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent a pair of letters to Tesla targeting the company&#8217;s use of non-disclosure agreements for owners who gain early access to its &#8220;full self-driving&#8221; software beta as well as its decision to use an over-the-air software update to fix an issue that regulators say should have been a recall. [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent a pair of letters to Tesla targeting the company&#8217;s use of non-disclosure agreements for owners who gain early access to its &#8220;full self-driving&#8221; software beta as well as its decision to use an over-the-air software update to fix an issue that regulators say should have been a recall<b data-stringify-type="bold">.</b></p>
<p>The letters signal NHTSA&#8217;s increasing scrutiny of Tesla and its practices related to over-the-air software updates and automated driving features within its Autopilot advanced driver assistance system.</p>
<p>Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver assistance system branded as Autopilot. For an additional $10,000, owners can buy “full self-driving,” or FSD — software that CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly promised will one day deliver full autonomous driving capabilities.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217463" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>FSD, which has steadily increased in price and added new functions, has been available as an option for years. However, Tesla vehicles are not self-driving. FSD includes the parking feature Summon as well as Navigate on Autopilot, an active guidance system that navigates a car from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp, including interchanges and making lane changes. The latest FSD beta is supposed to automate driving on highways and city streets.</p>
<p>However, this is still a Level 2 driver assistance system that requires the driver to pay attention, have their hands on the wheel and be able to take control at all times.</p>
<p>The first letter, dated October 12, asked Tesla to explain why the company didn&#8217;t issue a recall when it used a software update to correct how its Autopilot advanced driver assistance system detects emergency vehicles in low light conditions. In NHTSA&#8217;s view, using an over-the-air software update to repair anything related to vehicle safety should be a recall.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Tesla is aware, the Safety Act imposes an obligation on manufacturers of motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment to initiate a recall by notifying NHTSA when they determine vehicles or equipment they produced contain defects related to motor vehicle safety or do not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard,&#8221; the agency wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>NHTSA stated that a recall notice must be filed with the agency no more than five working days after the manufacturer knew or should have known of the safety defect or noncompliance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any manufacturer issuing an over-the-air update that mitigates a defect that poses an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety is required to timely file an accompanying recall notice to NHTSA,&#8221; the letter continued.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOT-PE21020-85593P.pdf">second letter</a>, also dated October 12, addressed Tesla&#8217;s use of NDAs for its so-called FSD early access beta release program. Owners have already paid for FSD, but Tesla has required NDAs to access the beta software. Last month, Musk also instituted another requirement — a safety score that uses personal driving data to determine whether owners can access the latest beta version.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given that NHTSA relies on reports from consumers as an important source of information in evaluating potential safety defects, any agreement that may prevent or dissuade participants in the early access beta release program from reporting safety concerns to NHTSA is unacceptable,&#8221; the agency wrote in the letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, even limitations on sharing certain information publicly adversely impacts NHTSA&#8217;s ability to obtain information relevant to safety. In order to ensure that non-disclosure agreements regarding the FSD early access beta release do not interfere with NHTSA&#8217;s ability to exercise its oversight responsibilities we are issuing the attached Special Order to Tesla.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musk indicated on Twitter this week that Tesla would drop the NDA requirement.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It will be available in perforated rolls</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The agency, however, is seeking more information and said Tesla has until November 1 to respond to both requests.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Years before he co-launched a stealthy business to fix the messy world of health data, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauravkaushikphd">Gaurav Kaushik</a> was slowly connecting the dots on how better visualization could impact health outcomes. In 2018, the budding entrepreneur was working with a Boston-based cancer research company and FlatIron Health to see how cancer patients, mutations in their cancer and health outcomes were all related.</p>
<p>Eventually, his team did an analysis that suggested that patients with triple-negative breast cancer, a harsh form of cancer that particularly affects women of color, respond well to immunotherapies.</p>
<p>Understanding the impact of connecting unorganized patient data with treatment plans, Kaushik seeded the impetus for<a href="https://www.science.io/"> ScienceIO</a>, a new startup he co-founded with CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/WillManidis">Will Manidis</a>, a former Thiel fellow and managing partner of Dorm Room Fund. The startup is using natural language processing and data analytics to create a massive database of patient data that can help stakeholders better understand, and treat, people holistically.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216917" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“You can’t navigate without a map, and there is no map for healthcare. If we want to understand basic things — like which patients have dire, unmet needs and need special attention or new solutions, or finding novel treatments for rare diseases — that takes thousands of hours of labor and years to uncover,” Manidis said.</p>
<p>Now, ScienceIO is not the first startup to try to fix healthcare data. And it likely won’t be the last. The startup’s differentiator, though, is that it has spent years building up a database of what it claims is the most representative data out there.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve spent the past two years building the first healthcare AI platform of its kind. We’re taking a data-first approach to artificial intelligence, building the technology necessary to turn disparate healthcare data into high-quality, computable data,&#8221; said Kaushik. &#8220;There’s tremendous opportunity to build data-powered solutions in healthcare, and we’re excited to see an ecosystem of companies emerge and benefit from our platform and the broader [natural language processing] renaissance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Natural language processing (NLP) is an advancing technology that makes it easier for computers to understand human speech. The company explained how NLP can be used for sentiment analysis, in which the technology looks at a social media post and predicts how the human behind it is feeling. ScienceIO’s application of NLP combines machine learning to find variables that impact patient health, using over 9 million medical conditions, drugs, device and genes as potential clues.</p>

<p>The broadness means that the product is applicable to a number of different potential customers. Broadly, for example, Kaushik thinks that clinicians would be able to build a fuller picture of patients based on their backgrounds.</p>
<p>“The patients you deal with have a litany of healthcare issues, and it’s not enough to say we understand your cancer really well, or we independently understand socio-economic conditions,” Kaushik said. “It’s about incredible depth across every subject area, and the totality of the patient without minimizing them.”</p>
<p>He added: “The reason we spent three years not talking to the world and building this data set was to ensure we represent the patients that capture what a physician should see, rather than reduce them to their biorisks.”</p>
<p>Manidis gave an example that includes insurance providers, who get thousands of medical plans &#8212; and data points such as bill codes, costs, conditions &#8212; everyday.</p>
<p>“You are trying to figure out how to prioritize [claims], either to send it to adjudication or look for things like fraud detection,” Manidis said. “You can use ScienceIO to structure the data and then understand claims, and reimburse patients faster [and] more accurately.”</p>
<p>Notably, ScienceIO doesn’t track, it just makes data more searchable and produces analytics that can be turned into usable insights. ScienceIO said that it is currently in pilot programs with several customers, but declined to give specific names. The results of these pilots, per Kaushik, will help them decide a realistic timeline for general availability.</p>
<p>The progress so far has helped the once-stealthy business raise an $8 million seed round. Investors in the round include institutional investors such as Section 32 and Sea Lane Ventures, as well as entrepreneurs including Lachy Groom and Josh Buckley.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/classpass/">ClassPass</a>, the subscription-based fitness marketplace most recently valued at $1 billion, is today announcing that it has been acquired by Mindbody.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mindbodyonline.com/">Mindbody</a> is a bit like the OpenTable of the fitness world. Its booking software is used by studios, gyms, and other experience-based service providers — the company recently signed a global agreement with Blo blowdry bar, for example — for customers and organizations to book their appointments, classes, etc.</p>
<p>ClassPass helps fill classes, while Mindbody provides the software that helps fitness centers run their business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217452" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Mindbody&#8217;s CEO Josh McCarter said that it was an all-stock deal. Alongside the acquisition, Mindbody is also announcing that it has secured a $500 million investment for the merged entity led by Sixth Street.</p>
<p>ClassPass launched back in 2012 with a model not unlike Mindbody&#8217;s current model. Founder and then-CEO Payal Kadakia envisioned a site that would let you book classes a la carte from a variety of studios and gyms. Turns out, people weren&#8217;t as motivated as she expected.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;ClassPass, finally a unicorn, raises $285 million in new funding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/classpass-finally-a-unicorn-raises-285-million-in-new-funding/embed/#?secret=msyePizoZk" data-secret="msyePizoZk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Through a series of iterations, <a href="https://classpass.com/">ClassPass</a> moved to a subscription model, allowing users to pay for a monthly subscription that would let them access a specific number classes across a spectrum of fitness genres.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over time, high-usage customers were being subsidized by the lower-usage customers. Meanwhile, studios and gyms with their various classes and instructors were all being treated equally, regardless of whether a class was with a popular instructor or during peak hours.</p>
<p>This led ClassPass to introduce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/classpass-begins-testing-variable-pricing-as-it-expands-beyond-studio-fitness/">virtual currency and variable pricing</a>. This allowed studios to price their classes based on a handful of factors, and ensured that customers were paying for exactly what they were using.</p>
<p>Once the company found that footing, it was off to the races in terms of growth. A huge international expansion commenced alongside a massive funding round led by Temasek. The biggest obstacle since then has been the pandemic, which hit gyms and fitness studios particularly hard.</p>
<p>But McCarter and ClassPass CEO Fritz Lanman told TechCrunch that all their data points to immense pent up demand for in-person fitness classes and experiences.</p>
<p>By combining forces, the Mindbody/ClassPass entity has the opportunity for huge growth. ClassPass studios that are not using a booking software — Lanman says it&#8217;s about one-third of the studios on ClassPass — will now have the chance to sign up with Mindbody.</p>
<p>Mindbody&#8217;s consumer-facing business will have the chance to double-down on their experience by signing up for a ClassPass subscription and get access to those studios. And, of course, gyms and studios that use Mindbody for a la carte bookings could be upsold to ClassPass, as well.</p>
<p>Lanman and McCarter stressed that gyms and studios on the ClassPass network will not be required to use Mindbody, and vice versa.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because we think it&#8217;s critical that ClassPass maintains its advantage of having as much inventory available in a particular marketplace,&#8221; said McCarter. &#8220;That means they need to work with businesses that are potentially on some of our competitors&#8217; software.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, there will be no forced migration for any business from one software platform to the other, and the same goes on the consumer-facing sides of the business.</p>
<p>ClassPass will maintain its brand, and Lanman told TechCrunch that there are no redundancies or layoffs planned.</p>
<p>Lanman likened the deal to the Facebook/Instagram merger from way back when.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at Instagram and Facebook,&#8221; said Lanman. &#8220;Instagram was only a small company when Facebook bought it, and Facebook really turbocharged it using its superior scale and services breath.&#8221;</p>
<p>The key, according to both Lanman and McCarter, is navigating their way through the end of the pandemic with as many studios, gyms, and service providers in tact.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re lucky in that most of our customers are vaccinated,&#8221; said Lanman. But, certainly people don&#8217;t want to work out face masks, and there&#8217;s still massive mandates in some places. And so, the top complexity of risk to the business and execution is just how many of these small businesses can we keep keep in business. And how long can they hold on? But we&#8217;re seeing really encouraging signs of resilience in the industry so far.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://astropad.com/product/lunadisplay/">Luna Display from Astropad</a> is a clever product enabling you to use your iPad as a second display. It was originally launched for Mac only, but Apple launched a competing product, putting the company in jeopardy for a couple of years. Today, it&#8217;s available for Windows machines as well, completing Astropad&#8217;s pivot to a multiplatform product.</p>
<p>To say that the company has had a hard time with bringing its products to market would be the understatement of the century. We&#8217;ve been following the company and its product for its long and arduous route. The company originally launched its product about five years ago, then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/10/the-luna-wireless-portable-ipad-display-adapter-is-now-available-for-80/">added a wireless module</a> back in 2018 to get rid of the pesky wires. Its rapid rise to stardom was torpedoed when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/28/apples-sidecar-just-really-gets-me-you-know/">Apple launched Sidecar back in 2019</a>, effectively making Luna&#8217;s product moot, and sending the company into crisis mode.</p>
<p>To its credit, the company and its founders have been good at staying transparent with its offering throughout. Once Apple beat it at its own game, <a href="https://astropad.com/blessing-in-disguise/">the founders kept the lights on</a> and announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/following-apples-sidecar-launch-astropad-announces-luna-display-for-windows/">a year ago that it pivoted to working on a Windows product instead</a>, fueling its product development with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/767721702/luna-display-for-windows/description">a $400,000 Kickstarter project</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217077" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2217110" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217110" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2217110" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LunaWorkspace.jpg" alt="Luna Display" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LunaWorkspace.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LunaWorkspace.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LunaWorkspace.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LunaWorkspace.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LunaWorkspace.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LunaWorkspace.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LunaWorkspace.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217110" class="wp-caption-text">The red dongle on the left of the computer is the Luna Display. Here, it&#8217;s wirelessly throwing to an iPad operating as a secondary display. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Astropad</p></div></p>
<p>As part of the Kickstarter project, Astropad originally promised a May 2021 launch, but as things go in the world of product development, the company and its 6,000 Kickstarter backers were treated to a number of delays along the way. It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but that Windows product is finally here, along with version 5.0 of Luna Display. On paper, at least, the product looks promising; the Luna dongle plugs in and communicates with Mac or Windows operating systems, unlocking iPad support for gestures, Apple Pencil and the use of external keyboards. The company claims a latency of only 16ms. Not as good as Apple&#8217;s claimed 9ms latency for its Sidecar product, but it&#8217;s quick enough for most use cases that don&#8217;t require real-time input. Don&#8217;t expect to be doing heavy-duty design work or gaming on the display, in other words, but showing a Chrome tab or a Word document will work perfectly fine.</p>
<p>The company claims that its customers have been clamoring for Windows support, with a total of 8,000 preorders. No doubt, its patient and loyal followers will be delighted that they can finally get their mitts on the product they&#8217;ve been waiting for.</p>
<p>The solution supports a few different modes of operation &#8212; you can use an iPad as a secondary display, you can use<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/luna-display-now-supports-older-macs-as-a-secondary-screen/"> another Mac (including older equipment) as a secondary display</a>, or you can run the product in &#8220;headless mode.&#8221; In this configuration, you can use your Mac or PC as the primary display for your desktop Mac &#8212; such as a Mac Mini or a Mac Pro.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To build out the software stack powering the solution, Astropad relied on the Rust programming language. For fans of such things, <a href="https://astropad.com/why-rust/">the company&#8217;s CEO Matt Ronge did an interesting deep-dive into the pros and cons</a> of using a relatively new language to build a low-latency solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Rust, we’ll have a high-performance and portable platform that we can easily run on Mac, iOS, Linux, Android, and Windows,&#8221; says Ronge. &#8220;Not only will this drastically expand our potential market size, but we also see many interesting new uses for our LIQUID technology that we’ll be able to pursue with our Rust based platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luna Display costs $129, and is <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/collections/luna-display-mac-and-pc/products/luna-display">available directly from Astropad starting today</a>, for both Mac and Windows, using USB-C, Mini DisplayPort or HDMI connectivity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft, Cisco, and Amplitude talk security at TC Sessions: SaaS this month.</p>
<p class="c-mrkdwn__pre" data-stringify-type="pre">Enterprises face a constant stream of threats from nation-state hackers and cybercriminals to corporate insiders. But the pandemic upended the world of work that saw millions of people shift from their downtown city offices to their spare room at home practically overnight.</p>
<p class="c-mrkdwn__pre" data-stringify-type="pre">The cloud held its own and reigned supreme, no longer as something we took for granted, but as a critical tool for keeping companies afloat during the lockdowns of 2020.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217278" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="c-mrkdwn__pre" data-stringify-type="pre">With change also comes adjustment. Just as companies and their employees became accustomed to the new way of working, so have the bad actors. The cloud can store near-infinite amounts of data and deliver apps as a service, beaming directly into the homes of employees around the world, or wherever they work.</p>
<p class="c-mrkdwn__pre" data-stringify-type="pre">But with it comes a new set of challenges and risks, and bad actors are taking notes. Just as we adjust to this adapted way of working, startups and corporations alike can&#8217;t afford to stay off the security pulse.</p>
<p class="c-mrkdwn__pre" data-stringify-type="pre">That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re thrilled to have three leading cybersecurity veterans at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=saassecuritypost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=saassecuritypost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Sessions: SaaS on October 27</a> to talk all things SaaS security.</p>
<p class="c-mrkdwn__pre" data-stringify-type="pre">TechCrunch will be joined by Edna Conway, vice president and chief security &amp; risk officer for Azure at Microsoft; Wendy Nather, head of advisory CISOs at Cisco, and Olivia Rose, vice president of IT and security at Amplitude for a live discussion to talk about the state of the SaaS security union, and what startups need to know about SaaS security now and in the future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to our discussion on security, the conference will also include Google’s Javier Soltero, Amplitude’s Olivia Rose, as well as investors Kobie Fuller and Casey Aylward, among others. We hope you’ll join us. It’s going to be a thought-provoking lineup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AB Volvo, the construction truck arm of Sweden’s Volvo Group, unveiled a new vehicle Wednesday made with a majority of “fossil-free” steel, plus plans to begin smaller-scale series production using the new material as early as 2022.</p>
<p>“Our intention is to start to build these vehicles, these relatively small-load carriers, utilizing this fossil-free steel,” Lars Stenqvist, executive VP of trucks technology at AB Volvo, told TechCrunch in a recent interview. “It&#8217;s important to say it&#8217;s not a research and development project or some kind of demonstration project to show up for politicians. This is serial production.”</p>
<p>The prototype vehicle, a fully electric and autonomous load carrier for use in mining and quarries, is composed of over 3,000 kilograms (6,600 pounds) of the new steel. Volvo said it targeted construction trucks first because, on average, around 70% of the vehicle weight comes from steel and cast iron.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217520" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The steel was manufactured by SSAB, a Swedish steelmaker with whom Volvo entered into a partnership earlier this year. Conventional steel manufacturing uses coal to extract oxygen out of the iron ore, but SSAB has developed a process to make steel using hydrogen. The hydrogen is produced via electrolysis, a process that uses renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
<p>The load carrier unveiled today is not composed of 100% fossil-free steel, because SSAB doesn’t have access to certain geometries yet, like those needed to produce cylindrical shafts, Stenqvist said. He added that the majority of the components and particularly the large bucket on the back of the vehicle are fossil-free.</p>
<p>The steel from SSAB is identical in all ways to conventional steel, which means it can be used in all of Volvo’s existing manufacturing facilities. “This is a very, very important input to us, because that means that we are agnostic from a production and manufacturing perspective,” Stenqvist said.</p>
<p>Volvo, which has set a target of zero-emissions across its operations by 2040, is aiming to scale its use of the steel throughout the rest of the decade. Volvo Cars, owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding, also plans to produce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/volvo-cars-wants-to-make-a-concept-car-using-fossil-free-steel/">a concept car</a> using the steel as soon as 2025.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">That’s two out of two successful crewed launches for Blue Origin, as the company today sent a crew of four people, including actor William Shatner, to space and back from its facility in West Texas.</p>
<p>The mission, dubbed NS-18, is the fifth rocket launch for the company this year and the eighteenth for the rocket overall.</p>
<p>The crew included Shatner, who is arguably best-known for having played Captain James T. Kirk on “Star Trek”; Audrey Powers, a Blue employee who serves as the company’s vice president of New Shepard Mission &amp; Flight Operations; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/dcvc-partner-and-planet-labs-co-founder-chris-boshuizen-bound-for-space-on-blue-origins-second-human-flight/">Chris Boshuizen</a>, co-founder of Planet Labs and current partner at venture capital firm DCVC; and Glen de Vries, co-founder of the clinical trial software company Medidata Solutions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217525" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Shatner, who is 90, is now the oldest person to reach space, an honor that was previously held by 82-year old Wally Funk (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">who flew on Blue’s previous launch in July</a>).</p>
<p>The launch started at around 10:50 AM ET, where the rocket pushed past the Kármán Line – an internationally recognized boundary of space. Around this time, the crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness. The capsule landed autonomously using a parachute back to the launch facility around 11 minutes later. The booster also landed autonomously near the launch pad.</p>
<p>The successful launch is great news for Blue Origin, which wants to establish itself as a leading player in the burgeoning space tourism industry. But the past few weeks haven’t been completely smooth for the company, which was founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos in 2000. Late last month, <a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/bezos-wants-to-create-a-better-future-in-space-his-company-blue-origin-is-stuck-in-a-toxic-past">21 current and former employees</a> jointly composed an essay alleging that the company’s workplace was one marred by sexual harassment and a lack of proper regard for safety.</p>
<p>The document seemed to have caught the attention of the Federal Aviation Administration, who told TechCrunch, “The FAA takes every safety allegation seriously, and the agency is reviewing the information.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Blue Origin faces competition in the space tourism market from competitors like Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, which conducted its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/virgin-galactic-and-richard-branson-celebrate-launch-of-first-passengers-into-space/">successful crewed launch this summer</a>, and SpaceX, which carried the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/watch-spacex-launch-the-first-all-civilian-inspiration4-mission-to-space-live/">Inspiration4 crew</a> to space on a three-day journey in September.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK government&#8217;s post-Brexit appetite to &#8216;reform&#8217; domestic privacy rules by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">reducing the level of protections wrapping people&#8217;s data</a> is already having wider ramifications for the country&#8217;s tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>Last month the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) announced a consultation on reducing privacy standards &#8212; claiming &#8216;simplified&#8217; rules would be a boon for business innovation.</p>
<p>Now a homegrown scale-up has blasted the consultation in an <a href="https://adambird.com/posts/back-to-eu/">excoriating blog post</a> &#8212; warning that any reduction in data protection standards will &#8220;certainly&#8221; damage its EU business and could even weaken its US business, given that a number of states (such as California) have already passed similar laws to Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217367" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>US lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are now also pressing the case to pass comprehensive federal privacy legislation. So &#8212; outside the UK at least &#8212; the direction of travel on personal data is toward greater protections, not fewer.</p>
<p>But inside the UK ministers are eyeing current high standards wrapping data and looking for ways to downgrade those protections &#8212; making a superficial claim that reducing privacy rights will be good for business.</p>
<p>What deregulation will certainly mean is increased legal uncertainty and risk for businesses &#8212; and potentially a lot of lost business too.</p>
<p>In the blog post, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/29/cronofy/">Cronofy</a>, a 2014-founded UK startup which sells a calendar API and scheduling platform for enterprises, writes that it&#8217;s making preparations to prevent a domestic deregulatory bomb cratering its business &#8212; saying it will be opening a new company in the Netherlands and offering customers the ability to contract with Cronofy BV under Dutch law.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That will become the new HQ for all of our data processing so we can be under the oversight of the Dutch data regulator and thus the EU,&#8221; writes CEO and co-founder Adam Bird. &#8220;Our new General Counsel overseeing all of this is Dutch.</p>
<p>&#8220;How does Britain fare out of this? Not very well I’m afraid,&#8221; he adds, suggesting the restructuring will also mean Cronofy ends up reducing the level of investment it makes into UK skills and UK jobs.</p>
<p>Bird is not alone in blasting the UK proposal to rip up data protection rules, either.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s newly appointed information commissioner, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/uk-names-john-edwards-as-its-choice-for-next-data-protection-chief-as-govt-eyes-watering-down-privacy-standards/">John Edwards</a>, defended the current data protection rulebook in a pre-appointment hearing with MPs, describing the UK&#8217;s GDPR as a &#8216;how to not a don&#8217;t do&#8217; just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">last month</a>.</p>
<p>While, earlier <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/ex-minister-predicts-huge-battleground-over-uks-plan-to-set-internet-content-rules/">this month</a>, Ed Vaizey, the former minister of state in charge of DCMS (now Lord Vaizey), warned the UK must stay aligned with the GDPR &#8212; or face &#8220;disastrous&#8221; consequences for the economy and digital businesses.</p>
<p>“The U.K. was very influential in how data protection legislation was drawn up when we were members of the EU so I think it’s slightly odd that we should shy away from that legislation,” Vaizey told TechCrunch last week.</p>
<p>“You do not want a position where you make yourself vulnerable to attacks by the EU to say that your data protection regime is not adequate and we can’t therefore have cross-border exchanges of data — that would be disastrous. So whether we like it or not we will have to keep to a certain extent in lock-step with the European Union.”</p>
<p>However even the policy noises coming out of DCMS appear to be doing damage to UK Plc.</p>

<p>In his blog post, Bird describes Cronofy as &#8220;a truly global company&#8221; &#8212; one that&#8217;s (currently) headquartered in the UK but with revenue split 55% US, 25% EU, 9% UK. Meaning 91% of the scale-up&#8217;s revenue is from exports.</p>
<p>&#8220;EU GDPR legislation has not harmed our US business and in many cases has been an advantage,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;Having to confront data privacy requirements from the founding of the business puts us at a distinct advantage as US companies wake up to having to protect people’s information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Brexit &#8216;got done&#8217;, Bird says a &#8220;significant&#8221; number of EU customers were already raising concerns about what the UK&#8217;s departure might meant for their (sensitive calendar) data and relationship with his business.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will always do our utmost to protect people’s private data. However we were making these assertions against the backdrop of the UK government grandstanding in the name of ‘strong negotiation’, even to the extent that they voted to break international law,&#8221; he continues, saying that even before the end of the transition period customers weren&#8217;t confident Cronofy would be able to stand by its word or that the UK government would bother to enforce compliance even if it kept the same data standards on paper. &#8220;Even more importantly, they couldn’t give that reassurance to their end users,&#8221; Bird adds.</p>
<p>The government&#8217;s noises now about &#8216;simplifying&#8217; UK data protection standards are the &#8220;final straw&#8221; for Cronofy.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/data-a-new-direction">consultation document</a>, DCMS talks about carrying out &#8220;reforms to create an ambitious, pro-growth and innovation-friendly data protection regime&#8221; while &#8220;maintain[ing] high data protection standards without creating unnecessary barriers to responsible data use&#8221; &#8212; but there&#8217;s no doubt the proposal&#8217;s aim to remove layers of protection.</p>
<p>Ministers are, for example, considering expansive legal permissions for businesses to use data for &#8216;innovation&#8217; purposes, whatever that might mean (hint: anything) &#8212; and consulting on removing the need for individual consent to process certain types of data, among other potential amendments to the UK&#8217;s version of GDPR.</p>
<p>Entirely removing a provision that gives people a right of review of purely automated decisions that have a legal/equivalent impact is also being eyed by government.</p>
<p>(And on that front, the professional body <a href="https://www.bcs.org/articles-opinion-and-research/human-review-of-ai-decisions-needs-legal-protection-says-it-industry-body/?utm_content=183285095&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-29681473"><span class="il">BCS</span></a>, aka The Chartered Institute for IT, has warned today against such a drastic step &#8212; suggesting in a blog post that increased clarity of the existing provision would be the more judicious policy than keeping it exactly as-is or dumping it altogether.)</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;With the recent announcement by the government of the changes they want to make to the UK’s data privacy legislation, it seems that those fears were well founded,&#8221; writes Bird, sounding the alarm over the direction of UK data policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wants to move to a ‘do and ask for permission’ model driven not by benefit to mankind but instead by commercial interests. Whatever we say to our customers about how Cronofy approaches data privacy and controls, corresponding enforcement will not follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can make our protestations about ISO certifications, data management controls, segmented data hosting. However, prospective customers won’t necessarily get that far because we’ll be discounted based on our location. I don’t blame them. Data protection is fraught and complicated. Why even entertain the risk of going with a provider from outside the EU.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the UK&#8217;s level of protection gets downgraded, the immediate risk is the UK will lose a key data flow agreement with the EU &#8212; which has only just be put in place now it&#8217;s a so-called &#8216;third country&#8217;, in EU terms.</p>
<p>UK companies with customers in Europe rely on this EU &#8216;data adequacy&#8217; agreement for smooth running as it allows for personal data to flow freely from the bloc to the UK. But if UK law is assessed as no longer equivalent the European Commission has said it will revoke the arrangement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/uk-gets-data-flows-deal-from-eu-for-now/">signed off this summer</a>.</p>
<p>The data flows deal already includes a sunset clause &#8212; meaning there will be an automatic review of UK standards in 2025.</p>
<p>But EU lawmakers warned they could revoke it at any moment if there&#8217;s divergence. So blistering attacks on UK privacy policy by homegrown entrepreneurs like Bird are unlikely to go unnoticed in Brussels&#8230;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK gets data flows deal from EU &#8212; for now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/uk-gets-data-flows-deal-from-eu-for-now/embed/#?secret=wmu8qGsvpZ" data-secret="wmu8qGsvpZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;This national act of self-harm will have ramifications for decades to come,&#8221; Bird warns. &#8220;It turns out that Project Fear [as Brexit supporters dismissively dubbed objections to leaving the EU by those that wanted to remain], was actually Project Fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of taking it as a warning of something to avoid, the UK government seem to have taken it as an outcome to exceed. Whilst in isolation, Cronofy being collateral damage is unimportant. What we are facing is a worrying portent for the UK and its relationship with the rest of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expected and wanted to be building Cronofy into a world-beating, UK company. Membership of the EU gave us an enviable platform to do that and, in turn, invest that success back into the UK,&#8221; he adds, underscoring his point that UK government policy has left Cronofy with little choice but to restructure its business in a way that puts the EU at the core.</p>
<p>DCMS has been contacted for a response to Bird&#8217;s blog post.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Reddit today is introducing a new way to post to its communities with the launch of the on-platform feature called &#8220;Predictions.&#8221; Spun off of the popular Reddit Polls, Predictions allow users to guess the answers to timely questions like &#8220;who will win the game tomorrow?&#8221; or &#8220;which character will meet their fate in the next [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reddit today is introducing a new way to post to its communities with the launch of the on-platform feature called &#8220;Predictions.&#8221; Spun off of the popular Reddit Polls, Predictions allow users to guess the answers to timely questions like &#8220;who will win the game tomorrow?&#8221; or &#8220;which character will meet their fate in the next episode?&#8221; or &#8220;how much will the price of Bitcoin move by Monday?,&#8221; among others.</p>
<p>This is the first new posting format Reddit has introduced in nearly two years, and one that the company says is designed to increase engagement on the platform by reducing the barrier to posting. That is, while some users may not feel comfortable posting publicly or engaging in discussions, they may take the time to respond to a poll or, now, make a prediction.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217443" style="width: 634px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217443" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2217443" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-predictions-1.png?w=624" alt="" width="624" height="270" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-predictions-1.png 624w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-predictions-1.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-predictions-1.png?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-predictions-1.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217443" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reddit</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217400" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To use the feature in a Reddit community, or subreddit, a moderator will first create a Predictions Tournament. This is a series of questions where Reddit users will predict the answers. The tournament can include as many questions as the moderator wants to have, and they can continue to add new questions even after the tournament starts.</p>
<p>Each Reddit user receives 1,000 tokens when they join the Predictions Tournament. These are free &#8212; Reddit says there&#8217;s no monetization model in place for tokens, nor a plan to roll that out in the future. However, users will not be able to get more tokens during the tournament once those 1,000 are used. That means they have to place their bets wisely across all the predictions, or they could risk losing their ability to respond to later questions if they run out.</p>
<p>Users can place anywhere between 10 and 100 tokens on each question, but no more or less.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217442" style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217442" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2217442" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-predictions-2.png?w=389" alt="" width="389" height="322" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-predictions-2.png 389w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-predictions-2.png?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-predictions-2.png?resize=300,248 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-predictions-2.png?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217442" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reddit</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moderators will choose the correct answers to the predictions, so they control the outcome of the Tournament and decide the winners. Of course, they are motivated to get this right as a community&#8217;s leader &#8212; and because there&#8217;s no financial gain for them either way. In addition, the tokens themselves have no value outside Prediction Tournaments, Reddit says.</p>
<p>Users who were right in their predictions will earn more tokens based on how many they originally put in. That means the better someone&#8217;s prediction skills, the more they&#8217;ll be able to bet in the future. They will also climb higher on the community&#8217;s Prediction Tournament leaderboard.</p>
<p>Reddit has already been testing the feature ahead of today&#8217;s official launch and saw more than 1 million participants involve themselves in Prediction Tournaments. Popular tournaments included the Oscar Prediction Tournament on r/movies, which saw 100,000 participants; the Azerbaijan Grand Prix Prediction Tournament on r/formula1, which saw 200,000 participants; and the 2020 Eurocup Prediction Tournament on r/soccer, which saw over 300,000 participants.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217441" style="width: 644px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217441" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2217441" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-predictions-3.png?w=634" alt="" width="634" height="411" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-predictions-3.png 634w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-predictions-3.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-predictions-3.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reddit-predictions-3.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217441" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reddit</p></div></p>
<p>The company isn&#8217;t the first to see the value in predictions as a tool for user engagement.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s internal R&amp;D lab, the NPE Team, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/facebook-tests-forecast-an-app-for-making-predictions-about-world-events-like-covid-19/">last year introduced an app called Forecast</a> which offered a similar set of capabilities. In Forecast, users could make predictions about world events, like COVID-19, and engage in discussions. Since then, the company went on to announce its entry into the fantasy gaming market, but with a twist. Instead of building up all-star fantasy teams, users make simpler predictions about the games themselves. There are also non-sports games, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/facebook-enters-the-fantasy-gaming-market/">those that allow you to guess</a> what will happen on TV shows like &#8220;Survivor&#8221; or &#8220;The Bachelorette.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the App Store, there are a number of apps for making predictions with friends, also often focused on sports. And across social media, there are Stories filters for personal predictions and other predictions games. For example, the Wishbone app maker Mammoth Media last year <a href="https://medium.com/@bvatere/prediction-master-for-snap-minis-our-latest-collaboration-with-snapchat-f8049c46d34">launched</a> a Snap Mini game called Prediction Master for Snapchat users.</p>
<p>Reddit says the new feature will roll out to all communities with at least 10,000 members which are rated as safe-for-work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://matik.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matik</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has created</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> automated data-driven software for customizing Google Slides or PowerPoint presentations,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Menlo Ventures, BoxGroup and Oceans Ventures also participated in the financing, which brings the San Francisco-based startup’s total raised to just over $23 million since its 2019 inception. The venture firms joined a group of angels &#8212; including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GTM Fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> angel investor Keenan Rice (who was part of Looker&#8217;s founding team)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allison Pickens (former COO of Gainsight)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Elena Verna (former SVP of Growth at SurveyMonkey)  and Jon Herstein (current CCO at Box) &#8212; who also put money in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matik’s product targets data-driven organizations, specifically sales and customer success teams, to make it easier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create personalized presentations such as quarterly business reviews, pricing proposals and one-pagers.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It works by automatically importing content from a variety of data sources, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikola Mijic, co-founder and CEO of Matik.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217170" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup says its technology transforms content from static to dynamic &#8212; whether it be text, charts, images or tables. It claims to save teams time from number-crunching, formatting and data pulling from disparate sources such as CRMs like Salesforce, BI/visualization tools like Looker and data warehouses such as Redshift, BigQuery or Snowflake. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the content is dynamic, presentations are “completely editable” after they’re generated, the company says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Matik, “what used to take hours is reduced to minutes,” leaving more time for strategic work, according to Mijic. Enterprise and mid-market companies are its target customers and it claims to be able to help them save money as well as help convert and retain customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some people spend four to six hours a week to create data-driven stories, and we get it down to a few minutes, saving them over 200 to 300 hours a year to do more strategic work and speak to customers,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2217230" style="width: 1694px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217230" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2217230 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Matik.jpg" alt="Matik" width="1684" height="852" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Matik.jpg 1684w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Matik.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Matik.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Matik.jpg?resize=768,389 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Matik.jpg?resize=680,344 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Matik.jpg?resize=1536,777 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Matik.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1684px) 100vw, 1684px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217230" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matik</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company runs on a license-based model, and has seen many companies buy a certain number of licenses and then “expand pretty quickly” to different teams by buying more licenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a short amount of time, Matik has built up a customer base that includes some big names, including Glassdoor, KeepTruckin, Handshake and Hover. It says that since Handshake started using Matik, it’s already saved 4,500 hours. While he declined to reveal any hard revenue figures, Mijic said Matik has grown “by 3x” since the beginning of the year and he expects it will have grown “by 4-5x” by year’s end compared to the end of 2020. So far, he added, it has had “zero churn.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mijic first came up with the concept behind Matik while at LinkedIn. He was supporting sales and customer success teams and was constantly asked to help put together presentations at the last minute by, for example, running a bunch of queries that pulled data. There, he </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">worked on an internal solution to facilitate the presentation-building process for the company’s go-to-market teams and led the eventual redesign of the solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mijic then teamed up with early Box employee </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/zak-stein" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zak Stein</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to found Matik to solve the problem more broadly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Matik wants to explore the possibility of applying its technology to e-mail, or “anything that is repetitive in nature that needs to be personalized.” It also wants to expand its product offering to teams beyond sales and go-to-market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Storytelling is not just in a presentation,” Mijic said. “We can take what’s core to our product and infuse it to other types of narratives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also, naturally, wants to do some hiring. The company currently has 13 employees and expects to boost its headcount to 20 by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A16z general partner Kristina Shen, who will take a seat on Matik’s board as part of the raise, said Matik has built a product that automates “a hugely manual and painful process” for many business functions: the personalization and updating of data in presentations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She described the Matik product experience as “incredibly seamless and intuitive,” giving an end user the ability to create an entire presentation “with just a few inputs and clicks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Customer feedback for Matik is consistently effusive and really speaks to the fact there are no satisfactory alternatives in the market,” she wrote via email. “Considering the varied use of and ongoing need for data-rich presentations as a key storytelling tool, we believe the long-term potential of Matik is massive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naomi Ionita, partner at Menlo Ventures, led Matik’s $3 million seed round in October of 2019. She said she was drawn to the team&#8217;s authenticity as well as the product market fit.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can imagine people laboring over these decks, pulling data from all these disparate sources with the goal of really crafting a story and personalizing it and then having to tweak the story based on different data points and making sure that story flows, month after month or quarter after quarter,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Thus, the time savings are an obvious benefit &#8220;out of the gate,&#8221; according to Ionita.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other benefit here is driving revenue, as when companies spend painstaking hours putting presentations together, they tend to only be able to cover a certain percentage of their accounts,&#8221; she told TechCrunch. &#8220;And so by automating this, we&#8217;re seeing customers be able to increase their account coverage. And all of these customer-facing folks will confirm that when you have the personalized touch point with their customers, it does have an impact on expansion and renewal opportunities.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lunar.vc/">Lunar Ventures</a>, a new, technically oriented VC fund aimed at early-stage deep tech startups, is announcing the closing of its €40 million first fund.</p>
<p>Lunar was founded in Berlin in 2019 by Dr Elad Verbin, a computer science researcher; Mick Halsband, a CTO and software architect; and Luis Shemtov, a former entrepreneur.</p>
<p>The launch is timely: Deep tech investments in Europe have almost tripled in the last five years, nearing €10 billion in 2020. That is roughly a quarter of the total VC investments in the continent.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217494" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Verbin said, “Technical startup founders in Europe have a big problem. They struggle to find investors who actually understand what they’re building. Most VCs in Europe don’t come from a technical or scientific background, and they struggle to evaluate the underlying technology, failing to invest in promising science-based moonshots.” Personally, this is also my experience.</p>
<p>Verbin continued: “We are a team of scientists and engineers and we have built Lunar Ventures to solve this problem. We find the best startups building the future, our team conducts rigorous technical due diligence to evaluate their true potential, and then we lead their funding rounds.”</p>
<p>The fund will invest up to €1 million into early-stage deep tech startups that are software-focused, aiming at the frontier of computer science, machine learning, cryptography, new cloud infrastructures and next-generation databases.</p>
<p>So far it’s invested in Zama, a Paris-based startup building end-to-end encryption for machine learning models; Berlin-based Deepset, enabling computers to understand plain language; and Molecule, a drug discovery platform using the Ethereum blockchain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lunar is backed by LPs such as Isomer Capital, Multiple Capital, Aldea Ventures, Compagnia di San Paolo and the European Investment Fund.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Media company ViacomCBS is getting into NFTs. Amid growing hype around the potential market for NFTs, aka non-fungible tokens &#8212; digital assets linked to ownership that&#8217;s stored on a blockchain, often used for buying and selling digital art and collectibles &#8212; ViacomCBS says it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211013005667/en/ViacomCBS-Enters-Strategic-NFT-Partnership-with-RECUR">partnering</a> with the NFT company <a href="https://www.recurforever.com/">Recur</a> to bring its iconic IP and franchises to the world of digital collectibles, starting next year. This includes products and collectibles from shows and films across top ViacomCBS brands like CBS, MTV, Showtime, Paramount Pictures, BET, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central.</p>
<p>The company isn&#8217;t offering many details about the upcoming project just yet, beyond simply saying that it will involve creating a place where its fans can buy, collect and trade NFTs across its portfolio. It also notes this platform will encourage &#8220;peer-to-peer engagement and facilitate innovative ways for users to unlock new experiences,&#8221; which signals there&#8217;s a social element to the new experience that goes beyond just the marketplace aspects.</p>
<p>Recur, which recently closed <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-company-recur-reaches-333m-valuation-following-steve-cohen-backed-fundraiser">on a $50 million Series A</a>, valuing the pre-launch company at $333 million, is currently working on building an NFT platform called NFTU.com. This platform is being created in partnership with digital licensing company Veritone, and will host NFTs created with Pac-12 Networks athletics video content &#8212; like sports highlights, for example.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217457" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This project can give you an idea of what ViacomCBS likely has in store with its own NFT plans.</p>
<p>While a number of other NFT marketplaces already exist, Recur&#8217;s plan is to develop technology that standardizes recurring royalties minted on any cryptocurrency &#8212; a decision that means NFTs would become &#8220;chain-agnostic,&#8221; bringing more potential fans into the crypto ecosystem. For <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nisaamoils/2021/04/09/recur-broadens-the-pool-of-customers-for-nfts/?sh=400427b1e570">brand partners and IP holders</a>, that means once the NFT left their own, originating platform to be resold elsewhere, the original rights holder would be able to continue to receive recurring royalties from the sales and resales indefinitely.</p>
<p>That could certainly look appealing to a media company with a deep catalog of IP that could be turned into digital collectibles. Think: Spongebob Squarepants, South Park or Star Trek collectibles, for instance. (To be clear, ViacomCBS has not announced the specific shows it will include in its initial distributions. And there could be more complicated rights discussions to still be ironed out with creators, actors and others tied to its IP before those determinations can be made.)</p>
<p>In addition, Recur&#8217;s chain-agnostic approach will allow NFT purchases to be made using U.S. credit and debit cards, instead of just cryptocurrencies. That could also appeal to a company looking to reach a wider audience outside of tech early adopters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new platform will launch in spring of 2022, ViacomCBS says.</p>
<p>ViacomCBS is not the first media company to embrace NFTs. In addition to adoption by <a href="https://variety.com/vip-video/nft-craze-catching-on-in-media-industry/">top media figures themselves</a>, brands <a href="https://www.axios.com/cnn-moments-nft-b40022f0-dfb8-4ccc-888b-596fb6732406.html">including</a> CNN, The New Yorker, Time, Playboy, <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/lionsgate-tom-brady-autograph-nft-draftkings-1235024498/">Lionsgate</a>, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/27/2304008/0/en/Media-Central-Corp-Announces-It-Is-Selling-NFTs-of-Nine-Historic-Magazine-Covers-as-Collectibles-Featuring-Grimes-Drake-Seth-Rogan-and-More.html">Media Central</a>, <a href="https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/media-nfts-gannett/">Gannett</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/major-media-wants-in-cnn-and-fox-are-entering-nfts/">Fox</a> and others have also begun their own investigations and experiments into the medium.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fueled by beloved characters and iconic properties with multi-generational appeal, we are thrilled to accelerate our consumer products presence even further into the growing metaverse,&#8221; said Pam Kaufman, ViacomCBS president of Consumer Products, in a statement. &#8220;In teaming up with Recur to create an NFT platform dedicated to ViacomCBS IP, voracious collectors and first-time NFT buyers alike will find unique opportunities to own a piece of their favorite franchises,&#8221; she added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At $11.7 billion, GitLab would be worth around 50x its current annualized revenue run rate.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s no longer Hot Summer anything, sadly, as the seasons change. But perhaps we&#8217;re in for Warm IPO Autumn.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">Rent the Runway</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/nerdwallets-ipo-filing-reveals-high-margin-content-business-accelerating-marketing-spend/">NerdWallet</a> and other companies are setting us up for a busy second half of October. But this week will see the debut of a company worth a multiple of those other venture-backed former startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/inside-gitlabs-ipo-filing/">as GitLab goes public</a>. And the developer tooling company recently turned up the valuation heat.</p>

<hr />
<p>This week, GitLab <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001653482/000162828021019932/gitlab-sx1a2.htm">updated its IPO filing</a> to include a higher expected pricing interval. The unicorn now anticipates that it will sell shares in its IPO for between $66 and $69 apiece, up from a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001653482/000162828021019505/gitlab-sx1a1.htm">previous range of $55 to $60</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s quite the jump!</p>

Then we&#8217;ll execute some revenue multiples work, hoping to suss out if our earlier estimations of the company&#8217;s value are holding up, and what the IPO&#8217;s possible pricing says about the software market more broadly.</p>
<p>This is one of those posts that&#8217;s only good news for startups and their backers. For the other side of this particular coin, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/venture-capital-is-going-to-need-a-record-breaking-run-of-ipos-to-clear-its-own-decks/">head here</a>. Ready? Into the breach.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s GitLab worth?</h2>
<p>In its first IPO price range, with 143,534,821 shares outstanding after its offering (inclusive of its underwriters&#8217; option), GitLab was set to be worth $7.9 billion to $8.6 billion. IPO-watching Renaissance Capital reported that at the &#8220;midpoint of [its first] proposed range, GitLab would command a fully diluted market value of $9.4 billion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or more precisely, at $57.5 per share, GitLab would be worth $9.4 billion. At $60 per share, that number would scale to $9.8 billion.</p>
<p>Now at $66 to $69 per share, the company&#8217;s expected 143,534,821 post-IPO share count works out to a simple valuation range of $9.5 billion to $9.9 billion. Translating the company&#8217;s fully-diluted valuation at $57.5 per share to $69 per share, we can estimate that when counting all shares including those that may be exercised, GitLab could be worth as much as $11.3 billion.</p>
<p>I could have showed a little less work there, but I want you to walk along with me as we tinker with the numbers.</p>
<h2>Is that expensive?</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s find out!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">On the heels of Personio <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/personio-an-hr-platform-for-smes-raises-270m-on-a-6-3b-valuation-expands-into-workflow-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising a big round yesterday</a>, one of its competitors and another big startup in the area of HR has also picked up some funding. <a href="https://www.hibob.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hibob</a>, a London-based company that targets the mid-market with an all-in-one platform that handles various human resources functions, closed a Series C of $150 million. The funding values the company at around $1.65 billion, the company has confirmed to us. This was also the figure that appeared in <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3919534,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked rumors</a> in the market earlier this week, ahead of the company confirming the news today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">General Atlantic led the round, with past investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Battery Ventures, Eight Roads and Entrée Capital among the others investing. Hibob last raised money about 10 months ago, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/hibob-raises-70m-on-a-500m-valuation-for-its-new-take-on-hr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$70 million round</a> in December 2020 (a round led by SEEK and Israel Growth Partners). Its valuation since then has more than tripled, a mark of how hot the market is for HR right now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Hot&#8221; and HR are not two terms you might usually hear in the same sentence. The tasks that comprise human resources &#8212; in Hibob&#8217;s case, tracking attendance, time off, compensation, payroll, benefits and running surveys &#8212; are usually seen as some of the more dry, and often overly officious, aspects of working life.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217458" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">COVID-19 and pandemic working practices &#8212; where the vast majority of knowledge workers were sent home for the better part of a year or more (and some of us are still here in our kitchens) &#8212; have definitely changed how we interface with work, and so HR systems have suddenly come into their own as a way of tracking things, and even helping us all stay connected.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hibob, which sells its platform as &#8220;Bob&#8221;, says that the last year has seen triple-digit growth in revenues, and its opportunity has been to present its product &#8212; which also offers collaboration and other tools &#8212; as a modern take on what HR can mean to a company.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">“Our mission is to modernize HR technology,” Ronni Zehavi, Hibob’s CEO, who co-founded the company with Israel David, told me last December. “We are a people-management platform for how people work today. Whether that’s remotely or physically collaborative, our customers face challenges with work. We believe that the HR platforms of the future will not be clunky systems, annoying, giant platforms. We believe it should be different. We are a system of engagement rather than record.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the company&#8217;s roots are in Israel, its modern HQ is in London, with another office in New York. It has 1,500 mid-sized customers operating in 134 countries, but right now it says that some 65% of those customers &#8212; which include the likes of Ebury Partners Ltd., G.Network, Revolut and Cazoo &#8212; are in the U.K. and other European markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The funding will be used in part in an effort to tap more growth internationally to complement that existing base.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The last several years have seen a turn in HR tech that mirrors that of all enterprise IT: The explosion of funding available to startups has bred a plethora of point-solution specialists addressing singular aspects of the larger HR process, whether it is payroll, or benefits, or hiring and onboarding, or surveys and employee satisfaction, or training, or recruiting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the bigger gravitational pull of technology seems to always bring us back to the concept of larger platforms, which are in their own way easier to run and potentially less expensive overall. In HR, those targeting smaller and mid-sized customers like Hibob or Personio also have a precedent in the form of Workday (and more historically companies like SAP).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Personio is an interesting company to consider in comparison to Hibob: it is bigger but also has smaller businesses in its mix of customers. When it announced its funding yesterday at a $6.3 billion valuation, it noted that its next steps would be to go into wider workflow automation, bringing more of the data you capture in HR systems (and specifically Personio&#8217;s HR systems) into other applications in a more efficient way.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It will be interesting to see whether Hibob takes a similar route, or if not, how it chooses to evolve its own platform over time. HR, being focused on people management, is in a way at the heart of how a company runs its whole business, so there are a lot of routes it can take.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<span class="il">Hibob</span> has created a solution that serves and anticipates the needs of modern, evolving businesses,” said Anton Levy, co-president, MD and global head of tech at General Atlantic, in a statement. “We have tracked the company for years, and positive customer feedback further validates that <span class="il">Hibob</span>’s platform has become a mission-critical component of HR tech stacks. <span class="il">Hibob</span> will mark our sixth investment in an Israel-based company in under two years, signifying our strong conviction in the country’s market. We look forward to supporting the business’ global growth as it redefines employee engagement and HR technology.”</p>
