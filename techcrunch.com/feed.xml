										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After steadily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">expanding</a> access over the course of the year, Twitter announced today its audio chatroom feature known as Twitter Spaces is now open to anyone who wants to host a Space across iOS and Android. Earlier this year, the company had limited access to hosting Spaces to accounts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">with at least 600 followers</a>, saying that it found these accounts would be more likely to have a good experience because they had an existing audience.</p>
<p>Now, Twitter says the option will be offered to all its mobile users on the Twitter app. Users are able to start their first Space by tapping on the Compose button &#8212; the button they would otherwise use to post a tweet, according to the graphic shared alongside today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">the time has arrived &#8212; we’re now rolling out the ability for everyone on iOS and Android to host a Space</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222066" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>if this is your first time hosting, welcome! here’s a refresher on how <a href="https://t.co/cLH8z0bocy">pic.twitter.com/cLH8z0bocy</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1451239134798942208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At present, for some users tapping on this button switches you to the screen where you would write and post your tweet. But it seems Twitter is showing the button will fan out an array of options, including those to compose a tweet, post a GIF, or start a Space. This is a minor but possibly impactful design choice, as much of Twitter&#8217;s commentary is posted spontaneously by dashing off a quick tweet. By making tweeting a two-step process, it could lead to some reduction in the number of posts if people take that split second to pause and reconsider their actions.</p>
<p>Twitter was earlier experimenting with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/">giving Spaces its own tab in the app</a>, but that has not broadly rolled out and isn&#8217;t shown in the current image shared with the announcement. In fact, Twitter users who are in the beta test for another new feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-communities/">Communities</a> will instead see the Communities button in the center of their app&#8217;s navigation row. Twitter says the dedicated Spaces tab was recently extended to more people in English on iOS, but is not yet available on Android.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter has been rapidly iterating on Spaces since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">launch into beta last year.</a> More recently, it added the ability for Spaces hosts to add up to two co-hosts and up to 10 speakers, allowing for larger events with more moderators. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">shut down</a> its Stories feature called Fleets this summer, which made Spaces the only product that appears in the top row of the Twitter mobile app.</p>
<p>Since announcing Spaces, a number of major platforms have launched their own audio networking products following the breakout social networking hit app Clubhouse, which became a popular pastime during the height of the pandemic. Now Spaces and Clubhouse compete with Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">Live Audio Rooms</a>, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Greenroom</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a>, Reddit, Public.com and others.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">For Manu Bansal, founder of <a href="https://www.lightup.ai/">Lightup.ai</a>, raising a seed round from a16z was not a very difficult journey. His previous company, Uhana, launched in 2016, was backed by NEA and had been acquired by VMWare in three years.</p>
<p>So he had demonstrated ability when it came to not just building a product, but building a company, attracting a team, generating revenues and most importantly, getting it to a good exit.</p>
<p>But a challenge came up in 2021 as he was raising the seed round — the venture funding market got white-hot. In 2016, total VC investments in the U.S. were about $80 billion. By 2020, the capital deployed had ballooned to $164 billion, according to PitchBook NVCA. By all means, 2021 will top this trend.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			“A sophisticated investor does not follow a fad or measure your progress against generic templates.”					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">startups have never had it so good</a>. The list of superlatives describing this insane bull market is getting longer. Silicon Valley is the Walmart on Thanksgiving Day sale.</p>
<p>Founders can raise money fast, really fast. Ask Bansal, inundated by investors and ready to do a preemptive up round just three months after he closed his seed round.</p>
<p>But this can be a gotcha, he warns.</p>
<h2>The vicious preemptive trap</h2>
<p>As the supply of capital grows, competition heats up, especially for people like Bansal. The number of unsolicited inbounds grows, with each attempt to get the founders&#8217; attention getting more crazy. Often, the easiest way investors get the founders&#8217; attention is to pump up the valuation. Up round, anyone?</p>
<p>But the dark side of this market can become a vicious preemptive trap, a cycle where an A round happens too early and a B round follows within a few months and the C round is not far behind.</p>
<p>“A company&#8217;s metrics cannot move materially in such short spans. As one of my investors says, figuring out go-to-market (GTM) has time constants involved,” said Bansal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211021005822/en/Today-at-Amazon-Accelerate-Amazon-Launches-New-Local-Selling-Capabilities-to-Help-Small-Businesses-Grow-by-Reaching-More-Customers-in-Their-Area">rolling out</a> ‘Local Selling,’ a set of services that allow local and regional retailers to offer both in-store pickup and fast delivery to nearby customers.</p>
<p>With this new option, sellers can offer in-store pickup for products and services to shoppers in specific zip codes. In some instances, customers will be able to purchase items from sellers for same-day pickup at the business’s local retail location.</p>
<p>Products that are available for pickup will have a ‘store pickup’ tab on the item page. Once customers place an order, they’ll receive a notification when their item is ready for pickup. When the item is ready, customers will have a five-day pickup window to collect their orders.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222028" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Shoppers can also choose local delivery, which will be facilitated by the business itself. Once you select the ‘arranged delivery’ option at checkout, the local retailer will contact you to schedule the exact date and time for the delivery. Some sellers may also offer installation services that you can add on top of your order.</p>
<p>Amazon Local Selling is now available from both national and local retailers, including Mavis Discount Tire, Sears Hometown Store, 4 Wheel Parts, Electronic Express, Best Buy, Appliance Connection, Mattress Warehouse, Beach Camera, Adorama, DataVision, Exclusive Furniture, World Wide Stereo, MODIA, Focus Camera, and others. The company says Local Selling will expand later this year and during 2022, as sellers who are interested in joining the program are able to apply to do so starting today.</p>
<p>“Our research shows that many customers will opt for local pickup when given the choice. This new capability is an exciting way to help sellers reach and delight more customers with great products and convenience,” said Jim Adkins, the vice president of recreational and vocational categories at Amazon, in a statement.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Amazon previously tested in-store pickup options in 2019 with the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/amazon-launches-counter-in-store-pick-up-in-the-us-starting-with-100-rite-aid-locations/">&#8216;Counter,&#8217;</a> a service where Amazon shoppers could arrange to collect packages at retail locations. The service essentially saw the company partner with retailers to arrange pickup counters in their stores for orders placed online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With this latest launch, Amazon is clearly looking to get orders to customers faster by leveraging its third-party network and their physical stores. It’s a way for Amazon to keep customers on its own marketplace as opposed to retailers’ websites. The launch also comes at a time when curbside pickup options have increased since the start of the pandemic. Companies like Walmart and Target have offered the option for quite some time now, as Amazon is gearing up to further compete with big box stores and retailers with its newest offering. It&#8217;s also worth noting that Shopify offers merchants on its platform in-store pickup options so this could be an attempt to better compete with that as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If challenging the status quo was easy, we’d see a lot more of it. In the world of smartphones, this means daring to think outside the rectangle, a form factor that has been the default for more than a decade and a half. Slowly but surely amid stagnant smartphone sales, companies have been testing the water.</p>
<p>There have, in recent years, been a number of evolutionary dead ends. ZTE’s Axon M comes to mind. A valiant, if deeply flawed, attempt that was, for all intents and purposes, two smartphones stuck together. Samsung’s folding phones seemed destined for a similar fate early on.</p>
<p>After a few generations, the company has turned things around, even if longevity and mainstream implications of both the line and the category broadly are still something of a question. I can genuinely say, for instance, that I’ve enjoyed my time with the Galaxy Z Flip 3. It works as intended, isn’t overly unwieldy like many of its folding brethren and is honestly the first foldable device I would recommend.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221991" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like Samsung, Microsoft has been well positioned to push the edges of the category. The company long ago abandoned hopes of being a mainstream mobile powerhouse. It’s not for lack of trying, of course. But not even its $7.2 billion Nokia acquisition could keep those dreams alive. Instead, the company found hardware solace in the Surface line, a modest success that has produced some genuinely compelling form factors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221719" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221719" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221719" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221719" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The first Surface Duo was born out of that line, which prided itself in thinking outside the standard PC/tablet form factor. At an event in October 2019, the company introduced the dual-screen Neo laptop and the smaller Duo, a dual-screen Android handset. The former never made it into production. In May, Microsoft confirmed the death of Windows 10X and, seemingly, hopes of the Neo along with it.</p>
<p>When the Duo launched last fall, it was one of the year’s most eagerly anticipated devices. Like ZTE, Microsoft circumvented the need for a foldable display by fusing two screens together with a hinge. With nearly a decade of Surface hardware under its belt, however, the company had clearly created a far more elegant solution. But like the Axon M before it, the original Duo largely disappointed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It wasn’t a failure from a hardware perspective, exactly (though sales may tell a different story), but it was plagued with too many issues to come anywhere near justifying its $1,400 asking price. The lack of an external camera, buggy software and the decision not to include 5G were among the major pain points in a device loaded with pain points. First-generation products are going to be imperfect &#8212; that’s the plight of the early adopter.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221725" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221725" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221725" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221725" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>But when asking consumers to shell out that much money for a new device, there are certain levels of quality one anticipates &#8212; ones the original Duo failed to meet. Much to its credit, however, Microsoft listened. Obviously that doesn’t help those chosen few who purchased the original product, but the company is clearly committed to doing better by future customers. In that sense, the Surface Duo 2 is more than just an update to the original device &#8212; it’s an effort to correct some of its predecessor’s biggest mistakes.</p>
<p>You could make a fairly convincing argument that Microsoft would have saved itself a lot of heartache had the first Duo been closer to this new model. The addition of the Snapdragon 888 with 5G, a rear-facing triple camera setup, narrowing the gap between the dual-screens and the continued improvement of software are important steps in the right direction. But the Duo 2 is still far from the sort of device you can heartily recommend. The next couple of generations &#8212; should Microsoft continue to invest in the device &#8212; will determine whether the issues with the device are fundamental or something that simply required continued refinement.</p>

<p>The software, which can still be buggy switching between displays, is likely the latter. Along with developing its own dual-screen software, Microsoft is utilizing much of the work Google has done with companies like Samsung to create a version of Android that works on foldables. Of course, developing for a foldable and a dual-screen form factor is not a perfect one-to-one. But given Microsoft’s immense resources, perfecting that experience is likely a matter of how much time and money it’s willing to invest &#8212; that, in turn, is a product of perceived interest in the device.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2222004,2222005,2222007,2222008,2222009,2222010,2222011"]</p>
<p>Where the original Duo relied on an internal camera for shooting, the 2 now has three rear-facing cameras: a 12-megapixel wide, 12-megapixel telephoto and 16-megapixel ultra-wide. That certainly sounds good on the face of it &#8212; and it’s undoubtedly an improvement. But the camera app is barebones and the picture quality was consistently sub-par compared to significantly less expensive systems. The Duo struggled in mixed and low light more than one would hope on a $1,500 system in 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221721" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221721" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221721" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221721" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Microsoft isn’t as invested in mobile photography as Samsung, Apple or Google. That certainly shows here, but it’s also something that can be improved upon in future generations. Ultimately, however, the camera leads us to one of the potentially fundamental issues with the device. Among the reasons the original Duo relied on an internal camera is a pragmatic issue of form factor: flipping the device open with the camera on one side and the second display serving as a viewfinder on the other.</p>
<p>The company has actually done a decent job working with the camera bump, so the rear of the displays sit together at a slight angle. But actually using the thing is a pain. It’s somewhat handy having the second screen to display the shots after they’re taken, but the process is unwieldy &#8212; more akin to attempting to photograph something using a tablet.</p>
<p>In spite of some seemingly unavoidable flaws like this, the Duo 2 is a nice piece of hardware, and the addition of features like Microsoft Pen support and dual-screen gaming, which arrived on the original Duo back in May, get the product closer to where it should be. Other nice touches like the Glance Bar, which shows glimpses of notifications in the gap between screens when the device is closed, demonstrate how Microsoft is continuing to work cleverly with the form factor it has. But with continued issues and an asking price of $1,500, any hope of the product becoming truly mainstream feel &#8212; at best &#8212; multiple generations away.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The climate measures in the budget reconciliation package now before the U.S. Congress could unlock an investment boom in clean energy, zero-carbon transportation and efficient manufacturing that would allow us, as a nation, to reverse the course of rising greenhouse gas emissions that threaten our future.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, ​​these investments will help the U.S. maintain its role as an economic leader in a global economy that prioritizes zero-carbon solutions. Oh, and investment creates jobs, lots of them.</p>
<p>After deadly floods in Louisiana, grid failures in Texas and devastating wildfires in California, who wouldn’t want strong steps to meet the climate crisis with impactful, 21st-century solutions?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221799" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For investors, the proposed federal investments for zero-carbon infrastructure, renewable energy, electric vehicles and climate innovations will provide the policy signals we and other investment firms need to confidently fund breakthrough technologies.</p>
<p>Once investors know that the government is serious about taking action to bring the economy into the 21st century and competing with nations already aggressively deploying these technologies, climate and tech investors will increase commitments in these areas.</p>
<p>For example, take transportation electrification. Transportation now emits a greater volume of greenhouse gases than any other U.S. sector, with carbon exhaust from cars, trucks, airlines and shipping adding up to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">29% of total U.S. emissions</a>. Despite the temporary reductions in travel-related emissions during the pandemic, transportation emissions were still climbing at last measure and are likely to keep growing. This should alarm us all.</p>
<p>But with the reconciliation bill’s tax incentives for purchasing electric vehicles making these cars much more affordable for Americans &#8212; up to a $12,500 credit if you buy an EV made in the U.S. &#8212; plus the bill’s incentives for manufacturing and deploying EV charging infrastructure, we’d see rapid adoption of clean electric transportation and a steep drop in transportation emissions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Couple the transportation incentives with the reconciliation package’s Clean Electricity Performance Program (CEPP), which encourages utilities to hasten their steady transition to clean energy &#8212; from a national average of 40% today to 80% by 2030 through incentive payments and penalties &#8212; we’d see a precipitous drop in overall emissions.</p>
<p>Transportation and electric power together currently account for more than half of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. These provisions will spur a broad energy generation transition that can also power the EV cars, trucks and fleets of the future.</p>
<p>As investors, we view the budget reconciliation as a long-term catalyst for sustainable growth, and growth translates to jobs. The Economic Policy Institute <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/iija-budget-reconciliation-jobs/">estimates</a> that the budget reconciliation provisions, on their own, could create up to 3.2 million new jobs per year. Through our existing investments, we have seen firsthand how infusions of capital, from both public and private sources, can stimulate job creation, from hourly wage positions all the way up to highly skilled engineering roles. The budget reconciliation will create economic opportunities for all.</p>
<p>There’s clearly a market for climate action: The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate <a href="https://newclimateeconomy.report/">found</a> that bold climate action globally could deliver $26 trillion in economic benefits through 2030. We need this funding to go as far and as fast as possible to avoid a global rise in temperatures of 1.5 degrees C, which experts collectively agree is the tipping point into catastrophic, irreversible climate change. Government policy can both signal and pave the way for broader private-sector investments, as it did decades before with pollution legislation.</p>
<p>And what will happen to these investment dollars if Congress does not pass the infrastructure and budget reconciliation packages? The cost of inaction is far higher than the costs outlined in the budget reconciliation legislation. The climate measures in the bill add up to $700 billion over a decade, or $70 billion a year.</p>
<p>Climate change-induced extreme weather disasters in the U.S. alone cost <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/">roughly $100 billion each year</a>. If measures are not passed, individual citizens will keep paying higher tax and energy bills. Meanwhile, investors will instead put money into companies and sectors in other geographies that are focused on next-generation renewable energy, EV charging and other technologies supported by policy and will look for clean infrastructure plays on other continents where their investment dollars go farther and create faster returns.</p>
<p>In a no-action scenario, the United States will face long-term negative consequences as its economic leadership fades and its OEMs and supply chains gradually lose their position as global leaders. The U.S., as a nation, will in turn lose the financial capacity to mitigate or respond to the devastating local impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>We have an urgent need to address the climate crisis now, with the public and private sectors each maximizing their tools to ensure long-term economic and environmental sustainability. The federal policy tools and opportunities are clear, and the private sector is ready to respond with investment capital.</p>
<p>We urge Congress to pass a budget reconciliation bill and allow its strong climate measures to reap benefits for all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix employees staged a walkout yesterday in response to the company&#8217;s handling of a Dave Chappelle special that premiered on October 5. At the same time, Los Angeles-based trans activist Ashlee Marie Preston hosted a <a href="https://twitter.com/AshleeMPreston/status/1450151113978572800">rally in solidarity</a> with Netflix workers participating in the walkout. Netflix stars like Jonathan Van Ness of &#8220;Queer Eye&#8221; and Mason Alexander Park of &#8220;Cowboy Bebop&#8221; and &#8220;The Sandman&#8221; expressed their solidarity in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnbE18-r_i0">a video</a> made for the rally, alongside other Hollywood stars and trans advocates like Angelica Ross, Jameela Jamil, Kate Bornstein, Our Lady J, Sara Ramirez, Peppermint and Colton Haynes.</p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8220;We value our trans colleagues and allies, and understand the deep hurt that’s been caused. We respect the decision of any employee who chooses to walk out, and recognize we have much more work to do both within <span class="il">Netflix</span> and in our content,&#8221; a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<div dir="ltr">The exact turnouts of the employee walkout and solidarity rally are unclear, but there was enough hype around the event that Preston <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVOTn2Gv4Uz/">preemptively moved it</a> to a location with more space.</div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dnbE18-r_i0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The employees who participated in the walkout want Netflix to &#8220;adopt measures to avoid future instances of platforming transphobia and hate speech,&#8221; they wrote in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733098/netflix-trans-employees-demands-dave-chappelle-walkout">a letter</a>. They want Netflix to address a list of demands in the categories of content investment, employee relations and safety, and harm reduction.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221200" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>When it comes to content, the group wants Netflix to increase its funding of trans and non-binary talent, bring employee resource groups into conversations about potentially harmful content, hire more trans and non-binary content executives, and revise internal procedures around commissioning and releasing sensitive works. In terms of employee relations and safety, they want Netflix to recruit trans people, especially BIPOC, for leadership roles, allow employees to remove themselves from previous promotional content like allyship and diversity videos, and eliminate references and imagery of transphobic titles and talent in the workplace. For harm reduction, they want Netflix to acknowledge the company&#8217;s harm in platforming transphobic content, add a disclaimer before transphobic titles, boost promotion for trans-affirming titles on the platform, and suggest trans-affirming content alongside those flagged as anti-trans.</p>
<p>The demands do not include removing the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22722357/dave-chappelle-the-closer-netflix-backlash-controversy-transphobic">controversial</a> Dave Chappelle special from Netflix, which sparked backlash from some employees and Netflix subscribers concerned with the company&#8217;s platforming of transphobic speech.</p>
<p>When asked in an interview with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/netflix-ted-sarandos-dave-chappelle-walkout-1235033910/">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, co-CEO Ted Sarandos didn&#8217;t say whether he would meet the group&#8217;s demands.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the last couple of days, it’s been just listening to folks and hearing out how they’re feeling and what they’d like. I want to say that we are deeply committed to inclusion on screen and behind the camera and in our workplace,&#8221; Sarandos told the Hollywood Reporter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">brb walking out</p>
<p>&mdash; Most (@Most) <a href="https://twitter.com/Most/status/1450854377707630593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>He seemed doubtful that he would meet their demand to add a disclaimer about transphobia before Chapelle&#8217;s special.</p>
<p>&#8220;The content is age-restricted already for language, and Dave himself gives a very explicit warning at the beginning of the show, so I don’t think it would be appropriate in this case,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Before Netflix released the Chappelle special, employees <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?srnd=equality&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">raised concerns</a> about potentially harmful anti-trans jokes in the show — Chapelle <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/oct/07/dave-chappelle-transgender-netflix-special-backlash">declared</a> that he’s “Team TERF,” referring to trans-exclusionary radical feminists, who oppose the movement for transgender rights. But Sarandos doubled down on his defense of the special, writing <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/ted-sarandos-dave-chappelle-defense-1235088647/">an internal email</a> that “content on screen doesn’t directly translate to real-world harm.” After receiving backlash, he later told the Hollywood Reporter, &#8220;I 100% believe that content on screen can have impact in the real world, positive and negative.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netflix Senior Software Engineer Terra Field, who is transgender, tweeted a <a href="https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1445914236668895236">viral thread</a> about the Chappelle special.</p>
<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t complaining about &#8216;being offended,&#8217; and we don&#8217;t have &#8216;thin skin,'&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;What we object to is the harm of that content like this does to the trans community (especially trans people of color) and VERY specifically Black trans women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Field was later suspended, along with two other employees, for attempting to attend an online meeting of top executives, according to <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/dave-chappelle-netflix-suspends-trans-employee-1235086394/">reports</a>. But she was <a href="https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1448097310026747908">reinstated</a> after Netflix found that a director had shared a link to the meeting with her, implying that it was okay to attend.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Several things can be true. Netflix is an incredible, life changing company. And Netflix fucked up majorly.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Soon after, Netflix&#8217;s trans employee resource group began organizing a walkout. But B. Pagels-Minor, the organizer of the walkout and global lead of both the Black and Trans employee resource groups, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/netflix-fired-the-employee-who-organized-a-walkout-in-solidarity-with-trans-workers/">fired on Friday</a>. Their termination sparked more backlash against Netflix.</p>
<p>“We have let go of an employee for sharing confidential, commercially sensitive information outside the company,” a Netflix representative told TechCrunch last week. “We understand this employee may have been motivated by disappointment and hurt with Netflix, but maintaining a culture of trust and transparency is core to our company.”</p>
<p>TechCrunch was able to reach B. Pagels-Minor, but they did not offer a comment.</p>
<p>The leaked information in question appears to be some internal metrics on “The Closer” that appeared in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?srnd=equality&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">story by Bloomberg</a>, which reported that Netflix spent $24.1 million for the one-off special. Meanwhile, the company spent $3.9 million on Bo Burnham’s recent comedy special “Inside” and $21.4 million on the buzzy, nine-episode “Squid Game,” Netflix’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-says-squid-game-is-its-biggest-series-launch-ever?srnd=pursuits-vp">best-ever debut.</a></p>
<p>Netflix told TechCrunch that the employee admitted to sharing the content externally. But Pagels-Minor&#8217;s lawyer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/business/media/netflix-dave-chappelle-employee-walkout.html">told the New York Times</a> this week that “B. categorically denies leaking sensitive information to the press.” A former Netflix employee with knowledge of the situation told TechCrunch that they highly doubt that Pagels-Minor leaked these documents, as they had both been critical of the leaks in public company chats.</p>
<p>Netflix told TechCrunch that its internal access logs showed that only one person viewed sensitive data about the titles mentioned in the Bloomberg article.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Android 12 is now officially available for Google&#8217;s Pixel phones and will slowly roll out to others in the coming months. Chances are, you think of Android as a consumer product, but over the course of the last few years, Google has put a lot of work into making it an enterprise tool, too. It&#8217;s maybe no surprise that with the launch of Android 12, which already includes a number of <a href="https://blog.google/products/android-enterprise/androidenterprise12/">new enterprise features by default</a>, Google is also now announcing a couple of new security-focused initiatives around <a href="https://www.android.com/enterprise/">Android Enterprise</a>, too.</p>
<p>This includes a new bug bounty program, the aptly named <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/android-rewards/">Android Enterprise Vulnerability Program</a>, which promises up to $250,000 for a full exploit of a Pixel device that runs Android Enterprise.</p>
<p>But Goole is also working with its wider partner ecosystem to expand its support for the Zero Trust security model on Android. This means, for example, working with partners like Okta, Ping and ForgeRock to move their authentication workflows from WebView to Chrome <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/">Custom Tabs</a> on Android. Google has long argued that developers should use Custom Tabs whenever they render content from outside of their own domain, in part for performance reasons, but also because Chrome&#8217;s Safe Browsing features provide additional security.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221905" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;While WebView is a flexible and powerful component for rendering web content, Custom Tabs are more modern and full-featured, allowing identity providers to gather device trust signals, improve employee security and enable single-sign-on across apps and the web<span class="il">,&#8221; explains Rajeev Pathak, a senior product manager</span> at Google, in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>Google is also extending its Android Management API to make it easier for companies that use Enterprise Mobility Solutions from the likes of Microsoft, Citrix or Google itself to ensure that users &#8220;receive the fastest delivery of all of our enterprise features, with best practices and Android Enterprise Recommended requirements set by default.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers are mobilizing support for a ban on tracking-based advertising to be added to a new set of Internet rules for the bloc &#8212; which were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">proposed at the back end of last year</a> but are now entering the last stretch of negotiations ahead of becoming pan-EU law.</p>
<p>If they succeed it could have wide-ranging implications for adtech giants like Facebook and Google. And for the holistic health of Internet users&#8217; eyeballs more generally.</p>
<p>The move follows a smorgasbord of concerns raised in recent years over how such creepy ads, which use personal data to decide who sees which marketing message, can negatively impact individuals, businesses and society &#8212; from the risk of discrimination and predatory targeting of vulnerable people and groups; to the amplification of online disinformation and the threat that poses to democratic processes; to the vast underbelly of ad fraud embedded in the current system.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220973" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gathering so much data about Internet users is not only terrible for people&#8217;s privacy (and wasteful from an environmental perspective, given all the extra data-processing it bakes in), they contend, but tracking opens up a huge attack vector for hackers &#8212; supporting a pipeline of data breaches and security risks, which in turn contravenes key principles of existing EU law (like data minimization).</p>
<p>So arguments in favor of a regional ban are plentiful.</p>
<p>On the flip side, adtech giants Facebook and Google make bank by mining people&#8217;s digital activity and using this surreptitiously sucked up information as a targeting tool to grab attention, darting eyeballs with what they euphemize as &#8220;relevant&#8221; advertising &#8212; meaning ads that use people&#8217;s own information to try to manipulate their behavior for profit.</p>
<p>The powerful pair can easily afford to spend millions lobbying against anything that threatens their tracking-based business models. And they have been doing just that in Europe in recent years, as lawmakers have been working on redrawing the parameters of digital regulations &#8212; along with the tacit (if not very publicly valuable) support of an opaque adtech middleman layer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These are largely faceless (to consumers) entities that benefit from dynamics like the lack of traceability around current ad spending (oh-hi ad fraud!) and arbitrage of quality publishers&#8217; audiences to sell ads against cheap filler content (bye-bye quality journalism!). But that&#8217;s hardly good news for consumers, society or for fair and honest competition, critics say.</p>
<p>While the arguments for banning microtargeting have been getting louder and stronger (with each passing scandal) for years, it&#8217;s fair to say that this remains something of a David vs Goliath battle &#8212; with individual rights, civil society, quality publishers and pro-privacy innovators on one side vs big adtech and the sprawling ecosystem of opaque data-traders and Internet content bottom-feeders that the current Facebook-Google duopoly gives succour to punching down hard on the other.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, high level competition concerns over Facebook and Google&#8217;s power over online advertising is driving increasing scrutiny and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">enforcement</a> from antitrust watchdogs in Europe.</p>
<p>But the risk there is regulators could just end up cementing harmful microtargeting &#8212; such as by enforcing increased sharing of people&#8217;s data for ad targeting &#8212; instead of seeking to reboot the market in a way that&#8217;s both healthy for consumers and for healthy digital competition.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;France fines Google $268M for adtech abuses and gets interoperability commitments&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/embed/#?secret=2Qprt7wPbx" data-secret="2Qprt7wPbx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So, the next few weeks, really looks like crunch time for anyone rooting for a full reboot of surveillance-based business models.</p>
<p>MEPs in the European Parliament are set to vote on a number of committee reports that contain amendments to the Commission&#8217;s legislative proposals seeking to outlaw or restrict the practice &#8212; with a final plenary vote expected in early November.</p>
<p>Their target is the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA): Incoming EU regulations that contain a range of measures intended to level the playing field between offline and online commerce &#8212; by dialling up accountability on digital businesses and platforms; standardizing elements of governance; and seeking to enforce fairness of business dealing; in the latter case by applying a set of fixed rules to intermediating platform giants like Google and Facebook that play a gatekeeping role over Internet content and/or commerce.</p>
<p>The planned legislation contains a swathe of new rules for how Internet businesses will be able to operate in the EU. But the European Commission, which drafted the proposals, did not include an outright ban on surveillance-based ad business models.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what a number of MEPs are trying to change now.</p>
<p>The Commission sidestepped including a ban in the draft legislation despite pressure from the parliament and other EU institutions to take a tougher line on microtargeting.</p>
<p>There have also been mounting complaints against tracking-based ads under existing EU privacy law (the General Data Protection Regulation; GDPR) &#8212; and a concerning a lack of GDPR enforcement against adtech.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/international-coalition-joins-the-call-to-ban-surveillance-advertising/">International backing for a ban on surveillance-based ads</a> has also been growing.</p>
<p>The Commission itself has been actively grappling with related issues &#8212; like how to reduce online disinformation and protect EU elections from interference &#8212; and recently made an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/"> appeal to the adtech sector</a> to do more to address problematic economic incentives driving the amplification of harmful nonsense.</p>
<p>But although it has said it will be beefing up efforts in those areas it continues to prefer what amounts to a process of adtech industry engagement vs laying down strict legal limits to prohibit such intrusive targeting altogether. So it&#8217;s been left to Europeans&#8217; elected representatives to take a stand against microtargeting.</p>
<p>The next few weeks will be crucial to determining whether the bloc ends up taking the bold but &#8212; many now argue &#8212; necessary step of outlawing surveillance-based advertising.</p>
<p>Alternative forms of Internet advertising are both available and profitable, supporters of a ban say.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that even EU regulators only gave Google the green light to acquire Fitbit at the end of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/"> last year</a> after gaining a concession from the tech giant that it would not use Fitbit&#8217;s health data for ad targeting &#8212; for a full ten years.</p>
<p>So if the EU&#8217;s own regulators decided they needed to bake in such extensive precautions before allowing another data-grabbing acquisition by big (ad)tech, it does suggest the fundamental problem here is adtech&#8217;s unfettered use of people&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>If the bloc outlaws microtargeting it would &#8212; conversely &#8212; provide clear impetus for the publishing industry to switch to less intrusive forms of advertising, while simultaneously creating an incentive for increased innovation around pro-privacy business models &#8212; a space where European startups are already among the world leaders.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s a chance for the region to lead in both digital regulations and tech development.</p>

<h2>Growing support for tracking-free ads</h2>
<p>In recent months a coalition of MEPs, civil society organisations and companies from across the EU has been campaigning to end the pervasive tracking advertising industry that dominates the Internet &#8212; organizing under the banner of the <a href="https://trackingfreeads.eu/">Tracking-free Ads Coalition</a>, and most recently <a href="https://trackingfreeads.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Letter-Tracking-free-Ads-Coalition.pdf">writing</a> to 100 of Europe&#8217;s largest advertisers urging them to reconsider their participation in surveillance-based advertising.</p>
<p>The Coalition is also calling on interested parties <a href="https://trackingfreeads.eu/contact/">to join the push</a> to defend fundamental EU rights and counter tracking-based harms.</p>
<p>Although time is now short &#8212; with the window of opportunity for slotting a ban into draft legislation set to close in a few weeks&#8217; (or even days&#8217;) time as the European Parliament has its say on the final shape of the regulations.</p>
<p>The Coalition argues that harms associated with surveillance-based advertising are simply too vast to ignore &#8212; whether it&#8217;s the core erosion of the fundamental right EU citizens have to privacy, or the impact on publishers whose audiences are being arbitraged by big tech and opaque adtech middlemen which in turn undermines quality journalism and supercharges ad fraud.</p>
<p>Media plurality is at threat, they warn.</p>
<p>The group also points out that viable alternatives already exist for funding online content, such as contextual advertising &#8212; used by the likes of pro-privacy search engine DuckDuckGo, which has been profitable for over a decade for example.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo is one of 14 pro-privacy businesses that have intervened to lobby MEPs on the issue in recent weeks &#8212; along with Vivaldi, Fastmail, Conva, Proton, Tutao, Disconnect, Mojeek, Ecosia, Startpage &amp; StartMai<wbr></wbr>l, Nextcloud, Kobler, Strossle <wbr></wbr>International and Mailfence &#8212; who have written to the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) to express their backing for banning tracking ads.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to the clear privacy issues caused by surveillance-based advertising, it is also detrimental to the business landscape,&#8221; they wrote in their letter to the IMCO committee which makes the case for pro-privacy alternatives to tracking.</p>
<p>&#8220;These practices seriously undermine competition and take revenue away from content creators. Anticompetitive behaviour and effects serve to entrench dominant actors’ positions while complex supply chains and ineffective technologies lead to lost revenues for advertisers and publishers,&#8221; they also argued, adding: &#8220;Although we recognize that advertising is an important source of revenue for content creators and publishers online, this does not justify the massive commercial surveillance systems set up in attempts to &#8216;show the right ad to the right people&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Other forms of advertising technologies exist, which do not depend on spying on consumers, and alternative models can be implemented without significantly affecting revenue. On the contrary &#8212; and that we can attest to &#8212; businesses can thrive without privacy-invasive practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>MEPs backing the Coalition&#8217;s calls for a ban on tracking ads are hoping to convince enough of their fellow parliamentarians to step in over the broad array of harms being associated with surveillance-based business models, including by debunking the economic claims that adtech makes in defence of tracking-ads.</p>
<p>The Coalition is shooting for an outright ban on microtargeting in the DSA, which will apply broadly to all digital services; and also wants to get restrictions on how data can be combined by gatekeeping giants for ad purposes added to the DMA &#8212; which is likely to apply to both Facebook and Google (among other tech giants).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">October last year</a> MEPs backed a call for tighter regulations on microtargeting in favor of less intrusive forms of advertising (like contextual ads) &#8212; urging Commission lawmakers to assess further regulatory options, including looking at a phase-out leading to a full ban.</p>
<p>But the Coalition believes the debate has moved on enough that the parliament could vote to back an outright ban.</p>
<p>At the same time, supporters also warn over the frenzied lobbying going on in the background as adtech giants try to derail a threat to what is &#8212; for them &#8212; a very lucrative business model.</p>

<h2>Big adtech&#8217;s EU lobbying frenzy</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/The%20lobby%20network%20-%20Big%20Tech%27s%20web%20of%20influence%20in%20the%20EU.pdf">report</a> published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/us-giants-top-tech-industrys-100m-a-year-lobbying-blitz-in-eu/">this summer</a> by Corporate Europe Observatory and LobbyControl listed US adtech giants Google and Facebook at the top of a list of big spenders lobbying to influence EU lawmakers &#8212; with the pair splurging €5.8M and €5.5M respectively to push their pro-tracking agenda in the region.</p>
<p>However that&#8217;s likely just the tip of the iceberg as Facebook and Google provide funding to an array of third party lobby groups, such as think tanks and industry associations, which can often been heard amplifying their talking points &#8212; without making their links with big tech funders amply clear.</p>
<p>One source close to the parliament negotiations around the DSA and DMA highlighted Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;enormous&#8221; lobbying budget &#8212; saying there&#8217;s a belief among some MEPs that it&#8217;s &#8220;the largest lobbying operation in world history in Europe&#8221;.</p>
<p>With the counter push to amend EU legislation now entering the final stages, o<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ur source on the negotiations suggested there is political momentum to get a ban on microtargeting into EU law &#8212; following the </span><em style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Wall Street Journal</em><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8216;s recent exposé of internal Facebook documents.</span></p>
<p>The whistleblower, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">Frances Haugen</a>, who revealed herself as the source of the document dump, called directly for lawmakers to act &#8212; suggesting changes are needed to Facebook&#8217;s algorithms to prevent a range of virality-generated harms.</p>

<p>Preventing ads from being targeted against personal data would fall into that category &#8212; removing the economic incentives that prop up some types of harmful disinformation and misinformation.</p>
<p>But Paul Tang, of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament &#8212; who is one of the MEPs involved in the push for a ban on microtargeting &#8212; argues there are now scores of reasons to ban tracking ads.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are tons of reasons but the two main concerns we have are as follows: Firstly, we need to stop the massive privacy breaches and monetization of attention. New examples of misuse of data and the harms of polarisation algorithms are being published almost every single week,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, Google and Facebook have built an opaque advertising ecosystem, allowing ad fraud and giving them a duopoly on the digital advertising market to the detriment of SMEs and traditional publishers, who their income erode. This undermines our public media and by that our democratic institutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another MEP who&#8217;s part of the Coalition, Alexandra Geese, a member of the Greens/European Free Alliance political group, told us her personal concern is how much personal data is being allowed to accumulate in the hands of just two private companies &#8212; with a range of associated risks and concerns.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While data protection against public authorities works quite well in Europe, we’re only starting to understand the risks and harms that arise because private companies control so much personal data,&#8221; she argued. &#8220;If it were in the hands of a government like in China, there would be a public outcry. Some of the harms are already clearly visible. Disinformation, hateful speech and the polarization of societies as well as electoral manipulation are so widespread because groups of users can be specifically targeted &#8212; be it for commercial reasons (keeping eyeballs to show ads to with strong emotional content), be it for manipulation by malicious actors.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I also have strong economic concerns. In the current advertising ecosystem, no other company can compete and it’s also very difficult to make a different choice. This is already choking publishers. In the long run, this will damage European AI companies. While we can leverage industrial data in Europe, the possibility to predict people’s behaviour as well as being able to train algorithms with such a wealth of data will always be an enormous competitive advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A report by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) which was prepared at MEPs’ request &#8212; and shared with TechCrunch ahead of publication &#8212; summarises a range of key harms it argues stem from microtargeted ads, underscoring both threats to Europeans&#8217; fundamental rights (like privacy) and the negative impact on media pluralism of adtech giants&#8217; surveillance-based business models enabling an opaque layer of adtech that profits off a shadowy trade in people&#8217;s information and arbitrage of quality publishers&#8217; audience.</span></p>
<p>Estimates for<span class="s1"> the cost of what the ICCL report bills as the &#8220;opaque fees charged on every tracking-based ad&#8221; range between 35%-70% &#8212; which it cites as a key threat to media pluralism.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">In the report the ICCL also writes that Google has &#8220;diverted data and revenue from publishers to itself&#8221; &#8212; citing a stat that in 2004 half (51%) of the tech giant&#8217;s ad revenue came from displaying ads on publishers’ properties vs &#8220;nearly all&#8221; (85%) now being derived from displaying ads on its own websites and apps &#8212; which the ICCL says Google does &#8220;with the benefit of data taken from publishers’ properties&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">So the narrative here is of theft of individuals&#8217; privacy <em>and</em> publishers&#8217; revenue. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The report also summarises examples of revenue uplift experienced by a number of European publishers after they switched from microtargeting (tracking) to contextual (non-tracking) ads. </span><span class="s1">Such </span><span class="s1">as the 149% <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/data-from-dutch-public-broadcaster-shows-the-value-of-ditching-creepy-ads/">boost seen by Dutch publisher NPO Group</a> — or the 210% higher average price reported by TV2, a Norwegian news website for ads sold through Kobler’s contextual targeting vs tracking-based ad targeting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Practical evidence from European publishers now shows that publishers’ ad revenue can increase when tracking-based advertising is switched off,” the ICCL argues, predicting that: “A switch off across the entire market will amplify this effect, protecting fundamental rights and publisher sustainability. We urge lawmakers to play their part.”</span></p>
<p>Asked about momentum in the Parliament for a microtargeting ban, Tang suggests there is a lot of appetite among MEPs to change what he dubs as &#8220;this opaque and even fraudulent advertising system&#8221;.</p>
<p>But few people TechCrunch spoke to about this issue were willing to predict exactly which way MEPs will jump. So it really looks like it will go down to the wire.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are currently still in hectic negotiations with all political groups but there is for sure a momentum,&#8221; Tang added.</p>
<p>He also gave short shrift to big adtech&#8217;s claims that surveillance-based ads are essential for small businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook promotes itself disingenuously as the champion of small and medium enterprises. The high intermediary costs of Facebook and Google, the prevalence of ad fraud and the limited effectiveness of tracking-ads should all be red flags for every SME out there,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>Also discussing momentum for the campaign, Geese said three groups in the parliament (S&amp;D, Greens and Left) are currently <span lang="EN-US">supporting a ban and a shift to contextual advertising for the whole ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Some MEPs of other groups support stronger transparency and better consent regulation as well as a ban of dark patterns,&#8221; she also told us, adding: &#8220;What is interesting is the fact that public awareness is rising and campaigns are picking up speed. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;People are sick of being tricked into consent and when asked with a simple Yes/No question, refuse consent in high numbers (ca. 80% globally e.g. for iPhone users). The advertising system is evolving and shutting out third party cookies will also mobilize publishers if they don’t want to depend entirely on Google and Facebook,&#8221; she continued, before sticking her neck out with a prediction of victory, saying: </span><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;I’m confident that we will have a majority by the time DSA/DMA go to plenary.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Nonetheless, Geese acknowledged that Facebook and Google continue to have &#8220;huge influence&#8221; over views on this issue.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Their lobbying is pervasive and targets the EU commission as well as my fellow lawmakers and national governments,&#8221; she said, noting that she hears colleagues from other parties repeating Google and Facebook claims &#8220;without really understanding the issue&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Also all relevant Brussels-based think tanks as well as many academic researcher depend in some way on funding by big tech &#8212; so they all send out the same kind of message.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;The current main claim is that &#8216;targeted advertising is good for SMEs&#8217; as well as pretending that a ban of surveillance advertising would mean a ban of any kind of advertising &#8212; which is incorrect since we do support contextual advertising,&#8221; Geese went on. &#8220;</span><span lang="EN-US">Many lawmakers are not familiar with the advertising industry and don’t know that surveillance advertising is a rather new form of advertising that has been taking revenue away from European companies and publishers in the last 15 years. Most are also unaware that this market is controlled by a duopoly that faces charges for price-fixing in the US. How can this be good for SMEs or European companies? </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Furthermore there is no evidence whatsoever that SMEs benefit more from targeted advertising than from contextual. With our proposal, SMEs would still be able to target clients on websites based on their interests or even on their location. Contextual advertising has a huge growth potential and can serve SMEs far better than the current system, not to speak of publishers who have thrived with contextual in the past.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">We contacted Google and Facebook for comment on the Coalition&#8217;s campaign. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">At</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the time of writing neither had responded to the request. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But we also pinged the IAB Europe &#8212; which was happy to defend surveillance-based advertising on the tech giants&#8217; behalf.</span></p>
<p>In a statement attributed to Greg Mroczkowski, the IAB Europe&#8217;s director of public policy, the online ad industry association argued that creepy ads are &#8220;indispensable&#8221; for both small and big business, and &#8212; it claimed &#8212; for &#8220;Europe&#8217;s news publishers&#8221; and for &#8220;content creators of all kinds&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which, as an argument, does seem to gloss over some basic market dynamics &#8212; like, for instance, if you flood the market with &#8220;content&#8221; of any quality that might make it more difficult for news publishers to produce high quality journalism (which is more expensive to produce than any old clickbait) since all this stuff is competing for people&#8217;s eyeballs (and attention is finite).</p>
<p>Similarly, if big business is allowed to use intrusively powerful ad targeting tools, doesn&#8217;t that undermine the ability of small businesses to compete against those brand giants using the same tools &#8212; given they don&#8217;t have the same level of resource to spend on digital marketing and data gathering? So wouldn&#8217;t it be a more level playing field if people&#8217;s data was off-limits and competition could be centred on the relative merits of the products?</p>
<p>But, well, here&#8217;s the IAB&#8217;s statement in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Personalised advertising is an indispensable marketing channel for small businesses and household brands alike. It is also a vital revenue generator for Europe’s news publishers as well as other content creators of all kinds.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The EU’s already extensive legal framework for privacy and data protection applies directly to data-driven ads, and we support <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">enforcement of that law</a>. We also welcome measures to further boost trust and transparency in the online advertising ecosystem, but uncosted, untested prohibitions of valuable technological solutions are not the way forward.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The claim by the IAB that it supports enforcement of the GDPR is also worth an addendum, given that its own Transparency and Consent Framework &#8212; a widely used tool for gathering Internet users&#8217; &#8216;consents&#8217; to ad targeting &#8212; is itself the subject of a data protection complaint.</p>
<p>A division of Belgium&#8217;s data protection agency found in a preliminary report <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">last year </a>that the tool failed to comply with key GDPR principles of transparency, fairness and accountability, and the lawfulness of processing. But that regulatory procedure <a href="https://mlexmarketinsight.com/news-hub/editors-picks/area-of-expertise/data-privacy-and-security/iab-europes-gdpr-probe-moves-forward-in-hearing-with-belgian-authority">appears to be ongoing</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IAB Europe&#8217;s ad tracking consent framework found to fail GDPR standard&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/embed/#?secret=m4ZocT58Mb" data-secret="m4ZocT58Mb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Adtech enforcement gap</h2>
<p>Another important strand to this story is the (much chronicled) lack of enforcement of the GDPR around adtech.</p>
<p>Yet there seems to be a lack of awareness inside parts of the European Commission about this very notable enforcement gap where EU data protection law intersects with tracking-based business models.</p>
<p>One Commission official we spoke to &#8212; in the context of flagging eye-watering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/researchers-show-facebooks-ad-tools-can-target-a-single-user/">research that demonstrates Facebook&#8217;s platform can be used to target ads at a single person</a>; in order to ask whether such a problematic use-case might fall under a proposed prohibition in draft AI regulations (which will forbid subliminal techniques that influence people ‘beyond their consciousness’ and aim to materially distorting a person’s behaviour in a manner that causes or is likely to cause them or another person physical or psychological harm) &#8212; pointed to the GDPR by way of recourse, saying the law already establishes rules on users’ consent and/or their right to object to targeted digital marketing.</p>
<p>However this official seemed entirely unaware that Facebook does not offer an option to use its service without being tracked. Which means EU users simply can&#8217;t obtain their GDPR rights when/if using Facebook.</p>
<p>So if the Commission is imagining that the GDPR provides protection enough against abuse of personal data by adtech it hasn&#8217;t being paying enough attention to the rampant attention-mining going down, consent-free, on the modern web.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/french-court-slaps-down-googles-appeal-against-57m-gdpr-fine/">Google has been fined in France under GDPR</a> for failing to be transparent enough about its tracking practices. But privacy experts continue to decry its use of disingenuous dark patterns &#8212; such as labyrinthine settings menus that make it hard for consumers to figure out how to stop it tracking them for ad targeting as they browse the Internet.</p>
<p>While a complaint against Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;forced consent&#8221; has been stalled in Ireland &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke/">has suggested</a> there&#8217;s no legal problem with the tech giant claiming users are actually in a contract with it to receive targeted ads (meaning there&#8217;s no need for it to ask for their consent).</p>
<p>Like Facebook, Google is now regulated on data protection matters by Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission &#8212; which has faced years of criticism for failing to act on cross-border GDPR complaints, including a large number concerning adtech.</p>
<p>So, again, if the Commission takes the view that the GDPR alone can stop unwanted microtargeting it&#8217;s essential to underscore that that certainly has not happened yet &#8212; more than three years after the law came into application.</p>
<p>So the salient question then is, should EU citizens really have to wait <em>years</em> more for Europe&#8217;s top court to enforce the letter of the law? A growing number of MEPs don&#8217;t think so. Which is why they think it&#8217;s vital to put a ban on the face of EU legislation.</p>
<p>If these parliamentarians fail to get a ban on microtargeting into the DSA (and/or adtech data restrictions in the DMA) there is perhaps another looming chance for them to amend legislation to outlaw at least a subset of surveillance ads.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Commission official we spoke to suggested that a prohibition already included in another draft piece of EU legislation &#8212; the AI regulation, which will set rules around high risk uses of artificial intelligence &#8212; could <em>potentially</em> apply to microtargeting of people, if it fulfils all the conditions under article 5(1)a) of the proposed Act.</p>
<p>The problem is that the current Commission proposal sets a very high bar for a ban &#8212; requiring that such an ad is not only targeted at a person without their knowledge but must also &#8220;materially distort&#8221; their behaviour in such a way that it &#8220;causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological harm&#8221;.</p>
<p>Safe to say, the adtech giants would deny any such impact is possible from targeted advertising &#8212; even as they rake billions more into their coffers by selling people&#8217;s attention via an industrial data-gathering apparatus which has been baked into the web to spy on what Internet users do and profile people for profit.</p>
<p>If a microtargeting ban fails to make it in the votes now looming in the European Parliament, the AI Regulation could be the next &#8212; and perhaps final &#8212; battleground for EU lawmakers to overrule the surveillance giants.</p>

<p>Techstars&#8217; Jonathan Fentzke and Space Capital&#8217;s Chad Anderson will both be joining us at the event, which takes place December 14 and 15 this year. Fentzke is the managing director of Techstars&#8217; Space Accelerator, which partners with JPL, NASA, the U.S. Space Force, Lockheed Martin and more to curate and level-up a group of 10 space-focused deep tech startups for each cohort. Anderson is the Managing Partner at Space Capital, a seed-stage VC firm and fund, and prior to that he ran Space Angels, a collective of investors focused on funding the industry at the earliest stages.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s always tremendous risk involved in venture capital, and more so in the early offing. But potential reward is greater then, too, and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re excited to be able to chat with Fentzke and Anderson about what&#8217;s involved in placing those early bets, and helping entrepreneurs just getting started make the most of the current moment in the commercial space industry.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221846" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">FIN7, a financially motivated Russian hacking group, has set up a fake company to lure unwitting IT specialists into supporting its continued expansion into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a>, security researchers have found.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">According to researchers at <a href="https://geminiadvisory.io/fin7-ransomware-bastion-secure/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_Vc7Ohwvc2RdjE74Btza4vgdCUztbiG1easG_eqmXLE4-1634826118-0-gqNtZGzNAiWjcnBszQe9">Recorded Future&#8217;s Gemini Advisory unit</a>, FIN7 — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/burgerville-hack-fin7-fbi/">known for hacking into point-of-sale registers and stealing over $1 billion from millions of credit cards</a> — is now operating under the guise of Bastion Secure, which claims to offer specialized <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/public-sector/">public sector</a> cybersecurity services.</p>
<p>Bastion Secure’s website looks like the real deal. But the research found FIN7 is using real, publicly available information from existing, legitimate cybersecurity companies — phone numbers, office locations and text pulled from real websites — to create a veil of legitimacy. Bastion&#8217;s website claims it won &#8220;Best Managed Security Service&#8221; at the SC Magazine awards in 2016, and that the fake company&#8217;s consultancy arm was acquired by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/six-degrees/">Six Degrees</a> in 2016. Neither are true.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221820" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Recorded Future&#8217;s analysis of the fake company&#8217;s website found it is largely copied from the website of Convergent Network Solutions, a legitimate cybersecurity company. The researchers said the site is hosted on the Russian domain registrar Beget, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybercrime/">cybercriminals</a> often use, and some of the submenus of the fake company&#8217;s website return a Russian-language &#8220;page not found&#8221; error, which the researchers said could indicate that the site creators were Russian speakers.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, both Chrome and Safari have blocked access to the &#8220;deceptive&#8221; site.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Much like the website, Bastion Secure’s advertised vacancies look legitimate enough, too. The fictitious company is looking for programmers, system administrators and reverse-engineers, and the job descriptions are similar to those you&#8217;d find at any cybersecurity company.</p>
<p>But Recorded Future said that FIN7 — under the guise of Bastion Secure — is looking to build a &#8220;staff&#8221; capable of conducting the tasks necessary for undertaking a range of cybercriminal activity.</p>
<p>“Given FIN7’s increased interest in ransomware, Bastion Secure is likely specifically looking for system administrators because an individual with this skill set would be able to,” the researchers found.</p>
<p>The interview process also rang alarm bells for the researchers. While the first and second stages gave no indication that Bastion Secure is concealing a cybercriminal operation, the third — in which prospective employees were tasked with a &#8220;real&#8221; assignment — gave it away.</p>
<p>&#8220;It became immediately clear that the company was involved in criminal activity,” the researchers said. “The fact that the Bastion Secure representatives were particularly interested in file systems and backups signals that FIN7 was more interested in conducting ransomware attacks than [point of sale] infections.”</p>
<p>One of the Recorded Future researchers who was offered a position as IT researcher at Bastion Secure analyzed the tools that were provided by the company and found the tools are components of the post-exploitation toolkits Carbanak and Tirion (Lizar). Both toolkits have been previously attributed to FIN7 and can be used for hacking both point-of-sale systems and deploying ransomware.</p>
<p>“FIN7’s decision to use a fake cybersecurity company to recruit IT specialists for its criminal activity is driven by FIN7’s desire for comparatively cheap, skilled labor,&#8221; Recorded Future said. &#8220;Bastion Secure’s job offers for IT specialist positions ranged between $800 and $1,200 USD a month, which is a viable starting salary for this type of position in post-Soviet states&#8230; In effect, FIN7’s fake company scheme enables the operators of FIN7 to obtain the talent that the group needs to carry out its criminal activities, while simultaneously retaining a larger share of the profits.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time FIN7 has masqueraded as a legitimate firm, <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/09/13/fin7-sysadmin-pleads-guilty-to-running-it-for-billion-dollar-crime-syndicate/">previously posing as &#8220;Combi Security,&#8221;</a> before unwanted public attention prompted the group to shut down the fake company.</p>
<p>Brett Callow, a ransomware expert and threat analyst at Emsisoft, told TechCrunch that FIN7&#8217;s decision to masquerade as Bastion Secure is likely also an attempt to avoid unwanted attention from law enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not at all surprising that a cybercrime operation would attempt to recruit via a fake company. Hiring from the dark web is problematic and risky,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ransomware gangs are less welcome on certain cybercrime forums than they once were, and applicants could potentially be law enforcement officers working undercover. Using standard job ads addresses both problems, while the fake company may also serve other purposes — money laundering, for example.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And employees could certainly be misled as to the nature of their work — for example, they may not realize that companies are unwilling recipients of their pen-testing,&#8221; said Callow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is lowering commissions on all subscription-based businesses on the Google Play Store, the company announced today. Previously, the company had followed Apple&#8217;s move by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">reducing commissions</a> from 30% to 15% on the first $1 million of developer earnings. Now, it will lower the fees specifically for app makers who generate revenue through recurring subscriptions. Instead of charging them 30% in the first year, which lowers to 15% in year two and beyond, Google says developers will only be charged 15% from day one.</p>
<p>The company says 99% of developers will qualify for a service fee of 15% or less, as Google is also further reducing fees for specific vertical apps in the <a href="https://play.google.com/console/about/mediaprogram/">Play Media Experience Program</a>. These will be adjusted to as low as 10%, it says.</p>
<p>The Play Media Experience Program encompasses apps like e-books and on-demand streaming music or video services, where the content costs account for the majority of sales. These are also businesses that, in some cases, compete directly with Google &#8212; as YouTube Music does with Spotify, for example.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221893" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The program was launched earlier this year to encourage book, video and audio developers to build for Android, and had offered service fees as low as 15%. Developers are asked to fill out a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSek2jHzWHHuVtfG4p-1H78pnechfLUD37c-IGTetVR4t59mMQ/viewform?resourcekey=0-MFg9iiob8Zlx4AArOrTSzQ&amp;_ga=2.88532059.194255499.1634832346-997168106.1627333517">form</a> to express interest.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221939" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221939" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2221939" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-12.18.48-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="509" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-12.18.48-PM.jpg 1830w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-12.18.48-PM.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-12.18.48-PM.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-12.18.48-PM.jpg?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-12.18.48-PM.jpg?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-12.18.48-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1150 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-12.18.48-PM.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221939" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Digital subscriptions have become one of the fastest growing models for developers but we know that subscription businesses face specific challenges in customer acquisition and retention,&#8221; said Google&#8217;s Sameer Samat, vice president, Product Management, in an announcement. &#8220;We’ve worked with our partners in dating, fitness, education and other sectors to understand the nuances of their businesses. Our current service fee drops from 30% to 15% after 12 months of a recurring subscription. But we’ve heard that customer churn makes it challenging for subscription businesses to benefit from that reduced rate. So, we’re simplifying things to ensure they can,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The new fees will kick in starting on January 1, 2022, Google said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company noted it spoke with the developer community to help determine the new fee structure, and took in feedback from a variety of developers across industries and verticals, including Anghami, AWA, Bumble, Calm, Duolingo, KADOKAWA, KKBOX, Picsart and Smule.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when determining the new fees for media apps, Google said that it realized that app-building now requires addressing a number of platforms, including TVs, cars, watches, tablets and more. That requires developers to invest more into their app-based business. In addition, by lowering the fees on apps delivering media experiences, Google believes this could allow businesses to pass on the savings to the artists, musicians, authors and other creators who would be impacted by the changes.</p>
<p>The move comes at a time of increased regulatory scrutiny over the app stores and several antitrust lawsuits, including an ongoing one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/google-files-a-counterclaim-in-epic-games-lawsuit-saying-its-owed-financial-relief/">in the U.S. with Epic Games</a>. Globally, lawmakers are working to determine if the tech giants are abusing their market power with the app stores, which provide the main distribution path for software that runs on mobile devices. South Korea, for instance, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">passed</a> an &#8220;anti-Google&#8221; law meant to curb in-app payment commissions. Plus, in many cases, the tech companies are competing with the developers whose apps they distribute through other arms of their much larger businesses, which complicates matters further.</p>
<p>In a clever move to thwart further regulations, Google has managed to get some developers on board with its new commissions ahead of their release. It even today provided statements by Bumble and Duolingo praising the move, with Bumble&#8217;s CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd saying this pricing will allow it &#8220;to better invest in our products&#8221; and Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn saying the reductions will help it to &#8220;accelerate our mission&#8221; and that it&#8217;s &#8220;excited to see Google continuing to collaborate with the ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though lowering its commissions, Google stresses that it does need to charge fees in order to continue to invest in Android, its commerce platform, the Play Store, security, app distribution system and developer tools. Google says it will share more about its coming updates to tools, APIs and other technologies during its <a href="https://developer.android.com/events/dev-summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.android.com/events/dev-summit&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634918105089000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGvE5pSQdkH0WQMSFJNguKlq2j1Uw">Android Developer Summit</a> on October 27-28.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s no secret that NFTs have been a hot space for crypto speculators in the Ethereum ecosystem to diversify their holdings, and while some see a golden opportunity to shill bad art to suckers, others believe that NFT-based gaming is destined for the mainstream and that products that nail the mechanics early-on will earn the spoils.</p>
<p>Parallel, a sci-fi card game based on the Ethereum blockchain, has had a more meteoric rise than most crypto projects, and investors have noticed. The platform tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve raised $50 million at a half-billion dollar valuation from crypto VC firm Paradigm. Previous investors include YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley, Focus Labs, OSS Capital and Yunt Capital, among others.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best crypto games will be the ones that can go beyond first-party content and inspire a community of players and developers to build on the game itself. We were impressed by <span class="il">Parallel</span>&#8216;s unique approach and fervent early community, and excited to support them for their next stage of growth,&#8221; Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang said in an email.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The project is based around a fantasy storyline about humanity&#8217;s escape from space following an apocalyptic attempt to resolve a global energy crisis. Unlike some of the other highly valuable pixelated NFT projects, like CryptoPunks, Parallel&#8217;s art style is focused on realism &#8212; through a science fiction lens, of course.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221518" style="width: 253px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221518" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2221518" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png" alt="" width="243" height="365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221518" class="wp-caption-text">An NFT from Parallel&#8217;s upcoming drop</p></div></p>
<p>The sci-fi NFT card game caught fire in August after its first pack drop amid a massive surge in NFT speculation. According to crypto tracker CryptoSlam, the platform did nearly $105 million in transaction volume. One of the titles&#8217; &#8220;Masterpiece&#8221; cards sold for $1.1 million worth of the Ethereum cryptocurrency. Even as sales fell to just over $11 million in September, a huge month like that can do big things for the long-term value of an NFT project, as rarer purchases made during that time that are held onto long-term can establish steadier baseline price floors for new assets minted on-chain.</p>
<p>Nothing stress tests a system like thousands of tech-savvy speculators trying to break down said system in order to get filthy rich. As a result, NFT &#8220;drops&#8221; have been plagued by every kind of nightmarish scenario. So far things have gone pretty well for Parallel, which has built up its own drop system, but with its next drop just days away and the potential value of those cards moving higher, plenty of eyes are centered on how smoothly things go.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The game element of the project doesn&#8217;t actually exist yet; the early funding has been used to build it out. Parallel takes a substantial 10% royalty on NFT sales, with half of that going toward in-game prize pools and the rest going to the company. That money can mean bigger revenues for the core platform down the line, but when the entry-point to a game swells to a few thousand dollars, the nature of the &#8220;game&#8221; becomes something different entirely. Balancing a market that tempts investors with rarity but is also friendly to new users has been a big challenge for NFT gaming projects to tackle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Parking can often feel almost laughably old-fashioned, with some lots still hiring an attendant to collect fees and check for valid tickets. Even when parking lot owners try to modernize &#8212; using an app, for example, or a credit card machine to take payment &#8212; they must deal with a whole array of providers to manage hardware, payment processing and marketing, all separately.</p>
<p>That’s where <a href="https://www.airgarage.com/">AirGarage</a> comes in. The company works with parking real estate owners and offers a full-stack software and management service for their lot or garage. That means handling everything from installing signage to collecting payments, and even providing parking enforcement.</p>
<p>AirGarage already has more than 200 locations across 30 states under its management. To scale its services even more, the startup has just closed a $12.5 million Series A led by a16z, with participation from existing investors Floodgate, Founders Fund and Abstract Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220963" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company’s undergone a number of pivots since its founding by Jonathon Barkl, Chelsea Border and Scott Fitsimones in 2017. The original instantiation of AirGarage, conceived when the three were students at Arizona State University, was to create a platform for people to rent out their driveways to college students who were paying exorbitant fees for on-campus parking. Barkl referred to this idea &#8212; a peer-to-peer marketplace for parking &#8212; as “AirGarage 1.0.”</p>
<p>“That was how we started getting in to the parking industry, in the parking problem,” he told TechCrunch in a recent interview. “The thread that carries through is we realized there&#8217;s underutilized space that is poorly managed and not really being monetized in the way that it should be, and we just have technology and add software to this, we can change that.”</p>
<p>In 2018, the company made its first shift, moving away from home driveways and toward parking space owners like churches and small businesses, to help them monetize their existing, underutilized asset. That was really when AirGarage hammered out its software-first full-stack approach, Barkl explained.</p>
<p>Two years later &#8212; in May 2020, when many cities were in the midst of their first round of stay-at-home orders and lockdowns &#8212; the company shifted yet again, this time to focus on parking real estate commonly found in downtown urban areas. The pandemic may seem like an odd time for a shift, especially for a startup that generates its revenue at least indirectly by people going outside, but Barkl described COVID as a “lightbulb moment” for AirGarage.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The way much of the parking industry works is by parking garage operators or managers leasing the space from the actual real estate owner. AirGarage started getting approached by owners who felt slighted by the managers during the pandemic, after these managers refused to continue paying them as part of prearranged lease agreements.</p>
<p>Plus, many of these agreements see the managers receiving 100% of the revenue after paying the lease fee; Barkl said they would talk to owners who were receiving $10,000 a month under a lease agreement for parking real estate that was generating $30,000 a month, leaving them with only a third of total revenue.</p>
<p>Instead, AirGarage offers a 70-30 split in the owner’s favor, with full transparency regarding how much money the parking real estate is pulling in each month. To increase revenue even more, AirGarage also collects data on the parking site in order to offer things like dynamic pricing, in addition to conducting all advertising, payment processing and online listings.</p>
<p>On the backend, the startup offers parking enforcement under a program it calls “space force.” It works by engaging gig workers &#8212; an Uber driver who is idling in-between rides, for example &#8212; to pull into lots and check license plates. Drivers get paid for each license they ensure is valid, and that fee is also dynamically priced according to how busy the lot is that day.</p>
<p>With the fresh round of funding, AirGarage is aiming to roll out new software and services so owners can generate revenue not only from personal vehicle parking, but from food trucks that need a place to park or cloud kitchens that need a place to store food. The engineering team is also working on features like using cameras to automatically read license plates so a driver can put her plate number on file with AirGarage and not have to worry about payment in the moment at all.</p>
<p>Barkl estimated that out of the 200-plus customers the company has signed on, fewer than five have cancelled services.</p>
<p>“In the last 20 years, while other industries have had monumental shifts because of technology and software, the parking industry is not quite there yet,” he said. “These companies are just so backwards and old-school in the way that they do things, and the only way to fix that, in our opinion, is to replace those companies entirely with what we&#8217;re building, which is that full-stack operator.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku shared <a href="https://www.roku.com/blog/update-on-youtube-tv">a progress update</a> today on its ongoing contract dispute with Google related to its attempt to renew the carriage agreement for YouTube TV, Google&#8217;s live TV streaming service. In April, Roku <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/roku-removes-youtube-tv-from-its-channel-store-following-failed-negotiations/">removed</a> the YouTube TV app from its channel store so it was no longer available to new Roku subscribers, but took steps to ensure that existing subscribers could continue to use the service. Today, Roku says it has still not been able to come to a deal with Google, and warns customers that Google could choose to remove YouTube TV from the Roku platform.</p>
<p>YouTube, however, says the breakdown of the negotiations doesn&#8217;t mean YouTube TV&#8217;s existing customers on Roku will be impacted.</p>
<p>Though its partnership agreement will terminate in December, YouTube tells TechCrunch that exiting users on existing Roku devices will still be able to use both YouTube TV and the YouTube app. However, new Roku devices won&#8217;t be able to carry either of the apps, it said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221816" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Roku earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/roku-removes-youtube-tv-from-its-channel-store-following-failed-negotiations/">made the details of its contract dispute public</a>, saying that Google had been asking for special treatment with regard to how its services are integrated into Roku&#8217;s operating system. While the agreement under discussion is related to YouTube TV, Google was also asking for preferential ranking of YouTube content in Roku&#8217;s search results and permissions to override default settings when the YouTube app is open, it said. For instance, if a Roku customer had YouTube open and used voice search to ask for music, Google wanted YouTube Music to play the request, even if the customer had set Pandora as their preferred music app.</p>
<p>Roku also alleged earlier this year that Google was asking for more data on Roku customers than it provides other developers, and said Google threatened to increase the hardware spec requirements for YouTube TV, which would ensure Roku&#8217;s lower-end and more competitively priced players would not be able to access it.</p>
<p>Google has consistently pushed back on Roku&#8217;s statements,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/roku-removes-youtube-tv-from-its-channel-store-following-failed-negotiations/"> saying it had not made requests</a> to &#8220;access user data or interfere with search results.&#8221; The company also shamed Roku for turning to customers in an attempt to sway the negotiations in its favor and said all its requests were about providing a good user experience.</p>
<p>Essentially, today&#8217;s update is to let Roku&#8217;s customers know that no progress has yet been made with the negotiations, and to alert them that Google could later take a more punitive action, if it chose. Roku may be right to warn customers that YouTube TV could one day be pulled from its platform, but it&#8217;s also a risk to share that sort of information this close to the holiday shopping season when consumers are in the market for new streaming devices. (After all, Roku just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/roku-debuts-new-streaming-stick-4k-bundles-software-update-with-voice-and-mobile-features/">released</a> a pair of new Streaming Stick 4K devices and a refreshed Roku Ultra LT, a Walmart-exclusive version of its high-end player.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That Roku would warn customers of a possibility of a removal that even Google says isn&#8217;t yet happening is an indication of how dirty these negotiations have gotten.</p>
<p>Roku&#8217;s arguments seem to largely boil down to what sort of rights it has to dictate how its own software works as the platform provider. That means determining how search results are displayed, what sort of data is shared with its app developers and how apps are meant to behave, according to its own guidelines.</p>
<p>These are the same sort of rules Apple and Google make for their own platforms. But although Roku is the platform in this scenario, it doesn&#8217;t put itself on the side of the tech giants who are accused of abusing their monopoly power &#8212; it paints itself as the victim, having to bow to Google&#8217;s demands or risk losing access to Google&#8217;s must-have apps, like YouTube and YouTube TV. And of course, Google competes directly with Roku via Chromecast.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ysZL4pRpto"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/streaming-services-face-their-real-test-in-2021/">Streaming services face their real test in 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Streaming services face their real test in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/streaming-services-face-their-real-test-in-2021/embed/#?secret=ysZL4pRpto" data-secret="ysZL4pRpto" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But Roku is not some indie developer trying to fight back against tech giants who are trying to destroy its business. It&#8217;s a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ROKU/key-statistics/">multibillion</a>-dollar company that&#8217;s <a href="https://nscreenmedia.com/android-tv-market-share/">claimed a larger slice of the U.S. streaming market</a> than Google&#8217;s own Chromecast.</p>
<p>YouTube told TechCrunch it has been negotiating in good faith with Roku and alleges Roku is still making baseless claims that cause alarm among their mutual users. The company reiterated that it has made no requests to access user data or interfere with search results.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since our negotiations with Roku earlier this year, we’ve continued to work with them to find a resolution that benefits our mutual users,&#8221; a YouTube spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roku has once again chosen to make unproductive and baseless claims rather than try to work constructively with us. Since we haven’t been able to continue our conversations in good faith, our partnership for all new Roku devices will unfortunately end on December 9. We are, however, giving Roku the ability to continue distributing both YouTube and YouTube TV apps to all existing users to make sure they are not impacted,&#8221; they added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If I went to Stanford and worked with some YC-backed startups, chances are that I’ll find it relatively easy to find one or two co-founders, get millions in funding and build a billion-dollar company.</p>
<p>However, as someone who grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, and studied at the University of Nigeria, those chances are much slimmer, and it’ll be hard to find the same resources to build a successful company.</p>
<p>When Y Combinator began Startup School as an in-person program for early-stage founders launching a company, it catered to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/16/startup-school/">first set</a> of privileged founders. But it then decided to level the playing field a bit by taking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/y-combinators-startup-school-relaunches-to-be-ready-when-you-are/">the program online</a> so founders from other parts of the world could participate.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221278" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The free program, which provides a similar curriculum to YC’s main content used during its biannual startup batches, amassed more than 300,000 participants.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.startupschool.org/">Startup School</a> has a Q&amp;A session every Monday where new members of the program join in for the first time. After several meetings, those in charge of the program noticed they needed to solve another problem.</p>
<p>“The most common question we get is where do I find a co-founder? How do I find the right co-founder? How to find a tech co-founder? So it was just very obvious to us that it’s a huge problem for people,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherynli">Catheryn Li</a>, product engineer at Y Combinator, said in an interview. “I think something like 20% of our active founders are actively looking for a co-founder and that’s across our 300,000 founders.”</p>
<p>So, the team began testing a co-founder matching platform with some early users in January this year and it went live in July.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When aspiring founders come to the platform, they describe themselves and the kind of co-founder they need. The platform then offers a pool of candidates who might be a good fit for the aspiring founder. If their requirements overlap and mutual interest exist on both ends, a connection is made.</p>

<p>For example, if an aspiring founder with an engineering background is looking for a sales/marketing co-founder, the other person would have to be a sales and marketing co-founder interested in an engineering co-founder.</p>
<p>In the three and half months YC’s co-founder matching platform has been live, more than 16,000 co-founder profiles have been created. These founders have sent 130,000 matching invites; with a 25% acceptance rate, the platform has made 33,000 matches.</p>
<p>Although it’s too early to determine the platform’s long-term results, TechCrunch spoke with Li and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katmanalac">Kat Mañalac</a>, YC’s head of outreach, to discuss a few short-term trends &#8212; some surprising and some not.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The matching platform received profiles from 146 countries &#8212; 40% from the U.S. and 60% from 145 countries.</p>
<p>The pandemic and a new work-from-home culture have fundamentally changed how founders think about location when choosing a co-founder. Assuredly, it is an incidental attribute &#8212; according to the report, 50% of the founders do not care where their co-founder resides.</p>
<p>“When we started creating this platform, we assumed that it’d be really important for someone to find a co-founder that’s nearby so that they can meet up in person,” Li said. “But it turns out people don’t care about that anymore.”</p>
<p>Further breakdown of founders’ location shows some similarity between a typical YC batch and the countries represented in the matching program.</p>
<p>For instance, the biggest representative outside the U.S. (both in this matching platform and YC’s most recent batch) is India. The South Asian country accounts for 14% of the profiles, followed by the U.K., Canada and Nigeria.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a continental breakdown looks like this: North America, 46%; Asia, 23%; Europe, 21%; Africa, 6%; South America, 3%; and Australia, 2%.</p>
<p>But matches performed on the platform tell a different story as founders have found partners in close proximity. Of the matches made so far, 55% are founders located in the same country, 69% are between founders in the same continent, while 61% of matches are from founders located within three time zones of one another.</p>
<h2>Shared interests and skills</h2>
<p>If founders care less about the location of their business partners, then what do they care about the most? Per the report, 79% of the profiles want their co-founder to commit to a certain number of hours for a few weeks into a project, while 74% prefer to have shared interests with their co-founder.</p>
<p>Shared interests, in this case, are synonymous with the industries or sectors generally known in the startup world, from blockchain and e-commerce to fintech and hardware.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221425" style="width: 644px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221425" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2221425" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?w=634" alt="YC co-founder matching platform" width="634" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png 2782w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?resize=140,150 140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?resize=280,300 280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?resize=768,824 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?resize=634,680 634w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?resize=1432,1536 1432w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?resize=1909,2048 1909w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screencapture-startupschool-org-cofounder-matching-trial-6MnBIYAkk-2021-10-18-20_11_21.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221425" class="wp-caption-text">YC co-founder matching platform</p></div></p>
<p>Profiles are allowed to select several interests on the matching platform and the most selected ones are almost identical to the categories on a typical YC batch: 36% of the founders selected B2B/enterprise; 34% picked consumer; 34% chose AI; 32% indicated an interest in the marketplace category; while 29% chose fintech and e-commerce.</p>
<p>To build in any of these sectors, founders need skill, and on the matching platform, five skills are held in high regard &#8212; product, design, engineering, sales and marketing, and operations.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising which skill is in the highest demand: engineering. According to the report, 63% of founders on the platform want a co-founder who does engineering. Even engineering founders want engineering co-founders: 44% of engineering founders prefer an engineer co-founder, the report said.</p>
<p>For other skills, 42% of founders want a product person; 39% prefer a design co-founder; 37% are better off if they find a co-founder who does sales and marketing; while 28% want a co-founder skilled in operations.</p>
<h2>More work to be done for underrepresented founders</h2>
<p>A widespread consensus held in the startup world is that it’s best to work with someone you’ve known for a while, maybe a friend or colleague, when looking for a co-founder.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/02/how-to-pick-a-co-founder">article by Harvard Business Review</a> in 2011 says, “a long-term relationship can help you leapfrog the learning curve of the close collaboration, which can sometimes take years to develop.”</p>
<p>On the surface, YC’s co-founder matching platform does not seem to regard this advice. One Twitter user called it “co-founder dating” and said YC lecturers in Startup School frown on the idea.</p>
<p>But Li explains that the matching platform has a pretty different model from other co-founder dating platforms.</p>
<p>“I do think that the typical advice that you should have met your co-founder a long time ago is less about the length of time and more about the fact that you are really comfortable working with them and you understand their working styles,” she said.</p>
<p>She adds that YC recommends that when two profiles match, they should not become co-founders immediately in the program. Instead, YC presents an opportunity for them to figure out each other’s personality and compatibility by pitching them with a trial project to work on for weeks or even months together.</p>
<p>In the project, clearly defined scopes and expectations are set so matched profiles can figure out each other’s working styles and compatibility.</p>
<p>Though it’s too early to say, the model seems to be working. Of the thousands of companies founded on the platform, 50 of them applied to the Y Combinator Summer batch &#8212; and three got in.</p>
<p>One of the startups is Sequin, a fintech that builds a debit card for women to build credit. The founders, Vrinda Gupta and Mark Thomas were some of the early testers of the matching platform.</p>
<p>CEO Gupta is one of the 13% of profiles that identify as a woman. The percentage reflects the global underrepresentation of female founders, but Mañalac believes YC’s matching platform will help close that gap.</p>
<p>“How to find a co-founder is one of the most common questions we get, especially from women who are solo founders. And, so we’re hoping that this is one way that we can help increase the pipeline of women that can start companies and get funding.”</p>
<p>She also hopes more aspiring underrepresented founders in international markets get to know about the platform. That way, they “can <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">meet more people who are interested in building and hopefully one day start a company with them.”</span></p>
<p>YC alumni also see value from the platform. Li recounted an instance where a female founder from the winter batch this year got a technical co-founder via the matching platform &#8212; barring her, over 150 alumni are using the platform to find new co-founders with whom they can start a new company.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">NVIDIA has unveiled its next-generation cloud gaming platform called GeForce Now RTX 3080 with &#8220;desktop-class latency&#8221; and 1440p gaming at up to 120 fps on PC or Mac. The service is powered by a new gaming supercomputer called the GeForce Now SuperPod and costs double the price of the current <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-nows-price-increase-new-features-180648780.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Priority tier</a>.</p>
<p>The SuperPod is &#8220;the most powerful gaming supercomputer ever built,&#8221; according to NVIDIA, delivering 39,200 TFLOPS, 11,477, 760 CUDA Cores and 8,960 CPU Cores. NVIDIA said it will provide an experience equivalent to 35 TFLOPs, or triple the Xbox Series X, roughly equal to a PC with an 8-core CPU, 28GB of DDR4-3200 RAM and a PCI-GEN4 SSD.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-10%2F9fb8f9d0-325d-11ec-bf9c-44ba371e8c1d&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=e0b28f14066b4ff146d91f1f0ceb12b9bebe8aa1" alt="NVIDIA launches GeForce Now RTX 3080-class gaming at up to 1440p 120fps" data-uuid="44dbf143-8ef2-3271-9d6c-1ec0ca74a0a9" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NVIDIA</div>
</figure>
<p>As such, you&#8217;ll see 1440p gaming at up to 120fps on a Mac or PC, and even 4K HDR on a shield, though NVIDIA didn&#8217;t mention the refresh rate for the latter. It&#8217;ll also support 120 fps on mobile, &#8220;supporting next-gen 120Hz displays,&#8221; the company said. By comparison, the GeForce Now Priority tier is limited to 1080p at 60 fps, with adaptive VSync available in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-nows-price-increase-new-features-180648780.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">latest update</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221858" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s also promising a &#8220;click-to-pixel&#8221; latency down to 56 milliseconds, thanks to tricks like adaptive sync that reduces buffering, supposedly beating other services and even local, dedicated PCs. However, that&#8217;s based on a 15 millisecond round trip delay (RTD) to the GeForce Now data center, something that obviously depends on your internet provider and where you&#8217;re located.</p>
<p>NVIDIA&#8217;s claims aside, it&#8217;s clearly a speed upgrade over the current GeForce Priority tier, whether you&#8217;re on a mobile device or PC. There&#8217;s a price to pay for that speed, though. The GeForce Now premium tier started at $50 per year and recently doubled to $100, which is already a pretty big ask. But the RTX 3080 tier is $100 for six months (around double the price) &#8220;in limited quantities,&#8221; with Founders and priority early access starting today. If it lives up to the claims, it&#8217;s cheaper than buying a new PC, in any case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As investors race to capitalize on surging interest in cryptocurrencies, startups are getting creative in how they onboard a generation of crypto users to their first wallets.</p>
<p><a href="https://worldcoin.org/">Worldcoin</a> is perhaps one of the most audacious efforts to bribe the world to embrace their currency. The startup, founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Alex Blania, wants to put a crypto wallet (and some of their currency) onto every human&#8217;s smartphone, but in order to do so they have to build a way to determine whether someone is a unique human. Worldcoin is aiming to make their proof-of-personhood network in the least dystopian way possible. That being said, it still requires scanning a billion people&#8217;s eyeballs with a five-pound chromatic sphere called &#8220;The Orb&#8221;.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221838" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221838" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221838" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg 4344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AlexAndSam.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221838" class="wp-caption-text">Alex Blania, left, and Sam Altman.

<p>The internet has developed with a very amorphous mesh of user networks. Bot networks operate alongside real people using their real identities, alongside users impersonating real people, alongside pseudonymous users. This can be a recipe for misaligned user incentives, as modern social media platforms have showcased, but when it comes to finance it can also be a recipe for fraud and inequality. Worldcoin wants to avoid all of that while ensuring equitable distribution of their currency, ensuring that each human on earth only signs up for one wallet in their network.</p>
<p>Worldcoin CEO Alex Blania tells TechCrunch that the currency is part of a larger effort to drive a more unified and equitable global economy driven by the internet economy, something cryptocurrencies notably haven&#8217;t nailed in their first several years.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Worldcoin] started with a discussion that universal basic income will eventually be something that is very important to the world, and in general, getting access to the internet economy will be much more important than is obvious at this point,&#8221; Blania says.</p>
<p>The Worldcoin coin itself is a &#8220;Layer 2&#8221; Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that leverages the security of the Ethereum blockchain while having its own economy. Blania says Worldcoin chose to build on top of Ethereum largely because of its developer network, which he hopes will also adopt Worldcoin. While plenty of crypto proponents want Bitcoin to become most people&#8217;s first exposure to cryptocurrencies, Blania sees too many scalability issues with the currency compared to an Ethereum Layer 2.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Bitcoin isn&#8217;t scalable to billions of people,&#8221; Blania says. &#8220;As we see today, it&#8217;s very expensive because transactions are slow.&#8221;</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-29/sam-altman-s-worldcoin-will-give-free-crypto-for-eyeball-scans">Bloomberg</a> wrote up early details of the company&#8217;s launch, which Blania notes was &#8220;pretty annoying,&#8221; acknowledging that what Worldcoin is doing is a complicated process with plenty of intricacies but that he&#8217;s confident his company will be able to communicate these to its global user base as it heads toward launch.</p>
<p>Speaking of which&#8230; <em>The Orb</em>?</p>
<p>The crypto startup has one of the more comically rigorous user acquisition flows, licensing their Orb cameras to contractors across the globe who manually go through the process of verifying each and every new user on the network in every city of every country on every continent of the globe.</p>
<p>In its most basic form, the company&#8217;s proof-of-personhood onboarding flow works by capturing an image of a person&#8217;s iris with the Orb, converting that image into a hash code (a process Worldcoin says can&#8217;t be reversed), checking with a database to ensure that a hash associated with that iris hasn&#8217;t already been uploaded, and, if it is unique, saving the hash while allowing users to generate a wallet in their app, from which the Orb scans a QR code. What this amounts to is a network of verified users that is tied to pseudonymous wallet codes rather than real names, and a database that is filled with hashes rather than actual eyeball photos, privacy efforts Blania hopes that Worldcoin can communicate clearly as it rapidly onboards users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221839" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221839" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221839" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg 2571w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OrbOperator_Indonesia.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221839" class="wp-caption-text">An Orb onboarding session in Indonesia.</p></div></p>
<p>Blania says that on average contractors have been able to onboard over 700 users per Orb per week in early testing across four continents: South America, Asia, Africa and Europe. They currently have 30 prototype devices out in the field and hope to add hundreds more in the coming months, before ultimately shipping thousands of Orbs per month (if all goes to plan). What does seem apparent, is that users in the U.S. might be waiting for a while to get their quality time with a Worldcoin Orb.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be that we delay launch in the United States until we have more clarity around the regulatory environment here,&#8221; Blania notes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all an arduous process, but setting up millions of users with their first crypto wallets while simultaneously building out a network of verified internet users via the blockchain sounds like something that many crypto investors would break their piggy banks for. As Worldcoin launches, unique users will be given a share of the digital currency (whether that is a flat rate or dollar-pegged amount isn&#8217;t final, but it sounds like it will be the latter). All-in-all 80% of the Worldcoin supply will be given to users onboarded to the service, while 10% will be reserved for the company with the remaining 10% going to the organization&#8217;s investors.</p>
<p>One of the major issues with giving users free money is that they tend to spend it. Blania says that they will make efforts to ensure users can&#8217;t immediately liquidate the entirety of their sign-up reward as Worldcoin scales its network and utility.</p>
<p>And speaking of investors, Worldcoin is launching with $25 million in funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from Coinbase, Reid Hoffman, Day One Ventures, Multicoin, FTX&#8217;s Sam Bankman-Fried and Variant&#8217;s Jesse Walden, among others. The investment was made at a $1 billion valuation, but the unicorn signifier largely seems meaningless here as Blania tells me the company and its IP will eventually be converted into a foundation. Investors are bankrolling the startup to get access to the 10% pool of investor capital in the Worldcoin token.</p>
<p>&#8220;The equity of the company itself should not matter at all, basically,&#8221; Blania says.</p>
<p>Ultimately, gaining attention for yet another new cryptocurrency is a massive challenge, onboarding billions of users is another one, as is ensuring their proprietary hardware can decipher billions of eyeballs in drastically different onboarding environments. Worldcoin has plenty of huge challenges ahead of it and some that likely won&#8217;t be obvious until there are more orbs in the wild. Some of these issues can likely be solved by having access to ever-flowing investor capital, but other issues will simply arise from communicating how all of this (pretty complicated) stuff works.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s launch blog seems to communicate it all pretty well: &#8220;Nothing like this has ever been done before and the outcome is uncertain.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://socraticworks.com/">Socratic</a>, an early-stage startup that wants to bring data to bear on a developer-focused task management system, announced a $3 million seed investment today from Unusual Ventures, Overtime.vc and a couple of industry angels. The company is also opening up public beta of the software starting today.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Socratic received the investment in May 2020. It has been operating in stealth and is announcing the funding today for the first time.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Nolan Wright says that he wants to build a new kind of task management system by using data to drive decisions. &#8220;Socratic is the first task management system that has been built from the ground up to use data and data science to help individuals and teams work better,&#8221; Wright explained.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221822" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It does this by letting developers work as they normally do, while Socratic works behind the scenes tracking all the critical data. &#8220;We then turn that around and give you insights into how you work and how you can work better,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The product is focused on developers and team leads, but Wright says that he also wants to give engineering executives more insight into what&#8217;s happening inside their organizations. &#8220;We also want to design it for executives, so we also try to answer some of the more important questions that engineering leaders are trying to ask,&#8221; he said. That could be related to whether more personnel would solve a productivity problem, as an example.</p>
<p>While the software is using internal tooling to track most of this information, it could obviously benefit from linking to other work systems, and the first such integration is with GitHub. &#8220;We not only do things like automation related to the integration like automatically moving tasks based on commits, but we also extract a lot of data from the git repository to actually provide insights like how long code reviews are taking, how long is it taking to merge features in general and what things need to be reviewed,&#8221; Wright said.</p>
<p>The company has only six employees, including the founders, with plans to add four more by the end of the year. Wright says the team is diverse already and he plans to try to keep it that way. &#8220;We have a really diverse group already, and it&#8217;s important for us. It&#8217;s about just getting different perspectives on things and so it&#8217;s just kind of who we are&#8230;and it&#8217;s an antidote to narrow thinking,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The software has been in private beta with around 10 design partners. As they open it for public beta today, the plan is for full launch sometime next year. Although this approach could be applied to many different work groups beyond developers, as an early-stage startup, the company has decided to focus on the software development process for starters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The whole gun on a robot thing was a question we’ve been barreling toward since the first practical quadrupedal robots arrived. Last week, that came to an inevitable head when a Ghost Robotics system was spotted at a tradeshow sporting a remote-controlled sniper rifle designed by a company called SWORD.</p>
<p>This is a question Boston Dynamics has worked hard to distance itself from. Understandably so &#8212; creating war machines is generally considered bad PR. That they &#8212; along with much of the robotics industry &#8212; were, in part, bootstrapped by DARPA funding and now create robots that people liken to scary sci-fi movies certainly complicates things.</p>
<p>I discussed Boston Dynamics’ approach to addressing the use of Spot for purposes of intimidation and violence in last week’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/actuator-8/">column</a>. I also talked a bit about my own feelings around mounting guns to the backs of robots (again, I’m against it and death machines generally). Ahead of writing the piece, I also reached out to Ghost Robotics, though only heard back after it was published.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221219" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I’ve since spoken to the company’s CEO Jiren Parikh about the system he refers to as “a walking tripod,” a nod to the fact that Ghost doesn’t design the payload &#8212; in this case, the SWORD Defense Systems Special Purpose Unmanned Rifle (SPUR). There are a lot of important ethical questions here. A walking tripod? Perhaps. But ultimately, there are questions of where the buck stops? The robotics company? The company that produces the payload? The end user (i.e. the military)? All of the above?</p>
<p>Important questions we need to address as we’re facing down a potential army of gun-strapped robotic dogs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191371" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191371" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2191371" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191371" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</p></div></p>

<p><strong>Let’s start with the question of autonomy.</strong></p>
<p>The robots themselves are not using any type of autonomy or AI for targeting weapon systems. SWORD, who makes the system, I can’t speak for. From what I know, that weapon is a manual-firing trigger. Even the targeting is done by a human behind the scenes. Firing the trigger is fully human-controlled.</p>
<p><strong>Is full autonomy a line the company doesn’t want to cross in this scenario?</strong></p>
<p>We don’t make the payloads. Are we going to promote and advertise any of these weapon systems? Probably not. That’s a tough one to answer. Because we’re selling to the military, we don’t know what they do with them. We’re not going to dictate to our government customers how they use the robots.</p>
<p>We do draw the line on where they’re sold. We only sell to U.S. and allied governments. We don’t even sell our robots to enterprise customers in adversarial markets. We get lots of inquiries about our robots in Russia and China. We don’t ship there, even for our enterprise customers.</p>
<p><strong>Does the company reserve the right to make sure the robots aren’t used for applications that you don’t support?</strong></p>
<p>In a sense, yes. We have full control. Everyone has to sign a licensing agreement. We don’t sell the robots to anyone we don’t want to. We only choose to sell them to U.S. and allied governments that we feel comfortable. We just have to recognize that military customers don’t disclose everything that they’re doing. If they need to use that robot for specific purposes for national security or to keep a war fighter out of harms way, we’re all for that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221223" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221223" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221223" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SPUR-5.png" alt="" width="1024" height="881" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SPUR-5.png 1395w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SPUR-5.png?resize=150,129 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SPUR-5.png?resize=300,258 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SPUR-5.png?resize=768,661 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SPUR-5.png?resize=680,585 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SPUR-5.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221223" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SWORD</p></div></p>
<p><strong>The vetting is in the customers [Ghost] chooses, rather than the applications the customers use those robots for?</strong></p>
<p>That’s correct. We’ve had people call to use these robots for fighting videos or putting together a reality show for crazy stuff the robots would do. Without naming names, we decline. We think that’s not tasteful. The robot is a serious tool. It’s a tool for inspections, security and all sort of military applications.</p>
<p><strong>As far as what we saw [last week] in the photos, is there a timeline?</strong></p>
<p>They’re expecting to do field testing on that sniper kit in late-Q1 of next year.</p>
<p><strong>In this specific case, what is the nature of the deal? The DoD has an individual deal with you and SWORD?</strong></p>
<p>There’s no deals. This is just a long-gun company that believes there’s a market opportunity for this. They developed on their own dime and we thought it was a compelling payload. There’s no customers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218459" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218459" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2218459" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png" alt="An aircraft flying" width="1024" height="582" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png 1256w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218459" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reliable Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>Okay, that’s it for the war dogs (for this week, at least). Let’s move from land operations to sea and sky. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/reliable-robotics-going-up-in-the-world/">First off is Reliable Robotics</a>, a Bay Area-based autonomous cargo-plane company that just raised $100 million. The Series C round brings the four-year-old firm’s total funding to $130 million, in Reliable’s bid to effectively move the autonomous trucking model into the skies.</p>
<p>Speaking of unmanned aerial vehicles, Wing just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/walgreens-will-deploy-wing-drone-deliveries-in-the-dallas-fort-worth-area/">announced</a> the beginning of what could amount to a big push into U.S. drone deliveries. Following successful pilots in Australia and a small town in Virginia, the Alphabet division announced a partnership with Walgreens to bring autonomous deliveries to the greater Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220625" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220625" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2220625" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WalgreensWing_14.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220625" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alphabet</p></div></p>
<p>Wing told us the following about its efforts on the regulatory side of things:</p>
<blockquote><p>In April of 2019, Wing became the first drone operator to be certified as an air carrier by the Federal Aviation Administration, allowing us to deliver commercial goods to recipients miles away, and we got an expanded version of that permission to launch in Virginia in October 2019. Now, we’re working toward permissions for this expansion, and we’ll be conducting test flights and demonstrating our new capabilities in the area in the coming weeks as part of that process. Prior to launching our service in DFW, we will work with authorities at the local, state and federal levels to secure all the appropriate permissions.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2219735" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219735" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2219735" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/saildrone-fleet.jpg" alt="Several Saildrone vessels float in formation on the ocean." width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/saildrone-fleet.jpg 1504w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/saildrone-fleet.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/saildrone-fleet.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/saildrone-fleet.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/saildrone-fleet.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/saildrone-fleet.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219735" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Saildrone</p></div></p>
<p>On the water-front comes another $100 million Series C. This one is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/saildrone-catches-a-100m-c-breeze-to-build-more-robo-boats/">for Saildrone’s autonomous boats</a>, which are being deployed to collect data for scientific purposes. The company has already deployed a sizable fleet of its uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs), which have traveled around half a million miles, collectively.</p>
<p>Lastly, an interesting piece <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/business/restaurants-robots-workers.html">from The New York Times</a> about the adoption of robotic waiters amid pandemic-related staff shortages. That part isn’t all that’s interesting in and of itself. What is, however, is that the wait staff has reported an increase in tipping, as a result. From the piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>Servi saved wait staff and bussers from having to run back and forth to the kitchen and gave overworked servers more time to schmooze with customers and serve more tables, which led to higher tips.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a small vindication of what robotics companies have been suggesting for a while &#8212; that autonomous systems won’t replace existing jobs, but rather augment them and fill in the gaps companies can’t with current headcount. That certainly seems to be the case on a shorter timeline when, frankly, these systems are incapable of replacing people outright. There’s a question around whether this is a step toward full automation, but in the near term, there’s something to be said for freeing up humans to do more humane things.</p>
