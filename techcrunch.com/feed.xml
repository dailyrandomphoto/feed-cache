										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gamestop shares are set to rally 70% this morning when trading starts, extending a rally that has perplexed market observers, irked hedge funds, and generally made crypto&#8217;s recent rally appear soft and weak.</p>
<p>Being a retail trader is mostly being a sucker, hoping to best the markets while lacking the infrastructure, access, and information that professionals enjoy. Hell, most professional fund managers that regular folks can invest in fail to beat the market. That&#8217;s one reason why index funds and other passive investments that merely track aggregate performance have grown so much in recent years; why pay more to have someone make you less money than simply making the same returns as the S&amp;P 500?</p>
<p>Things have changed some in recent years. Robinhood <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/spurred-by-robinhood-trading-fees-fall-among-old-guard-brokers/">blew up the trading fee economy</a>, and now along with a host of similar companies &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/social-stock-trading-services-public-raises-65m-series-c/">Public.com with its social focus</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/fintechs-savings-and-investing-boom-isnt-just-a-domestic-affair/">Freetrade in the UK</a>, and so forth &#8212; has made retail investing far more accessible than it was before to more folks. And we&#8217;re all trapped inside. And a rude, jokey Reddit forum has gone from in-nerd joke to front-page news after its users started to push their weight around.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s something that was noted by none other than the founder of Reddit Alexis Ohanian who shared some thoughts on Twitter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">And it&#39;s a perfect storm at a time when lots of people are hurting, interest rates are so low, inescapable student loan debts loom, and every major institution has caught Ls during a /global pandemic/ over the last year. This is something to believe in.</p>
<p>&mdash; Alexis Ohanian Sr. 7&#xfe0f;&#x20e3;7&#xfe0f;&#x20e3;6&#xfe0f;&#x20e3; (@alexisohanian) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1354407436732387335?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It&#8217;s an old saw that back in the dotcom boom traders would congregate in chat rooms to share tips, lie to each other, and try to pump their own equities higher. That all still happens. But what has changed is that the combination of mature social platforms and free trading has at once boosted access to the public markets <em>while</em> Reddit and other online congregation points have provided a simpler way for retail investors, the <em>hoi polloi</em>, to fuck around and make other people find out.</p>
<p>Again, Ohanian&#8217;s thoughts on this resonate.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A couple hundred thousand years of evolution conditioned us to believe in and rally around the immediate tribe around us. The idea of an &#8216;institution&#8217; &#8211; a faceless, nameless entity we just have to trust &#8212; is actually pretty foreign to our species,&#8221; </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1354407438473076737?s=20">the venture investor wrote on Twitter</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I know they&#8217;re all &#8216;random people on the internet&#8217; but there&#8217;s a lot more empathy and community there than people realize. It&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been saying for 15 years that (online) community is still massively undervalued.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>This is what has happened with Gamestop, a company that until recently was unnotable, and stuck between a physical retail footprint, the pandemic, and its customers increasingly preferring digital game purchases. It was worth around $4 per share last summer. It started 2021 worth around $18. Now it&#8217;s $147.98 after rising 92.7% yesterday, and is up $69.02 this morning, or 46.6%.</p>
<p>How did that happen? No, the company did not get suddenly, radically stronger in short order. Instead, a coterie of Reddit users realized that Gamestop was shorted by more than 100%. That means that investors had bet more shares than existed in the company that it would lose value.</p>
<p>And mostly this would have been fine, a quirk of the market; other highly-shorted stocks <a href="https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-heavily-shorted-stocks-primed-for-epic-squeezes-analysts-say-gamestop/">can see a majority of their shares sold short</a>, but to see a short-percentage of greater than 100% was eyebrow-raising.</p>
<p>Then came the wager: If big investors had bet more shares than Gamestop had in existence that it would lose value, what would happen if lots of individuals investors &#8212; retail interest, as they say &#8212; started <em>buying</em> the stock? That might drive its value up, forcing the hedge funds and other big capital pools to decide whether to hold onto their negative bet and take strong paper losses as Gamestop rallied, or cover their short, buying the stock at a higher price than they initially paid for it, losing money. Covering shorts would require buying the stock at high prices, perhaps boosting its value yet again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the wildest short-squeeze we can recall.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s always tension between short-sellers and investors who prefer to make positive wagers. Indeed, shorts are generally hated and the term <em>perma-bear</em>, slang for someone who is chronically worried about the price of assets to the point of distraction,<sup>1</sup> is often levied at them.</p>
<p>But <em>a boom in retail investing </em>and<em> social platforms allowing the congregation of disparate individual investors </em>can do quite a lot, it turns out. So, users of the WallStreetBets sub-Reddit started buying Gamestop. And they kept doing so, pushing its price higher and higher.</p>
<p>The result was that big money got smacked in the shorts, literally. CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/gamestop-shares-are-jumping-again-but-short-sellers-arent-backing-down.html">reports</a> that short-sellers have lost more than $5 billion so far thanks to Gamestop&#8217;s rapid appreciation on the back of becoming an internet meme.</p>
<p>But the tug-of-war between professionals betting that Gamestop is not worth its inflated priced, and that it will fall, is not over. Short interest remains high. So, even if some pro investors have cried uncle and exited their trade, the retail revenge on the so-called smart money is hardly a sure thing; what those excitable individuals may have done is merely set up a more enticing short position for hedge funds than had existed before.</p>
<p>Gamestop has a lot further to fall from over $140 per share than it did from $18, say.</p>
<p>Of course no one knows what will happen today. The investors who have taken out more short positions during the rally are set to eat their own ties this morning when Gamestop opens higher. Perhaps they will hold, and eventually their short bet will pay off. Or perhaps retail will be able to keep rallying Gamestop until, well, no one really knows.</p>
<p>But while most folks have their retirement accounts in investments so boring you&#8217;ve forgotten their names &#8212; Fidelity Freedom 2060 Fund, or what have you &#8212; small-time investors are sticking it to the man. This is the political war underneath the trading scrap. Retail is generally said to be mad at being pushed around, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp">front-run</a>, and generally speaking operating as second-class investing citizens. The Gamestop gambit is, to some degree, revenge.</p>
<p>Not that it will matter, per se, in the long-term. Large investing groups will still crush retail, having access to better information and tools and the like, as we mentioned up top. But today, at least, those same concerns are going to start the day with huge paper losses on their Gamestop shorts.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s hilarious, because the company is obviously overvalued and individual simply do not give a fuck.</p>
<ol>
<li>I, Alex Wilhelm, am like this before coffee.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/episerver-acquires-optimizely/">acquiring Optimizely last fall</a>, content management company <a href="https://www.episerver.com">Episerver</a> is adopting the Optimizely name for the entire organization.</p>
<p>CEO Alex Atzberger told me that the company will be rolling out new branding in the next coming months, as well as renaming its entire product suite to reflect the Optimizely brand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe it’s no longer just about personalizing the experience or driving recommendations,&#8221; Atzberger said. &#8220;The brand and word Optimizely really signifies optimal performance. Companies today of any size, any scale [need to be] much more sophisticated in terms of how they digitally connect with their customers. It&#8217;s a never-ending story.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the same time, he emphasized that Episerver is making the change from &#8220;a position of strength,&#8221; with the combined company seeing double-digit revenue growth last year and going live with more than 250 new customers.</p>
<p>Asked whether adopting the Optimizely name was always part of the post-acquisition plan, Atzberger replied, &#8220;When we acquired Optimizely, we knew that we would be acquiring not just a great product, not just a great customer base, but also acquiring a very well-known brand. We had not yet decided on [rebranding], but it was certainly something that, for me, was part of the consideration.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to announcing the new company name, Episerver/Optimizely is also announcing a new platform that it&#8217;s calling Optimization-as-a-Service, which integrates aspects of Optimizely and Episerver products to offer web targeting, testing and recommendations. As Atzberger put it, this new platform allows customers to determine &#8220;who to show something to, what content to show and how to actually show this content.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Days after the billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya announced his involvement in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-for-sunlight-financial-is-another-sign-of-a-renewables-boom/">$1.3 billion acquisition of the solar and home improvement lending business Sunlight Financial</a>, a collection of investors announced a nearly $1 billion cash infusion into <a href="https://loanpal.com/">Loanpal</a>, another renewable energy and home improvement lender.</p>
<p>The $800 million commitment to Loanpal arrives alongside a flurry of climate commitments from some of the world&#8217;s largest investors.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Blackrock chief Larry Fink, <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter">released the $9 trillion investment manager&#8217;s annual letter</a> calling for more stringent accounting and reporting of climate data, and Bank of America joined 60 other companies <a href="https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/content/newsroom/press-releases/2021/01/global-business-leaders-support-esg-convergence-by-committing-to.html">in committing to a new reporting standard for climate and sustainability</a> endorsed by the International Business Council and the World Economic Forum. Fink endorses a separate reporting scheme called the <a href="https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/">Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures</a> that has the backing of some of the biggest financial investors in the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KWAQtajDSI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-for-sunlight-financial-is-another-sign-of-a-renewables-boom/">Chamath Palihapitiya&#8217;s SPAC for Sunlight Financial is another sign of a renewables boom</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chamath Palihapitiya&#8217;s SPAC for Sunlight Financial is another sign of a renewables boom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-for-sunlight-financial-is-another-sign-of-a-renewables-boom/embed/#?secret=KWAQtajDSI" data-secret="KWAQtajDSI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>These new standards will drive more investment dollars into businesses that are reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change. And lending programs incentivizing the switch to more energy efficient appliances and renewable installations are probably the lowest of low hanging fruit for the financial services industry.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one reason why investors like <span style="font-weight: 400;"> NEA, the WestCap Group, Brookfield Asset Management, and the giant private equity energy investment fund Riverstone Holdings are backing Loanpal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal, which was a secondary transaction to give strategic investors a stake in the business actually wrapped up last year. As a result Scott Sandell, the managing general partner at NEA and a longtime investor in pr and Laurence Tosi, Managing Partner of WestCap Group, have joined the company’s board of directors.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We invited a number of players into the company,&#8221; said Loanpal&#8217;s founder, chairman and chief executive Hayes Barnard. The former chief revenue officer for SolarCity before its acquisition by Tesla, Barnard has a long history with solar energy development. At Loanpal he also had the balance sheet to take his pick among would-be investors. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re a multi-billion dollar company,&#8221; said Barnard.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2101183" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101183" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2101183" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg 3500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101183" class="wp-caption-text">Loanpal founder chairman and chief executive, Hayes Barnard. Image Credit: Loanpal</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;This was us inviting strategic investors into the company and being thoughtful about where they could help and how they could help,&#8221; Barnard said.</p>
<p>Loanpal is profitable, has zero debt and throws off monthly dividends to its financial backers. &#8220;Today we finance $400 million a month for roughly 15,000 solar systems that are combined with battery systems,&#8221; says Barnard. In all, the company has arranged $5.9 billion in consumer finance loans since its launch in 2018. Loanpal also counts around 85% of the top solar firms as vendors and has a staff of around 12,000 sales professionals.</p>
<p>Those numbers allowed the company to bring in board members like Tosi, the former chief financial officer of the multi-billion dollar financial services firm, Blackstone. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">He really understands how to bring in capital markets at scale,&#8221; said Barnard. </span></p>
<p>If anything, the attention from Blackrock, Blackstone, Riverstone and all the financial services firms without references to stones or rocks in their name shows that this is a problem of capital at scale. Decarbonizing the global economy is a $10 trillion business, according to the World Economic Forum (or, for the retail investment crowd, the equivalent of roughly 66.7 billion Gamestops <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gamestop+share+price&amp;rlz=1C5GCEA_enUS896US897&amp;oq=gamestop+share+price&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0i131i433l2j0l6.2291j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">at yesterday&#8217;s share price</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The near term market that we’re going to penetrate now is sustainable home solutions that’s a $100 billion market,&#8221; Barnard said. </span></p>
<p>A significant chunk of that $10 trillion is going to come from the development and integration of new consumer facing appliances and hardware to reduce the consumption of energy. &#8220;We believe the battery storage market, the smart thermostat market and the solar market are all intertwined and combined,&#8221; said Barnard. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall the most important thing is that this is just technology that is better. It was going to scale regardless of who was in the White House. These pieces of technology are better, they save homeowners money.. It’s kind of an IQ test if homeowners want to do it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://lynk.global/">Lynk</a>, a &#8220;knowledge-as-a-service&#8221; platform that connects clients with over 840,000 experts in a wide range of fields, announced today it has raised $24 million led by Brewer Lane Ventures and MassMutual Ventures, with participation from Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund. The company uses machine learning algorithms to match users, who include investment firms, Fortune 100 companies and government entities, with experts on its platform, helping connect them with people they would probably not find at traditional consultancies or by searching online.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the core of it, the search is a people search based on what you know, and not just where you work, to put it very simply,&#8221; co-founder and chief executive officer Peggy Choi told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2015, Lynk has now raised a total of $30 million. It has more than 200 employees across offices in eight cities: Hong Kong, New York City, Singapore, London, Mumbai, Shanghai, Hyderabad, Toronto and Manila. Its funding will be used for product launches and to expand in North America and China, where its seen demand grow over the past twelve months.</p>
<p>Lynk&#8217;s flagship product, Lynk Answers, is currently used by about 200 enterprise clients when their employees need to do research for projects including geographical expansion, product-market fit and due diligence, with many relying on the platform for on-the-ground research in areas they can&#8217;t travel to because of the pandemic. For example, investors talk with advisors on Lynk to understand new technology or the dynamics in a sector. Over the past few years, companies have used Lynk to help them react quickly to geopolitical changes, including events that affected their supply chain. Some sought supply chain experts when shipments got stuck in customs or they wanted to diversify their manufacturing by setting up factories in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Before Lynk, Choi worked in finance, including at Silver Lake in London and TPG in San Francisco. As an investor, &#8220;every day you have to do a lot of conversations with executives and different kinds of experts to learn about new industries or companies really quickly. Through that experience, I realized that talking to the right person makes a huge difference,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In contrast, Choi found herself at a loss when her parents wanted to launch an art gallery. &#8220;They had all these day-to-day business questions and sometimes they asked me because they thought I would know how to address it. But I don&#8217;t know either, I&#8217;m not the right person for them, so I had to find the right people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When I saw that contrast, I thought, what about using data to organize people in a way based on what they know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lynk, which monetizes by charging enterprise clients a subscription fee, fills the gap between traditional consultancies and consumer-oriented Q&amp;A platforms like Quora or China&#8217;s Zhihu. The platform also includes SaaS features that provide an alternative to email chains, like collaboration tools and auto-transcription for expert interviews so they can be organized, searched and referenced by a team.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Zhihu has become one of China&#8217;s biggest hubs for experts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/how-zhihus-become-one-of-chinas-biggest-hubs-for-experts/embed/#?secret=Wni8hqLUIr" data-secret="Wni8hqLUIr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lynk’s experts, who the platform calls “Knowledge Partners,” include C-suite executives, independent consultants, lawyers, engineers, financial analysts and scientists, among others. The company finds them through several channels, including digital marketing, a referral program for current Knowledge Partners and partnerships with groups, associations and institutions. Lynk vets experts before they are added to the platform, where they set their own rates.</p>
<p>When users have a question, Lynk’s search engine shows them a list of experts based on criteria like domain expertise and geography. Then they ask potential experts a couple of questions to see if they are the right match. Lynk uses data from those conversations, on an anonymized basis, to refine its search technology and make matching more accurate. Once users pick experts, they work with them in different ways. Most of the time they do a question-and-answer session. Sometimes that turns into speaker and workshop engagements or longer-term projects.</p>
<p>Choi said building an inclusive roster of experts is a priority for Lynk. The company&#8217;s team and board are divided equally between women and men and represent more than 20 nationalities. It wants to build a diverse database through initiatives like outreach programs and campaigns like <a href="https://lynk.global/in-the-news/lynk-launches-lynk-elite-expert-women-for-international-womens-day-2020">Lynk Elite Expert Women</a> to recruit people, including those who haven&#8217;t done consulting before.</p>
<p>“When we were running the [Lynk Elite Expert Women] campaign, we realized that a lot of people find it a very new way of being valued,” said Choi. “Especially if they&#8217;ve spent their entire life doing something, they also want to know what people want to know about their area.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://literati.com">Literati</a> has raised a $40 million Series B to pursue an unusual startup opportunity — namely, book clubs.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Jessica Ewing (a former product manager at Google) explained that the Austin-based company started out with book clubs for <a href="https://literati.com/kids/">kids</a>, before launching <a href="https://literati.com/book-clubs/">its Luminary brand</a> for adult book clubs last year. And the Luminary clubs live up to the name — they&#8217;re curated by notable figures such as activist and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, NBA star Stephen Curry, entrepreneur and philanthropist Sir Richard Branson, journalist Susan Orlean and the Joseph Campbell Foudnation.</p>
<p>When you sign up for a Literati book club, you receive a print edition of each month&#8217;s selection with a note from the curator. You also get access to the Literati app, where you can discuss the book with other readers, and where curators host author conversations. For example, Curry is leading <a href="https://literati.com/book-clubs/stephen-curry/">a book club focused on nonfiction</a> about people who &#8220;transcend expectations&#8221; (he invested in Literati as well), while <a href="https://literati.com/book-clubs/malala/">Yousafzai chooses books by women</a> &#8220;with bold ideas from around the world.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ewing told me that she&#8217;s trying to build the first &#8220;new, innovative bookseller&#8221; since Amazon launched 25 years ago. And she&#8217;s doing that by focusing on curation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s too much choice, too many lists, it’s completely overwhelming for most people,&#8221; she said. And she argued that it helps to enlist celebrities and other big names to do the curation: &#8220;Books are aspirational. No one aspires to play more video games, people aspire to read more &#8230; People want their books to be recommended by someone a little bit smarter than they are.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2101199" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101199" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2101199" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/About-this-Club_Stephen.jpg?w=680" alt="Stephen Curry book club" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/About-this-Club_Stephen.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/About-this-Club_Stephen.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/About-this-Club_Stephen.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/About-this-Club_Stephen.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/About-this-Club_Stephen.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/About-this-Club_Stephen.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101199" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Literati</p></div></p>
<p>Ewing&#8217;s hope for Literati is to create &#8220;the next great literary social network,&#8221; bridging the gap between celebrity-driven lists like <a href="https://www.oprah.com/app/books.html">Oprah&#8217;s Book Club</a> and <a href="https://hello-sunshine.com/book-club">Reese&#8217;s Book Club </a>and what she described as &#8220;the wine-and-cheese, super intimate model.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#8220;</span>I would love to see in-person meetups once we’re out of the COVID environment,&#8221; she added. &#8220;But I also think there&#8217;s everything in between. We&#8217;re enabling threaded discussions [in the app] right now, and it&#8217;s cool to have asynchronous conversations about the books.&#8221;</p>
<p>And on the children&#8217;s book side, Literati is also working building personalization tools designed to recommend the best books for each child.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, this is one of the most exciting applications: How do we make this generation of kids love reading by pairing them with the right books?&#8221; Ewing said.</p>
<p>Literati previously raised $12 million in funding from Shasta Ventures and others, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/literati/company_financials">according to Crunchbase</a>. The new round was led by Aydin Senkut of Felicis Ventures, with participation from Dick Costolo and Adam Bain of 01 Advisors, Founders Fund, General Catalyst, Shasta, Silverton Partners, Springdale Ventures and — as previously mentioned — Stephen Curry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to start my own book club with <span class="il">Literati</span>, because their mission to better the world through reading naturally aligns with my values as an entrepreneur and father,” Curry said in a statement. “I was a fan before I was an investor, and am so proud to be a part of a company that works to better the lives of others, one book at a time.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lottiefiles.com/">LottieFiles</a>, a platform for JSON-based Lottie animations, has raised a Series A of $9 million. The round was led by M12, Microsoft’s venture capital arm, with participation from returning investor 500 Startups.</p>
<p>Based in San Francisco and Kuala Lumpur, LottieFiles was founded in 2018. The platform includes Lottie creation, editing and testing tools, and a marketplace for animations. It now claims about one million users from 65,000 companies, including Airbnb, Google, TikTok, Disney and Netflix, and 300% year-over-year growth. The new funding brings its total raised to about $10 million.</p>
<p>Smaller than GIF or PNG graphics, Lottie animations also have the advantage of being scalable and interactive. It was <a href="https://airbnb.design/introducing-lottie/">introduced as an open-source library</a> by Airbnb engineers six years ago and quickly became popular with app developers because Lottie files can be used across platforms without additional coding and edited after shipping.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2101125" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cover-image.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101125" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2101125" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cover-image.png?w=680" alt="An illustration from animation startup LottieFiles" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cover-image.png 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cover-image.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cover-image.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cover-image.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cover-image.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cover-image.png?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cover-image.png?resize=2048,1024 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cover-image.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2101125" class="wp-caption-text">An illustration from animation startup LottieFiles</p></div></p>
<p>LottieFiles co-founder and chief executive officer Kshitij Minglani told TechCrunch the startup originally started as a community for designers and developers, before adding tools, integrations and other resources. It launched its marketplace during the COVID-19 lockdown, with 70% of earnings going directly to creators, and also has a list of animators who are available for hire.</p>
<p>LottieFiles’ core platform and tools are currently pre-revenue, with plans to monetize later this year. &#8220;It’s not often a revolutionary format comes about and disrupts an entire industry, saving tons of precious design and development hours,&#8221; said Minglani. &#8220;We didn’t want to stunt the adoption of Lottie by monetizing early on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funding will be used on LottieFiles’ product roadmap, expanding its infrastructure and increasing its global user base.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year ago, Starship Technologies had a couple hundred autonomous bots delivering burritos and pizzas to  students on college campuses and residents in a few neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The company — with $17 million of new capital in its coffers — has expanded its fleet five-fold since COVID-19 swept through the European and North American markets that it operates in. While COVID-19 delivered pain and chaos, including to Starship Technologies, the company has also experienced an uptick in demand as restaurants switched to a takeout and delivery-only model. Starship now has 1,000 autonomous delivery bots in its fleet.</p>
<p>Starship Technologies said last year it planned to expand to 100 universities by late summer 2021. That&#8217;s a leap from the 15 campuses it operates at today. Still, the company is expanding in just about every measurable way, including locations, volume of trips, fleet size and workforce, which now number 400 people. The company said it is bringing new college campuses on every month and has a robust pipeline that will come online as classes resume.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s recent $17 million raise, which was announced Tuesday, included investors TDK Ventures and Goodyear Ventures. The new investment brings Starship&#8217;s total funding to $102 million. Starship decline to share its valuation. The company also announced it has expanded to UCLA and Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Starship Technologies, which was launched in 2014 by Skype co-founders Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis, has grown from an enterprise that completed 5,000 deliveries in 2017 to 1 million by January of this year. It&#8217;s also expanded beyond college campuses and communities like Milton Keyes, UK to more towns, including a 5,000-household area in Northhampton, UK and the California cities of Mountain View and Modesto.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.classiq.io/">Classiq</a>, a Tel Aviv-based startup that aims to make it easier for computer scientists and developers to create quantum algorithms and applications, today announced that it has raised a $10.5 million Series A round led by Team8 Capital and Wing Capital. Entrée Capital, crowdfunding platform OurCrowd and Sumitomo Corporation (through IN Venture) also participated in this round, which follows the company&#8217;s recent $4 million seed round led by Entrée Capital.</p>
<p>The idea behind Classiq, which currently has just under a dozen members on its team, is that developing quantum algorithms remains a major challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, quantum software development is almost an impossible task,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nir-minerbi-6a1554176/?originalSubdomain=il">Nir Minerbi</a>, CEO and Co-founder of <span class="il">Classiq. &#8220;</span>The programming is at the gate level, with almost no abstraction at all. And on the other hand, for many enterprises, that&#8217;s exactly what they want to do: come up with game-changing quantum algorithms. So we built the next layer of the quantum software stack, which is the layer of a computer-aided design, automation, synthesis. [&#8230;] So you can design the quantum algorithm without being aware of the details and the gate level details are automated.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2101025" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101025" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2101025" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png 7688w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2101025" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Classiq</p></div></p>
<p>With Microsoft&#8217;s Q#, IBM&#8217;s Qiskit and their competitors, developers already have access to quantum-specific languages and frameworks. And as Amir Naveh, Classiq&#8217;s VP of R&amp;D told me, just like with those tools, developers will define their algorithms as code &#8212; in Classiq&#8217;s case a variant of Python. With those other languages, though, you will write sequences of gates on the cubits to define your quantum circuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you&#8217;re writing down isn&#8217;t gates on cubits, its concepts, its constructs, its constraints &#8212; it&#8217;s always constraints on what you want the circuit to achieve,&#8221; Naveh explained. &#8220;And then the circuit is synthesized from the constraints. So in terms of the visual interface, it would look the same [as using other frameworks], but in terms of what&#8217;s going through your head, it&#8217;s a whole different level of abstraction, you&#8217;re describing the circuit at a much higher level.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, he said, gives Classiq&#8217;s users the ability to more easily describe what they are trying to do. For now, though, that also means that the platform&#8217;s users tend to be quantum teams and scientists and developers who are quantum experts and understand how to develop quantum circuits at a very deep level. The team argues, though, that as the technology gets better, developers will need to have less and less of an understanding of how the actual qubits behave.</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo embed breakout embed--video" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/442845321" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>As Minerbi stressed, the tool is agnostic to the hardware that will eventually run these algorithms. Classiq&#8217;s mission, after all, is to provide an additional abstraction layer on top of the hardware. At the same time, though, developers can optimize their algorithms for specific quantum computing hardware as well.</p>
<p>Classiq CTO Dr. Yehuda Naveh also noted that the company is already working with a number of larger companies. These include banks that have used its platform for portfolio optimization, for example, and a semiconductor firm that was looking into a material science problem related to chip manufacturing, an area that is a bit of a sweet spot for quantum computing &#8212; at least in its current state.</p>
<p>The team plans to use the new funding to expand its existing team, mostly on the engineering side. A lot of the work the company is doing, after all, is still in R&amp;D. Finding the right software engineers with a background in physics &#8212; or quantum information experts who can program &#8212; will be of paramount importance for the company. Minerbi believes that is possible, though, and the plan is to soon expand the team to about 25 people.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#8220;We are thrilled to be working with <span class="il">Classiq</span>, assisting the team in achieving their goals of advancing the quantum computing industry,&#8221; said Sarit Firon, Managing Partner at Team8 Capital. &#8220;As the quantum era takes off, they have managed to solve the missing piece in the quantum computing puzzle, which will enable game-changing quantum algorithms. We look forward to seeing the industry grow, and witnessing how <span class="il">Classiq</span> continues to mark its place as a leader in the industry.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has spelled economic setbacks for many people and industries, but the capital swirling about the technology world continues to roar along. In the latest development, <a href="http://tcv.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCV</a> &#8212; the storied venture capital firm behind the likes of Airbnb, Spotify, Peloton and Facebook &#8212; has closed a record $4 billion for its latest fund.</p>
<p>This is not only the company&#8217;s biggest fund to date, but it also speaks to just how fast the tech industry is accelerating in terms of capital and how much of it tech is attracting. In 25 years of operations (a milestone it passed in 2020) TCV invested $14 billion across hundreds of startups. This latest $4 billion fund raised in a matter of months represents nearly 30% of that figure.</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s also more than the company originally targeted, which was <a href="https://www.buyoutsinsider.com/veteran-tech-investor-tcv-targets-3-25bn-for-fund-xi-amid-ideal-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$3.25 billion</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Parter John Doran told TechCrunch the plan will be to use the money to continue backing existing portfolio companies, as well as make new bets, both in areas that have shown to be very strong winners in the last year &#8212; e-commerce, education, and tools to enable working in the cloud, for example &#8212; but also investments in areas that may not be doing as well right now, but TCV will believes will return, like travel.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We have to take a long term view,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s about great founders and CEOs, and where those in areas like travel, you&#8217;ll still see the startups get funded at up rounds. Besides, who will be better positioned to grow and take advantage of a world that’s now more digital? That is a huge opportunity in the long term.&#8221;</p>
<p>As with other big capital events, the closing of a VC fund may not be intrinsically interesting news in itself, but it&#8217;s a significant bellwether that points to the level of confidence, interest and activity in the early stages of the funding process. That, in turn, has a direct knock-on effect for startups, and subsequently the technology industry at large.</p>
<p>In the case of TCV XI, as it is known, it&#8217;s a sign of strength in the market &#8212; it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/tcv-closes-3b-fund-aimed-at-consumer-internet-it-infrastructure-and-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1 billion more than its previous fund, closed before the pandemic in 2019</a> &#8212; but also an endorsement of some of the less traditional processes and practices that have become the norm in many of our lives.</p>
<p>Notably, the raising (and closing) of the fund was done entirely virtually over the last year, Julia Roux, the company&#8217;s head of investor relations, told TechCrunch, from a mix of returning and new LPs. Going virtual is also, in many cases, the route that TCV (and other VCs) have taken in closing deals over the last year too, which looks like it may now be here to stay.</p>
<p>TCV has been very active in the past year, not just with private startup investments but seeing one of its most successful startups go public. Airbnb boldly went for an IPO in December, in the wake of a year that saw its business providing accommodation and other services to travellers come to a grinding halt.</p>
<p>The IPO was an example of the kind of more long-term investing that the firm is keen on doing (and very much has the funds to do now) despite current market conditions. Doran pointed out that TCV remains a &#8220;big believers in the Airbnb story,&#8221; investing in more shares in the company in the IPO.</p>
<p class="p1">Other big investments this year have included a lot of activity in commerce and fintech &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/dutch-payments-startup-mollie-raises-106m-at-1b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mollie</a> (raised $106 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/spryker-raises-130m-at-a-500m-valuation-to-provide-b2bs-with-agile-e-commerce-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spryker</a> ($130 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/revolut-raises-500-million-at-5-5-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revolut</a> ($500 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/klarna-raises-650-million-at-a-10-6-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Klarna</a> ($650 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/fintech-decacorn-nubank-raises-400m-led-by-tcv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nubank</a> ($400 million) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mambu-raises-135m-at-a-2b-valuation-for-an-saas-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mambu</a> ($135 million) &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/strava-raises-110-million-touts-growth-rate-of-2-million-new-users-per-month-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strava</a> ($110 million). (Note how many of those rounds were outside the U.S.: almost all of them. The company says it has some $4 billion under management outside the U.S. now.)</p>
<p>Recent exits include AxiomSL, Genesys, Cradlepoint, and Silver Peak.</p>
<p>“We are humbled by the ongoing support of new and returning investors, which enabled us to raise a record sized fund,” said Jay Hoag, a founding general partner at TCV, in a statement. “Just as importantly, we are honored by all the great entrepreneurs we’ve worked with over the past 25 years, as their vision and relentless execution has been our foundation. We look forward to backing entrepreneurs with our new fund that we believe will become the next generation of iconic companies, in this incredibly fertile technology industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s not every day you see a Latin American startup funded by a U.S. venture capital firm based in the midwest. <a href="http://playvox.com">Playvox</a>, a Colombian startup that wants to bring a positive twist to customer service monitoring announced a $25 million Series A from <a href="https://www.fiveelms.com/">Five Elms Capital</a>, a Kansas City, MO VC firm. It has now raised $34 million.</p>
<p>While it was at it, Playvox also announced something else unusual for an early stage company: an acquisition. The startup bought an Australian company called<a href="https://agyletime.com/"> Agyle Time</a>, a workforce monitoring SaaS tool. The acquisition brings together two companies with similar missions to provide a more complete customer service solution.</p>
<p>Playvox founder and CEO Oscar Giraldo founded the company in 2012 and has been quietly building it into an international business with brand name customers like Dropbox, Electronic Arts and Wish. The company&#8217;s Workforce Optimization platform works as a layer on top of customer service center management tools like Zendesk and Salesforce Service Cloud, allowing management to monitor digital channels and give customer service agents feedback to help them do their jobs better.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When you call a contact center or a company, you may hear that &#8216;this call may be recorded for quality and training purposes&#8217;. So Playvox is a technology that works on the backend of [the customer service system] to manage the workforce that is responsible for providing a great customer experience,&#8221; Giraldo explained. It does this, but instead of for calls, it focuses on chat and email interactions.</p>
<p>Giraldo got the idea for the business nine years ago when he was working as a software engineer in Argentina and toured some customer service centers, where he observed a lot of disgruntled and unhappy employees. He wanted to start a company that would help give feedback to these employees in a more constructive and positive way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of the traditional approach of customer service QA that was punishing the agents [for mistakes], what we do is we use that data to train them with a learning management system that is integrated in the platform, and have coaching tools that allow our customers to provide timely feedback to the agent so they can change their behavior for the better,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The Agyle Time acquisition enables the company to expand beyond this feedback system into customer service workforce scheduling and position them to compete in the enterprise market with a more complete toolset. &#8220;What we see is that combining the quality management agent optimization tools that Playvox has built with Agyle Time&#8217;s workforce management will allow us to be a unique vendor in the marketplace,&#8221; Giraldo said.</p>
<p>As for Five Elms, it&#8217;s a firm that invests between $4 and $40 million in companies that have between $2 and $20 million in revenue. They like SaaS companies in atypical places with portfolio companies in Fayetteville, AK, Columbus, OH and Brisbane Australia. Playvox fits nicely in that group.</p>
<p>&#8220;Playvox continues to deliver extraordinary products, add renowned brands to its customer base, and attract exceptional executives because of its company values and culture,&#8221; Ryan Mandl, managing director at Five Elms Capital said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.datastax.com/">Datastax</a>, the company best known for commercializing the open-source <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/">Apache Cassandra database</a>, is moving beyond databases. As the company announced today, it has acquired <a href="https://kesque.com/">Kesque</a>, a cloud messaging service.</p>
<p>The Kesque team built its service on top of the Apache Pulsar messaging and streaming project. Datastax has now taken that team&#8217;s knowledge in this area and, combined with its own expertise, is launching its own Pulsar-based streaming platform by the name of <a href="https://www.datastax.com/products/luna-streaming">Datastax Luna Streaming</a>, which is now generally available.</p>
<p>This move comes right as Datastax is also now, for the first time, announcing that it is cash-flow positive and profitable, as the company&#8217;s chief product officer, Ed Anuff, told me. &#8220;We are at over $150 million in [annual recurring revenue]. We are cash-flow positive and we are profitable,&#8221; he told me. This marks the first time the company is publically announcing this data. In addition, the company also today revealed that about 20 percent of its annual contract value is now for DataStax Astra, its managed multi-cloud Cassandra service and that the number of self-service Asta subscribers has more than doubled from Q3 to Q4.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The launch of Luna Streaming now gives the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/datastax">10-year-old company</a> a new area to expand into &#8212; and one that has some obvious adjacencies with its existing product portfolio.</p>
<p>&#8220;We looked at how a lot of developers are building on top of Cassandra,&#8221; Anuff, who joined Datastax after leaving Google Cloud last year, said. &#8220;What they&#8217;re doing is, they&#8217;re addressing what people call &#8216;data-in-motion&#8217; use cases. They have huge amounts of data that are coming in, huge amounts of data that are going out &#8212; and they&#8217;re typically looking at doing something with streaming in conjunction with that. As we&#8217;ve gone in and asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s next for Datastax?,&#8217; streaming is going to be a big part of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given Datastax&#8217;s open-source roots, it&#8217;s no surprise the team decided to build its service on another open-source project and acquire an open-source company to help it do so. Anuff noted that while there has been a lot of hype around streaming and Apache Kafka, a cloud-native solution like Pulsar seemed like the better solution for the company. Pulsar was originally developed at Yahoo! (which, full disclosure, belongs to the same Verizon Media Group family as TechCrunch) and even before acquiring Kesque, Datastax already used Pulsar to build its Astra platform. Other Pulsar users include Yahoo, Tencent, Nutanix and Splunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we saw was that when you go and look at doing streaming in a scale-out way, that Kafka isn&#8217;t the only approach. We looked at it, and we liked the Pulsar architecture, we like what&#8217;s going on, we like the community &#8212; and remember, we&#8217;re a company that grew up in the Apache open-source community &#8212; we said, &#8216;okay, we think that it&#8217;s got all the right underpinnings, let&#8217;s go and get involved in that,&#8221; Anuff said. And in the process of doing so, the team came across Kesque founder Chris Bartholomew and eventually decided to acquire his company.</p>
<p>The new Luna Streaming offering will be what Datastax calls a &#8220;subscription to success with Apache Pulsar.&#8217; It will include a free, production-ready distribution of Pulsar and an optional, SLA-backed subscription tier with enterprise support.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Datastax also plans to remain active in the Pulsar community. The team is already making code contributions, but Anuff also stressed that Datastax is helping out with scalability testing. &#8220;This is one of the things that we learned in our participation in the Apache Cassandra project,&#8221; Anuff said. &#8220;A lot of what these projects need is folks coming in doing testing, helping with deployments, supporting users. Our goal is to be a great participant in the community.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After revealing its first fund just last year, a $100 million pool of investment capital dedicated to early stage startups focusing on sustainable food development, clean energy, health innovation and new space technologies, <a href="https://www.primemoverslab.com">Prime Movers Lab</a> is back with a second fund. Prime Movers Lab Fund II is larger, with $245 million committed, but it will pursue the same investment strategy, albeit with a plan to place more bets on more companies, with an expanded investment team to help manage the funds and portfolio.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of VCs out there,&#8221; explained founder and general partner Dakin Sloss about the concept behind the fund. &#8220;But there aren&#8217;t many VCs that are focused exclusively on breakthrough science, or deep tech. Even though there are a couple, when you look at the proportion of capital, I think it&#8217;s something like less than 10% of capital is going to these types of companies. But if you look at what&#8217;s meaningful to the life of the average person over the next 30 years, these are all the companies that are important, whether it&#8217;s coronavirus vaccine,s or solar energy production, or feeding the planet through aquaponics. These are the things that are really meaningful to to making a better quality of life for most people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sloss told me that he sees part of the issue around why the proportion of capital dedicated to solving these significant problems is that it requires a lot of deep category knowledge to invest in correctly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not enough technical expertise in VC firms to choose winners intelligently, rather than ending up with the next Theranos or clean tech bubble,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So that&#8217;s the first thing I wanted to solve. I have a physics background, and I was able to bring together a team of partners that have really deeply technical backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>As referenced, Sloss himself has a degree from Stanford in Mathematics, Physics and Philosophy. He was a serial entrepreneur before starting the fund, having founded Tachyus, OpenGov and nonprofit California Common Sense. Other Partners on the team include systems engineer Dan Slomski, who previously worked on machine vision, electro-mechanical systems and developing a new multi-phase flow fluid analyzer; Amy Kruse, who holds a PhD in neuroscience and has served as an executive in defence technology and applied neuroscience companies; and Carly Anderson, a chemical engineer who has worked in biomedicine and oil &amp; gas, and who has a PhD in chemical and biomolecular engineering. In addition to core partners with that kind of expertise, Prime Movers Lab enlists the help of venture partners and specialist advisors like former astronaut Chris Hadfield.</p>
<p>Having individuals with deep field expertise on the core team, in addition to supplementing that with top-notch advisors, is definitely a competitive advantage, particularly when investing in the kinds of companies that Prime Movers Lab does early on in their development. There&#8217;s a perception that companies pursuing these kinds of hard tech problems aren&#8217;t necessarily as viable as a target for traditional venture funding, specifically because of the timelines for returns. Sloss says he believes that&#8217;s a misperception based on unfortunate past experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there are three big myths about breakthrough science or hard tech or deep tech,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That it takes longer, that it&#8217;s more capital intensive, and that it&#8217;s higher risk. And I think the reason those myths are out there is people invested in things like Theranos, and the clean tech bubble. But I think that there were fundamental mistakes made in how they underwrote risk of doing that.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1816563" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1816563" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1816563" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="752" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg?resize=768,564 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg?resize=680,500 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1816563" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Momentus</p></div></p>
<p>To avoid making those kinds of mistakes, Sloss says that Prime Movers Lab views prospective investments from the perspective of a &#8220;spectrum of risk,&#8221; which includes risk of the science itself (does the fundamental technology involve actually work), engineering risk (given the science works, can we make it something we can sell) and finally, commercialization or scaling risk (can we then make it and sell it at scale with economics that work). Sloss says that if you use this risk matrix to assess investments, and allocated funds to address primarily the engineering risk category, concerns around timeframes to return don&#8217;t really apply.</p>
<p>He cites Primer Movers Lab&#8217;s Fund I portfolio, which includes space propulsion company Momentus, heading for an exit to the public markets via SPAC (the company&#8217;s Russian CEO actually just <a href="https://spacenews.com/momentus-ceo-resigns-amid-u-s-government-concerns/">resigned in order to smooth the path for that, in fact</a>), and notes that of the 15 companies that Fund I invested in, four are totally on a path to going public. That would put them much faster to an exit than is typical for early stage investment targets, and Sloss credits the very different approach most hard science startups take to IP development and capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;The inflection points in these types of companies are actually I think faster to get to market, because they&#8217;ve spent years developing the IP, staying at relatively low or attractive valuations,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then we can kind of come in, at that inflection point, and help them get ready to commercialize and scale up exponentially, to where other investors no longer have to underwrite the difference between science and engineering risk, they can just see it&#8217;s working and producing revenue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Companies that fit this mold often come directly from academia, and keep the team small and focused while they&#8217;re figuring out the core scientific discovery or innovation that enables the business. A prime example of this in recent memory <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/wingcopter-raises-22-million-to-expand-to-the-u-s-and-launch-a-next-generation-drone/">is Wingcopter</a>, a German drone startup that developed and patented a technology for a tilt-wing rotor that changes the economics of electric autonomous drone flight. The startup just took its first significant startup investment after bootstrapping for four years, and the funds will indeed be used to help it accelerate engineering on a path towards high-volume production.</p>
<p>While Wingcopter isn&#8217;t a Prime Movers Lab portfolio company, many of its investments fit the same mold. Boom Aerospace is currently working on building and flying its subscale demonstration aircraft to pave the way for a future supersonic airliner, while Axiom Space just announced the first crew of private tourists to the International Space Station who will fly on a SpaceX Falcon 9 for $50 million a piece. As long as you can prove the fundamentals are sound, allocating money turning it into something marketable seems like a logical strategy.</p>
<p>For Prime Movers Lab&#8217;s Fund II, the plan is to invest in around 30 or so companies, roughly doubling the number of investments from Fund I. In addition to its partners with scientific expertise, the firm also includes Partners with skill sets including creative direction, industrial design, executive coaching and business acumen, and provides those services to its portfolio companies as value-add to help them supplement their technical innovations. Its Fund I portfolio includes Momentus and Axiom, as mentioned, as well as vertical farming startup Upward Farms, coronavirus vaccine startup Covaxx, and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People and businesses are relying on the internet to get things done more than ever before, an opportunity but also an infrastructure headache for service providers that need to scale quickly and reliably to meet that demand.</p>
<p>Today, a startup that has built a clever, software-based way for them to expand their networks without buying costly equipment is announcing a major round of funding on the back of its business booming.</p>
<p><a href="http://drivenets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DriveNets</a> &#8212; which provides software-based routing solutions to service providers that run them as virtualized services over &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_box_(computer_hardware)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white box</a>&#8221; generic architecture &#8212; has closed $208 million in funding, a Series B that values the company at over $1 billion post-money.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The plan will be to use the funding to continue building out the business internationally and to tailor it to more use cases beyond carriers, including the wave of bigger companies that stream large amounts of media and have some control over their networks as a result.</p>
<p>Future deals are still under NDA, CEO Ido Susan said, but he described the opportunity as a clear one: &#8220;If you want to serve bandwidth with low latency, if you want to offer strong 5G capability or cloud gaming, you need to be close to your end customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Series B is being D1 Capital Partners. Previous backers Bessemer Venture Partners and Pitango (which co-led DriveNets&#8217; previous, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/drivenets-emerges-from-stealth-with-110m-for-its-cloud-based-alternative-to-network-routers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$110 million round</a> when it emerged from stealth) also made a significant investment, and Atreides Management also participated. This latest round was made at more than double DriveNets&#8217; valuation in 2019.</p>
<p>D1 has been an especially prolific investor in the last year, going big on businesses that are seeing a lot of attention as a result of pandemic conditions. They include e-commerce giants <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/warby-parker-valued-at-3-billion-raises-245-million-in-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warby Parker</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/instacart-raises-200m-more-at-17-7b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instacart</a>, fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/transferwise-five-unicorns/">TransferWise</a>, gaming engine <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/unity-now-valued-at-6b-raising-up-to-525m/">Unity</a>, online car sales platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/cazoo-the-uk-used-car-sales-portal-raises-another-311m-now-valued-at-over-2b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cazoo</a>, and transportation startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/bolt-raises-182m-to-expand-its-on-demand-transportation-network-in-europe-and-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bolt</a>.</p>
<p>DriveNets&#8217; big round is based both on bigger trends in the market, as well as its own strong record.</p>
<p>Before this round, DriveNets had already <a href="https://drivenets.com/news-and-events/press-release/att-deploys-drivenets-network-cloud-in-their-next-gen-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">counted AT&amp;T among its customers</a>, a major vote of confidence for the company and its virtual network approach, but it seems that recent circumstances and the spike in internet activity have brought more providers to consider its approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;The internet was growing 30%-40% annually even before Covid-19,&#8221; said Susan. &#8220;But even five years ago, incumbent carriers were coming to us saying, said no one can build virtual networks. Now, it’s not a question of whether it works or not, but when you will adopt it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recent m<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">omentum for the company&#8217;s sales, he said, is very good. &#8220;Everyone is working and studying from home so you need more capacity and bandwidth in the network,&#8221; he added. </span></p>
<p>DriveNets&#8217; core product is a more flexible and cost-effective replacement for the traditional network router that relies on virtualized architecture. Traditionally, routers have been sold as vertically-integrated hardware solutions, bringing together both software and hardware into one branded big box, with companies like Cisco and Juniper Networks dominating the space.</p>
<p>In their place, as Susan and co-founder Hillel Kobrinsky envisioned it, DriveNets provides a solution that is based around generic white boxes. It currently works with three providers for these boxes, Susan said.</p>
<p>These work in conjunction with a system it has developed called Network Cloud, which in turn runs a networking stack called the DriveNets Operating System. Service providers control their systems of white boxes and other servers through a virtualized service run over Docker containers, using open APIs to automate and configure various network services.</p>
<p>This allows for more flexibility in capacity among the white box servers, but they can also be easily added and removed as needed. Essentially, it&#8217;s a system that disaggregates the software from the hardware, to make expanding the hardware much easier, and controlling the software significantly more flexible to boot.</p>
<p>(Ironically, my conversation with Susan took place over Zoom with him in his home office, which also doubles as a DIY workshop. So with a full array of hardware equipment surrounding Susan, we talked about how software would come to dominate the world.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a disruptive concept that potentially steps on a lot of toes, but Adam Fisher, a partner with Bessemer, said that he&#8217;s confident it&#8217;s one that will continue to gain traction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are extremely enthusiastic about the company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Aside from Ido and Hillel as entrepreneurs, we really connected with their vision. Network routing is moving to software and cloud architecture. We&#8217;re talking not just about the small parts here but the hearts and lungs of the system. DriveNets is starting with the hardest parts. Once one customer becomes multiple customers, you just realise it&#8217;s the future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beauty and wellness appointment booking apps have proliferated of the last few years, but it appears the race is still on as today one of the leaders, <a href="https://booksy.com">Booksy</a>, raises $70 million in a Series C round led by Cat Rock Capital, with participation from Sprints Capital. </p>
<p>The round was also joined by OpenOcean, Piton Capital, VNV Global, Enern, Kai Hansen, Zach Coelius and Manta Ray Ventures, and takes the total raised by the firm to $119 million. The funding will be used for expansion plans across North America, expanding to new verticals, and acquiring complementary businesses.</p>
<p>The Booksy app is used by customers to book and pay for beauty appointments with local businesses. Salons, nail bars and barbershops can manage the bookings, payments, and customer base via the accompanying Booksy Biz app. The platform also allows salons to sell other products via Booksy E-Commerce, which acts as a marketplace allowing customers to discover and book other local stylists, nail technicians etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Booksy was founded by Polish entrepreneurs Stefan Batory (CEO) and Konrad Howard. Allowing customers to schedule their best appointment time means that 38% of customers end up booking after-hours and increasing their appointment frequency by 20%, says the company. The startup launched in 2014 but is now in the US (its largest market), UK, Poland, Spain, Brazil, and South Africa. It claims to be the number-one beauty booking app in each country, with “13 million” consumers on the app.</p>
<p>Batory said in a statement: “Like with many sectors negatively hit by the pandemic, it’s been a turbulent time for the beauty and wellness industry but we’re confident in its ability to come back from this, so it’s fantastic to see our latest group of investors share our optimism and vision. This latest round of funding enables us to reach even more salons and service providers across the US, and in all the regions we operate, which in turn helps them reach more customers.” </p>
<p>Alex Captain, founder and managing partner at Cat Rock Capital, said: “We are incredibly excited to invest in Booksy as it builds the leading global software platform for digitizing the beauty and wellness industry around the world.”</p>
<p>Booksy certainly seems to have cracked the international expansion game ahead of most competitors, which tend to stay more local to their countries of origin such as Treatwell, Styleseat, Vagaro and Mindbody. The opportunity for Booksy is to now use its war cast to roll-up other local players.</p>
<p>It has already acquired rival Lavito in 2018 and, more recently, merged with Versum in December 2020 allowing it to enter Mexico.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lime is adding electric mopeds — painted in the company&#8217;s signature green — to its micromobility platform as the startup aims to own the spectrum of inner city travel from jaunts to the corner store to longer distance trips up to five miles.</p>
<p>Lime said Wednesday it plans to launch as many as 600 electric mopeds on its platform this spring in Washington D.C. The company is also working with officials to pilot the mopeds in Paris. Eventually, the mopeds will be offered in a &#8220;handful of cities&#8221; over the next several months.</p>
<p>The mopeds, supplied by manufacturer Niu, are designed for two people and outfitted with tech like infrared-cameras in the helmet compartment that can detect if they&#8217;re in use during a trip, an effort aimed at rooting out misuse and increasing safety. Repeat offenders of Lime&#8217;s policies, which includes wearing a helmet at all times, will be kicked off the platform. Customers will also be required to take a selfie wearing the helmet at the start of a ride.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The helmets will be supplied by Moon for U.S. customers and Nikko for the European deployments.</p>
<p>The mopeds will have a top speed of 28 miles an hour and be able to travel up to 87 miles on a single charge. Unlike Lime scooters, in which gig economy workers can earn money by collecting, charging and bringing back to city streets, the mopeds will have swappable batteries and be maintained by full-time employees.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s unclear if mopeds have always been part of Lime&#8217;s long-term plans, the company&#8217;s head of new mobility  told TechCrunch that they&#8217;ve been thinking about what the future of electrified urban transportation might include.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;As we&#8217;ve grown as a company, we understood that we just needed to follow what our riders were demanding which is further distances,&#8221; said Sean Arroyo, head of new mobility at Lime. &#8220;The ability to meet any trip, at anytime, anywhere, is something that&#8217;s at the foundation for us and so our riders really are the ones that pointed us in this direction.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Lime CEO Wayne Ting first hinted late last year that a &#8220;third mode&#8221; of transport beyond scooters and bikes was in the works for the first quarter of 2021 as well as the addition of third-party companies to its platform. Last year, Lime also started to include on its app <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wheels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="wheels">Wheels</a>-branded electric bikes in certain cities. Ting said, at the time, that users should expect more partnerships like these.</p>
<p>The expansion into mopeds is the latest sign that Lime has managed to put some of its darker Covid-19-tainted times behind it. Lime <a href="https://www.li.me/second-street/limes-path-through-covid-19">underwent a round of layoffs</a> in April, taking on capital from Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/">the next month</a> in a down-round that brought its valuation under the $1 billion mark. Lime paused most of its operations for a month during the early COVID-19 days.</p>
<p>But it has since rebounded. Ting said in November that the company is both operating cash flow positive and free cash flow positive in the third quarter and was on pace to be full-year profitable, excluding certain costs (EBIT), in 2021. It also had enough cash — or access to it — to expand into mopeds.</p>
<p>The question is, &#8216;whether more modes are on the way?&#8217;</p>
<p>Arroyo didn&#8217;t give specifics, but it does appear more is coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think throughout this year you&#8217;re gonna see us really expand, not just with modes, but optionality,&#8221; Arroyo said. &#8221; For us it&#8217;s really about having a platform that&#8217;s available for all these trips, and then we want to be able to provide optionality that makes sense for the riders. Shared is a huge component, but there&#8217;s a lot of different levels of what shared looks like; and throughout 2021, I think you&#8217;re gonna see us offer quite a few different options as our modes expand.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.gardin.co.uk/">Gardin</a>, a ‘deep tech’ hardware and software startup developing optical phenotyping technology and analytics to optimise food production, has raised $1.2 million in pre-seed funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is LDV Capital, with participation from Seedcamp, and MMC Ventures. A number of angel investors are also investing, including Pratima Aiyagari, Gilad Engel, and Abdulaziz Alrashed.</p>
<p>Founded in late 2019, Gardin’s mission, in the U.K. company’s own words, is to help everyone access high quality, nutritious food that is “good for you and for our planet”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Specifically, the startup is developing tech for farms based on its own “optical phenotyping” hardware and accompanying analytics software. The idea is to enable food producers to measure and monitor the nutritional value of food, from “seed to plate in a real world environment,” rather than a lab.</p>
<p>“With deployment of Gardin’s OS, insight from our analytics will be delivered to help food producers optimise production, grow nutritious food, lower carbon footprint and reduce waste,” says founder and CEO Sumanta Talukdar. “At Gardin, we want to empower food producers to feed the world consciously, sustainably and nutritionally, as it should be”.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7W9VyKIaee"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/infarm-raises-170m-in-equity-and-debt/">Infarm raises $170M in equity and debt to continue building its &#8216;vertical farming&#8217; network</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Infarm raises $170M in equity and debt to continue building its &#8216;vertical farming&#8217; network&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/infarm-raises-170m-in-equity-and-debt/embed/#?secret=7W9VyKIaee" data-secret="7W9VyKIaee" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Talukdar says he started the company after learning that the traditional food industry currently “does not, or cannot, quantifiably measure food nutrition and quality”. This has seen Gardin partner with some of the leading crop and plant physiologists, phenotyping experts and plant scientists to identify the key biochemical mechanisms in various crops related to plant physiology.</p>
<p>“By designing hardware to specifically measure the signatures of these mechanisms, Gardin is able to quantify plant physiology and key compounds density with high fidelity (i.e. signal/noise ratio) at a cost similar to consumer electronics goods,” he explained. To achieve this, Gardin is employing a multispectral data fusion approach, using a suite of remote sensing and computer vision techniques to capture very specific data which is then “fused” to drive the analytics.</p>
<p>To that end, Gardin has been designed to assist both traditional and CEA (controlled environment agriculture), with the ambitious aim to become the new “food production gold standard”.</p>
<p>“Our full stack product is designed to run and optimise the entire growing environment running silently in the background like an OS i.e we are solving their problems, helping food producers grow higher quality food and reducing their operating costs and carbon footprint,” adds Talukdar.</p>
<p>“We have also designed our platform so we can integrate with their existing architectures. To us, asking a producer in what is already an asset heavy industry to change or add to their system to make us fit, was folly”.</p>
<p>In terms of traction, Talukdar says Gardin has already secured pilot trials that are ready to go live early this year with “key go-to-market clients. They include supermarket chains, food producers and vertical farms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.mooncard.co">Mooncard</a> is partnering with Flying Blue to offer Air France miles to its customers. This is the first time you can earn miles with a payment card in France that isn’t an American Express card.</p>
<p>Mooncard provides corporate payment cards to streamline your expenses. Most companies in France don’t use corporate cards. But fintech startups have created corporate cards that can help you streamline expenses.</p>
<p>In addition to Visa cards, Mooncard lets you easily take a photo of your receipts, add details and submit expenses to your accounting team. You can set up different limits and validation processes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today’s news is interesting as American Express has been in a monopolistic position for decades with its partnership with Flying Blue. In France, companies had to choose American Express if they wanted miles as perks.</p>
<p>When it comes to pricing, it looks pretty similar to what American Express offers:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png" alt="" width="1024" height="597" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2100832" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png 2472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=768,447 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=680,396 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=1536,895 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=2048,1193 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>There’s one big difference —&nbsp;Mooncard relies on the Visa network. As many restaurants and shops don’t support American Express, it could be enough to lure customers away from American Express. Employees can use their miles for personal trips.</p>
<p>There are 3,000 companies using Mooncard as well as many public institutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Joanne Chen just became the second general partner in the history of the now 26-year-old, Silicon Valley venture firm, Foundation Capital.</p>
<p>Were she still alive, Foundation&#8217;s founder, Kathryn Gould, would undoubtedly cheer the development.</p>
<p>Known for her big personality, Gould first met Chen when Chen was an MBA student at the University of Chicago. Gould was recovering from a bout with cancer at the time, and after being introduced to Chen through one of <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/k/steven-neil-kaplan">Chen&#8217;s professors</a>, she initially advised Chen not to go into venture. As Gould herself discovered early on, doors open more easily to men in the venture world, which is why she&#8217;d <a href="https://www.strictlyvc.com/2015/02/23/kingmaker-background-kathryn-gould/">started her own firm in the first place</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yet, like Gould, being dissuaded only motivated Chen more. While she began her career as an engineer at Cisco, she was long interested in finance, jumping into a banking analyst role with Jeffries, then working as an associate with the capital advisory firm Probitas before cofounding a mobile gaming company she would later wind down.</p>
<p>Indeed, grad school in Chicago &#8212; and meeting Gould &#8212; only reinforced for Chen how much she wanted to become a VC, and following stints at Formation 8 and Hyde Park Angels, she landed at Foundation in 2014. (Sadly, Gould passed away in 2015.)</p>
<p>Chen has certainly brought a fresh perspective to a firm that features 10 investors altogether, the rest men.</p>
<p>Aside from being the only woman in the group, Chen has a strong point of view, for example, on the entrepreneurial potential of students from U.C. Berkeley, where she studied as an undergraduate. While the university is not nearly so organized as Stanford when it comes to minting founders, in her view it has just as much talent and, as a result, it&#8217;s a network into which she invests a lot of time and energy as an investor.</p>
<p>Chen, who was born in China and great up in Montreal, also spends a lot of time thinking about AI, both as an investor and also simply a person in the world. Her father, who received his PhD from the University of Montreal, went on to work at Bell Labs as a researcher, and her mother is a computer programmer and &#8220;DevOps person&#8221; who Chen routinely talks with about software tools. But their background isn&#8217;t so simple.</p>
<p>Like many immigrants, her parents fled China during the Cultural Revolution. Because her grandfather helped architect a major telecom company in China, he was persecuted by the Communist Party, stripped of all his responsibilities and titles and, as an &#8220;intellectual,&#8221; says Chen, thrown in jail. Meanwhile, his son (her father) wasn&#8217;t allowed to start college until he was 21, and it was only because he was a good student that was he invited abroad to obtain his master&#8217;s degree.</p>
<p>Today, her family&#8217;s experience combined with China&#8217;s use of artificial intelligence &#8212; including to track its Muslim minority &#8212; is top of mind for Chen in ways it may not be for someone with a lesser grasp of the lengths to which authoritarian regimes will go, and how quickly they can act.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why most of Chen&#8217;s work centers on understanding how AI, from how machines evolve from organizing activity to replacing humans (which will definitely happen, says Chen); to how to recognize and counter malicious applications of AI with AI (such as through recruiting software that screens out names and gender to eliminate human bias); and how to otherwise make sure that AI is used to improve human life, she suggests.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen isn&#8217;t exactly alone in her interest in AI. Nearly every startup today incorporates &#8212; or says it does &#8212; AI into its offerings, from lending companies to startups that help remote teams work more effectively. And investors, including at Foundation, have funded many of them.</p>
<p>Asked how she deals with competition for many of these deals, Chen says she moves as fast when there&#8217;s a decision to be made. She engages with VPs of engineering and technical founders who share ideas through Slack communities and elsewhere. She also notes that Foundation provides capital to roughly 30 operators who write angel checks and help steer the firm&#8217;s attention to interesting deals.</p>
<p>Mostly, suggests Chen, she focuses on whatever is not landing in her inbox &#8212; a lesson learned in part from Gould years ago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to believe. As Gould <a href="https://www.strictlyvc.com/2015/02/23/kingmaker-background-kathryn-gould/">once told this editor</a> of the advice she gives to other VCs: &#8220;It not the calls you take. It’s the calls you make. Everyone is calling you with dumb startup ideas, and you can stay hugely busy sorting through that crap. My advice instead is to figure out who are the 10 to 20 smartest people you know and call them. One of them is always starting a company.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.efounders.com">eFounders</a> is expanding its focus by creating a second startup studio called <a href="https://www.efounders.com/logicfounders">Logic Founders</a>. This time, Logic Founders is going to focus on fintech startups exclusively. Camille Tyan (pictured above) is going to lead the new studio.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, eFounders has launched dozens of software-as-a-service companies trying to improve the way we work. Portfolio companies include <a href="https://frontapp.com">Front</a>, <a href="https://aircall.io">Aircall</a> and <a href="https://www.spendesk.com">Spendesk</a>.</p>
<p>Camille Tyan previously co-founded PayPlug, a payments company that was acquired by Natixis (Groupe BPCE). He plans to follow the eFounders model centered around a new vertical. Logic Founders will come up with ideas for new startups. It’ll recruit two co-founders and start working on the product for the first 12 to 18 months of the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ideally, the startup finds product-market fit and raises a seed round after this initial phase. The startup studio keeps a stake in the startup but it moves on so that it can focus on new projects.</p>
<p>If you’ve been following eFounders closely, the startup studio has already worked on several fintech companies, such as Spendesk, <a href="https://upflow.io">Upflow</a>, <a href="https://multis.co">Multis</a> and <a href="https://www.swan.io">Swan</a>. New fintech projects will likely fall under the Logic Founders umbrella.</p>
<p>The studio says it will launch API-first financial products. It is riding the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/embedded-finance-might-represent-fintechs-future/">embedded finance</a> trend — many believe financial products will be distributed by platforms that aren’t primarily focused on finance but could benefit from fintech features. You can expect companies working on payments orchestration, asset securitization, lending APIs, crypto and B2B identity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese internet giant ByteDance has told employees in India that it is reducing the size of its team in the country after New Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/india-retains-ban-on-tiktok-uc-browser-and-57-other-chinese-apps/">retained ban on TikTok</a> and other Chinese apps last week, said a source familiar with the matter and an internal memo obtained by TechCrunch. After the publication of this story, a TikTok spokesperson confirmed the layoff.</p>
<p>The company, which employs more than 2,000 people in India, shared the news with employees in the country at 10 am local time and said only critical jobs will be retained in the country, said the source. More than two-thirds of the company&#8217;s workforce is expected to be eliminated, the source said. ByteDance said it was left with no choice after the Indian government, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned its marquee app late June</a> last year, had offered no clear direction on when TikTok could make return in the nation, the source said on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is deeply regretful that after supporting our 2000+ employees in India for more than half a year, we have no choice but to scale back the size of our workforce. We look forward to receiving the opportunity to relaunch TikTok and support the hundreds of millions of users, artists, story-tellers, educators and performers in India,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Prior to the ban, India was the biggest international market for TikTok, which had amassed over 200 million monthly active users in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. India blocked over 200 apps with links to China last year amid geopolitical tension between the two nations. New Delhi has said that these apps engaged in activities that posed threats to “national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week, New Delhi told ByteDance and dozens of other Chinese firms that it maintains the concerns it had originally charged against them and would retain the ban.</p>
<p>TikTok CEO Vanessa Pappas and VP of Global Business Blake Chandlee shared more context about the move in a memo to India employees today. &#8220;We initially hoped that this situation would be short-lived, and that we would be able to resolve this quickly. Seven months later, we find that has not been the case. Many of you have patiently waited to hear how this would play out, which has been very stressful. Thank you for your continued belief and trust in us,&#8221; they wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you can imagine, a decision of this magnitude is not easy. For the last several months, our management team has worked tirelessly to avoid having to separate anyone from the company. We&#8217;ve cut expenses, while still paying benefits. However, we simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while our apps remain un-operational. We are fully aware of the impact that this decision has for all of our employees in India, and we empathize with our team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s move caps some of the strangest and confusing months for ByteDance employees in India. Following the ban, the employees were told to focus on developing a range of other apps from the Chinese giant such as the productivity suite Lark that had not been blocked in India.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok is engaging with India over ban and already complies with local privacy and security requirements, CEO says&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/tiktok-is-engaging-with-india-over-ban-and-already-complies-with-local-privacy-and-security-requirements-ceo-says/embed/#?secret=nIojqZnrx8" data-secret="nIojqZnrx8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But they were asked to not talk about these apps in the public to avoid putting risk of other ByteDance properties also getting the limelight. The source said ByteDance also stopped all marketing efforts in India to promote its other services in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we don&#8217;t know when we will make a comeback in India, we are confident in our resilience, and desire to do so in times to come,&#8221; Pappas and Chandlee wrote in the memo.</p>
<p>In a statement on Wednesday, Ji Rong, spokesperson of Chinese Embassy in India, said the nation&#8217;s ban on Chinese apps violates guidelines by the World Trade Organization. &#8220;These moves in violation of WTO non-discriminatory principles and fair competition principles of market economy severely damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. The Chinese side firmly opposes them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese government always asks Chinese companies to observe international rules and local laws and regulations when doing business overseas. The Indian government has the responsibility to follow WTO rules and market principles and protect the legitimate rights and interests of international investors including Chinese companies. These moves of the Indian government have also hindered the improvement of the Indian business environment and the innovative development of related Indian industries. China-India economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial by nature. We urge the Indian side to immediately correct its discriminatory measures and avoid causing further damage to bilateral cooperation.&#8221;</p>
