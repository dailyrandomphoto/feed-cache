										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix has raised the prices of its subscription services once again in the U.S. and Canada. All new subscribers will see the new prices starting today, and existing customers will receive an email notice 30 days before the increase enters effect.</p>
<p>The hikes were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-netflix-raises-monthly-subscription-prices-us-canada-2022-01-14/">first reported by Reuters</a>, which Netflix told: &#8220;We’re updating our prices so that we can continue to offer a wide variety of quality entertainment options.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926">The new prices are as follows</a>:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258135" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Basic (1 stream, 480p): $8.99 → $9.99</li>
<li>Standard (2 streams, 1080p): $13.99 → $15.49</li>
<li>Premium (4 streams, 4K): $17.99 → $19.99</li>
</ul>
<p>In Canada the new prices are $16.49 for Standard and $20.99 for Premium, with Basic unchanged at $9.99.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/netflix-is-raising-prices-on-most-of-its-plans-in-the-us/">The last increase was in 2020</a> (standard went from $13 to $14) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/netflix-price-hike/">before that 2019</a> (from $11 to $13). One imagines they waited until January just so no one can say they raised the price three years in a row.</p>
<p>The pandemic has seen something of a historic increase in demand for TV and movies, and while Hollywood is still trying to sort out its strategy, Netflix has confidently doubled down on a winning formula and slipped its customers the bill.</p>
<p>While nobody likes to lose another buck a month, the value proposition is hard to deny with the platform&#8217;s seemingly endless selection of increasingly international productions. The breakout hit &#8220;Squid Game&#8221; is just one example of a show that probably wouldn&#8217;t have been made (indeed the creator shopped it unsuccessfully for years) without Netflix&#8217;s deep pockets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Expect an email soon detailing the changes — you&#8217;ll have a chance to change or cancel, but who among us has the strength to do so? Just use the increase as justification for watching 10% more shows.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We'll be off on Monday, January 17 in observance of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage startup founders have just a few ways to recruit and retain employees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer a competitive salary</li>
<li>Create a role that harnesses their interests/talent</li>
<li>Give them a stake in the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, equity will not leave employees with substantial wealth. But even the most embittered worker will think twice about walking away from a job before they&#8217;re fully vested.</p>
<p>In a TC+ guest post, Kirsten Prost, vice president at VC/PE firm Tercera, lays out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/a-startup-founders-guide-to-allocating-equity-grants/">detailed steps for designing your equity program</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258076" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Full TechCrunch+ articles are only available to members<br />
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">Use discount code <strong>TCPLUSROUNDUP</strong></a> to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription</i></p>
<hr />
<p>Her guide includes brackets and multipliers for contributors at different levels, along with fictional examples founders can use for modeling, and tips that will help employees understand the value of their stake.</p>
<p>Speaking as a veteran of many early-stage startups: entrepreneurs love to be seen talking about fostering an ownership mentality, but if that&#8217;s going to be more than happy talk, you&#8217;ll first need a transparent equity program.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be off on Monday, January 17 to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading, and have an excellent weekend!</p>

<p>There’s a growing rift between the public and private markets’ valuation of tech startups, and Justworks’ decision to delay its IPO may well be a bellwether of what’s to come, writes Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>Software companies are getting hammered on the public markets, while the private markets continue to retain their enthusiasm for tech startups.</p>
<p>This difference in opinion, writes Alex, could turn out poorly for richly valued startups that want to exit this year.</p>
<p>“Justworks’ IPO delay indicates that the enthusiasm gap between private markets and their public analog is wide. And for pricey unicorns still bleeding cash, that’s terrible news.”</p>

<p>Game distribution platform Steam banned blockchain-based games in October 2021: Any titles that incorporate NFTs or cryptocurrency were summarily booted from the service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, within Axie Infinity, an NFT-based online game, new players are paying hundreds of dollars to acquire mythical pets and love potions.</p>
<p>Blockchain gaming is making inroads with some consumers, but given the lack of regulatory guidance and the speculative nature of many crypto holdings, what do investors think?</p>
<p>To find out, we surveyed seven who are active in the space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anton Backman, principal, and Kenrick Drijkoningen, general partner, Play Ventures</li>
<li>Banafsheh Fathieh, head of investments, Americas, Prosus Ventures</li>

<p>It’s one thing to get a prospective customer to visit your site, but convincing them to reach for their wallet or share their phone number is a stretch.</p>
<p>As consumers gain greater control over their privacy, Aleksandra Korczynska, CMO of GetResponse, says marketers who align lead generation with the goals of their prospective customers will gain a significant advantage.</p>
<p>“The key is building a foot-in-the-door technique for continuous engagement — lead magnets,” she says.</p>

<p>Special purpose acquisition companies took 2020 and 2021 by storm, enabling a large cohort of companies to go public.</p>
<p>But, as they say: if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p>
<p>Disappointment isn&#8217;t limited to a single industry, writes Alex Wilhelm in The Exchange. Property tech, fintech, media, and personal mobility companies have all seen big drop-offs since their debut.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would hazard that we’ve collected enough data to call the SPAC boom a failure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paying users to play is part of blockchain gaming&#8217;s unique selling proposition, but is that the purpose of entertainment?</p>
<p>Senior Editor Alex Wilhelm says he enjoys the fun and excitement associated with playing against others online, but &#8220;I am bearish on crypto games as they currently exist for a few reasons, even if the incentives are more aligned than they appear in traditional gaming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Halsey Minor is best known as a co-founder of CNET and an early Salesforce.com investor, but for the last several years, he&#8217;s been working in crypto.</p>
<p>After three decades developing content, he&#8217;s now leading Vivid Labs, which operates a proprietary NFT publishing platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much like I recognized the massive explosion of the internet many years ago, I see crypto and NFTs as the technology of the future,&#8221; said Minor in a TC+ interview that includes advice for founders hoping to raise capital for web3 projects.</p>

<p>Next week, Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm plan to file a series of stories for The Exchange examining sectors and trends in different regions. To build a foundation for that reporting, this week, they looked back at a record-setting year for venture capital.</p>
<p>In 2021, VC investment totaled $621 billion, an increase of 111% from the year before, according to CB Insights. Crunchbase pegs the figure at $643 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regardless of which number we choose, it’s clear that well north of half a trillion dollars was invested into high-growth private companies last year – a rough doubling of what the same asset class managed in 2020.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a country where many people are still unbanked, and queuing to pay bills is part of daily life, the impact of being able to pay anyone instantly can't be understated.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brazilian instant payment system Pix ended 2021 having powered more than 8 billion transactions, according to <a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/financialstability/pixstatistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistics</a> from the country&#8217;s Central Bank. This is quite an impressive figure for an offering only launched in November 2020 and goes to show how ubiquitous Pix has become in the country.</p>
<p>You could describe Pix as &#8220;a government-built version of Venmo,&#8221; as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/kaszek-leads-z1s-latest-round-as-it-develops-its-bank-app-aimed-at-latam-teens/">João Pedro Thompson, founder of fintech Z1,</a> told TechCrunch. However, the analogy doesn&#8217;t fully capture the fact that Pix appeals to many more than just digitally savvy teenagers repaying friends for coffee. Otherwise, it wouldn&#8217;t be used by <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2021/11/6-em-cada-10-brasileiros-ja-usaram-o-pix-pelo-menos-uma-vez.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six of 10 Brazilians</a>.</p>
<p>In a country where many people are still unbanked and queuing to pay bills is part of daily life, the impact of being able to pay anyone instantly can&#8217;t be understated. In addition, Pix now supports more services, such as letting you <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/brazils-pix-new-features-saque-and-troco-are-avaliable-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdraw cash from businesses</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting that Pix is an institutional initiative, part of a wider range of public efforts to transform Brazil&#8217;s financial landscape. &#8220;The Central Bank has been doing a tremendous job and Pix is one of the most relevant structural changes,&#8221; Brazilian VC <a href="https://twitter.com/brunoyoshimura" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bruno Yoshimura</a> told TechCrunch when we wrote about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/why-latams-fintech-boom-is-more-than-hype-and-superlative-venture-investment/">Latin America&#8217;s fintech boom</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve lived in Brazil, so this naturally piqued my interest. At the time, entrepreneurs were constantly complaining about bureaucracy, and their highest hope was that institutions would just stay out of the way. But now, VCs and founders are actually praising the Central Bank for its initiatives and the opportunities it has created.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both Open Banking and Pix will level the playfield for new challenges, and we expect to see a lot of innovation around them,&#8221; Yoshimura said, referring to another of the Central Bank&#8217;s projects.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just Pix, and it&#8217;s not only the Central Bank&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/about/bcbhashtag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BC# agenda</a> either. Brazil&#8217;s Superintendence of Private Insurance (Susep) is working on <a href="https://openinsurance.susep.gov.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open insurance plans</a>, which means that insurtech could be the next sector to benefit from regulatory tailwinds.</p>
<p>To understand what&#8217;s going on with regulations in Brazil, and how this is affecting startups, I reached out to experts with firsthand knowledge of Latin America&#8217;s fintech ecosystem.</p>
<p>On the VC side, I got in touch with <a href="https://twitter.com/amyecheetham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Cheetham</a>, a partner at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/things-are-heating-up-for-costanoa-ventures-closes-two-over-subscribed-funds/">Costanoa Ventures</a>, whose recent investments <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/plug-raises-2-7m-to-make-payment-acceptance-in-brazil-less-terrible/">include Rio de Janeiro-based Plug</a>; and <a href="https://mundiventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alma Mundi Ventures</a>&#8216; <a href="https://twitter.com/javiersantiso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Javier Santiso </a>for additional thoughts on insurtech. On the startup side, I spoke with CEOs <a href="https://twitter.com/rodrigoteijeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rodrigo Teijeiro</a> from <a href="https://recargapay.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RecargaPay</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrosonegodeoliveira/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pedro Sônego de Oliveira</a> from <a href="https://truepay.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TruePay</a>.</p>
<h2>Opportunities abound</h2>
<p>&#8220;The open banking initiatives adopted by Brazil&#8217;s Central Bank are absolutely tailwinds for fintech innovation,&#8221; Costanoa&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/amyecheetham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Cheetham</a> said. &#8220;As consumers regain control of their data, it creates space for new entrants to the banking ecosystem and creates more competition, giving consumers access to better, cheaper, fairer, and more secure financial products and services. This includes giving fintechs the power to build for previously [underserved] or unserved segments of the population,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p><a href="https://recargapay.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RecargaPay</a> is one of the startups leveraging the new regulations to expand their B2C services. &#8220;Our mission at RecargaPay,&#8221; founder Teijeiro said, &#8220;is to democratize mobile payments and financial services in Brazil, so open banking and Pix are the perfect recipe to accelerate our mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teijeiro is particularly appreciative of Pix and its &#8220;incredible&#8221; trajectory. &#8220;What was accomplished in just one year was a tremendous disruption benefiting millions of Brazilians by making their payments easier, faster and cheaper. For this, the Brazilian Central Bank deserves to be recognized as the &#8216;fintech startup of the year,'&#8221; he said, describing Pix&#8217;s impact on cash going mobile as &#8220;a huge blessing for RecargaPay.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Its technology enables legal professionals and companies to create profiles and be matched to available work, monitor projects and pay through the platform.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Similar to other industries embracing contract work, <a href="https://www.lawtrades.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lawtrades</a> is giving legal professionals a way to become independent and run their own virtual law practices.</p>
<p>Raad Ahmed and Ashish Walia started the company in 2016 with an initial focus on startups and small businesses, trying to find product-market fit (as one does), but finding that legal usage among companies of that size was often project-based, infrequent and short-term if the company folds.</p>
<p>In 2019, the company pivoted to working with mid-market and enterprise-level companies by selling into legal departments, and that’s when growth took off, Ahmed told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257720" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Today, Lawtrades works with companies, like Doordash, Gusto and Pinterest, to offer them a marketplace of professionals that can be hired remotely and with flexibility. Its technology enables professionals and companies to create profiles and be matched to opportunities, monitor projects and pay through the platform.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, it is a new internet-native work model that we are starting with legal because it is a $100 billion market that has not been disrupted much in the last 100 years,” Ahmed said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2257732" style="width: 3210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257732" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2257732 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png" alt="Lawtrades" width="3200" height="2400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3200px) 100vw, 3200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257732" class="wp-caption-text">Lawtrades app design. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lawtrades</p></div></p>
<p>He and Walia wanted to build a different hiring experience from the likes of LinkedIn, where companies would have to weed through hundreds of applicants to find the qualified few. Professionals are also able to provide a flat pricing structure, unlike law firms which have overhead and other firm costs that are typically factored into billable hours.</p>
<p>Following the doubling of revenue in 2021, it closed on a $6 million Series A round, led by Four Cities Capital, with participation from Draper Associates and 500 Startups. The round also included nearly 100 customers, angel investors and company founders, including Gumroad founder Sahil Lavingia, Teachable’s Ankur Nagpal and GoDaddy CEO Aman Bhutani.</p>
<p>“Due to the world finally embracing remote legal work and more lawyers leaving big law firms to work for themselves, we’re cash flow positive and leveraging revenue-based financing, so we didn’t have to do a big dilutive equity raise,” Ahmed said.</p>

<p>At the end of 2021, Lawtrades had 80 customers on the platform and 150 active engagements. On the talent side, there are over 1,000 profiles, up from 400 made by the end of 2020. Currently, it is running on an invite-only model, and 5% are accepted into the network. The makeup of the network is 60% women and over 35% are minorities.</p>
<p>In December, the company’s revenue run rate was $8 million, up from $3 million at the beginning of 2021, Ahmed added. More than $11 million was earned on the platform to date by the network and over 60,000 hours of work was logged on the platform in 2021, a 200% boost from 2020.</p>
<p>Ahmed plans to use the new funding to rebrand the company, launch an iOS app, expand into other professional categories, like finance and management consulting, and gain an international footprint. He also intends to double Lawtrades’ current headcount from 15 to 30 across product, support and sales.</p>
<p>“The world of work is in a unique position,” he added. “People are working remotely and companies are looking for talent, so it is an all-out talent war with the best people getting the best offers. With our model, the power is in the individual to pick the kind of work they want to do. That’s how we are able to attract amazing talent and then be able to get companies that want to hire them. We are iterating on and pushing the boundaries of the 40-hour work week.”</p>

		Steve Alexander is SVP and CTO of <a href="https://www.ciena.com/">Ciena</a>, a networking systems and software company that works with operators and content providers across the globe.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Meta’s stated mission is to seamlessly connect disparate environments like work, social media and gaming so it can allow people to effectively live and work in the virtual space.</p>
<p>This will clearly have a significant and sustained impact on our networks. We aren’t just talking about a need to be constantly connected, without glitches; we’re talking about fully immersive content streaming seamlessly, in 4K and 8K, with low latency and minimal lag.</p>
<p>We will need to be able to go from one experience to another without being distracted by reboots, operating system or application loading times, network congestion, or anything else that suggests we’re not in a seamless virtual environment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Accomplishing all of this makes virtual life seem as challenging as moving to Mars.</p>
<p>Yet, it is possible to make the journey to our new virtual world friction-less. We just need to make sure we are putting in place the basic building blocks needed for virtual life.</p>
<p>Starting today, we have the opportunity to make the metaverse habitable and hospitable, a place where our virtual selves can thrive, not just survive.</p>
<h2>Bandwidth is key</h2>
<p>We’ll need a lot of bandwidth to make this work at scale. Much like water is a building block of life, there is no way we could function in a metaverse without bandwidth. We need high-performance connectivity capable of supporting the different demands of bandwidth-hungry applications in the metaverse.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That bandwidth must be widespread and affordable, too, to better support our underserved and under-connected communities. Visions of a virtual world often center on equal opportunities for everyone to create and explore. For that to happen inside the metaverse, we need to ensure a level playing field of connectivity in the real world first.</p>
<h2>Low latency is as critical as air</h2>
<p>Bandwidth is one thing, but if it takes the avatar we’re engaging with several seconds to respond – or worse – then meta life is suddenly annoying and inhospitable. We already find it frustrating to have lag when streaming live sports or gaming online, and this will only be exacerbated when we are trying to fully immerse ourselves into a virtual world.</p>
<p>Technology such as edge computing – which can reduce network latency and improve reliability – will become increasingly important in networks that require real-time responsiveness.</p>
<h2>Virtual hardware: The infrastructure of the metaverse</h2>
<p>We’ve all been there: Hardware breaks, and we need to fix it. In that time, we need to be able to survive without whatever function that piece of hardware operated. But this can’t happen in a metaverse – or at least it shouldn’t, because we should have utilized virtualized functions for much of what the metaverse requires.</p>
<p>Deploying infrastructure functions using virtual machine and container concepts where they, like apps, can be deployed across the network at scale and in real time will be key. Classic network functions such as routing and switching will need to be fully virtualized. They need to be easily updated, upgraded, patched and deployed.</p>
<h2>Software intelligence: The mayor of the metaverse</h2>
<p>We need the metaverse to be software-defined to enable it to act quickly and seamlessly. It’s the equivalent of a local government or council being able to repair our roads, remove the trash and control traffic flows in real time. This generally happens today in real life without us knowing, until it stops working and we wonder what happened.</p>
<p>Automation and AI, powered by programmable software capabilities, hold the key to helping speed the delivery of network rollouts, making them more accessible and adaptive.</p>
<p>An adaptive virtual programmable network will be able to identify a fault and self-heal, without the need for a physical truck-roll. It can draw resources – compute, storage, bandwidth – from underutilized areas to ramp up other parts of the metaverse seeing increased activity, and revert automatically when required.</p>
<p>Over the next several years, we will hear a lot of talk about the metaverse, but any innovation in use cases will not happen without the required network innovations. An adaptive network that provides software-controlled, high-capacity, low-latency connectivity will be even more important of a foundation for the future metaverse than it is for today’s cloud apps.</p>
<p>The building blocks are already there for the artist formerly known as Facebook to build a hospitable metaverse, and as those technologies continue to evolve – driven by an expected uptick in innovation among tech developers looking to capitalize on the metaverse emergence – Meta will have more world-building tools to work with.</p>
<p>Simply put, it’s not easy to build a virtual universe, but it’s certainly something that we can bring closer to reality through proper network infrastructure investments and innovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like you, I check NFT marketplace volume a few times each day to keep tabs on the burgeoning market for buying and selling digital signatures on various blockchains that point to images and the like. We&#8217;re very cool.</p>
<p>Mostly, the data is steady. OpenSea <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/making-sense-of-opensea-at-a-13b-valuation/">volumes tend to lead the space</a>, with other, smaller NFT exchanges and some crypto games filling in the list. You can take a look at DappRadar&#8217;s NFT marketplace data set <a href="https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, a related list of numbers from NonFungible <a href="https://nonfungible.com/market/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and some great charted data from The Block <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/nft-non-fungible-tokens/marketplaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, if you want to dive in on your own.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But recently the data changed, and an NFT marketplace called <a href="https://looksrare.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LooksRare</a> shot up on the charts, quickly surpassing OpenSea&#8217;s results and taking the top slot among its competitors in volume terms.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220369 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Is OpenSea in trouble? Did LooksRare suddenly surge to the top of the charts thanks to a better model, price list or other business effort? Kinda, but it appears that there&#8217;s a lot of bullshit going down to make the numbers look better than they are. So let&#8217;s talk about incentives and governance tokens to parse out what&#8217;s up with LooksRare and the larger future of the financialization of everything.</p>
<h2>Incentives</h2>
<p>The data is pretty funny. In the last 24 hours, LooksRare has seen just under $290 million worth of NFT trades, per DappRadar data. OpenSea&#8217;s 24-hour tally is a more modest $131.6 million. Given how far ahead of OpenSea that single data point puts LooksRare, have we seen a new marketplace king crowned? No.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Friday episode, a run-down of key news headlines, startup funding rounds and whatever else is popping in the worlds of startups and tech. Happily this week, we did not talk about NFTs, and I don’t think that we even said “token” a single time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257776" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Instead, Mary Ann and Natasha and Alex got back to what we might consider the roots of Equity. Here’s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">We started with a look <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/fertilis-ivf-cell-culture-funding/">at the recent Fertilis round</a>. Fertilis is an Australian startup working to make the IVF process more reliable. We are big fans of the concept, though the startup has lots of work ahead of it before it moves the needle for couples hoping to conceive.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Mary Ann brought together two very Equity topics: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2257147">Fintech and SaaS</a>, but more interestingly, fintech that only wants to serve SaaS startups. Even though we tried to define Arc’s relationship with the startups it serves, Alex landed on it being a friends with benefits for the financial world.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Speaking of fintech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/brex-confirms-12-3b-valuation-hires-meta-exec-to-serve-as-its-chief-product-officer/">Brex made headlines</a> (again) with its new raise and new executive &#8212; thanks to Meta.</li>
<li aria-level="1">We keep returning to the hiring conversation, and that’s for good reason. Career Karma (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/career-karma-lands-40-million-to-evolve-into-a-edtech-employee-benefit/">news here</a>) and SeekOut (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/tiger-doubles-down-on-seekout-which-just-raised-115m-to-help-enterprises-hire-and-retain-talent/">news here</a>) have two different strategies when it comes to empowering employees at companies &#8212; and all of us agreed that retention, versus placement, is the future of hiring tech.</li>
<li aria-level="1">We ended with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/08/startup-accelerators-definition-of-value-add-is-due-for-a-refresh/">conversation on accelerators</a> thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/y-combinator-will-now-invest-500000-in-accelerator-companies/">Y Combinator’s news</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/has-y-combinators-new-deal-changed-the-early-stage-investing-game/">venture reaction thereof</a>. Plus, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/angellist-just-closed-a-25m-fund-to-back-startups-based-on-hiring-velocity/">new AngelList</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/dorm-room-fund-returns-to-campus-with-new-10-4-million-fund/">Dorm Room Fund</a> remind us that staying niche in strategy continues to be the way that early-stage venture operations are winning deals.</li>
</ul>
<p>A big hug to you all for surviving the start to the working year during a COVID surge. We can do this! We’ll get through it as a big team, OK?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bentley Motors stands bestride the old world and the modern era. For over a century, the automaker has been at the forefront of automotive luxury and performance, and while it has constantly adapted to change during the years, classic, tactile coachbuilding has always remained as its ethos.</p>
<p>This romantic view of automotive manufacturing seems almost at odds with our current level of technological advancement and the demands of the modern luxury consumer.</p>
<p>If Bentley has mastered anything, it&#8217;s rolling with the times while sticking to the classic hits. The best example of this is the 2022 Bentley Continental GT Speed, a powerful two-door grand tourer that&#8217;s simply unlike any other car on the road today.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257900" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The Bentley Continental GT is the two-door sibling to the four-door Bentley Continental Flying Spur sedan. Though they share many elements, the GT is much more than a halved version of the larger car, and distinguishes itself in design and performance, among other factors.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the GT is a 6.0-liter twin-turbo W12 engine, a massive power unit that is a unique outlier in this era of shrinking (or indeed vanishing) engines. This signature system produces 650 horsepower for the Speed, a 24 hp bump from the standard Conti GT W12. It doles out an impressive 664 pound-feet of torque and is sent through a dual-clutch eight-speed automatic gearbox.</p>
<p>Power is sent through all four wheels while an enhanced chassis system puts it all to use.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our chassis engineers have an incredible array of technology at their disposal, to give the car genuine duality in ride and handling, and controlled by the driver using Drive Dynamics Control,&#8221; Mike Sayer, head of Product Communications for Bentley Motors Ltd. told TechCrunch. &#8220;To enable the chassis to be varied, we utilize three-chamber air springs, which allow three distinct spring stiffnesses. In Sport mode, a single chamber in each air spring is utilized, providing a high spring stiffness. In Comfort, solenoid valves bring all three chambers into play, at a low pressure, providing a softer spring. To this we then add Bentley Dynamic Ride &#8212; our 48V electric anti-roll control.&#8221;</p>
<p>This iteration of the Speed brings some new tech to the GT for the first time, specifically an electronic rear differential and rear-wheel steering.</p>
<p>For the E-diff, this distributes torque across the rear angle to give it balance and control during turn-in when driving in a sporty manner. Rear-wheel steering was first applied to the Flying Spur to give the full-sized luxury four-door a tighter turning radius as well as enhanced stability at speed. On the GT Speed, it&#8217;s meant to give the two-door sharper turning and is far more active on this car than on the sedan.</p>
<p>All told, the more than 5,000-pound GT can sail at up to 208 mph, rocketing off the line to hit 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds, something cars without a cruise ship&#8217;s worth of luxury accouterments struggle to achieve.</p>
<h2>Bentley sprinkles in tech</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2257978" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-gear-shifter.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257978" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2257978 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-gear-shifter.jpg" alt="bentley-continental gt speed" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-gear-shifter.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-gear-shifter.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-gear-shifter.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-gear-shifter.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-gear-shifter.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-gear-shifter.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-gear-shifter.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2257978" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alex Kalogianni</p></div></p>
<p>Within the Continental GT Speed is a carefully crafted interior that has been a signature element of Bentley vehicles.</p>
<p>A substantial sum of the car&#8217;s assembly is by hand, and while there are some automated tasks, there are very few elements that don&#8217;t receive attention from a master craftsperson. The interior is replete with premium leather and real wood surfaces that range from burr walnut to rare, naturally felled redwood.</p>
<p>Seat elements and the steering wheel are all hand-stitched, and the hefty metal switches are scored with diamond-pattern knurling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The knurling that&#8217;s used on the main rotary controls took 18 months to develop, and involved the creation of an algorithm to accurately describe the way the facets of the knurling are angled,&#8221; added Sayer, highlighting the degree of focus given to every detail. This ornate, meticulously built interior is the setting for a high degree of modern technology, and yet it&#8217;s all very well integrated.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257981" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-console.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257981" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2257981" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-console.jpg?w=300" alt="bentley continental gt speed" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-console.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-console.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-console.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-console.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-console.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-console.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-console.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-console.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-console.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-console.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-console.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2257981" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alex Kalogianni</p></div></p>
<p>A 12.3-inch touchscreen can be found in the center of the dashboard, as a modern luxury car buyer would expect, and it performs the usual functions. It&#8217;s the source for navigation and entertainment, as well as the interface for several vehicle functions. Drivers can customize their preferred throttle and steering settings, raise the suspension for a few inches of extra clearance and access the full driver&#8217;s manual if need be.</p>
<p>This is paired with an all-digital gauge cluster that can also be customized to mirror much of the same information displayed on the touchscreen. There&#8217;s even a heat-based night vision option that highlights the area in front of the car for enhanced night driving. This system also has integrated pedestrian recognition, so any persons encountered in the night are highlighted by a red box.</p>
<p>The high-resolution screens feature graphics styled to mitigate their juxtaposition against all of the tangible craftsmanship.</p>
<p>&#8220;The design of the graphics of those gauges was subject to the same attention to detail as physical components,&#8221; said Sayer. &#8220;Beyond that, our ethos includes retaining physical, haptic buttons and rotary controls in lieu of multiple touchscreens.&#8221;</p>
<p>In case it&#8217;s still too much tech to tolerate, the screen tumbles away into the panel and is replaced with three analog gauges; a clock, compass and air temp monitor. A touch of in-car gadgetry theater? Perhaps, but another way of looking at it is future-proofing the interior of a vehicle in a way. Aesthetically speaking, the rest of the cabin will age far better than the display will, and having a method to tuck it out of sight fits the accommodating nature of this luxury grand tourer.</p>
<h2>The UX</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2257983" style="width: 5194px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257983" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2257983 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg" alt="bentley continental gt speed" width="5184" height="3456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg 5184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2257983" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alex Kalogianni</p></div></p>
<p>Seated at the wheel of the GT Speed can be a little dazzling at first due to the glitzy chrome and polished veneer, but it&#8217;s quick to demonstrate how driver focused it is from the moment of ignition.</p>
<p>Assists such as a head-up display and traffic sign recognition are on hand to improve situational awareness, and on long journeys, lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control relieve some of the burden. Convenient, though the GT Speed is most rewarding when fully engaged.</p>
<p>The W12 engine is blustery and sonorous when its note rumbles out the back of the exhaust. Stepping on the throttle feels and sounds like accelerating in the single-engined fighter planes that the GT Speed shares a lineage with. That&#8217;s as far as the similarities go because everything else beyond is far from antiquated. Power delivery is smooth yet forceful, and there&#8217;s quite a ways to go before experiencing any drop-off, though reaching that point requires a length of unrestricted highway.</p>
<p>In that regard, the GT Speed mirrors the Flying Spur in that it feels heavy and grounded like a steam locomotive, and when it&#8217;s time to take a sharp corner, this leads to a great degree of hesitation. Muster up some trust and bravery, though, and the GT Speed is surprisingly dynamic.</p>
<p>The car is at its best in those moments when a windy back road presents itself. Its size and weight are still palpable, but the active tech in play allow the Bentley to round corners with confidence. The enjoyment diminishes when things get increasingly challenging, however, and all the physics-warping engineering can&#8217;t disguise the car&#8217;s heft. It&#8217;s in those moments where you make a mental note to return with something smaller and more spry.</p>
<p>Regardless if it&#8217;s in sport or comfort, the speed at which the GT&#8217;s dual-clutch transmission fires through gears is near seamless, giving spirited drivers the power they need and cruising ones a touch more serenity. On the highway or as a daily driver, the GT Speed doesn&#8217;t put one foot wrong, making the more than $274,000 price tag feel worth it. One would hope, at least.</p>
<h2>Contenders</h2>
<p>From a competitor standpoint, the GT Speed does stand largely on its own, not because of a lack of sporty luxury coupes, but due to how uniquely it executes the same mission. Segment stalwarts BMW and Mercedes-Benz can&#8217;t rightly match the level of lavishness and exclusivity that the Bentley provides, so anything equally dynamic would still be lesser. In terms of handling and power, the AMG S63 Coupe comes close and at a relatively lower starting price ($173,100), but though it&#8217;s in the same weight class, the Continental GT Speed simply does it better.</p>
<p>For a true contender, its not-too-distant cousin, the Rolls-Royce Wraith is the closest match. Beyond its similarly stacked luxury pedigree and exclusivity, the Wraith sports its own whopper of a power unit, a 624-horsepower 6.6-liter V12. This two-door grand tourer has an equally staggering $300,000 price tag and can pull off similar tricks that the GT Speed can in terms of acceleration and cruising smoothness.</p>
<p>As with anything, the future is uncertain for how Bentley plans to continue this union of old and new. As the past has proven, it&#8217;s planning ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firstly, the product range will be hybridized &#8212; we&#8217;ve already launched hybrid versions of the Bentayga and Flying Spur, and the Continental family will follow. We&#8217;ll then launch the first Bentley BEV in 2025, ahead of Bentley being an electric-only brand by 2030,&#8221; Sayer stated.</p>
<p>For now, we still have the Bentley Continental GT Speed, a near-anachronistic luxury powerhouse that sets the standard in its segment while marching to the beat of its own thumping 12 cylinder engine. It&#8217;s the culmination of Bentley&#8217;s dogged adherence to sticking to what they do best while still being flexible enough to bend with the winds of change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) <a href="http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/press/message/single.htm%21id%3D10439388%40fsbMessage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Friday that it has raided and shut down the operations of the notorious REvil ransomware gang.</p>
<p>The unprecedented move — which will undoubtedly send a message to other ransomware groups operating out of the country — saw the Russian authorities conduct raids at 25 addresses across the Moscow, St. Petersburg and Lipetsk regions that belonged to 14 suspected members of REvil.</p>
<p>The gang, which shut down its operations in July before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/revil-ransomware-group-goes-dark-after-its-tor-sites-were-hijacked/">a failed comeback in September</a>, is believed to have orchestrated some of the most damaging attacks of the past 12 months, including those targeting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/colonial-pipeline/">Colonial Pipeline</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jbs-paid-11-million-to-resolve-ransomware-attack-11623280781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JBS Foods</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">U.S. technology firm Kaseya</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257964" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The FSB said it seized more than 426 million rubles and €500,000 (about $6 million), as well as $600,000 in cash, and cryptocurrency wallets, computers and 20 high-end cars.</p>
<p>In a statement, the FSB said it conducted the search operation at the request of U.S. authorities, which were notified of their results.</p>
<p>The detained members of the ransomware gang were charged under Russian law for the alleged &#8220;illegal circulation of means of payment.&#8221; Russian authorities have not released the names of any of the suspects.</p>
<p>“As a result of joint actions of the FSB and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, the organized criminal community ceased to exist, the information infrastructure used for criminal purposes was neutralized,” the FSB said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>News of the FSB&#8217;s surprise operation comes just two months after the U.S. Department of Justice charged a 22-year-old Ukrainian citizen linked to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/revil-ransomware-group-goes-dark-after-its-tor-sites-were-hijacked/">REvil ransomware</a> gang for orchestrating the July ransomware attack against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">U.S. technology firm Kaseya</a>. Seven other REvil gang members were also arrested throughout 2021 following operations coordinated by Europol. In July, President Biden urged Russia to follow suit, pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin to take action to disrupt these criminal gangs.</p>
<p>The action taken by the FSB also comes just hours after a major cyberattack took down government websites in Ukraine on Friday, including websites for the foreign ministry, national security and defense council and the government&#8217;s cabinet of ministers. Officials said it was too early to draw any conclusions but they pointed to a “long record” of Russian cyber assaults against Ukraine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo Via, the autonomous vehicle company&#8217;s trucking and cargo transportation unit, is expanding its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/waymo-and-jb-hunt-partner-to-bring-autonomous-trucks-to-texas-in-new-pilot/">existing partnership with logistics company J.B. Hunt Transport Services</a> from a pilot into a long-term strategic alliance.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, J.B. Hunt will be Waymo Via&#8217;s first launch customer for fully autonomous, driverless freight routes, which Waymo expects to reach within the next few years.</p>
<p>Waymo and J.B. Hunt began a &#8220;test run&#8221; in 2021 along I-45 between Houston and Fort Worth, Texas, one of the country&#8217;s busiest trade corridors. Waymo&#8217;s Daimler trucks, powered by the Waymo Driver autonomous platform, delivered 862,179 pounds of freight by the end of the pilot, with no crashes or speeding events, 100% on-time pickup and delivery and 100% freight intact, <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/12/what-we-learned-from-our-initial-trial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the company</a>. Each of the runs were completed with a commercially licensed truck driver and a software technician onboard to monitor operations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257867" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“Our pilot last year with Waymo Via really helped us get a hands-on understanding of how autonomous driving technology could be implemented within our operations,” said Craig Harper, chief sustainability officer and executive vice president at J.B. Hunt, in a statement. “This strategic alliance will continue that momentum and further explore the intricate details that would make this a value-driven solution for customers.”</span></p>

<p>In 2022 and beyond, the companies intend to launch several more pilots along the same corridor in Texas to prepare for driverless autonomous operations.</p>
<p>Waymo did not share what specific goals it hopes to achieve for its next pilot with J.B. Hunt, other than to firm up the company&#8217;s driver-as-a-service model, which involves Waymo partnering with an OEM like Daimler to build autonomous trucks equipped with the Waymo Driver. Those trucks will be purchased directly from fleets or carriers, like J.B. Hunt and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ryder-to-build-logistics-network-with-autonomous-trucking-company-embark/"> serviced by partners like Ryder</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the long-term vision,&#8221; Julianne McGoldrick, a Waymo spokesperson, told TechCrunch. &#8220;In the interim as we scale up to that vision, we have our test fleet of trucks, and the pilots that we&#8217;ll do with those and with our autonomous specialists are really to gain that operational practice so that when we do reach fully autonomous operations, we have all the foundations in place to haul freight with no human driver for J.B. Hunt and customers like them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the course of the Waymo-J.B. Hunt partnership, the two companies also plan to conduct joint operational and market studies to learn more about their collective progress using self-driving trucks, as well as explore a technology integration with J.B. Hunt 360, the company&#8217;s digital freight matching platform.</p>
<p>Of course, Waymo isn&#8217;t the only self-driving truck on the roads in Texas, or elsewhere. <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">One of Waymo Via&#8217;s competitors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tusimple-completes-its-first-driverless-autonomous-truck-run-on-public-roads/">TuSimple, recently completed its first driverless autonomous trucking run, </a>which effectively puts its tech at a more progressive milestone. Aurora and Kodiak Robotics are also testing and carrying freight in Texas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"> That doesn&#8217;t worry Waymo &#8212; the Alphabet-owned strategy is linked more tightly with its partners than with ticking off autonomous boxes, McGoldrick says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I think what we&#8217;ve seen is a lot of partnerships or collaborations in the industry have been primarily centered around one-off trial runs or one-off pilots, and there hasn&#8217;t been much meat to them,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re entering this multi-year deal with multiple components that really cover everything and show that we&#8217;re going really deep with our partners, as opposed to just doing a pilot for pilot&#8217;s sake. We&#8217;re really crafting what our fully autonomous launch will look like together with our partners so that it&#8217;s as successful as possible when we&#8217;re ready.&#8221;  </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Brands can collect customer data from dozens of touch points, analyze it and make smarter decisions about how to market their products.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.daasity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daasity</a>, an e-commerce analytics and data company, secured $15 million in Series A funding as it continues developing its approach to helping consumer brands better leverage their customer data to make smarter decisions.</p>
<p>VMG Catalyst led the oversubscribed round and was joined by existing investors Cove Fund, Exeter Capital, 1855 Capital, Mooring Ventures, Okapi Venture Capital and Serra Ventures. This gives the company $20.7 million in total funding to date, CEO Dan LeBlanc told TechCrunch via email.</p>
<p>The company’s technology enables brands to pull in all of their data from different places, like Shopify, Amazon, Facebook and Klaviyo, analyze it and push it to marketing channels to optimize customer experiences based on insights from a historical performance.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257694" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“There have never been more consumer product brands, and competition among them is at an all-time high,” LeBlanc said. “Brands win by having access to the right data, which leads to faster and more confident decision-making. Data demands have never been higher, and we are investing in the data infrastructure to get brands the access to the data they need.”</p>
<p>Daasity is working with more than 1,600 brands, including Manscaped, Vuori and Caraway Home, and in the past year grew its annual recurring revenue by 300%, while also growing its headcount by 100%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will enable further employee growth, with LeBlanc expecting to grow another 160% by the end of 2022. The company is also investing in technology development for better data accessibility, data sources and educational resources for better insight into results. It will also be working on more personalized customer data.</p>
<p>Next up, the company will be heads down in making brands’ data infrastructure modular by allowing the ability to configure components of their data infrastructure — as easily as they select food from a menu, LeBlanc said. It is also adding 35 integrations, like data sources, warehousing options, transformation capabilities and visualization tools.</p>
<p>Brooke Kiley, partner at VMG Catalyst, said in a written statement that the firm was “thrilled to continue our partnership with Dan and the Daasity team as they enter their next phase of growth. We consistently see how difficult it is for brands to act on their data, yet there is a greater need than ever. It is vital to utilize data to succeed in today’s competitive e-commerce environment. Daasity makes data accessible to all brands, empowering them with actionable insights and the ability to enrich their marketing channels with essential customer data.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous driving startups in China are in an arms race to put passengers in their machine-driven vehicles. Every few weeks, news arrives that another major player has gotten the green light to launch a new pilot program or a small-scale service.</p>
<p>These press releases, often dotted with regulatory jargon and flowery language to aggrandize the companies&#8217; progress, can be confusing. That’s why we put together this post summarizing the progress of China’s major robotaxi operators &#8212; <strong>AutoX, Baidu, Deeproute.ai, Didi, Momenta, Pony.ai and WeRide</strong> &#8212; in 2021 while trying to parse what their announcements actually mean.</p>
<p>Most of the major players have been testing drivered (autonomous vehicles with in-car safety operators) and driverless vehicles for some time in China, so this post will focus on their public-facing services that run on a regular basis. While navigating the costs, safety and regulations around robotaxis, these companies have also dabbled in areas that are quicker to scale, such as self-driving trucks, goods-hauling vans and city buses, though robotaxis remain their focus in the long run.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245276" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>A few things to note about China’s autonomous driving space</h2>
<p>Before we dive in, it&#8217;s worth highlighting a few circumstances unique to China&#8217;s autonomous vehicle sector.</p>
<ol>
<li>Road conditions in the country can vary greatly. An autonomous driving test that takes place in an industrial park in suburban Shenzhen, for instance, will encounter much simpler traffic than one that runs in a meandering urban village downtown.</li>
<li>Regulations on autonomous vehicles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/the-rise-of-robotaxis-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can differ across provinces</a> &#8212; and even different districts within the same city. A company that obtains approval to run a fully driverless test in one city isn&#8217;t necessarily more technologically advanced than its peers; it could simply mean it&#8217;s cozy with a local regulator with a progressive attitude toward self-driving.</li>
<li>Some regional governments are targeting smart transportation as their growth strategy. Naturally, they are keen to support autonomous vehicle startups. Authorities may give an informal nod to unmanned driving tests in their jurisdictions well before national or city-level regulations are rubberstamped.</li>
<li>Government support can also manifest in ways like tax breaks, access to favorable land use and cheap office space. That&#8217;s in part why China&#8217;s major autonomous vehicle startups are concentrated in well-resourced cities like Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Suzhou.</li>
<li>Local governments in China often set up pilot zones to spur the development of emerging technologies, like self-driving. Such initiatives allow companies to experiment without the usual regulatory constraints that rein in the more mature industries.</li>
<li>As of today, no city in China has issued a permit for driverless robotaxis, which would allow an autonomous car to transport the public without a safety operator as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/cruise-waymo-get-ok-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waymo and Cruise</a> can in San Francisco. A few cities have granted permits for fully driverless tests on public roads.</li>
</ol>
<h2>AutoX</h2>
<p>Headquartered in Shenzhen with an R&amp;D center in California, AutoX was founded in 2016 by former Princeton professor Jianxiong Xiao. Its investors include Alibaba, MediaTek and Chinese state-owned carmaker SAIC Auto.</p>

<p><strong>Operations</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.autox.ai/blog/20200817.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In August 2020</a>, AutoX began offering drivered robotaxi rides to the public in Shanghai&#8217;s Jiading. Users can book trips through Alibaba&#8217;s Amap navigation map, which AutoX said was the &#8220;first time&#8221; a robotaxi service had become available on a major Chinese ride-hailing platform.</p>
<p>Jiading, a suburban district of Shanghai, has attracted<a href="https://www.shanghai.gov.cn/nw48088/20201127/c6a4f12a69e943ebb169a44f5e01ee4a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a clutch of major automakers and OEMs</a> like SAIC Auto, Volkswagon, NIO, Toyota, Baidu, Didi and Delphi to set up offices. AutoX <a href="https://www.autox.ai/blog/20200410.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in 2020</a> that it had struck a deal with the Shanghai government to put 100 &#8220;self-driving vehicles&#8221; on the city&#8217;s public roads.</p>
<p>In January 2021, AutoX <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/c1n91evDCjk0su1MisDgaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolled out</a> a driverless robotaxi service in Shenzhen&#8217;s Pingshan, an industrial district that is refashioning itself as a &#8220;<a href="http://www.sz.gov.cn/szhlwzwfw/szhlwzwfw/cgzs/content/post_1419942.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smart city</a>.&#8221; In November, AutoX <a href="http://www.szpsq.gov.cn/english/News/Photos/content/post_9377658.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the program had covered the entire 168 square kilometers of Pingshan, which is nearly three times Manhattan&#8217;s size.</p>
<p>Just a month before, AutoX <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/autox-removes-safety-drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put a fleet of 25 unmanned autonomous vehicles</a> on the public roads of Shenzhen in a &#8220;test&#8221;. A Chinese auto news blog <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_z5BfvBp5ExIqzDyoSNjPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the startup went ahead without a license from the local transportation regulator, though AutoX told TechCrunch that it had obtained &#8220;government support.&#8221; We were unable to reach the relevant department at the time.</p>
<p>Altogether, AutoX said it has &#8220;several hundred&#8221; robotaxis on the road.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. tests </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As of November 2021</a>, AutoX held the testing permits for both drivered and driverless testing in California.</p>
<p><strong>OEM partners </strong></p>
<p>AutoX has been working with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOuF7PNo1k&amp;ab_channel=AutoX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honda</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/autox-and-fiat-chrysler-are-teaming-up-on-a-robotaxi-for-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Fiat Chrysler</a> to develop robotaxis in China.</p>
<h2><strong>Baidu Apollo Go</strong></h2>
<p>Apollo Go is the autonomous driving front of search engine titan Baidu, the Beijing-based internet firm founded in 2000. Baidu kickstarted its autonomous driving unit in <a href="https://tech.qq.com/a/20151214/045792.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late 2015</a>, around the same time most of its startup competitors were born.</p>

<p><strong>Operations</strong></p>
<p>In November 2021, Apollo Go was authorized to provide paid robotaxi service in China’s &#8220;<a href="http://kw.beijing.gov.cn/art/2021/11/26/art_1134_620476.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-ever demo zone for commercial autonomous driving</a>&#8221; in Beijing.</p>
<p>The fleet of 67 vehicles, monitored by in-car safety drivers, was Apollo Go&#8217;s &#8220;first commercial deployment&#8221; on open roads. The service was available for hailing via Apollo Go&#8217;s app and ran every day from 7 am to 10 pm.</p>
<p>Apollo Go got to partake in China&#8217;s &#8220;first commercial robotaxi demo zone,&#8221; though it wasn&#8217;t the first to offer rides for compensations (spoiler: see WeRide&#8217;s section below). But the event carried much symbolic weight. The pilot area, spanning 60 square kilometers, sits inside the Beijing Economic and Technological Development Zone, a state-level economic project in suburban Yizhuang. It introduced a regulatory framework to stipulate how robotaxi operators could utilize passenger data and price their services. Developments in the capital city could become a model for the rest of China.</p>
<p>Yizhuang isn&#8217;t only promoting robotaxis; other types of autonomous vehicles are also welcome in its broader &#8220;<a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-04/14/c_139880097.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connected vehicles demo zone</a>.&#8221; A number of tech giants, including JD.com and Meituan, started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/meituan-jd-com-and-neolix-begin-autonomous-deliveries-in-beijing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing unmanned delivery minivans there</a> last year.</p>
<p>The free version of Apollo Go is available to the public in certain areas of Guangzhou, Changsha and Cangzhou, and is currently <a href="https://apollo.auto/robotaxi/index_cn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting early testers in Shanghai</a>.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. tests</strong></p>

<h2>Deeproute.ai</h2>
<p>Shenzhen-based Deeproute has made considerable progress for a company that&#8217;s merely two years old. In 2019, Zhou Guang founded Deeproute after he left his last autonomous driving venture Roadstar.ai amid company infighting. The young entrepreneur quickly garnered support for his new endeavor. Last September, Deeproute <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/deeproute-l4-10000-usd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a whopping $300 million in a Series B round</a> from investors including Alibaba and Chinese automaker Geely.</p>

<p><strong>Operations</strong></p>
<p>In July, Deeproute deployed 20 drivered robotaxis on the public roads in<a href="https://www.deeproute.ai/en/news/detail.php?id=4&amp;bid=41&amp;cid=273" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Shenzhen&#8217;s downtown Futian district</a>, which is close to its headquarters in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/harry-shum-microsoft-digital-finance-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tech collaboration zone</a> established by the governments of Hong Kong and Shenzhen.</p>
<p>The robotaxi service, which launched after the company obtained a <a href="https://www.163.com/dy/article/G89JVPN3055004XG.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permit</a> from Shenzhen&#8217;s transport regulator in April, is still free to the public, with plans to charge passengers in the future, the company told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4caLBGn9Jvw&amp;ab_channel=DeepRoute" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last March</a>, Deeproute&#8217;s robotaxi fleets, co-developed with state-owned Dongfeng Motor, began offering free rides to the public in Wuhan. The city in central China is another contender racing to <a href="http://en.whkfq.gov.cn/2021-06/10/c_632046.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become a pioneer in China&#8217;s autonomous driving field</a>.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. tests</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As of November 2021</a>, Deeproute held the testing permit for drivered autonomous vehicle testing in California.</p>
<p><strong>OEM partners</strong></p>
<p>The startup and Dongfeng have plans to deploy <a href="https://www.deeproute.ai/news/detail252.html">no fewer than 200 robotaxis</a> by 2022.</p>
<h2>Didi</h2>
<p>The ride-hailing giant has been quieter than expected about its robotaxi ambitions, given it carved out an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/04/didi-chuxings-autonomous-driving-unit-is-now-an-indepedent-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> autonomous driving subsidiary</a> in 2019 and quickly raised a $500 million round for the new entity &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/softbank-pours-500m-into-didi-in-chinas-biggest-autonomous-driving-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the single largest funding round in the industry</a> at the time.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if Didi has been distracted by other concerns. Shortly following its U.S. public listing last year, the firm was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/china-roundup-data-security-clampdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit with a data probe</a> by Chinese regulators. In December, the Chinese ride hailing giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/chinas-ride-hailing-giant-is-delisting-from-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it would delist from the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

<p><strong>Operations</strong></p>
<p>Didi&#8217;s robotaxi service began picking up passengers in some areas of Shanghai <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnYXiRbxMus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in June 2020</a>. The company <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autonomous-didi-idUSKBN23U1U4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it would expand its robotaxi service to Beijing and Shenzhen by the end of 2020 before replicating the scheme outside China in 2021. It has yet to update its progress. The company also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autonomous-didi-idUSKBN23U1U4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set an ambitious goal</a> to operate more than one million &#8220;self-driving cars&#8221; through its ride hailing platform by 2030.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. tests</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As of November 2021</a>, Didi held the testing permit for drivered autonomous vehicle testing in California.</p>
<p><strong>OEM partners</strong></p>
<p>In April 2021, Didi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/didi-volvo-autonomous-driving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Geely-owned Volvo would be supplying its global robotaxi fleets.</p>
<h2>Momenta</h2>
<p>Unlike most other robotaxi operators, which focus on Level 4 fully autonomous driving tech, five-year-old Momenta is also touting advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to automakers. This approach helps rake in short-term income but is questioned by industry observers as to whether the startup is devoting enough resources to real driverless tech.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257246" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257246" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2257246" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257246" class="wp-caption-text">Robotaxis co-developed by Momenta and SAIC Motor / Photo: Momenta (2021)</p></div></p>
<p>Nonetheless, Suzhou-based Momenta has become one of the most funded autonomous vehicle startups in China. It has raised $2 billion from a group of high-profile investors, from General Motors, Daimler, Bosch, Toyota, Chinese state-owned automaker SAIC to Nio Capital, a fund overseen by Nio&#8217;s founder William Li.</p>
<p>Unlike most of its peers that have set up R&amp;D forces or are testing in the U.S., <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/momenta-500-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Momenta picked Germany</a> as its launch pad for international expansion. In 2021, it opened an office in Stuttgart, the backyard of its investor Daimler.</p>
<p><strong>Operations</strong></p>
<p>In December 2021, Momenta and SAIC <a href="https://www.saicmotor.com/chinese/xwzx/xwk/2021/56470.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched a free robotaxi service in certain parts of Shanghai</a>. Users could summon these drivered vehicles via SAIC&#8217;s app from 8 am to 10 pm every day. The program was &#8220;testing and validating potential commercial applications with 20 vehicles,&#8221; said Momenta. The program had plans to roll out in Suzhou and Shenzhen in the upcoming months.</p>
<p>The company has won substantial support from the government of Suzhou, an affluent city adjacent to Shanghai. It has a joint venture with the Suzhou branch of the state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) to &#8220;scale up&#8221; robotaxi deployment in the city. SASAC is a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/xi-jinpings-ambitious-agenda-economic-reform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powerful government body</a> in China that has <a href="https://www.thewirechina.com/2021/02/07/the-long-arm-of-sasac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oversight of 100 or so large state-owned enterprises</a>.</p>
<p><strong>OEM partners</strong></p>
<p>Momenta has been working with SAIC on its robotaxi fleets. The partners <a href="https://www.saicmotor.com/chinese/xwzx/xwk/2021/56470.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aimed</a> to deploy 200 vehicles across China by 2022.</p>
<h2>Pony.ai</h2>
<p>Pony was founded in 2016 by two veterans of Baidu&#8217;s autonomous vehicle arm, a team that had spawned some of China&#8217;s most reputable AV experts. The company, with offices in Guangzhou and California, has raised over $1 billion to date, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-pony-ai-hits-5-3-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with backing from Toyota</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257254" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257254" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2257254" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/55351642042261_.pic_.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/55351642042261_.pic_.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/55351642042261_.pic_.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/55351642042261_.pic_.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/55351642042261_.pic_.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/55351642042261_.pic_.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/55351642042261_.pic_.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257254" class="wp-caption-text">Pony&#8217;s Lexus robotaxi in Shanghai / Photo: Pony.ai (2021)</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Operations</strong></p>
<p>Aside from Baidu, Pony <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211129005790/en/Pony.ai-Receives-Approval-for-Paid-Autonomous-Robotaxi-Services-in-Beijing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also obtained approval</a> to operate paid robotaxi services in Beijing&#8217;s smart vehicle demo zone last November. The service, called PonyPilot+, had been ferrying passengers for free in the same area.</p>
<p><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8L88zlA4uinBihnTnBeCNg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last July</a>, PonyPilot+ debuted in Jiading, Shanghai&#8217;s automotive hub. In June, Pony<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/G810Pk0MHI4wjB1beQEkWg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> added fully driverless cars</a> to its existing robotaxi fleet in Guangzhou.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. tests</strong></p>
<p>In November, the California Department of Motor Vehicles notified Pony that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/pony-ai-suspension-driverless-pilot-california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it was suspending its driverless testing permit</a> following a reported collision in Fremont. The decision came six months after Pony <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/chinese-startup-pony-ai-can-now-test-driverless-vehicles-in-three-california-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obtained the regulatory green light</a>. The company&#8217;s drivered testing permit in California wasn&#8217;t affected.</p>
<p><strong>OEM partners</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pony.ai/tech?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiple manufacturers</a> have supplied Pony&#8217;s robotaxis, including Toyota&#8217;s Lexus, Hyundai, as well as China&#8217;s BYD and Aion.</p>
<h2>WeRide.ai</h2>
<p>WeRide and Pony share many roots. Both have bases in Guangzhou and California, with founders who hailed from Baidu&#8217;s autonomous driving team. Founded in 2017, WeRide raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/weride-310-million-series-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $600 million</a> just within 2021. Its investors include state-owned GAC and Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257259" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257259" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2257259" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/weride-robotaxi.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/weride-robotaxi.jpeg 1290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/weride-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/weride-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/weride-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/weride-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/weride-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257259" class="wp-caption-text">WeRide&#8217;s robotaxi fleet supplied by Dongfeng / Photo: WeRide (2021)</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Operations</strong></p>
<p>In November 2019, WeRide&#8217;s drivered robotaxis began ferrying the public in a 144-square-kilometer area of Guangzhou. The service was a<a href="https://www.weride.ai/en/robo-taxi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> collaboration with the government-owned Baiyun Taxi Group</a>, the largest taxi company in South China.</p>
<p>WeRide was able to charge passengers at Guangzhou&#8217;s taxi rate from the outset, which predated the paid services of Baidu and Pony in Beijing.</p>
<p>This is a familiar scenario where competitors clamor to label their programs the &#8220;first&#8221; in China. The claims are valid in their own right but deserve closer discernment. As an industry insider said, &#8220;Beijing is more influential as a policy bellwether;&#8221; but to businesses, the difference between running a paid robotaxi service in Beijing and Guangzhou &#8220;isn&#8217;t that big.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s Beijing or Guangzhou, as long as the city has friendly policies, that&#8217;s good news. After all, robotaxi companies just want to test their operations,&#8221; the person said.</p>
<p>WeRide also operates a drivered robotaxi service in Wuhan.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. tests</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As of November 2021</a>, WeRide held the testing permits for both drivered and driverless testing in California.</p>
<p><strong>OEM partners</strong></p>
<p>WeRide and its strategic investor GAC <a href="https://www.weride.ai/en/gac_investment-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in December that they planned to build a fleet of &#8220;tens of thousands of&#8221; robotaxis in the coming years.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This newest raise comes just three months after Bolt took in a sizable $393 million in Series D funding.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Checkout technology company <a href="https://www.bolt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt</a> continues to make quick work of attracting new capital. The company announced Friday $355 million in Series E financing to give Bolt an $11 billion valuation, according to sources close to the company.</p>
<p>Bolt’s one-click checkout product aims to give businesses the same technology Amazon has been known for since 1997, and at the same time, incorporates payments and fraud services meant to ensure transactions are real and payments can be accepted. In addition, shoppers can create an account once and then use those credentials across a network of hundreds of Bolt network brands.</p>
<p>This newest raise comes just three months after Bolt took in a sizable <a href="https://www.bolt.com/blog/bolt-series-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$393 million in Series D funding</a>. Including the Series E, Bolt’s total funding to date is nearly $1 billion. The company’s valuation is nearly double what it was at the Series D, Ryan Breslow, founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257873" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In discussing Bolt’s rise to total funding near the $1 billion mark, Breslow explained that the company operates in a space with competitors that are actually worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Depending on the source, that’s companies like Stripe, Shopify and Checkout.com.</p>
<p>“It may seem like a lot of money raised, but actually no, this is capital for us to be competitive,” he added. “We don’t just want to be on par with competitors, but be better. The capital will enable us to bring in the best talent, make strategic acquisitions and expand into Europe, which is important to us.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the international front, the company got a head start there in November after <a href="https://www.bolt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">securing agreements with both Benefit Cosmetics and PrestaShop</a>, and when Bolt made its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/bolt-acquisition-tipser-remote-checkout/">first-ever acquisition (of Tipser</a>, a Swedish-based technology company enabling direct checkout on any digital surface).</p>
<p>“We saw how significant Tipser could be for Bolt,” Breslow said at the time. “They had been perfecting their embedded commerce technology for a decade and were the only formidable player. They were stronger than us in areas where we were weaker. It is very strategic to have them on our team.”</p>
<p>Two months later, he says the integration of Bolt’s native checkout and shopper experience with Tipser’s embedded commerce technology continues and that, together, they are already signing up some big customers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock led the Series E investment, with new investors Schonfeld, Invus Opportunities, CreditEase and H.I.G. Growth joining existing investors Activant Capital and Moore Strategic Ventures.</p>

<p>Ben Tsai, partner at Invus Opportunities, said via email that the e-commerce landscape provides “a huge opportunity to improve the online checkout experience, and retailers are realizing that they are losing customers as a result.”</p>
<p>“Bolt has a growing network of millions of shoppers who benefit from the ease of one-click checkout across Bolt’s expanding network of retailers,” he added. “We’re pleased to support Ryan and the ambitious Bolt team and see tremendous opportunity in the space that Bolt is disrupting.”</p>
<p>Over the past year, Bolt grew its gross merchandise value per merchant by 80% and saw increased accounts by 180% over 2020, while transactions grew 200% year over year. The company also says 100 million shoppers are poised to join the Bolt network over the next 18 months.</p>
<p>Finally, after launching Conscious Culture, a playbook aimed at helping businesses create people-first work cultures, last May, it now counts nearly 80 companies and hundreds of customers in the collective.</p>
<p>Bolt currently has more than 550 employees working remotely across over 200 cities. In addition to talent, acquisitions and international expansion, the new funding will also accelerate Bolt’s goals of putting out a flurry of new products this year.</p>

<p>Within the pipeline are key investments into areas like social commerce, where native embedded commerce will be able to go on any channel: websites, chat bots, in-venue, video streams, games, you name it. Breslow expects this move will put Bolt’s checkout capabilities everywhere. Funding will also be pumped into expansion of consumer products to help shoppers shop more efficiently across Bolt’s network.</p>
<p>Going forward, Breslow sees Bolt unbundling the “Amazon gold standard” buying experience as it launches new products so that any business can not only have the one-click checkout, but also the seamless order tracking, fast returns, fast shipping and membership benefits — all technologies that gave Amazon an early advantage.</p>
<p>When asked if becoming a public company was near, Breslow said that it was not in the immediate horizon nor the end goal.</p>
<p>“We have one goal, and that is to build the greatest company ever,” he added.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“From 2020 to 2021, the number of North Korean-linked hacks jumped from four to seven, and the value extracted from these hacks grew by 40%,” the report said.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The attacks primarily targeted investment firms and centralized exchanges. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257942" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The report stated that the hackers siphoned the funds from the organizations’ internet-connected “hot wallets” into DPRK-controlled addresses by using complex tactics, including phishing lures, code exploits, malware and advanced social engineering.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Once North Korea gained custody of the funds, they began a careful laundering process to cover up and cash out,” the report said.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In 2021, Ethereum and Bitcoin accounted for 58% and 20% of the funds, respectively; 22% came from ERC-20 tokens or altcoins. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The report also said, citing </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2019_171.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the United Nations Security Council</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, North Korea used the money by hacks to support its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile-related programs. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As per the analysis report, the Lazarus Group &#8212; a hacking group that is part of North Korea’s primary intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau &#8212; is suspected of carrying out the attacks. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Lazarus Group has previously been accused of the cyberattack on </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sony Pictures </span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Entertainment</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">WannaCry</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">More than 65% of North Korea&#8217;s stolen funds were laundered through mixers &#8212; software tools that pool and scramble digital assets from thousands of addresses. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">North Korea also owns unlaundered crypto funds, which are believed to be worth $170 million, from 49 separate hacks spanning from 2017 to 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“It’s unclear why the hackers would still be sitting on these funds, but it could be that they are hoping law enforcement interest in the cases will die down, so they can cash out without being watched. Whatever the reason may be, the length of time that DPRK is willing to hold on to these funds is illuminating, because it suggests a careful plan, not a desperate and hasty one,” the report said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">FinDev Canada has injected $13 million into Energy Entrepreneurs Growth Fund (<a href="https://shellfoundation.org/focus-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EEGF</a>), which invests in early and growth-stage energy startups in sub-Saharan Africa. Part of the funding will go toward increasing access to clean energy for off-grid households and businesses in the region.</p>
<p>The $120 million EEGF, which was founded in 2019 by the Shell Foundation &#8212; and co-funded by UKaid and the Dutch Entrepreneurial Development Bank FMO, extends financing in the form of debt (catalytic or mezzanine) or equity to businesses in the energy sector. The EEGF is managed by Triple Jump; an impact investment manager and advised by Persistent; and a climate venture builder.</p>
<p>FinDev Canada participated in fundraising through 2X Canada, an impact investment facility driving the economic empowerment of low-income and underserved populations in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257929" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>FinDev Canada vice president and chief investment officer Paulo Martelli said in a <a href="https://www.findevcanada.ca/en/news/findev-canada-and-its-2x-canada-facility-invest-energy-entrepreneurs-growth-fund-contribute" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> the funding will help accelerate innovation in the clean energy industry after the Covid-19 slow-down.</p>
<p>“The pandemic has slowed down electrification in Africa, which was already behind before the health crisis. By increasing EEGF’s capacity to invest in this sector, FinDev Canada and its 2X Canada facility support energy companies committed to expanding access to clean and reliable energy for African households and businesses, leading to inclusive and sustainable growth and the improvement of millions of lives,” he said.</p>
<p>The fund invests in at least half of companies that explicitly address the energy needs of women consumers and entrepreneurs in Africa, and those offering renewable energy solutions to businesses and households. It is estimated that<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2021/06/18/figure-of-the-week-increasing-access-to-electricity-in-sub-saharan-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 75% of the world’s population</a> without access to electricity and renewable energy solutions could be taken up to bridge that gap.</p>
<p>“A just and inclusive energy transition, one that alleviates energy poverty and mitigates climate change, requires an understanding of the financing needs of entrepreneurs, who we are depending on to deliver the world’s energy access goals,” said Shell Foundation’s operations director, Gareth Zahir-Bill.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“FinDev Canada’s investment into the fund will help it expand its provision of flexible financing solutions for entrepreneurs, accelerating access to clean and reliable energy for millions of lives in Africa.”</p>
<p>Last year the EEGF invested in Baobab+ and Yellow, both offering pay-to-own solar energy solutions, and Redavia, which designs and installs mobile solar farms for businesses.</p>
<p>Redavia, which has clients in Ghana, Kenya and Tanzania, received $3.7 million mezzanine investment from the fund. The startup targets to install more than 85 MWp of solar power across the continent. By September last year it had installed “close to 90 solar units, for 7 MWp of solar capacity.”</p>
<p>Yellow, which has operations in Malawi and Uganda and allows households and small businesses to pay for solar systems through installments, received $4 million, while Baobab+ got $2.3 million. Baobab+ has operations in Mali, Senegal, Madagascar and Côte d’Ivoire, and is planning to enter Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A congruence of factors in India — notably, climate change policies, fuel costs and skyrocketing demand for e-commerce — has set up ideal conditions for startups like all-electric commercial vehicle startup EVage.</p>
<p>The startup already has five EV trucks on the road for a range of e-commerce customers, including Amazon India&#8217;s Delivery Service Partner, with plans to provide &#8220;in the thousands&#8221; more to Amazon by the end of the year, according to one investor. EVage just raised a $28 million seed round, led by new U.S.-based VC RedBlue Capital, and will use the funds to complete its production-ready factory outside of Delhi in the first quarter of 2022 and scale up production to meet growing demand.</p>
<p>EVage&#8217;s flagship vehicle is a one-tonne (2,000 pound) truck that was designed for India&#8217;s commercial delivery market using feedback from its partnership with Amazon. The truck is developed on EVage&#8217;s industry-ready EV platform that the company says allows it to build multiple different types of high-quality vehicle at a far lower cost than other OEMs. The startup plans to manufacture vehicles in &#8220;Modular Micro Manufacturing&#8221; factories, similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/arrival-to-open-a-second-us-microfactory-to-build-electric-vans-for-ups/">Arrival&#8217;s microfactories</a>, which should have smaller carbon footprints and require less capital to produce vehicles than traditional OEMs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257872" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The upshot: EVage aims to pass on those savings to customers.</p>
<p>Finding a way to make production cheaper is vital for scaling, and the opportunity and demand for scaling EVs in India is massive.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s Transport Minister, Nitin Gadkari, whom Olaf Sakkers, general partner at RedBlue Capital and future EVage board member, says has had a high-level hand in the announcement of EVage&#8217;s deal with Amazon, has set a target for the country to have 30% private cars, 40% buses, 80% two and three-wheelers and 70% commercial vehicles electric by 2030.</p>
<p>A series of incentives like the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &amp;) Electric Vehicles schemes (<a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/govt-extends-fame-scheme-to-promote-electric-mobility-till-2024-11624688932461.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAME-I and FAME-II)</a> help by providing subsidies to electric two-wheelers and commercial or transit-related four-wheelers. FAME-II subsidies only apply if OEMs source 50% of components from local manufacturers, which helps boost the supply side, as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Two and three-wheelers are already well on their way to that target, particularly so with companies like Ola Electric setting up a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/ola-electric-raises-200-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">massive factory for e-scooters</a> and Hero MotorCorp, one of the country&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/gogoro-partners-with-indias-hero-motocorp-one-of-the-worlds-largest-two-wheel-vehicle-makers/">largest micro-EV manufacturers</a>, penning a deal with Taiwanese battery swapping company Gogoro to build a battery swapping network in India. Four-wheelers are a bit slower to market, in part because the average commuter isn&#8217;t buying electric cars. The path to electric four-wheeler adoption, therefore, is more likely to occur through commercial roads, Sakkers said.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s e-commerce market is exploding, especially as global companies increase their presence in the country and the mobile-first nation full of smartphone users gets extra comfortable with easy digital transactions. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">Amazon has invested $6.5 billion</a> in India since it entered the country in 2013, and Walmart entered the South Asian nation through a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/20/walmart-flipkart-deal-done/">$16 billion acquisition</a> of the startup Flipkart. Those companies, alongside national and local delivery companies, are looking to partner with Indian OEMs that can meet the unique demands of an Indian market.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some electric vehicles that work in developed markets like the U.S. and Europe, and you see companies like Rivian selling to logistics fleets for those use cases, but the needs of Indian logistics in an Indian market more broadly is very different,&#8221; Sakkers told TechCrunch. &#8220;It requires solving different problems, and so we see a pretty big opportunity to create custom-built vehicles for these kinds of use cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sakkers noted that from a pure engineering perspective, for example, EVage&#8217;s vehicles don&#8217;t have to meet the same standards of the west in terms of being certified to drive at highway speeds, because rarely in India do vehicles go above 40 miles per hour. That means everything from motor requirements to battery size and types of materials you need to build are different, and potentially much cheaper, added Sakkers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The total cost of ownership savings for the customers is quite significant,&#8221; said Sakkers. &#8220;They&#8217;re not only doing this for optic reasons, they&#8217;re also doing it for pure economic reasons. In India, you can&#8217;t operate at certain times of day in cities if you produce a certain amount of emissions, so it also improves your ability to operate a logistics fleet if you&#8217;re operating electric vehicles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t many startups that fit into this mold so that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re putting so much capital into EVage,&#8221; said Sakkers. &#8220;The demand for this segment of vehicles is half a million per year in India. Scaling production to the hundreds of thousands is going to be a challenge for the company, but also a huge opportunity.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The House committee leading the investigation into the January 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol issued subpoenas to four major tech companies Thursday.</p>
<p>January 6 select committee chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS) sent <a href="https://january6th.house.gov/news/press-releases/select-committee-subpoenas-social-media-companies-records-related-january-6th" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letters</a> to YouTube parent company Alphabet, Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta, Reddit and Twitter demanding for those companies to provide additional information on how those platforms were used to organize the day&#8217;s violent events.</p>
<p>In the announcement, the committee accused each company of hosting content related to planning the attack on the U.S. Capitol. &#8220;Meta platforms were reportedly used to share messages of hatred, violence, and incitement; to spread misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories around the election; and to coordinate or attempt to coordinate the Stop the Steal movement,&#8221; the committee stated, noting that it believes Facebook&#8217;s since-disbanded Civic Integrity team held information relevant to the investigation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257835" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As TechCrunch reported at the time, Facebook was a major hub of the Stop the Steal movement as the platform failed to control the spread of content denying the legitimate results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Facebook was also previously the organizing platform of choice for some extremist and militia-like organizations that went on to play a role in the Capitol attack,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/proud-boys-facebook-mcinnes/"> including the Proud Boys</a> and the Three Percenters.</p>

<p>The committee&#8217;s complaint with Reddit appears to be focused on r/The_Donald, a notorious subreddit that migrated to its own domain after being banned over hate speech in late January 2020. The committee also noted that YouTube was used to livestream the events and Twitter users &#8220;reportedly used the platform for communications regarding the planning and execution of the assault.&#8221;</p>
<p>The committee first requested relevant records from <a href="https://january6th.house.gov/news/press-releases/select-committee-demands-records-related-january-6th-attack-social-media-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 different platforms</a> in August of last year, though that round of letter also demanded information from extremist-friendly sites including 4chan, 8kun, Gab, Parler and theDonald.win in addition to more traditional social media apps like Snapchat, Twitch and TikTok.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The committee is revisiting its previous demands from the four mainstream social platforms after those companies failed to provide sufficiently detailed information &#8220;despite repeated and specific requests,&#8221; this time with a deadline set for January 27.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A competition legal expert, backed by a powerful litigation fund, is set to mount a multibillion-dollar class action suit against Facebook/Meta for breach of competition law on the basis that it abused its dominance of social networking in the U.K. for several years. If successful, the action would see Facebook having to pay $3.1 billion (£2.3 billion) in damages to Facebook U.K. users.</p>
<p>The class action lawsuit was lodged against Meta, Facebook’s parent company, yesterday with the U.K.&#8217;s Competition Appeal Tribunal in London.</p>
<p>The unusual approach claims Facebook should pay its 44 million U.K. users compensation for the exploitation of their data between 2015 and 2019. Effectively, it’s saying Facebook took all the personal and private data of its users &#8212; who, due to Facebook’s dominance, had no other viable social platform &#8212; and in return all its users got, in effect, was the ability to post pictures of babies and kittens to their friends and families.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257806" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2257813" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257813" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dr-Liza-Lovdahl-Gormsen.jpeg" alt="Dr Liza Lovdahl Gormsen" width="300" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-2257813" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dr-Liza-Lovdahl-Gormsen.jpeg 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dr-Liza-Lovdahl-Gormsen.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dr-Liza-Lovdahl-Gormsen.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dr-Liza-Lovdahl-Gormsen.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dr-Liza-Lovdahl-Gormsen.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dr-Liza-Lovdahl-Gormsen.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dr-Liza-Lovdahl-Gormsen.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dr-Liza-Lovdahl-Gormsen.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257813" class="wp-caption-text">Dr Liza Lovdahl Gormsen</p></div>The action is being mounted by international competition law expert Dr Liza Lovdahl Gormsen (pictured here) who has made submissions before the U.K.’s Parliament regarding Facebook’s market dominance, as well as written <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3400204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">academic legal papers</a> about it.</p>
<p>Dr Lovdahl Gormsen’s case rests on the idea that Facebook (recently renamed Meta) set an &#8220;unfair price&#8221; for U.K. Facebook users.</p>
<p>The “price” set for granting access to the social network was the surrender of U.K. users’ highly valuable personal data, who in return simply got “free” access to Facebook’s social networking platform, no financial compensation, all while Facebook generated billions in revenues.</p>
<p>Key to the case’s argument is that Facebook &#8220;surrounded&#8221; its U.K. users not just by locking them and their data into its platform, but also by tracking them via the Facebook pixel, on other websites, thus generating deep “social graph” data about its users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Germain to Dr Lovdahl Gormsen’s argument is that user profiles resurfaced time and again in controversies, such as during the Cambridge Analytica scandal, further illustrating their market exploitation.</p>
<p>Dr Lovdahl Gormsen’s lawyers, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, LLP, have written to Meta to notify them of the claim. Dr Lovdahl Gormsen will represent the class of people affected &#8212; that is, all people domiciled in the U.K. who used Facebook at least once during 1 October 2015 &#8211; 31 December 2019.</p>
<p>The &#8220;opt-out&#8221; class action is the first of its kind against Meta in England and Wales. As an opt-out case, Facebook’s 4 million U.K. users will not need to actively join the case to seek damages, but will be part of the claim unless they decide to opt-out from it.</p>
<p>Financial backing for the case is coming from Innsworth, one of the largest litigation funders in the world. Quinn Emanuel and Innsworth have previous history in bringing consumer class action claims of this kind.</p>
<p>The wider context to this is that Meta is also facing a consumer class action in the U.S., regulatory action around the world and an antitrust suit from the FTC in the U.S. that could break it up from the Instagram and WhatsApp platforms.</p>
<p>In a statement, Dr Lovdahl Gormsen said: “In the 17 years since it was created, Facebook became the sole social network in the UK where you could be sure to connect with friends and family in one place. Yet, there was a dark side to Facebook; it abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on ordinary Britons giving it the power to exploit their personal data. I&#8217;m launching this case to secure billions of pounds of damages for the 44 million Britons who had their data exploited by Facebook.”</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, I asked Dr Lovdahl Gormsen if Facebook could argue that there were other social networks available, such as Twitter or Myspace?</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t think people can connect to their family and friends in the same way on Twitter, and Snapchat and all these other places. Facebook is quite unique in the way they&#8217;re doing it,” she said.</p>
<p>The action is also based on the ubiquity of the Facebook pixel on other websites. What is the significance of that to the case, I asked?</p>
<p>“Imagine yourself as a Facebook user,” said Dr Lovdahl Gormsen. “You may be aware that your data will be used by Facebook.com. But what the pixels are doing is when you use a third-party website, that of course has nothing to do with Facebook. That means Facebook has created many, many, many more data points on you that you actually knew you’d signed up to.”</p>
<p>She argues that although it’s possible for a user to remove themselves from Facebook’s platform, deep down in the Settings, in practice the vast majority of users have no idea how to do this or even know it’s possible.</p>
<p>Dr Lovdahl Gormsen is a Senior Research Fellow at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law (BIICL), the director of the Competition Law Forum, a Non-Governmental Advisor to the International Competition Network and sits on the advisory board of the Journal of Antitrust Enforcement (OUP).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a tight labor market, so-called vertical labor marketplaces that zoom in on one industry, like nursing or hospitality, are drawing funding. Trusted Health, a healthcare staffing platform, raised <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/nursing-startup-nabs-149m-for-healthcare-staffing-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$149 million</a> in funding in November, for example. Seasoned, a hiring platform for restaurant workers, closed on nearly<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/seasoned-spices-up-restaurant-hiring-after-bagging-18-7m/"> $19 million</a> at roughly the same time.</p>
<p>Investors are similarly betting there is plenty of upside in a hiring platform focused entirely on the fast-growing cannabis industry, in which an estimated <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/budtending-by-the-numbers-heres-where-the-jobs-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">320,000 people</a> were already working as of last fall, a 32% increase from the year earlier.</p>
<p>Indeed, an <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/25037996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor syndicate</a> led by Level One Fund just plugged $19 million in Series B funding into <a href="https://vangst.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vangst</a>, a six-year-old, Denver-based outfit that pairs both short-term workers and full-time employees with job openings at cannabis companies around the U.S. It&#8217;s no surprise, given the traction the outfit is seeing, along with the variety of revenue streams it has built.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257067" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to founder and CEO Karson Humiston &#8212; who launched the company while an undergraduate student at St. Lawrence University &#8212; Vangst currently features 500 &#8220;gigs&#8221; per week that the platform takes on average 48 hours to fill. (Vangst treats these individuals as W-2 employees, and pays them through its own payroll.) It also right now features nearly 2,000 full-time positions that represent $85 million in gross salaries.</p>
<p>It can start to add up financially. Vangst charges its customers 50% more than it pays its part-time employees, so paying $15 per hour, it might charge a client $22.50 for that employee&#8217;s time. As for full-time roles, in exchange for vetting talent that it connects with companies, Vangst takes a percentage of each candidate&#8217;s first-year salary.</p>
<p>Vangst also charges employers both monthly and yearly subscriptions for the privilege of posting as many openings as they need to fill and, more recently, it began to build out a content business with priced-out modules about retail roles and other positions in the cannabis industry that those new to it might not understand. (Not everyone knows what a trimmer does.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Vangst just raised $10 million to plug more people into the fast-growing cannabis industry&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/24/jobs-platform-vangst-just-raised-10-million-to-plug-more-people-into-the-fast-growing-cannabis-industry/embed/#?secret=Na4YLViixR" data-secret="Na4YLViixR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t all been a bed of rosettes for Humiston and her team. Though Vangst had gained momentum following its Series A round, which closed with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/24/jobs-platform-vangst-just-raised-10-million-to-plug-more-people-into-the-fast-growing-cannabis-industry/">$10 million</a> in 2019, like a lot of other hiring businesses, it was hard hit by the immediate ripple effects of the coronavirus. In March of 2020, Humiston says, Vangst was forced to lay off half its then 70-person team as its customers shrank their own payrolls and began operating at 50% of their previous capacity.</p>
<p>In fact, it was because of Vangst&#8217;s dwindling revenue that it decided to jump into the business of placing full-time salaried candidates in roles. Think accounting managers, product managers and software engineers. &#8220;That was sort of our COVID strategy,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Gradually, when business bounced back, Vangst had built up an entirely new book of business, says Humiston.</p>
<p>Now the challenge is no longer demand but supply. Like nearly every other employer in the U.S., Vangst, which has 56 employees, is working hard to find people to fill the roles on its platform, including by attending trade shows and spending money on SEO services.</p>
<p>Part of its new funding round will be used to build up its small marketing team, unsurprisingly.</p>
<p>Vangst&#8217;s own customers are meanwhile having to sweeten their terms in many cases in order to secure help. As Humiston tells it, &#8220;We encourage them to pay above minimum wage&#8221; and to &#8220;show their mission and values and the perks that they offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The good news: Many more new jobs are expected to come online to fill, which should bode well for Vangst when the labor market finds its footing again.</p>
<p>The state of New York, for example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/new-york-marijuana-legalization-facts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legalized</a> recreational cannabis use last September, and though it is still in the process of doling out retail licenses, that decision is expected to open up <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9142719/Cuomo-says-legalizing-marijuana-create-60-000-jobs-300m-tax-revenue.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60,000 new jobs</a>, according to former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p>
<p>Last fall, New Jersey also signed into law three bills that permit and regulate the use of recreational marijuana, and businesses are already opening up there.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s saying nothing of Michigan, which is &#8220;growing extremely quickly right now&#8221; as a market, Humiston says. (Vangst also has clients in Colorado, California, Nevada and Arizona, among other places to have already embraced recreational marijuana. There are currently <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/where-is-marijuana-legal-a-guide-to-marijuana-legalization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18 states</a> altogether where it&#8217;s legal.)</p>
<p>Eventually, says Humiston, Vangst also hopes to go international. Toward that end, it has upcoming plans to spend time in Barcelona with one of its investors, Casa Verde Capital, which is investing more money in European startups these days.</p>
<p>Still, the team has much to master first, she offers. &#8220;As here [in the U.S.], where we had to do a lot of learning about business needs and regulatory stuff, we&#8217;re eager to learn about international markets. We&#8217;re starting that exploration process this spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 13, 2022! Somehow it is already the close of Thursday, which is odd, as it was minutes ago Monday morning. Such is the pace of 2022! There is some hope in the market that things will slow down (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/dear-vcs-if-you-want-startup-prices-to-come-down-stop-paying-higher-prices/">and get cheaper</a>), but that doesn’t seem super likely at the moment. More on that shortly, along with news that Facebook’s dating app is kaput? To which we can heartily reply: Facebook is still building dating apps? – <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-admin/twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/has-y-combinators-new-deal-changed-the-early-stage-investing-game/">How Y Combinator’s new terms are changing startup investing</a>: News that Y Combinator is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/y-combinator-will-now-invest-500000-in-accelerator-companies/">boosting the capital it invests</a> into its accelerator batch companies is driving a <em>little</em> bit of commentary. While Y Combinator investing more money is generally good news for startup founders, other investors have concerns.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/instacart-doubles-down-on-its-ready-made-meals-offering-with-new-hub-and-faster-delivery/">Instacart goes Blue Apron, because why not</a>: Instacart is rolling out pre-made meals to its platform, expanding its product remit as the grocery delivery game becomes increasingly competitive. Recall that Instacart had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/">simply insanely good 2020</a>, but that growth at the well-funded former startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/are-rivals-snacking-on-instacarts-core-grocery-delivery-market/">slowed in 2021</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/databricks-launches-its-first-industry-specific-lakehouse/">Databricks does something other than file an S-1</a>: Databricks, a massive private data analytics firm, has released a verticalized version of its “Lakehouse” product. What’s a lakehouse? The thing that sits atop a data <em>lake, </em>get it? Anyways, flagging this moment for you as the point in which we really, <em>really</em> knew that Databricks was a Big Kid company and that it should go public. C’mon Databricks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/databricks-raises-1-6b-at-38b-valuation-as-it-blasts-past-600m-arr/">we want the damn numbers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups/VC</strong></h2>
<p>We have lots and lots to talk about today, so let’s dive right in:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257754" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/turnip-mobile-first-gaming-community-funding/">Turnip wants to power gaming communities</a>: I joke about startup names from time to time, but I really do adore the moniker “Turnip.” It’s memorable, fun to say, and the company even has a .gg domain name. Why the weird TLD? Because Turnip is in the gaming <em>community</em> space, and a .gg is to gamers as a .eth is to a person with a Middlingly Messy Minx as their profile picture on Twitter.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/arc-wants-to-build-the-de-facto-finance-solution-for-saas-startups/">Arc shows there is more room in the market for alt-financing plays</a>: Fresh out of stealth, Arc is building a product to both provide capital access to software companies and perhaps help them manage other elements of their financial lives. Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann Azevedo</a> dug into the company’s plans.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/payment-orchestration-platform-gr4vy-pulls-in-another-15m-in-a-series-a-extension/">Gr4vy raises $15M for payments orchestration</a>: While I try to avoid buzzwords in this newsletter when possible, I took a moment today to better learn what “payments orchestration” is, as that’s what Gr4vy just raised a Series A extension to work on. In practice, it appears to be a meta software layer that bundles all sorts of payments options and work into a single product. So it’s more like a bundle than a conductor, but I have to admit that “orchestration” sounds better than, say, coordination.</li>
<li>Also shoutout to Gr4vy for flat-out using leetspeak in its name. Very retro.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/gofundme-acquires-classy/">GoFundMe buys Classy</a>: GoFundMe is perhaps best known as the U.S. healthcare and disaster safety net. Classy is a similar product, but aimed at helping nonprofits fundraise. The former has bought the latter in an equity deal, according to our own <a href="https://twitter.com/asilbwrites">Amanda Silberling</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/yahaha-studios-a-platform-for-building-no-code-immersive-games-raised-50m-in-3-rounds-ahead-of-its-launch-this-year/">What happens if you combine no-code, metaverse, games, user-generated content, $50 million, and Espoo</a>? You get Yahaha Studios, which is <em>based </em>in Espoo, Finland. It just announced that it has raised $50 million over three rounds and is building a no-code service that it calls a “metaverse for games.” Not only am I curious thanks to Roblox’s huge success, but I like games, so find this to be perfectly neat.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/pubg-mobile-maker-krafton-sues-apple-google-and-rival-game-developer-garena-over-clones/">PUBG publisher sues around $5T in market cap over game clones</a>: The publisher of PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds mobile version, Krafton, is suing Apple (worth $3 trillion), Alphabet (worth a little less than $2 trillion), and Garena Online (valuation unknown) over what TechCrunch describes as copying its title’s “opening, its game structure and play, the combination and selection of weapons, armor and unique objects, locations, and the overall color schemes, materials and textures.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/ubits-snags-25m-to-create-the-netflix-for-corporate-training-in-latam/">UBITS raises $25M to upskill workers in LatAm</a>: The great edtech explosion of 2020 moderated somewhat in 2021, but now in 2022 we’re still seeing rounds get done in the space. UBITS is building tech to help “upskill” workers in Latin America, or essentially to train them for new, more complex work.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so, so much more. This startup thinks it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/u-s-fintech-current-introduces-high-yield-savings-where-customers-earn-a-4-00-apy/">can offer a 4% savings rate</a>, which is wild. This startup is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/serve-robotics-new-autonomous-sidewalk-delivery-robots-dont-require-human-assist/">building super cute sidewalk robots</a>. Shield <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/shield-bags-15m-series-a-to-address-surging-demand-for-its-ai-powered-communication-compliance-platform/">raised $15 million</a> for communications compliance software, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/fintech-farm-nabs-7-4m-to-launch-neobanks-in-nigeria-and-other-emerging-markets/">while Fintech Farm wants to build neobanks for different emerging markets</a>.</p>

<p>It’s one thing to get a prospective customer to visit your site, but convincing them to reach for their wallet or share their phone number is a stretch.</p>
<p>As consumers gain greater control over their privacy, Aleksandra Korczynska, CMO of GetResponse, says marketers who align lead generation with the goals of prospective customers will gain a significant advantage.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The key is building a foot-in-the-door technique for continuous engagement — lead magnets,” she says.</p>

<h2><strong>Big Tech Inc.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/meta-shuts-down-its-experimental-video-speed-dating-service-sparked/">Meta shutters speed-dating service</a>: At some point, Meta tries every digital product idea out there. I would not be shocked if deep inside the company’s headquarters there were a few developers frantically building an alpha version <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-acquires-friendfeed/">of a FriendFeed clone</a>, even if Bret Taylor already quit the company to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/bret-taylor-has-been-promoted-to-salesforce-co-ceo/">become a pseudo-CEO at Salesforce</a>. On that theme, Facebook is shuttering a speed-dating service it apparently had cooked up. Will you miss it?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/venmo-introduces-new-gift-wrapping-feature-with-eight-animated-designs/">Venmo introduces e-gift wrap</a>? Now if you hate gift wrapping, and hate giving away money, you can be doubly annoyed thanks to Venmo’s new feature that will let users ‘wrap’ their money transfers. Now your parents cannot claim that giving money instead of a present isn’t festive!</li>
