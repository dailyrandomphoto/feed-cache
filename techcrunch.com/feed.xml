	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Peer-to-peer trading, face to face, eye to eye — it&#8217;s the way deals had been done for millennia, before distance and lack of trust forced us to use go-betweens such as banks and brokers to transact.</p>
<p>Now decentralized finance (DeFi) has taken us back to an over-collateralized future. We can transact peer to peer not only remotely but also trustlessly by interacting with a smart contract. This innovation has set the foundation for a financial renaissance that goes far beyond just replacing intermediaries.</p>
<p>Until recently, regulators have largely ignored this emerging parallel financial system. But with former blockchain professor Gary Gensler as chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, D.C. has woken up. The question is: How can authorities enforce regulations that don&#8217;t rely on the presence of intermediaries? And how will the regulation protect users and the market?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244794" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Decentralization &gt; deterritorialization</h2>
<p>DeFi protocols might appear out of regulatory reach. Copies of blockchain transaction history are stored in nodes all over the world, ready to reappear like the many-headed hydra if one should be compromised.</p>
<p>Yet history provides lessons of how regulators might think they can address DeFi.</p>
<p>Historically, regulators have only held purview over legal entities within their jurisdiction. This changed with the extraterritorial Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) of 2010, which saw U.S. authorities regulating beyond their currency and U.S. persons across the world and coordinating with other jurisdictions by signing intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) for enforcement.</p>
<p>The EU followed a similar approach with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, writing regulations from their ivory tower to control the data of Europeans wherever they are in the world — though it remains unclear how authorities can enforce against organizations outside the EU.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Looking ahead, we could see regulators rely on similar extraterritorial methods in an attempt to reach into cyberspace and enforce regulation in DeFi.</p>
<h2>Choke points and on-ramps</h2>
<p>Even with extraterritorial enforcement, however, regulators would still need to identify choke points that could be used to control otherwise decentralized protocols.</p>
<p>These points of centralization already appear to be on the radar of regulators. As Gensler <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarked</a>: DeFi can be a misnomer, with platforms often being &#8220;decentralized in some aspects but highly centralized in other aspects.”</p>
<p>Individual protocols with known developers, or those controlled by corporate token holders, might be pressured to get changes pushed to the protocol. And for protocols that are as decentralized as they claim — run by distributed anonymous communities — regulators could make interaction with the protocol illegal. Or, more likely perhaps, stymie the flow of funds by targeting on-ramps or marking certain protocols as toxic.</p>
<p>These on-ramps could be fiat-to-crypto exchanges or stablecoins that could be forced to incorporate due diligence and know-your-client procedures to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism (AML/CFT) efforts, etc. To be effective, these future controls will need to be built with DeFi in mind. This could see the sanction list published as a Chainlink lookup or a free API call from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) or Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) directly.</p>
<p>At the same time, individual protocols seeking to integrate with the real economy are likely to make trade-offs that work in favor of regulators.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://aave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aave</a>&#8216;s know-your-client versions of liquidity pools are providing limited DeFi access to institutions by using on-ramps to KYC participants. They are able to mitigate risk by relying on organizations like Chainalysis to analyze blockchains for know-your-transaction (KYT), though this comes at the cost of depth of liquidity, and doesn&#8217;t grow the pie for all participants.</p>
<p>Other promising solutions include smart wrapping contracts that allow verified entities to deposit funds and automatically mint &#8220;fully compliant assets&#8221; that can be used in any DeFi protocol without having to KYC each time.</p>
<p>On the flip side, protocols may further decentralize; as we’ve seen recently, MakerDAO shut down legal entities and relies solely on the DAO. But while these fully decentralized protocols may remain out of reach of regulators, they could also be divorced from the real economy to an extent.</p>
<p>With these scenarios in mind, the question becomes not <em>how to enforce regulation </em>but what outcome the <em>regulations should be aiming to achieve</em>.</p>
<h2>How should DeFi be regulated?</h2>
<p>As to what changes should be pushed to protocol level, we now stand at a crossroads.</p>
<p>There is opportunity for the appropriate level of regulation to give DeFi enough breathing space to make a difference: boosting transparency, increasing financial inclusion and enabling credit to 8 billion people that will see the world take a tremendous jump toward prosperity.</p>
<p>Yet there is also potential for overreach that would stifle innovation and growth and have unintended consequences. Unfortunately, we seem to be well down this path already.</p>
<p>What is needed is the realization that DeFi shares many of the same goals as financial regulators: overhauling inflexible processes and delivering wider access, cheaper prices and more stability — all while ensuring these benefits are widely shared with all participants in the market.</p>
<p>For example, access to liquidity has long been a central concern not only for cryptocurrency and blockchain projects, but for financial markets in general. As per the Bank of England&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2019/andrew-hauser-panellist-at-trade-tech-fx-europe-barcelona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Run Lola Run</a> speech of 2019, there is evidence that those that are further from liquidity get a worse and worse deal.</p>
<p>DeFi has the potential to create fairer, more transparent and more liquid markets through completely new mechanisms, helping everyone to reduce fraud and front-running, resolving fragmentation and creating markets that are efficient, resilient, fair and equally accessible to all — not just participants that have the right connections.</p>
<p>Defining the right regulation could make or break DeFi, and there are big questions to be answered: How do we establish wallet scores? How do we build in decentralized identifiers (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W3C DIDs</a>)? And how can we ensure that any controls don&#8217;t work against financial inclusion?</p>
<p>Given such an opportunity to rebuild finance from the ground up, we need to be bold: Set clear objectives and create regulation that smooths the path to get to the new financial world — without simply settling for a faster version of what we have today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re pretty big reading nerds here at TechCrunch, which means that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/gift-guide-the-best-books-for-2020-recommended-by-vcs-and-techcrunch-writers-part-1/">we like to collect yearly book recommendations</a> and share them with you.</p>
<p>With our own Danny Crichton having left the fold for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannycrichton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pastures more Lux-urious</a>, The Exchange crew decided to take up the mantle of collecting and sharing book suggestions this year. To collect a wide sample, we asked venture capitalists to share their favorites from the year — not just books written this year, mind, but what they read in 2021 that they wanted to shout out — and divided the list into two parts.</p>
<p>Today we’re discussing books that don’t have a core focus on business. Tomorrow, we’ll flip the script and dive into recommendations that are business-focused. There’s a loose fiction focus today, and a nonfiction focus tomorrow, but divvying based on content type wound up being the most sensible way to parse our collected recs into two neat parts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244806" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>In total, we had more than 80 unique recommendations, with several titles collecting more than one nod. It may not surprise you to learn that some science fiction titles were rather popular with the technology investing crew.</p>
<p>Before we get into the list, a note that next year we’ll ask founders to contribute. This year, we approached the data collection in a somewhat ad-hoc manner. Next year, we’ll smarten up, create a form and let more folks weigh in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regardless, let’s talk about the best non-business books from some of the more influential business folks in the startup industry. (Also, The Exchange will be paywall-free today and tomorrow so that everyone can read. You can still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">sign up for TechCrunch+ here</a> to keep reading The Exchange from Friday onward.)</p>

<h2>The most recommended non-business books of 2021</h2>
<p>There was less overlap with fiction than we anticipated, but we did find some common notes. Let’s start with those:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593135202/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0593135202&amp;linkId=21569ce4e18ad2f52b6a5ddfbd540704">Project Hail Mary</a>, by Andy Weir</h3>

<p>From the author of &#8220;The Martian&#8221; (very good) and &#8220;Artemis&#8221; (also very good), &#8220;Project Hail Mary&#8221; is a science-fiction romp that includes the things that Weir became known for with his earlier projects, namely problem-solving and space. If you liked &#8220;The Martian,&#8221; you’ll dig &#8220;Project Hail Mary.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of recommendations, <a href="https://twitter.com/vc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Chapman</a>, a managing partner at Alpha Bridge Ventures; <a href="https://twitter.com/zachcoelius" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zach Coelius</a>, a managing partner at Coelius Capital; and <a href="https://twitter.com/evdillon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ted Dillon</a>, an operating partner at Clean Energy Ventures, all gave it a nod.</p>

<p><div id="attachment_2244939" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244939" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2244939 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kristin-hannah.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="495" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kristin-hannah.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kristin-hannah.png?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kristin-hannah.png?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kristin-hannah.png?resize=768,559 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kristin-hannah.png?resize=680,495 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kristin-hannah.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244939" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: <strong>St. Martin&#8217;s Press</strong></p></div></p>
<p>The final titles of our most recommended section come from the same author. Costanoa Ventures’ investor <a href="https://twitter.com/amyecheetham">Amy Cheetham</a> gave us two picks from the same author, so we’re including them here as a pair. Both are historical fiction novels, in case that sways you one way or the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nightingale&#8221; is being turned into a movie, per the author’s website, and hit a number of bestseller lists. While we’re not familiar with her work, Cheetham gave us an author to dig into, precisely what we were hoping to uncover with this project.</p>
<h2>Recommendations that we can endorse</h2>
<p>Next, let’s dig into books that got single recommendations from venture capitalists, but that we’ve read ourselves and can therefore endorse.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439156816/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1439156816&amp;linkId=f113a40935c7fd41784eace64772e4f5">On Writing</a>, by Stephen King</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2244949" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/On-Writing.jpg?w=449" alt="" width="449" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/On-Writing.jpg 529w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/On-Writing.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/On-Writing.jpg?resize=198,300 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/On-Writing.jpg?resize=449,680 449w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/On-Writing.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /></p>
<p>Vertex Ventures’ <a href="https://twitter.com/tessachen">Tessa Chen </a>gave &#8220;On Writing&#8221; her endorsement, stating that it is “an oldie but goodie” that she has read several times and said “people who write in our portfolio” read as well.</p>
<p>As writers for a living, we can confirm that &#8220;On Writing&#8221; is a good read. It’s challenging in that it makes demands of the reader in terms of how to approach rule-breaking, to pick an example. If you want to become a better writer, and therefore communicator, it’s worth every minute you can give it.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, Mark Forsyth’s &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Eloquence-Mark-Forsyth/dp/1785781723">The Elements of Eloquence&#8221;</a> – recommended by Dillon – is probably worth consuming.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316705853/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0316705853&amp;linkId=fb2a60ebab3273918094bb3288d45bcb">Shards of Earth</a>, by Adrian Tchaikovsky</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2244950" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shards-of-Earth.jpg?w=439" alt="" width="439" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shards-of-Earth.jpg 516w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shards-of-Earth.jpg?resize=97,150 97w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shards-of-Earth.jpg?resize=194,300 194w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shards-of-Earth.jpg?resize=439,680 439w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shards-of-Earth.jpg?resize=32,50 32w" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sandhya">Sandhya Hegde</a>, a general partner at Unusual Ventures, sent this recommendation. Alex recently read the book, having become familiar with Tchaikovsky thanks to his &#8220;Children of Time&#8221; and &#8220;Children of Ruin&#8221; titles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shards of Earth&#8221; is good in that it brings new flavors to the space opera genre. If you enjoy space romps that take the reader through civilizations and star systems, you’ll like the book. But the concept of art plays a bigger role than you’d expect, giving the book’s antagonists a rather different tenor than most bad guys have in the realm of science fiction.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2244951" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fifth-Season.jpg?w=445" alt="" width="445" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fifth-Season.jpg 522w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fifth-Season.jpg?resize=98,150 98w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fifth-Season.jpg?resize=196,300 196w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fifth-Season.jpg?resize=445,680 445w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fifth-Season.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" /></p>
<p>By this point, you may have some of Jemisin’s work, as her profile has become rather large in recent years. Her &#8220;Inheritance Trilogy&#8221; is straight-up magic, as is her collection of short stories, &#8220;How Long &#8217;til Black Future Month?&#8221;</p>
<p>But her perhaps best work is the &#8220;Broken Earth Trilogy,&#8221; recommended by Redpoint’s <a href="https://twitter.com/emily__man">Emily Man</a>. Imagine a world where the planet itself is a rival, and where magic and technology intermingle with an intensity that we can’t recall reading elsewhere. The books are worth buying as a trio and bingeing. Just don’t have social events on your calendar. Once you start the series, you won’t want to do anything else.</p>

<p>Thanks to Techstars’ <a href="https://twitter.com/ckevinliu">Kevin Liu</a> for recommending &#8220;The Pearl,&#8221; giving us a chance to wax about Steinbeck. While we’re most familiar with &#8220;Cannery Row&#8221; and &#8220;Tortilla Flat,&#8221; there’s no need to stick to his lighter works – nor to the great movie adaptations of &#8220;East of Eden&#8221; and &#8220;Of Mice and Men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Pearl&#8221; is a good entry for this list given its central theme of greed. Which, you know, is a pretty important part of investing.</p>

<p>Eclipse Ventures partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-knafel-3483625b">Jayson Knafel</a> threw this one into the mix. Honestly, you should read the entire &#8220;Remembrance of Earth&#8217;s Past&#8221; trilogy, of which &#8220;The Three-Body Problem&#8221; is the first work.</p>
<p>The saga goes over first contact, the question of species safety, how far we might take science one day and more. The first book is amazing. The second book in the series spends time asking questions about humanity itself, while the third pushes the reader so far into the weird that it is nearly philosophical at times. That said, the final book in the series, &#8220;Death’s End,&#8221; is one of Alex’s favorite books, period. It’s just flat-out bonkers good.</p>

<p>We’re adding our endorsement to this particular title given that one of our partners read it and loved it. So, that’s another vote alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/texasvc">Mercury Fund’s Aziz Gilani’s</a> nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ove&#8221; is not a book about a happy person, mind; it’s about a grump. But that fact doesn’t make it any less delightful, we reckon. You can find a copy of this book just about anywhere, given its popularity.</p>

<p>Here was a surprise! <a href="https://twitter.com/vcsurferdad">Venrock’s Brian Ascher</a> threw &#8220;Ready Player Two&#8221; into the mix, which made us sit back and remember when we read &#8220;Ready Player One,&#8221; a book that is metaverse-y and was also made into a movie not too long ago. You can skip the film.</p>
<p>Regardless, Ascher cited the book’s “depiction of AI and neural links” as being “very current,” adding that “apparently Mark Zuckerberg liked the book, too.”</p>
<p>While &#8220;Ready Player One&#8221; had some issues, it has become a book that many folks have read. So, in terms of cultural importance, perhaps &#8220;Ready Player Two&#8221; will reach similar status. Which means we should probably read it.</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://twitter.com/amyecheetham?lang=en">Cheetham</a> recommendation, Alex read this one as part of a book club. The book is centered around twins, race and America’s failings as a nation to move past its racist roots. It’s a read well worth the time if you want to look at the world from a different perspective.</p>

<p>Veil got a vote from <a href="https://twitter.com/vc">Chapman</a>, who also liked &#8220;Project Hail Mary.&#8221; So you won’t be shocked to learn that it is also in the science-fiction genre. Dealing with climate change and politics, &#8220;Veil&#8221; is an interesting foray into the future, but an Earth-focused one. Don’t expect warp drives.</p>
<p>You might know Peper from his active social media accounts. Frankly, since reading &#8220;Veil,&#8221; Alex has been meaning to read more Peper, so consider this short blurb his reminder to do so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re in the earliest stages of Artemis, NASA&#8217;s new push to establish an enduring human presence on the Moon, and Kathy Lueders will be leading a great deal of this ambitious undertaking. But it&#8217;s more than rockets and lunar landers, as she&#8217;ll explain at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TechCrunch Sessions: Space</a> next week on December 14 &amp; 15.</p>
<p>Lueders, a NASA veteran of long standing, recently became head of the newly minted Space Operations Mission Directorate, which will oversee launches and near-Earth operations for Artemis and other projects. She&#8217;ll also be working closely with the International Space Station as its approaches its final years of service as a NASA facility.</p>
<p>Lueders was previously the head of human spaceflight, where she presided over the enormous increase in commercial crew flights, led by SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9 rockets and eventually its Dragon capsule. Her new role keeps her close to these crucial day-to-day operations, letting her focus on those while allowing R&amp;D to be more the purview of Jim Free at the Explorations Systems Development Mission Directorate. No doubt they&#8217;ll work closely together, but it will be interesting to hear her perspective on why the new organization makes sense.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244520" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We will also discuss <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">robotic exploration, space infrastructure, ISS decommissioning</a>, and of course one of Lueders&#8217;s favorite topics, inspiring the next generation of space workers and researchers, from astronauts to engineers to data analysts.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15. Don’t miss the big value in our sponsored sessions. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets">Buy your pass right now</a> and get ready to take away mission-critical information to help you build a better business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ottawa-based <a href="https://gadget.dev/">Gadget</a>, a developer productivity company founded by two former Shopify employees, has raised $8.5 million in seed funding. The funding round was led by Sequoia Capital and Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from Greg Brockman, the co-founder and CTO of OpenAI, Koen Koppen, the CTO of Klarna, Solmaz Shahalizadeh, the head of data science and engineering at Shopify and more.</p>
<p>Founded in 2020 by Harry Brundage and Muhammad Hashemi, Gadget aims to offer ecommerce app developers a way to cut down on the time they spend writing code. The platform allows developers to build and scale apps more efficiently by allowing them to skip the busywork associated with their tasks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started Gadget because we were trying to build a bunch of different things ourselves and got frustrated with how long it took to get anything off the ground,&#8221; CEO Brundage told TechCrunch in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s frustrating to spend weeks and weeks pre-launching and preparing these things. We figured that lots of other people have the same problem and we wanted to build something that solves it.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244913" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gadget bundles the tools, libraries, APIs and best practices needed by developers into a single experience. It allows developers to define their data models and write code while accessing a set of advanced primitives, such as built-in state machines, automated access control, instant API generation and integrations to other SaaS platforms.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244965" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244965" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2244965" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png" alt="" width="1024" height="656" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png 1810w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png?resize=768,492 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png?resize=1536,984 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244965" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong><em>Gadget</em></p></div></p>
<p>In terms of the recent funding, Gadget plans to use it to publicly launch its serverless stack and build out connections to third-party APIs, beginning with Shopify. Brundage and Hashemi plan to initially focus on the ecommerce giant in order to leverage their product and engineering expertise with the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to put the money to use in hiring an even more amazing and bigger team and then just delivering as many features as we can,&#8221; Brundage said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regarding the future, Brundage and Hashemi hope to build a long-lasting enduring company that makes it easier for important software to be developed. Brundage noted that there are many possible useful tools that haven&#8217;t been built yet and the company hopes Gadget can make those tools come to life.</p>
<p>“Software development is reaching a tipping point,” said Mike Vernal, a partner at Sequoia, in a statement. “As we expect more from the software we use, developers need more from the tools they build with in order to keep pace with demands. Gadget&#8217;s platform delivers on the promise of helping ecommerce developers build scalable software, incredibly fast.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By late last year, the alarm bells were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">just starting to ring</a>. Researchers discovered that Russian spies had months earlier burrowed deep into the networks of several U.S. federal networks. The spies, working for Russia&#8217;s foreign intelligence service had first targeted SolarWinds, an IT company whose software helps to remotely manage the networks of thousands of businesses, Fortune 500 organizations, and federal government agencies. By breaking into SolarWinds&#8217; network and pushing a tainted software update to its customers, the Russian spies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-nasa-federal-aviation-administration-networks/">delivered digital backdoors</a> directly to the heart of the U.S. federal government.</p>
<p>It was, and by some accounts <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/10/24/new-activity-from-russian-actor-nobelium/">continues to be</a>, one of the most intricate acts of cyber-espionage in recent years to become public. But it was the delivery mechanism that sparked fear: How could companies trust that the software on their networks hadn&#8217;t been tampered with?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the problems that five ex-Google employees are trying to solve. Dan Lorenc, Matt Moore, Scott Nichols, Ville Aikas, and Kim Lewandowski founded <a href="https://chainguard.dev/about">Chainguard</a> in October after working together on building open source tools at Google. Before founding Chainguard, the five most recently worked on two open source security projects, Sigstore, a new standard for digitally signing and verifying software, and SLSA (delightfully pronounced <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/06/introducing-slsa-end-to-end-framework.html">&#8220;salsa&#8221;</a>), a framework for maintaining end-to-end integrity of a software supply chain.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243057" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Just like a product made on a factory assembly line, software can be made up of different components, and can sometimes depend on code written by others and released as open source for anyone to use. These software &#8220;dependencies&#8221; sometimes have bugs that go unnoticed but are incorporated into larger software projects. Attackers also intentionally try to introduce subtle flaws that can be later exploited, sometimes at scale, if the flaws are embedded in widely used software.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of companies are relying more and more and open source software, and actually not realizing the risks that they&#8217;re setting themselves up for when they go and find some random package on the internet and install it in their production systems,&#8221; Lewandowski told TechCrunch. &#8220;We want to make it possible for companies to have confidence in some of these critical open source packages; they can go back and trace to the source and understand the pieces that go into creating that software package and having an audit trail to go back and track to see where it came from, if there does happen to be a breach.&#8221;</p>
<p>The co-founding team plans to work on open source projects to help companies understand and manage the risks they face from the software supply chains.</p>
<p>Chainguard announced Wednesday that it has raised $5 million in seed funding, led by Amplify Partners and several angel investors. Lewandowski said the team plans to use the funding to scale the company beyond the five new employees, and continuing to build out the products it wants to take to market. &#8220;We&#8217;re probably going to be pretty split down the middle of focusing on open source and then building with a product,&#8221; said Lewandowski.</p>
<p>Though early days, the company said it plans to bring an early version of its product offering next year, with a focus on helping companies harden their own software supply chains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Candela makes an unusual style of watercraft called a hydrofoiling boat, which glides above the sea on fins for a smoother, more efficient ride — doubly unusual, in fact, in that it is electrically propelled. The company has <a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/candela-speedboat-ab/pressreleases/electric-watercraft-maker-candela-secures-eu24m-investment-from-eqt-ventures-to-scale-production-of-foiling-vessels-3149465">raised $24M</a> to accelerate production of its existing small craft and a larger commercial one, in pursuit of cleaner and generally more future-proof waters.</p>
<p>The principle on which these boats work is actually fairly easy to understand. As a boat moves through the water, it tends to propel itself upwards and out as well as forward, and in a traditional watercraft — especially in choppy seas — this leads to the boat bouncing up and down on the water as it goes.</p>
<p>Hydrofoiling watercraft rise up too, but unlike a normal keeled boat the craft has a set of strong, bladelike fins attached to the powertrain and a horizontal fin below. At cruising speed the boat rises up on these fins so that they are the only things under the water, reducing drag and chop considerably and correspondingly increasing the efficiency of the engine.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244872" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course there are consequences to having your boat standing on its fins like that, not least of which is it looks a little strange (boaters are very conscious of these things). But practically speaking the main issue is probably that turning tends to&#8230; well, flop the boat over on its side due to the abnormally high center of gravity. Fortunately this potentially dangerous tendency is handled preemptively in Candela boats.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2244874" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg" alt="CG image of a Candela P-8 on the water." width="1024" height="574" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg?resize=1536,861 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg?resize=2048,1149 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;When you turn left in a Candela, it will lean left, and you will be pushed down in your seat, not to the side as in a planing boat. This coordinated turn is performed by the on board software, which regulates the angle of attack of the foil 100 times per second. So the foil moves constantly, in real-time, to balance the boat,&#8221; explained a company representative in response to my question. Although he compared it to a fighter jet, it might be easier to think of an all wheel drive system constantly monitoring for slip and anticipating such factors during a car&#8217;s turns.</p>
<p>Solving this problem makes hydrofoiling craft a viable alternative to a traditional hull, and that in turn solves one of the problems inherent to electric watercraft: low range. Watercraft face incredible resistance from the medium through which they travel, and at speed even the best batteries out there will run out much sooner than a gas tank.</p>

<p>Painstakingly designing the entire boat around the engine and shaving every gram off the weight, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/zin-boats-reinvents-the-electric-speedboat-in-a-bid-to-become-the-tesla-of-the-sea/">as Zin Boats does</a>, is one approach to making those battery packs last, but if you can increase efficiency by half with something like hydrofoiling, you outrange any other boat in the same class almost without trying.</p>
<p>These boats do actually exist, though only a handful of them at present. Candela started out with the prototype C-7 speedboat, and made several upgrades with the larger <a href="https://candela.com/candela-c-8/">C-8</a>, currently in pre-production with the first boat about 80 percent done and delivery of the first run scheduled for spring. Before you get out your piggy bank, let&#8217;s be clear here: this craft is aimed squarely at the ultra-rich, with a €290,000 price tag before you start adding options like a hard top.</p>
<p>But while the company does hope to sell as many of these as possible to the Monaco and Dubai crowd, the bigger opportunity may be in public transport, of all things. Ferries are crucial infrastructure to cities around the world, but are often old, diesel-powered things that pollute the air and water around them. Candela is aiming at replacing those with its 30-passenger P-30.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244931" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244931" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2244931" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg" alt="3D model of Candela's P-30 passenger boat." width="1024" height="619" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg?resize=768,464 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg?resize=680,411 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg?resize=1536,928 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg?resize=2048,1238 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2244931" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Candela</p></div></p>
<p>The company plans to debut the P-30 in Stockholm in 2023, where they hope it will operate for 40 percent cheaper, get around faster, quieter, and without making waves. They even plan to make it autonomous at some point, though we&#8217;ll address that ambition when it&#8217;s actually being attempted. With a predicted 60 mile range per charge, the P-30 should be able to make multiple trips without stopping and plug in to a fast charger at terminals without too much disruption.</p>
<p>Replacing commercial ferry and water taxi fleets with clean-running alternatives could be a huge step towards improving local water quality and cutting down on municipal contributions to pollution. Many coastal and bay cities could use something like this and may be willing to pay a premium to be recouped in lower running costs and general goodwill.</p>
<p>The $24M round was led by EQT Ventures, with participation from TED curator Chris Anderson. The money will be used to expand the R&amp;D team and scale up production with automated tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve shown that our hydrofoil tech is the key to make electric boats commercially viable. We’re seeing boundless demand for the Candela C-8, as well as huge interest in our commercial vessels,&#8221; said Candela CEO Gustav Hasselskog in a press release. &#8220;The investment from EQT Ventures will allow us to double down on our mission to speed up the transition to fossil fuel-free lakes and oceans. It took us four years to develop the technology and two more years to master it. Now we are ready to scale up fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all still toys for the filthy rich but at one point so were electric cars. A few more years and electric boats may be as affordable as traditional ones — which is to say, not very, but considerably less than a house. If it ends up helping keep our waterways, lakes and oceans cleaner, though, I&#8217;m all for it.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I sponsored my fiancé for a K-1 visa last year right before the pandemic. Unfortunately, the consulate canceled my fiancé’s visa interview and he hasn’t yet been able to get his visa. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Now that travel restrictions to the United States have been lifted, what’s the status of visa interviews?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Pining in Pittsburgh</strong></p>
<p>Dear Pining,</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to me with your question. While theoretically love knows no bounds, the U.S. immigration system can sometimes assert otherwise. We are saddened to hear that you and your fiancé have been separated for so long! We have many clients in your situation, which we recently chatted about on the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/100-ilts-100th-episode-celebration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100th episode of “Immigration Law for Tech Startups.</a>” Rest assured, we’re beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>As always, I recommend consulting with an immigration attorney for specific guidance — every situation is different based on where you and your fiancé are located, and immigrants often say it’s very helpful to have an attorney throughout the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/k-1-visa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K-1 visa</a> process to answer questions and guide you, as well as to support with the adjustment of status process once you and your fiancé are married.</p>

<p>The good news is that starting in January 2022, all U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) personnel will be back in USCIS offices, working to get through the backlogs and reduce processing times that increased substantially during the pandemic. Abroad, however, cases and interviews at the State Department will likely continue to face delays. Many U.S. embassies and consulates remained closed, and those that have reopened have huge backlogs to work through.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter posted today that its testing a feature that would turn its in-app explore page into a TikTok-like video feed, complete with even a &#8220;For You&#8221; tab. This feature is testing on both Android and iOS for users in certain countries who use Twitter in English.</p>
<p>Twitter is the latest social app to see if it can capitalize on TikTok&#8217;s rapid growth &#8212; the short form video app surpassed<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/"> one billion</a> monthly active users this year, making it one of the fastest companies to hit that milestone. TikTok clones like Instagram Reels, Snapchat Spotlight and YouTube Shorts have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok/">incentivized creators</a> to use their platforms and have grown in popularity. Even apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/spotify-tests-a-tiktok-like-vertical-video-feed-in-its-app/">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/reddit-is-quietly-rolling-out-a-tiktok-like-video-feed-button-on-ios/">Reddit</a> are experimenting with the format.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>If it’s looking different, then you’re in our latest test: a new Explore experience to help you discover the best content that’s trending.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter has been constantly churning out new products and features this year, like Spaces, Twitter Blue and Tip Jar. This momentum is expected to continue with Parag Agrawal taking over as CEO after co-founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">Jack Dorsey</a> stepped down last week. Already, Agrawal has begun <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/new-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-begins-restructuring-as-two-execs-step-down/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">r</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/new-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-begins-restructuring-as-two-execs-step-down/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">estructuring the company</a> to support what he called &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1465349749607854083">ambitious goals</a>&#8221; in an email to staff, which he tweeted upon his appointment.</p>
<p>Spaces, Twitter&#8217;s live audio product, is now the default center icon on the app&#8217;s bottom navigation bar. This indicates that Twitter is committed to promoting this Clubhouse competitor. But Twitter&#8217;s copycat features haven&#8217;t always been successful. Fleets, its Snapchat/Instagram stories competitor, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">shuttered</a> after eight months. So, just because Twitter is testing a short form video feed doesn&#8217;t mean that this will definitively become its vehicle for content discovery. But, as TikTok&#8217;s success has shown, people find short videos to be quite engaging.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At Apple&#8217;s Worldwide Developer Conference in June, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-the-wwdc-2021-keynote/">teased its plans</a> to incorporate support for home, office, and hotel keys into Apple Wallet, as well as state driver&#8217;s licenses. Today, Apple is announcing Hyatt will become the first hotel partner to support the new technology. The hotel chain will roll out support for room keys in Apple Wallet for their guests, starting initially with six U.S. properties with more to come in the future.</p>
<p>The six properties include Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, Hyatt Centric Key West Resort &amp; Spa, Hyatt House Chicago/West Loop-Fulton Market, Hyatt House Dallas/Richardson, Hyatt Place Fremont/Silicon Valley and Hyatt Regency Long Beach.</p>
<p>The new system will work alongside the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/world-of-hyatt/id476639005">World of Hyatt mobile app</a>. After making a reservation in the app, you&#8217;ll be presented with a screen that offers you the option to add your room key to Wallet. This experience is similar to when you book tickets or passes and then have the option to tap a button to add those items to Apple Wallet for later access. And like other passes, you can add your hotel room keys immediately after booking your reservation. Of course, the door won&#8217;t unlock until the time of check-in.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244796" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Once the key is added to your Apple Wallet, you&#8217;ll be able to see the reservation dates, property name, and your upcoming check-in date on the main screen. You can also tap on the three-dot menu on the upper-right to view more information about your stay, including your reservation number and other details about the property. Plus, you can launch the Hyatt app directly from within Apple Wallet to manage your reservation.</p>
<p>The hotel keys aren&#8217;t only available on your iPhone &#8212; they&#8217;re also automatically added to the Wallet app on a paired Apple Watch.</p>
<p>In addition to the convenience of not having to keep up with a plastic hotel key card, this system may also allow guests to bypass waiting in lines in the lobby to check-in. Instead, the app can notify guests when the room is ready and they can check in on their phone. When that process is completed, the room key will be enabled and will display your room number so you can just head to your room directly. This could help customers reduce their Covid exposure, as well, as they won&#8217;t have to wait in lines alongside other guests for check-in.</p>
<p>Apple says guests with multiple rooms will be able to add them all to their same room key and wallet for their stay, so they don&#8217;t have to remember which virtual key to tap. And like the Express mode used by transit pass holders, hotel keys can also work in an Express mode where you won&#8217;t even need to unlock your device to open the door. The key also work to unlock access to hotel amenities, like the gym or pool.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>If the guest decides to extend their stay or book at late checkout in the mobile app, the hotel key will update as well. One thing you can&#8217;t do, however, is share the hotel key with a friend &#8212; they only work with the Hyatt account holder who&#8217;s logged into the mobile app. After checkout, the hotel keys are archived in Apple Wallet but not deleted.</p>
<p>The new system will require hotels to update their room lock infrastructure to support NFC technology. This allows the customers to open hotel doors with a tap, like they do today when using Apple Pay at supported point-of-sale terminals. Hyatt is working with <a href="https://www.assaabloy.com/group/en">Assa Abloy</a> on its solution, but Apple is open to working the vendors the hotel chooses. The company declined to say which other hotel chains may be working to roll out the technology, but notes Hyatt has plans to expand access across global properties.</p>
<p>Support for hotel keys is rolling out today to iPhones running iOS 15 and Apple Watch devices running watchOS 8. Hyatt tells TechCrunch it&#8217;s currently only working on a cardless solution for iOS users, though it hasn&#8217;t ruled out working with Google down the road.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volkswagen has entered into three new partnerships related to electric vehicle batteries, as the German automaker looks to transition its entire portfolio of cars, trucks and SUVs to zero-emission vehicles by 2040.</p>
<p>The three separate partnerships, all of which were announced Wednesday, are with materials technology group Umicore, battery specialist 24M Technologies and Vulcan Energy Resources, a company that is planning on opening a lithium brine project in Germany.</p>
<p>Volkswagen&#8217;s joint venture with Umicore will supply the automaker&#8217;s European battery cell factories with cathode materials, a key building block of lithium-ion batteries. The JV will have an initial production capacity of 20 gigawatt-hours, with the aim of scaling to up to 160 gigawatt-hours by 2030. The materials will feed VW’s planned Gigafactory in Salzgitter, Germany.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244811" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition, Volkswagen said it was investing in battery start-up 24M, which is developing a battery that has a semi-solid electrode. The MIT spin-out says its manufacturing process is faster and less capital-intensive than conventional lithium-ion batteries. VW did not disclose the size of its investment.</p>
<p>The final partnership with Vulcan includes a binding contract for what the companies describe as &#8220;carbon neutral&#8221; lithium sourced from Germany. The companies say it is able to have carbon neutral lithium because the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">brine extraction process it is using is more environmentally-friendly than traditional brine extraction and it will be processed in a plant powered by renewable energy.</span></p>
<p>Vulcan will supply the automaker with lithium hydroxide for five years from 2026.</p>
<p>All three agreements are part of Volkswagen’s plan to invest €30 billion ($34 billion) in electric vehicles. In Europe alone, VW said it would build six battery gigafactories by the end of the decade, with a production capacity of 240 gigawatt-hours overall.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Volkswagen is not the only major automaker moving swiftly to secure the battery supply chain. Earlier this month, General Motors announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/gm-to-form-new-joint-venture-with-posco-chemical-aimed-at-key-battery-component/">a similar JV with South Korea’s POSCO Chemical</a> to build a new cathode materials facility in North America by 2024. Meanwhile, Stellantis secured its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/stellantis-locks-in-lithium-supply-agreement-to-secure-ev-battery-materials/">lithium intake agreement</a> with Vulcan last month.</p>
<p>The slew of deals is notable not only because it marks a ramp-up in automakers’ plans to electrify, but because such deals could help reshape the global battery supply chain away from China. Currently, the majority of battery cathodes and anodes are manufactured in that country, according to <a href="https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/membership/china-controls-sway-of-electric-vehicle-power-through-battery-chemicals-cathode-and-anode-production/">Benchmark Mineral Intelligence</a>. Around 75%, or 148 of 200, planned lithium-ion megafactories <a href="https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/membership/global-battery-arms-race-200-gigafactories-china-leads-2/">are also due to be located in China</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital identity startup <a href="https://passbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passbase</a>, which offers SDKs for running remote identity checks, has raised $10 million in Series A funding as it dials up attention on crypto compliance &#8212; touting tools to help fintechs with rapidly evolving regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>The funding is led by Costanoa Ventures, with participation from Lakestar, Eniac Ventures, Cowboy Ventures and Seedcamp.</p>
<p>It follows an unannounced $3.5 million seed round &#8212; which almost doubled the $3.6 million in seed funding that Passbase raised back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/passbase-grabs-3-6m-to-power-privacy-preserving-online-id-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a>. So the 2018-founded startup&#8217;s total raised to date is around $17.7 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243213" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The digital identity space is a crowded one, but on the crypto compliance front Passbase is keen to point back to early experience and claim it as a differentiator &#8212; the team having started out building a cryptocurrency wallet before pivoting to identity authentication &#8212; which it argues helps it understand the needs of that particular (and some might say peculiar) industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our primary focus is on crypto,&#8221; says the startup, describing the typical customer for its SDKs as a &#8220;fast growing digital first financial services product, particularly fiat to crypto onramp services&#8221;.</p>
<p>Passbase&#8217;s subscription developer product provides tools to create a ve<span style="font-weight: 400;">rification flow and back-office compliance for regulatory needs such as AML (anti-money laundering), KYC (Know Your Customer) and age restrictions </span>&#8212; with different tiers targeted at startups, growth and enterprise users.</p>
<p>Its top-line claim is the product can be integrated in as little as 30 minutes, and covers more than 6,000 IDs across 190 countries and 15 languages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Passbase says it has around 180 customers for the dev product at this stage.</p>
<p>While, over the last year, it says revenue has grown 8x.</p>
<p>While the (hyper frothy) crypto market is where Passbase spies the biggest opportunity for its regulatory support tech, it also says it&#8217;s keeping an eye on developments around online age verification &#8212; an area that&#8217;s seeing rising attention from regulators in certain markets (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">such as the U.K.</a>) as a result of concerns around child safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Age verification is secondary priority but we have a few use cases such as online gaming, digital cannabis, online sale of e-cigarettes and online sales of alcohol&#8230; but we do continue to track regulations in age verification such as COPPA, the Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act, and others,&#8221; it told us.</p>
<p>Passbase says the Series A funding will be used for launching a new no-code policy system to allow customers to design their own onboarding flows for multiple regions and regulatory requirements &#8212; with the startup saying it has a big focus on scaling companies that are looking for compliance support as they expand into new markets and geographies.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will solve the need for companies to both understand what they need to do to comply in different markets (i.e. through policy templates) and manage how to do it (i.e. workflows within our verification product),&#8221; Passbase suggests of the incoming policy tools.</p>
<p>Expanding the system&#8217;s capabilities to provide what it bills as &#8220;market-optimized onboarding solutions for different geographies and use cases&#8221; is another slated aim.</p>
<p>Its overarching vision is to be a key player in a digital identity network comprised of a sharable KYC token and verifiable credential model &#8212; which it argues will enable &#8220;a privacy preserving identity ecosystem&#8221;, as envisaged by the decentralized identity model now being hyped as &#8220;web3&#8221;.</p>
<p>However there are a number of (rather better) resourced startups also selling identity verification tools &#8212; Passbase names <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jumio-raises-150m-as-its-all-in-one-id-authentication-platform-crosses-300m-verified-identities/">Jumio</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/onfido-the-ai-based-id-verification-platform-raises-100m-led-by-tpg/">Onfido</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/persona-lands-50m-for-identity-verification-after-seeing-10x-yoy-revenue-growth/">Persona</a> and <a href="https://www.veriff.com/blog/veriff-secures-69m-in-series-b-funding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veriff</a> as its closest competitors.</p>
<p>Notably <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/stripe-goes-beyond-payments-with-stripe-identity-to-provide-ai-based-id-verification-for-transactions-and-much-more/">Stripe also recently added ID checks</a> &#8212; launching into the space this summer and creating a fresh layer of competition for AI-powered verification via a self-serve tool.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CNRcwToQbH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/stripe-goes-beyond-payments-with-stripe-identity-to-provide-ai-based-id-verification-for-transactions-and-much-more/">Stripe goes beyond payments with Stripe Identity to provide AI-based ID verification for transactions and much more</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Stripe goes beyond payments with Stripe Identity to provide AI-based ID verification for transactions and much more&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/stripe-goes-beyond-payments-with-stripe-identity-to-provide-ai-based-id-verification-for-transactions-and-much-more/embed/#?secret=CNRcwToQbH" data-secret="CNRcwToQbH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Stripe&#8217;s arrival obviously causes a big headache for all the startups founded on dreams of becoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/passbase-grabs-3-6m-to-power-privacy-preserving-online-id-checks/">&#8220;Stripe for identity verification</a>&#8221; (which was literally how Passbase was talking about its business back in 2019).</p>
<p>But despite fierce competition on core ID checks, Passbase isn&#8217;t throwing in the towel &#8212; it&#8217;s just betting on specializing in crypto compliance needs (and there being a market for specialized crypto compliance tools) instead. Hence its marketing thrust now talks about bringing &#8220;KYC to crypto&#8221; &#8212; and stays silent on the arrival of Stripe on its turf &#8212; again arguing that its early experience in crypto and web3 provides a competitive edge for the crypto niche it&#8217;s now zeroing in on.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s important to remember, our team came from the web3 and crypto space with Coinance. We understand the needs of web3 better than anyone in the IDV [identity verification] space. These competitors existed when we were looking for solutions and there is a reason we didn’t choose them,&#8221; it argues, dialling up the crypto hype.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our seed round got us to table stakes to be a competitive solution in IDV, with improvements such as more flexible pricing for scaling companies, a more user-friendly verification flow, deeper customization for product leaders and better documentation so developers can integrate in minutes, not weeks. The Series A is about taking the next step towards an accessible global compliance solution and the decentralized identity model web3 was built to facilitate.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.synthesia.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Synthesia</a>, a startup using AI to create synthetic videos, is walking a fine, but thus far prosperous, line between being creepy and being pretty freakin&#8217; cool.</p>
<p>Today, it announced the close of a $50 million Series B funding round led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from GV and existing investors Firstmark Capital, LDV Capital, Seedcamp and MMC Ventures.</p>
<p>Synthesia allows anyone to turn text or a slide deck presentation into a video, complete with a talking avatar. Customers can leverage existing avatars, created from the performance of actors, or create their own in minutes by uploading some video. Users also can upload a recording of their voice, which can be transformed to say just about anything under the sun.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244759" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup, aware of the fact that almost any powerful tool on the internet can be used for evil, is focusing exclusively on enterprise clients, rather than allowing anyone and everyone to hop on the platform. These customers predominantly use the tool for training videos, it said, but also use Synthesia for monthly updates to the broader team or delivering information that would normally come via email.</p>
<p>Interestingly, founder <a href="https://twitter.com/vriparbelli?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victor Riparbelli</a> said that user behavior didn&#8217;t necessarily match up to his earlier expectations. Rather than seeing tons of usage from video production departments, other folks inside the organization are the power users of the tool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who, before Synthesia, could produce a slide deck or write a Word document can now actually create video content,&#8221; said Riparbelli. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s the key thing that is making us grow so fast from an AI perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since raising a $12.5 million Series A in April, Synthesia has added features that make it even easier for users to create their own animated talkers, and the platform now has 1,000 custom avatars in use. Riparbelli cited Ernst &amp; Young as an example customer. The firm has 35 partners with their own avatars, creating videos for both internal comms and client communication.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Synthesia&#8217;s AI video generation platform hooks $12.5 million Series A led by FirstMark&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/synthesias-ai-video-generation-platform-hooks-12-5-million-series-a-led-by-firstmark/embed/#?secret=QVWm4T0HIO" data-secret="QVWm4T0HIO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The &#8220;anyone can make video&#8221; concept gives me very strong Canva vibes. The $40 billion Australian startup shot up like a rocket after unlocking the ability to design &#8212; anything &#8212; for the rest of the organization outside of the design department. Canva also launched its own video product recently, focusing more on turning existing designs and slide decks into animated, lively videos.</p>
<p>The startup takes that a step further with the ability to create videos featuring an avatar that looks and feels like a real person, either an unknown actor or the CEO of your own company.</p>
<p>Synthesia isn&#8217;t the only company doing work in its problem space. An Israeli company called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/d-id/">D-ID</a> actually demo&#8217;d their tech at Disrupt 2021, showing how they can take a still image of a person and turn it into video content.</p>
<p>In other words, the race is on, in a few ways. Companies looking to make video creation easier through AI and avatars must not only race to increase realism and add in a sliding scale for emotional expression, etc., but they must also ensure the safety of users and the credibility of their own platforms.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s plain as day to see how these types of tools could be used to mislead or do harm to large numbers of people, and it&#8217;s up to the companies creating these tools to ensure they&#8217;re used in an above board fashion.</p>
<p>For Synthesia&#8217;s part, the company is pretty clear about not synthesizing anyone without explicit consent, and the tech is only accessible via an on-rails experience fully controlled by the company.</p>
<p>All that said, don&#8217;t be surprised to see a video from your department head or CEO, but not <em>quite </em>them, in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/polestar/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><ins>Polestar</ins></a> has <a href="https://media.polestar.com/global/en/media/pressreleases/642344" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><ins>released</ins></a> an over-the-air update that boosts the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-ev-drive-video-133035906.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1"><ins>Polestar 2&#8217;s</ins></a> torque and horsepower. It bumps up the EV&#8217;s oomph to 469 horsepower (an increase of 67hp) and 502 lb. ft of torque, an increase of 15.</p>
<p>In practical terms, Polestar says those upgrades shave around a tenth of a second off the 0-60 MPH acceleration time, which is <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/43418/polestar-2-gains-67-hp-from-ota-update-and-this-is-how-its-going-to-be" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1"><ins>down to 4.4 seconds</ins></a>. The company suggests the biggest acceleration boost will be found in the mid-range. It claims that going from 50 to 75 MPH will take 2.2 seconds, which is around half a second faster than the typical Polestar 2 setup.</p>
<p>The update isn&#8217;t free, however. It&#8217;s available in the Polestar Extras store for eligible cars in the UK, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, Denmark, Germany and Austria, and it costs around €1,000 ($1,130). Polestar plans to offer the update in the US and Canada in the spring, with pricing to be announced later.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244793" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Polestar isn&#8217;t the only automaker to increase EV performance via over-the-air updates. Tesla has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-y-acceleration-boost-174341431.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1"><ins>also offered</ins></a> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-3-owners-quicker-164500702.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="30" data-v9y="1"><ins>paid updates</ins></a> that boost acceleration in some models, such as Model 3 and Model Y.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After months of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/roku-alleges-google-is-using-its-monopoly-power-in-youtube-tv-carriage-negotiations/">nasty</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/roku-removes-youtube-tv-from-its-channel-store-following-failed-negotiations/">contract</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/roku-warns-customers-contract-negotiations-with-youtube-have-failed/">disputes</a>, Roku this morning announced it&#8217;s come to an agreement with Google which will allow it to continue to carry both YouTube and YouTube TV on its platform. Roku declined to share the specifics of the deal terms, beyond saying it&#8217;s a multi-year extension that covers both services.</p>
<p>For Roku and Google customers, however, that means they don&#8217;t know which party won the battle or what that means for Google&#8217;s access to Roku&#8217;s user data. During the spat, Roku brought to public attention how Google was allegedly demanding elevated access to customer data which Roku had then described as &#8220;outside the realm&#8221; of industry-standard practices. It said Google wanted more user data than Roku offered its other customers.</p>
<p>Roku also said that Google had threatened to retaliate by increasing the hardware spec requirements for YouTube TV if it didn&#8217;t get its way. That would have meant Roku&#8217;s low-end players would no longer have access to the service.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244777" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These are hefty complaints. And in the case of the user data-sharing agreements, it seems customers should have the right to know where the decision ended up.</p>
<p>It may be easier to spot which side won when it comes to Roku&#8217;s other allegations, however. Roku had said Google wanted preferential treatment of YouTube content in Roku search results and had wanted to override Roku customers&#8217; default settings when the YouTube app was open. For example, if a Roku customer had YouTube open and used voice search to ask for music, Google wanted YouTube Music to play the request, even if the customer had set Pandora as their preferred music app. This should be easy enough to test out when the new agreements go into effect.</p>
<p>Roku had hauled the details of the backroom negotiations into the public in an attempt to gain an upper hand in the disputes, ultimately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/roku-warns-customers-contract-negotiations-with-youtube-have-failed/">warning customers in October</a> that negotiations had failed &#8212; and that customers may lose access to YouTube TV as a result.</p>
<p>Google, meanwhile, had dismissed Roku&#8217;s claims as &#8220;baseless,&#8221; and denied it had asked for elevated access to user data or to interfere with Roku search results. The company also suggested Roku was attempting to use these allegations (which had a whiff of an antitrust nature to them) as a means to renegotiate a separate deal for the main YouTube app. Given that the new agreement now covers both services, one has to wonder if Roku was successful on that front.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Roku spokesperson shared the following statement about the new deal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Roku and Google have agreed to a multi-year extension for both YouTube and YouTube TV. This agreement represents a positive development for our shared customers, making both YouTube and YouTube TV available for all streamers on the Roku platform.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, a Google spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re happy to share that we’ve reached a deal with Roku to continue distributing the YouTube and YouTube TV apps on Roku devices. This means that Roku customers will continue to have access to YouTube and that the YouTube TV app will once again be available in the Roku store for both new and existing members. We are pleased to have a partnership that benefits our mutual users.</p></blockquote>
<p>Google also declined to comment on the nature of the data-sharing agreements under the new contract, only referring back to prior statements it made where it had denied Roku&#8217;s allegations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[NewtonX developed search engine technology to match questions to only those who would know the answer among an open network of over 1 billion professionals.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Everyday business decisions require data and are often questions someone has already asked and had answered. However, where all of that knowledge lives is not always accessible if you aren’t in research or have a panel of experts. <a href="https://www.newtonx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NewtonX</a> wants to change that.</p>
<p>The business-to-business insights company on Wednesday announced $32 million in Series B funding to continue developing its tool aimed at democratizing access to high-quality data and research.</p>
<p>The round was led by Marbruck Ventures and included Level One, the UBS O’Connor fund, Gaingels and Heliad Partners. Existing investors Two Sigma, Third Prime, XFund, Story Ventures and Switch also participated. The latest investment gives NewtonX a total amount raised of $47 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244350" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We profiled the company back in 2019 when it announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/two-sigma-leads-12m-series-a-for-expert-knowledge-network-newtonx/">$12 million Series A round</a>, but the premise behind the company is that it developed search engine technology to match questions to only those who would know the answer among an open network of more than 1 billion professionals. It also ensures every professional is verified so there is true expertise.</p>
<p>Sascha Eder, co-founder and CEO of NewtonX told TechCrunch that the company was very close to the path of profitability, but decided to take on the new capital to prioritize growth. It used the Series A funding to invest in technology, and now wants to take that technology to the next level, bringing in automation and artificial intelligence, so that answers will come faster, thus transforming into an enterprise scalable-grade company to handle any future growth.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, the company also built out its marketing and sales teams for more brand awareness and partnerships. A big part of the Series B will go even deeper to build out a product suite, which will require additional marketing, sales and engineering hires, Eder said.</p>
<p>“For the first four years of our company, we didn’t have a sales team, which is different from other startups, but we can say we had a product market fit from day one,” he added. “We provided the right solutions and a lot of organic growth, and now it is time to take that to the next level with a strategic approach to awareness and expansion globally.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>NewtonX works with more than 200 companies, like Pinterest, and Fortune 500 consulting firms, financial institutions, market research firms and mid-sized companies. The company is growing 100% year over year and has plans to grow from 80 employees today to over 200 by the end of 2022, Eder said. It had been at 45 employees around this time last year.</p>
<p>Even venture capitalists need access to insights, an additional reason that made the company attractive, Kemper Shaw at Marbruck Ventures said in a written statement.</p>
<p>“In just five years NewtonX has established itself as the leader in B2B research and is used by the world’s leading companies that trust NewtonX to get the data they need to make multi-million dollar decisions,” Shaw said. “Their knowledge graph and custom recruiting automation allows them to connect business leaders to insights they previously could not access or where they had to question the validity of the data, NewtonX solved this problem and will be a critical part of companies’ competitive edge in the years to come.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a field that ranges from text therapy and AI chat bots, to guided meditation, </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01100-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mental health startups are pursuing a different niche: therapy for kids. And kids only. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HelloHero, a company focused on teletherapy for kids up to 21 years old (the average user is 10 years old), announced a $7.7 million dollar seed round on Wednesday, with a $4.5 million line of credit from Silicon Valley Bank. This round of funding follows a rebrand for the company, and plans to dive deep into data-driven teletherapy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HelloHero is the brainchild of founder Syed Mohammed, who struggled with dyslexia as a child, but wasn’t diagnosed until adulthood. After benefitting from therapy as an adult, he has focused on building out a teletherapy program offered through schools or directly to families. That platform was initially called Enable My Child (founded in 2018). But the company has recently rebranded to HelloHero. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243418" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, HelloHero has provided teletherapy for 3,800 children, about 1,800 of whom have been served this school year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HelloHero isn’t the only player in the teletherapy for kids space (</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/dotcom-therapy-raises-13m-to-provide-therapy-for-kids-in-and-out-of-school/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DotCom Therapy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company founded 2015 to provide therapy through school districts, closed a $13 million round this year as well). Although HelloHero does hit some similar notes seen in other teletherapy companies (largely, leveraging clinical expertise to get therapists into schools that may not have them), its approach is very technology-focused. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohammed has spent a lot of time thinking about using technology to improve therapy itself, and building tools to connect schools, insurance companies and parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we&#8217;ve built here is the healthcare system that is connected to payers; that is connected to their families and children; that is connected to therapists,” Mohammed told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any child who uses HelloHero begins with a treatment plan established by a therapist. After every session of therapy delivered using HelloHero, therapists and parents are asked to evaluate the clinical progress a child is making. All of that data is collected by HelloHero’s platform, which, as Mohammed explains, is used to tweak the plan from week to week.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have generationally improved how progress is tracked,” argues Mohammed.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not the only benefit of collecting information this way. Session-level data that links therapy to clinical progress (or lack thereof) has already proved to be a powerful asset for companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a vastly larger scale, ieso, a U.K.-based text-therapy company which closed a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/uk-based-mental-health-provider-ieso-raises-53m-armed-with-an-unprecedented-dataset/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$53 million Series B round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November, has also asked participants to evaluate their progress over the course of treatment. The result is a massive data set linking certain therapeutic techniques to clinical outcomes (which has resulted in published research). That data set has become a major attraction point for investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HelloHero appears to be building an outcomes-linked data set of its own, and has aims to using it to provide more automated therapeutic tools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohammed plans to develop a data-informed tool to guide therapists through their own sessions. It would provide advice in real time on a therapists’ screen while in-session, based on what has worked (and not worked) before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In HelloHero&#8217;s current platform, advice is already provided before or after sessions are completed, says Mohammed. But the company plans to bring real-time “on-screen intelligence” to life within the next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from on-screen intelligence, HelloHero has looked to set its platform apart on the back end. HelloHero has built its own electronic medical record system, and a payer platform that’s “connected” to private insurers and Medicaid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I asked our chief technology officer, &#8216;how much code do we really have?&#8217;, and he explained it: think about us like a regional bank. That’s how big our technology is,&#8221; Mohammed said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as the therapy itself goes, HelloHero has two arms of the business: the first is based on direct collaborations with schools. The company is in contract with 500 school districts, and more than 100 are actively providing therapy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second arm is a direct to family program, which offers specialized courses for kids and parents (programs include screen time management, or feeding difficulties, as examples). Now, the direct to family programs constitute about 8-10% of the business, says Mohammed. Going forward the company plans to invest more in this aspect of the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for this round, the company also plans to focus on recruiting expertise in three areas: insurance integration, child psychology and technology. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You will be excused if you haven&#8217;t heard of <a href="http://wiz.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wiz</a>, an 18-month-old Israeli security startup from Microsoft Azure vets, but it has already been turning heads by raising $550 million on a $6 billion valuation. (No, that is not a typo.)</p>
<p>Wiz started out by creating an agentless tool to scan across the range of cloud tooling from virtual machines to containers to serverless, says Raaz Herzberg, Wiz&#8217;s head of product. &#8220;When we think about the tools organizations started from deploying in the cloud, most were not cloud native. We basically took the cloud API&#8217;s and worked our way to doing a full scan, and that has never been done before,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Today, the company introduced a new product called Wiz Guardrails designed to create a single security policy to protect code, from creation to production, essentially extending the coverage of the original product from the cloud infrastructure to the development pipeline.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244761" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are releasing something today…I honestly believe will transform the way organizations do cloud security by basically enabling them to extend that type of solidified scan across any architecture type and any cloud, and also extending that across the full development pipeline,&#8221; Herzberg told me.</p>
<p>The way it works is that admins can define the security policy they want to apply to the code in the pipeline. As the code moves through the production cycle, it continually checks it for anything that falls outside of compliance and flags it for fixing before it becomes a problem. Once in production, it can continue to monitor the code for compliance with the policies.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Assaf Rappaport went to Microsoft when it bought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/08/microsoft-confirms-purchase-of-cloud-security-firm-adallom/">his previous startup Adallom</a>, which helped secure SaaS products. He claims to have helped build this to a $2 billion business before heading off on his own again in March 2020, a particularly inopportune time to launch a new company.</p>
<p>But it didn&#8217;t seem to hurt him as the company has managed to raise gobs of money at a gaudy $6 billion valuation just nine months after releasing its first product. He says that the market has accelerated due to COVID pushing companies to the cloud faster, something we have heard from many companies since 2020.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the founder&#8217;s track record also helped instill confidence in investors, who often look for people who have built startups to successful exits, and Rappaport says that they have managed to attract Fortune 500 and 100 companies quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that market opportunity combined with the pace of what we created, I would say [explains] the hype and the excitement from investors about Wiz,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meta (formerly Facebook) today is introducing a new &#8220;Professional&#8221; mode for user profiles, designed to be used by creators looking to monetize their followings on the social network. The new mode, which is initially available to select creators in the U.S., will present creators with additional money-making opportunities and expanded insights that had been previously only available to Facebook Pages.</p>
<p>Among these will be the ability for creators to participate in the new <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/programs/bonuses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reels Play bonus program</a>, where some creators are able to earn up to $35,000 per month based on the views for their short-form video content. However, access to this program, for the time being, is invite-only &#8212; meaning Meta will determine which creators qualify to earn bonuses.</p>
<p>While Meta didn&#8217;t share what other monetization options will be available in the days ahead, it did note that it will also make professional-level insights available to these creators, which are similar to what Page owners have access to. This includes access to post, audience and profile insights. For example, creators will be able to now see the total number of shares, reactions and comments that their posts have and be able to view their follower growth over time. This allows them to make better, more informed decisions about the content they post and how it resonates with their audience.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244763" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2244775" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244775" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2244775" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Professional-mode.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="618" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Professional-mode.png 1188w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Professional-mode.png?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Professional-mode.png?resize=300,273 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Professional-mode.png?resize=768,698 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Professional-mode.png?resize=680,618 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Professional-mode.png?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244775" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Meta</p></div></p>
<p>While many creators are already using Facebook profiles instead of Pages to attract fans and followers, Meta warns that others who decide to opt into this new experience will be opening themselves up to being more of a public figure on the social network. That means anyone can follow them and see the public content posted to their feed, but they&#8217;ll be able to mark posts as either public or friends-only, as you could otherwise on a private profile.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, creators who are using Facebook Pages will be opted into the new Pages experience instead. This will provide access to a Professional Dashboard that will serve as a central destination for admins to review the Page&#8217;s performance and access professional tools and insights, the company notes. Facebook is also testing a two-step composer on Pages. which allows creators to schedule posts and cross-post into a group.</p>
<p>The changes come at a time when Meta is heavily investing in its creator user base, as it sees the potential in a new revenue stream that comes from things like creator subscriptions and virtual tips, aka &#8220;Stars&#8221; &#8212; the latter which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/facebooks-new-website-lets-fans-buy-stars-without-paying-the-app-stores-commissions/">it just made available</a> yesterday outside the app stores through a new website where it no longer has to pay commissions to Apple and Google. The company earlier said it was planning to lure in creators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/">with $1 billion in payments</a>, like the Reels bonuses among other things, as the competition for creator talent heats up with TikTik and other top social apps, like YouTube, Twitter, Snapchat and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meta notes that the new Professional mode is still in testing with select creators in the U.S. for now, but will roll out more broadly in the future, including to the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/introducing-new-tools-to-support-facebook-creators-in-emea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMEA region</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During the good number of hours I’ve spent researching and writing about vertical farming in recent months, one key word keeps popping up: proximity. So many of the resources spent on modern farming are devoted to transporting produce long stretches, ramping up carbon footprints in the process. Gotham Greens isn’t vertical farming, exactly, but it has become a poster child for locally grown agriculture, courtesy of its urban greenhouse that sits directly atop a Whole Foods in Gowanus Brooklyn.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old company currently has three New York City locations (two in Brooklyn and one in Queens), two additional farms on the East Coast (Baltimore and Providence), a pair in the Midwest (Chicago) and one in the Mountain region (Denver). Today, it announced further westward expansion with the opening of its first California greenhouse, based just outside UC Davis.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243772" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243772" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2243772" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg 3500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg?resize=2048,1534 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243772" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gotham Greens</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243770" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gotham’s ninth location is a 10-acre farm designed to dramatically reduce the resources required to grow produce. Using its hydroponic technology, the company says it’s capable of reducing the standard 10 gallons of water required to grow a head of lettuce to less than a single gallon. Overall, it claims the farm will be able to save 270 million gallons of water a year, while occupying 300 fewer acres than traditional farming practices.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting move, heading to California, where so much of the nation’s produce is grown &#8212; and certainly a different tactic that opening a location in New York City or Chicago. Of course, in spite of California’s proud tradition of growing, the state has been plagued by the very real devastation of climate change.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243773" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243773" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2243773" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg 3500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg?resize=2048,1535 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243773" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gotham Greens</p></div></p>
<p>“California is the center of North America’s leafy greens production, where water shortages, wildfires and other results of climate change are straining critical agricultural resources. By putting down roots in California, we aspire to be a part of the agricultural industry’s solution to the increasingly visible impacts of climate change,” co-founder and CEO Viraj Puri said in a release. “Our newest greenhouse facility in Northern California is strategically located to service retailers and food service providers throughout the region more quickly while conserving precious resources, including land and water.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The proximity to UCD was no mistake, either. The company will be partnering with researchers from the school and will likely have a solid pipeline of future employees. The company also used the opportunity to announce plans to reduce the plastic in its packaging 40% (versus 2020) and electricity use 5% by the year 2024.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/samsara-could-become-a-decacorn-in-upcoming-iot-themed-ipo/">Samsara IPO heading toward pricing</a>, it&#8217;s a good moment to spend a little more time digging into the IoT market. There&#8217;s a lot more going on than merely the liquidity point of one of its players, it turns out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.afero.io/">Afero</a>, for example, closed a $50 million Series C today, led by <a href="https://crosspointcapital.com/">Crosspoint Capital Partners</a>. The new capital raise is roughly equivalent to all the capital that Afero raised prior to its latest round, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/afero/company_financials">per Crunchbase data</a>, implying that the startup now has more cash on hand than at any point prior.</p>
<p>After being slightly surprised at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/iot-data-collector-samsaras-ipo-will-be-fun-to-watch/">how large Samsara&#8217;s own IoT-focused business had grown</a> while we weren&#8217;t watching, TechCrunch got ahold of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/joe-britt">Afero CEO Joe Britt</a> and <a href="https://crosspointcapital.com/team/hugh-thompson/">Crosspoint&#8217;s Hugh Thompson</a> to chat more about its business and why it chose this moment to raise.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244738" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>What does Afero do?</h2>
<p>Per Britt, when his team was putting Afero together, they noted projections indicating that the number of connected devices in the world was going to scale by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>Given that anticipated boom in connected gadgets, sensors and the like, Afero&#8217;s IoT platform was built with security in mind. That might sound intuitive, but Britt argues that the web was not initially compiled with security as a top priority, which has led to round after round of issues surrounding breaches and hacks.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re going to connect our lives and businesses to the internet on an ambient basis, security is going to be a pretty darn big deal. Else your toaster or production is going to get hacked.</p>
<p>Thompson, who has a background in security work, stressed how important that stance was to his interest in investing in the company, saying that the startup is &#8220;rare&#8221; in having &#8220;built things right [in security terms] from the very beginning.&#8221; (Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker">TechCrunch&#8217;s Zack Whittaker</a>, I am more aware than ever of how frequently major companies are compromised, making me sympathetic to arguments of the importance of building with a security-first mindset.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Afero&#8217;s IoT platform also includes a software development toolkit (SDK) for customer companies to build mobile apps on top of, as well as the ability to tailor itself to customer use cases.</p>
<p>In practice, the startup works with companies like Home Depot to bring connected devices to markets like the smart home segment. According to Britt and Thompson, the company&#8217;s platform can also support offline items like tagged physical goods to help track supply chains.</p>
<h2>Why raise now?</h2>
<p>Of all the startups that I have spoken to after raising a Series C, Afero is the smallest in terms of full-time staffing with just 24 people. Obviously, the company is going to do some hiring with its new capital. It also plans to invest in its go-to-market efforts &#8212; more spending on marketing, sales and so forth.</p>
<p>Asked by TechCrunch how large the company&#8217;s in-market footprint is today, Afero&#8217;s CEO declined to share a specific number, and after trying to find a way to explain general scale without being too precise, he simply said that there are &#8220;a lot&#8221; of Afero-connected devices in the world. Normally we&#8217;d complain a bit about a lack of hard numbers, but given that the startup&#8217;s customers might not want it to disclose how many of their devices sit atop Afero&#8217;s platform, it makes some sense.</p>
<p>In time, when Afero has a wider customer base, we&#8217;ll expect more specificity.</p>
<p>A few years back, we might have been skeptical of the scale of the market that Afero is tackling, but Samsara&#8217;s growth changed our general perspective.</p>
<p>The soon-to-be public company&#8217;s platform collects IoT data from real-world business operations, allowing for the creation of an application layer atop data sourced from sensors. Samsara&#8217;s revenues of $113.8 million last quarter provide proof of market demand for IoT platforms more generally.</p>
<p>Afero&#8217;s best-known partnership has more of a consumer flavor &#8212; Home Depot&#8217;s HubSpace line is geared toward the public &#8212; than what Samsara has built, so the two are not direct competitors today. We&#8217;re not trying to say that Afero is coming after Samsara or the other way around. At least not yet.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we&#8217;ll be curious to see how many new customer companies Afero can land in the next few quarters &#8212; and how soon it will scale to the point that it&#8217;s comfortable sharing harder metrics.</p>
