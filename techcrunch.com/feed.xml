You’ll find them all in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#24513748-ac7b-490b-ad48-4b0767bf0c58">event agenda</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick look at just some of the compelling topics that our slate of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#56c4ffdf-04f9-4404-a33a-522de0e81ba5">leading space experts</a> will tackle. It’s a great opportunity to learn everything you ever wanted to know about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-launch-vehicles-at-tc-sessions-space-2021/">Launch vehicles</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Now, about that giant cash payload. How can you find one for your startup? Start by spending time in these sessions where you can pick the brains of VCs who invest heavily in space tech — and write the ginormous checks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Fast Money, Team Space: Company Concept, Capital and</strong> <strong>Customer</strong> — Game-changing technology and entrepreneurial initiatives are the new space norm. However, a great technical design is not enough. Growing an idea across markets also takes capital and customers. Transitioning from concept to the development phase is more likely to succeed if a company obtains stable forms of capital and potential long-term customers. Harpoon Ventures’ Chris O’Connor focuses on a startup that identified the right venture partners to grow their business and secured opportunities to prototype and test their designs with the U.S. government.</p>
<p><strong>Backing the Brightest</strong> — There’s an art to later stage space company funding, especially as the exit picture for the sector is still only just starting to take shape. Tess Hatch (BVP), Shaun Maguire (Sequoia) and Lisa Rich (Hemisphere) discuss how they evaluate which companies are primed for growth.</p>
<p><strong>Being There When Stars Form</strong> — At the earliest stages, space companies are at their riskiest. But these investors are willing to wade in and write checks to help those companies gain their footing. Hear from Chad Anderson (Space Capital), Jonathan Fentzke (Techstars) and Jessica Robinson (Assembly Ventures) about how they pick their winners.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15. Spare your budget — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets">buy your pass</a> before <strong>the price goes up on December 3</strong> and save up to $100.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://beerorcoffee.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BeerOrCoffee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a São Paulo-based flexible office </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketplace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has raised $10 million in a Series A round led by Kaszek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valor Capital Group also participated in the round, which brings BeerOrCoffee’s total raised to about $13 million since its 2017 inception. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kees Koolen, the founder of Booking.com, led the startup’s seed round in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BeerOrCoffee describes itself as a B2B marketplace of workspaces on demand that aims to provide hybrid work solutions for companies. It offers over 1,100 shared workspaces in 160 Brazilian cities on its marketplace, including WeWork, Selina and Impact Hub</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240536" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s flagship offering, OfficePass, works as a corporate benefit. It is an office subscription that gives employees access to a distributed network of office spaces, where the employer only pays for the actual use of the space through a payment as a service (PaaS) model. People can choose the closest space and book to use shared spaces, meeting rooms or private offices, according to Roberta Vasconcellos, CEO and co-founder of BeerOrCoffee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, customer i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food offers the OfficePass benefit to its more than 4,500 employees and uses a total of 240 different spaces across 67 cities throughout Brazil. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the startup’s other clients are Itaú, Banco Inter, Creditas, QuintoAndar, Stellantis, Sodexo, MRV, Mapfre and Movile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On one hand we improve people&#8217;s work/life balance and productivity and on the other, we optimize companies’ costs and time with an as a service model and centralize all their workspace management in a single dashboard,” she told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic, naturally, fueled the company’s growth as the world saw an increasingly distributed workforce. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had a great leap in demand for our service,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vasconcellos said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re helping companies make the best use of workspaces and giving their employees the flexibility to work however they want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That demand continues. In the third quarter of 2021, BeerOrCoffee said it saw the number of bookings made on its marketplace grow 243% compared to the previous quarter. It declined to reveal hard revenue figures, though.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240542" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240542" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2240542 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/beerorcoffee.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/beerorcoffee.jpg 953w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/beerorcoffee.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/beerorcoffee.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/beerorcoffee.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/beerorcoffee.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/beerorcoffee.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240542" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BeerOrCoffee</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to OfficePass, the startup also offers private “hubs,” or office spaces, with flexible terms. The benefit to companies, it says, is that they don’t need to invest in infrastructure such as furniture, internet and cleaning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BeerOrCoffee practices what it preaches. Its team (currently made up of 82 people) has operated in over five countries since day one, noted Vasconcellos. While it is currently focused on Brazil only, it eventually plans to expand across Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hernan Kazah, managing partner and co-founder of Kaszek, says his firm has “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">always been very impressed by the high-quality network of offices BeerOrCoffee was building and the great feedback they were getting” from some of its portfolio companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic convinced the firm that the trend towards a more flexible working model was here to stay so Kaszek reached out to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vasconcellos with interest in investing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s important to point out that BeerOrCoffee does not operate as a direct opponent with similar offerings such as coworking networks, noted Kazah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The co-working networks are partners and BeerOrCoffee is an asset light company,” he said. “As a marketplace, it does not own or directly operate its supply, but rather offer the product and technology necessary for its clients to find and manage their workspace and real estate solutions. This also allows them to bring new demand to the workspaces, providing a better and the cheapest channel of customer acquisition for them and allowing them to add value in their offering by being plugged into BeerOrCoffee’s network.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Civil society has been poring over the detail of the European Commission&#8217;s proposal for a risk-based framework for regulating applications of artificial intelligence which was proposed by the EU&#8217;s executive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">back in April</a>.</p>
<p>The verdict of over a hundred civil society organizations is that the draft legislation falls far short of protecting fundamental rights from AI-fuelled harms like scaled discrimination and blackbox bias &#8212; and they&#8217;ve <a href="https://edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Political-statement-on-AI-Act.pdf">published a call for major revisions</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We specifically recognise that AI systems exacerbate structural imbalances of power, with harms often falling on the most marginalised in society. As such, this collective statement sets out the call of 11[5] civil society organisations towards an Artificial Intelligence Act that foregrounds fundamental rights,&#8221; they write, going on to identify nine &#8220;goals&#8221; (each with a variety of suggested revisions) in the full statement of recommendations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240596" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Commission, which drafted the legislation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/">billed the AI regulation</a> as a framework for &#8220;trustworthy&#8221;, &#8220;human-centric&#8221; artificial intelligence. However it risks veering rather closer to an enabling framework for data-driven abuse, per the civil society groups&#8217; analysis &#8212; given the lack of the essential checks and balances to actually prevent automated harms.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s statement was drafted by European Digital Rights (EDRi), Access Now, Panoptykon Foundation, epicenter.works, AlgorithmWatch, European Disability Forum (EDF), Bits of Freedom, Fair Trials, PICUM, and ANEC &#8212; and has been signed by a full 115 not-for-profits from across Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>The advocacy groups are hoping their recommendations will be picked up by the European Parliament and Council as the co-legislators continue debating &#8212; and amending &#8212; the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) proposal ahead of any final text being adopted and applied across the EU.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="12Yl150wPP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">Europe lays out plan for risk-based AI rules to boost trust and uptake</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out plan for risk-based AI rules to boost trust and uptake&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/embed/#?secret=12Yl150wPP" data-secret="12Yl150wPP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Key suggestions from the civil society organizations include the need for the regulation to be amended to have a flexible, future-proofed approach to assessing AI-fuelled risks &#8212; meaning it would allow for updates to the list of use-cases that are considered unacceptable (and therefore prohibited) and those that the regulation merely limits, as well as the ability to expand the (currently fixed) list of so-called &#8220;high risk&#8221; uses.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s proposal to categorizing AI risks is too &#8220;rigid&#8221; and poorly designed (the groups&#8217; statement literally calls it &#8220;dysfunctional&#8221;) to keep pace with fast-developing, iterating AI technologies and changing use cases for data-driven technologies, in the NGOs&#8217; view.</p>
<p>&#8220;This approach of ex ante designating AI systems to different risk categories does not consider that the level of risk also depends on the context in which a system is deployed and cannot be fully determined in advance,&#8221; they write. &#8220;Further, whilst the AIA includes a mechanism by which the list of ‘high-risk’ AI systems can be updated, it provides no scope for updating ‘unacceptable’ (Art. 5) and limited risk (Art. 52) lists.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, although Annex III can be updated to add new systems to the list of high-risk AI systems, systems can only be added within the scope of the existing eight area headings. Those headings cannot currently be modified within the framework of the AIA. These rigid aspects of the framework undermine the lasting relevance of the AIA, and in particular its capacity to respond to future developments and emerging risks for fundamental rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>They have also called out the Commission for a lack of ambition in framing prohibited use-cases of AI &#8212; urging a &#8220;full ban&#8221; on all social scoring scoring systems; on all remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces (not just narrow limits on how law enforcement can use the tech); on all emotion recognition systems; on all discriminatory biometric categorisation; on all AI physiognomy; on all systems used to predict future criminal activity; and on all systems to profile and risk-assess in a migration context &#8212; arguing for prohibitions &#8220;on all AI systems posing an unacceptable risk to fundamental rights&#8221;.</p>
<p>On this the groups&#8217; recommendations echo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public-to-safeguard-rights-urge-eu-bodies/">earlier calls</a> for the regulation to go further and fully prohibit remote biometric surveillance &#8212; including from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/eus-top-data-protection-supervisor-urges-ban-on-facial-recognition-in-public/">EU&#8217;s data protection supervisor</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qGTALgzC8X"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public-to-safeguard-rights-urge-eu-bodies/">Ban biometric surveillance in public to safeguard rights, urge EU bodies</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The civil society groups also want regulatory obligations to apply to <em>users</em> of high risk AI systems, not just providers (developers) &#8212; calling for a mandatory obligation on users to conduct and publish a fundamental rights impact assessment to ensure accountability around risks cannot be circumvented by the regulation&#8217;s predominant focus on providers.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">After all, an AI technology that&#8217;s developed for one ostensible purpose could be applied for a different use-case that raises distinct rights risks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Hence they want explicit obligations on users of &#8220;high risk&#8221; AIs to publish impact assessments &#8212; which they say should cover potential impacts on people, fundamental rights, the environment and the broader public interest.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;While some of the risk posed by the systems listed in Annex III comes from how they are designed, significant risks stem from how they are used. This means that providers cannot comprehensively assess the full potential impact of a high-risk AI system during the conformity assessment, and therefore that users must have obligations to uphold fundamental rights as well,&#8221; they urge.</p>
<p>They also argue for transparency requirements to be extended to users of high risks systems &#8212; suggesting they should have to register the specific use of an AI system in a public database the regulation proposes to establish for providers of such system.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EU database for stand-alone high-risk AI systems (Art. 60) provides a promising opportunity for increasing the transparency of AI systems vis-à-vis impacted individuals and civil society, and could greatly facilitate public interest research. However, the database currently only contains information on high-risk systems registered by providers, without information on the context of use,&#8221; they write, warning: &#8220;This loophole undermines the purpose of the database, as it will prevent the public from finding out where, by whom and for what purpose(s) high-risk AI systems are actually used.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another recommendations addresses a key civil society criticism of the proposed framework &#8212; that it does not offer individuals rights and avenues for redress when they are negatively impacted by AI.</p>
<p>This marks a striking departure from existing EU data protection law &#8212; which confers a suite of rights on people attached to their personal data and &#8212; at least on paper &#8212; allows them to seek redress for breaches, as well as for third parties to seek redress on individuals&#8217; behalf. (Moreover, the General Data Protection Regulation includes provisions related to automated processing of personal data; with Article 22 giving people subject to decisions with a legal or similar effect which are based solely on automation a right to information about the processing; and/or to request a human review or challenge the decision.)</p>
<p>The lack of &#8220;meaning rights and redress&#8221; for people impacted by AI systems represents a gaping hole in the framework&#8217;s ability to guard against high risk automation scaling harms, the groups argue.</p>
<p>&#8220;The AIA currently does not confer individual rights to people impacted by AI systems, nor does it contain any provision for individual or collective redress, or a mechanism by which people or civil society can participate in the investigatory process of high-risk AI systems. As such, the AIA does not fully address the myriad harms that arise from the opacity, complexity, scale and power imbalance in which AI systems are deployed,&#8221; they warn.</p>
<p>They are recommending the legislated is amended to include two individual rights as a basis for judicial remedies &#8212; namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) The right not to be subject to AI systems that pose an unacceptable risk or do not comply with the Act; and</li>
<li>(b) The right to be provided with a clear and intelligible explanation, in a manner that is accessible for persons with disabilities, for decisions taken with the assistance of systems within the scope of the AIA;</li>
</ul>
<p>They also suggest a right to an &#8220;effective remedy&#8221; for those whose rights are infringed &#8220;as a result of the putting into service of an AI system&#8221;. And, as you might expect, the civil society organizations want a mechanism for public interest groups such as themselves to be able to lodge a complaint with national supervisory authorities for a breach or in relation to AI systems that undermine fundamental rights or the public interest &#8212; which they specify should trigger an investigation. (GDPR complaints simply being ignored by oversight bodies is a major problem with effective enforcement of that regime.)</p>
<p>Other recommendations in the groups&#8217; statement include the need for accessibility to be considered throughout the AI system&#8217;s lifecycle, and they call out the lack of accessibility requirements in the regulation &#8212; warning that risks leading to the development and use of AI with &#8220;further barriers for persons with disabilities&#8221;; they also want explicit limits to ensure that harmonized product safety standards which the regulation proposes to delegate to private standards bodies should only cover &#8220;genuinely technical&#8221; aspects of high risks AI systems (so that political and fundamental rights decisions &#8220;remain firmly within the democratic scrutiny of EU legislators&#8221;, as they put it); and they want requirements on AI system users and providers to apply not only when the outputs are applied within the EU but also elsewhere &#8212; &#8220;to avoid risk of discrimination, surveillance, and abuse through technologies developed in the EU&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sustainability and environmental protection has also been overlooked, per the groups&#8217; assessment.</p>
<p>On that they&#8217;re calling for &#8220;horizontal, public-facing transparency requirements on the resource consumption and greenhouse gas emission impacts of AI systems&#8221; &#8212; regardless of risk level; and covering AI system design, data management and training, application, and underlying infrastructures (hardware, data centres, etc.</p>
<p>The European Commission frequently justifies its aim of encouraging the update of AI by touting automation as a key technology for enabling the bloc&#8217;s sought for transition to a &#8220;climate-neutral&#8221; continent by 2050 &#8212; however AI&#8217;s own energy and resource consumption is a much overlooked component of these so-called &#8216;smart&#8217; systems. Without robust environmental auditing requirements also applying to AI it&#8217;s simply PR to claim that AI will provide the answer to climate change.</p>
<p>The Commission has been contacted for a response to the civil society recommendations.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/european-parliament-backs-ban-on-remote-biometric-surveillance/">Last month</a>, MEPs in the European Parliament voted to back a total ban on remote biometric surveillance technologies such as facial recognition, a ban on the use of private facial recognition databases and a ban on predictive policing based on behavioural data.</p>
<p>They also voted for a ban on social scoring systems which seek to rate the trustworthiness of citizens based on their behaviour or personality, and for a ban on AI assisting judicial decisions — another highly controversial area where automation is already been applied.</p>
<p>So MEPs are likely to take careful note of the civil society recommendations as they work on amendments to the AI Act.</p>
<p>In parallel the Council is in the process of determining its <a href="https://twitter.com/mikarv/status/1465605600843341824">negotiating mandate</a> on the regulation &#8212; and current proposals are pushing for a ban on social scoring by private companies but seeking carve outs for R&amp;D and national security uses of AI.</p>
<p>Discussions between the Commission, Parliament and Council will determine the final shape of the regulation, although the parliament must also approve the final text of the regulation in a plenary vote &#8212; so MEPs&#8217; views will play a key role.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer awareness of supply chain shortages and even earlier deals may have contributed to a slight decline in U.S. e-commerce sales during Cyber Week &#8212; the kickoff to the holiday shopping season that runs from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday. Last year, U.S. consumers spent a record <a href="https://business.adobe.com/blog/the-latest/cyber-week-online-shopping">$34.4 billion during Cyber Week</a>, up 20.7% from the year prior. But this year, that figure dropped by 1.4% to $33.9 billion in online spend, according to data from Adobe&#8217;s Digital Economy Index.</p>
<p>Adobe&#8217;s <a href="https://business.adobe.com/resources/holiday-shopping-report.html?sdid=L3XTTSTL&amp;mv=other">analysis</a> comes from data from over one trillion visits to U.S. e-commerce websites, which feature 100 million individual SKUs across 18 product categories, giving it a comprehensive window into holiday shopping trends.</p>
<p>The company noticed the declines this year starting on Black Friday. This year, retailers pulled in $8.9 billion in Black Friday online sales, down 1.3% from last year&#8217;s record of $9.03 billion &#8212; its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/27/black-friday-shopping-in-stores-drops-28percent-from-pre-pandemic-levels.html">first-ever year-over-year decline</a>. Cyber Monday 2021 sales also dropped 1.4% year-over-year to $10.7 billion &#8212; just $100 million shy of what consumers spent last year, at $10.8 billion. Meanwhile, Thanksgiving Day online sales stayed flat at $5.1 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240749" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These declines, while relatively small, represent a reverse in the usual trend of holiday shopping sales that jump up with every subsequent year. For an industry supposedly accelerated several years by the pandemic,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/covid-19-pandemic-accelerated-shift-to-e-commerce-by-5-years-new-report-says/"> according to reports</a> from last year, it&#8217;s a notable demonstration of how the long-lasting impacts of the pandemic &#8212; which now include supply chain shortages &#8212; may have played out in consumers&#8217; psyches. Worried about possible shortages, consumers may have shopped even earlier this year, Adobe says.</p>
<p>The data seems to back this up. During the month of November (Nov. 1 to Nov. 29), consumers spent $109.8 billion, a significant jump of 11.9% over last year. That means 22 days of the month have exceeded $3 billion in online spending, Adobe notes. This is a new record, as only 9 days in 2020 hit that same milestone. Plus, consumers may have shopped last month, as well, the company points out.</p>
<p>&#8220;With early deals in October, consumers were not waiting around for discounts on big shopping days like Cyber Monday and Black Friday,&#8221; said Taylor Schreiner, Director at Adobe Digital Insights, in an announcement about the Cyber Week findings. &#8220;This was further fueled by growing awareness of supply chain challenges and product availability. It spread out e-commerce spending across the months of October and November, putting us on track for a season that still will break online shopping records,&#8221; Schreiner added.</p>
<p>In other words, sales aren&#8217;t necessarily going to be down in 2021 overall, they&#8217;re just not going to be as concentrated as before. In fact, the pandemic may have may online shopping such a regular habit that now consumers are placing their holiday purchases alongside their usual activity, instead of waiting for a big Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales event as in years past.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite the declines, the peak holiday shopping period otherwise looked a lot like it would have otherwise. Cyber Monday shoppers went for the usual categories in greater numbers compared with September 2021 sales, across categories like toys (sales were up by nearly 11x the pre-season levels in Sept. 2021), gift cards (up by 7x), books (up by 7x), video games (up by 6x), and baby and toddler products (up by 6x). Appliances, including microwave ovens and small kitchen appliances, were also up 9.6x and 7.1x respectively, leading to the category&#8217;s increase of 5.6x.</p>
<p>Smartphone-driven sales were also up this year, with Cyber Monday smartphone-driven sales up 8.4% year-over-year, for example. This actually represents a change in course, however. Pre-pandemic, smartphone sales were expected to top 50% of online sales. But consumers now working from home may not need to shop from their phones as much as before, Adobe noted.</p>
<p>Although the shopping patterns look different, Adobe says it expects the overall holiday season to break a new record. It forecasts that consumers will drive 10% year-over-year growth in sales to hit $207 billion from November 1 through December 31.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What’s going on with an IPO that was expected to be a key moment for Brazilian tech companies in particular, and fintech upstarts more broadly?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brazil’s Nu Holdings, the parent company of the popular Latin American neobank Nubank, announced a reduction to the expected price of its public offering this morning. The well-funded fintech is listing in the United States and its native Brazil, and is among the final companies that TechCrunch is tracking for a 2021 debut.</p>

<hr />
<p>In its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001691493/000119312521314359/d213207df1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first F-1 filing</a>, Nubank indicated that it expected to sell its shares at a price of up to $11 apiece, raising a maximum of $3.66 billion in its public-market flotation. The company <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001691493/000119312521342848/d213207df1a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now anticipates</a> a smaller $9 per-share IPO price maximum and a $2.86 billion max raise.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220366 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The downward pricing trend is a disappointment for the company, though it will still command a strong valuation when it raises billions in its IPO. Nubank <a href="https://www.bloomberglinea.com/2021/11/29/nubank-estaria-considerando-recortar-la-valoracion-de-su-opi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is expected</a> to price its IPO on December 8.</p>
<p>What’s going on with an IPO that was expected to be a key moment for Brazilian tech companies in particular, and fintech upstarts more broadly? We unpacked the company’s new public offering valuations and dug into whether Nubank’s downward revision will matter for Brazilian startups generally. Let’s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Calculating Nubank’s new IPO worth</h2>
<p>The Nubank IPO is a little bit complex, given that the company is selling Class A shares on the United States&#8217; New York Stock Exchange and BDRs, or <a href="https://www.b3.com.br/en_us/products-and-services/solutions-for-issuers/bdrs-brazilian-depositary-receipts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazilian Depositary Receipts</a>, on its home market&#8217;s B3 stock exchange. That &#8212; and an indication of interest from a host of the company’s backers for more shares &#8212; makes for an interesting aggregate package.</p>
<p>But that cannot slow us down, so let’s get some valuations in hand to better understand the company’s new anticipated valuation.</p>
<p>In its latest filing, Nubank states that after its IPO it will have 4,608,684,459 ordinary shares outstanding, a figure that rises to 4,637,255,888 when we include equity reserved for underwriter purchase. Using that larger figure, at its IPO price range of $8 to $9, the company would be worth between $37.1 billion and $41.7 billion.</p>
<p>However, those valuations are only part of the picture. At its first IPO price range of $10 to $11, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/88023/Leading-digital-banking-platform-Nu-Holdings-files-and-sets-terms-for-a-$3-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renaissance Capital calculated</a> that on a fully diluted basis &#8212; inclusive of stock options that have vested, but have yet to be exercised, etc. &#8212; the company was worth $50.8 billion at $10.50 per share.</p>
<p>Converting that valuation to $9 per share, the top end of its new range, gives Nubank a $43.5 billion fully diluted valuation.</p>
<p>Is that number good?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As containers proliferate, developers are using them to deliver software, and depending on the environment, on prem or in the cloud, that can present a set of challenges for your users when it comes to installing the container. To help solve that issue, <a href="http://aws.com">AWS</a> announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace">AWS Marketplace</a> for Containers Anywhere today at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/?trk=direct">AWS re:Invent</a> in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The name of the product may not be the most creative, but it does describe precisely what it does. You can offer your container in the marketplace and your users can deploy it anywhere. The idea is to use the AWS Marketplace to provide a way to discover containerized applications, then subscribe to them and deploy them in an easy way to a Kubernetes cluster in any environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this launch, you can deploy third party Kubernetes applications to on-premises environments using Amazon EKS Anywhere or any customer self-managed Kubernetes cluster in on-premises environments or in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), enabling you to use a single catalog to find container images regardless of where they eventually plan to deploy,&#8221; AWS&#8217;s Channy Yun wrote <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-marketplace-for-containers-anywhere-to-deploy-your-kubernetes-cluster-in-any-environment/">in a blog post</a> announcing the new feature.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240718" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As Yun points out, this gives users all of the advantages of using the marketplace including flexible billing options, the knowledge that your application has been run through a security scan and simplified administration. One of the big advantages is the flexible licensing, which lets you deploy across different environments with changing the license.</p>
<p>&#8220;After you have subscribed to an application using this feature, you can migrate your Kubernetes applications to AWS by deploying the independent software vendor (ISV) provided Helm charts onto their Kubernetes clusters on AWS without changing their licenses,&#8221; Yun wrote.</p>
<p>AWS reports that AWS Marketplace for Containers Anywhere is available now across all regions, so long as it supports the AWS Marketplace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fundbox, a company that offers loans and financial products to small businesses, announced today it has raised $100 million in a Series D round at a valuation of $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Or more simply, the company aims to solve SMBs’ working capital needs through its credit and payments offerings. It is particularly focused on B2B-focused small businesses.</p>
<p>“We use artificial intelligence to deliver financial products that small business owners use to better run and grow their businesses,” CEO Prashant Fuloria told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240512" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) led Fundbox’s Series D financing, which brings the company’s total equity raised to $410 million since its 2013 inception. Existing backers Allianz X, Khosla Ventures and The Private Shares Fund joined new investors including Arbor Waypoint Select Fund and a suite of BNY Mellon funds managed by Newton Investment Management North America.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based <a href="https://fundbox.com/">Fundbox</a> last raised in 2019 &#8212; a $175 million Series C that valued the company at $700 million post-money. That same year, the company also opened its Dallas office, now its largest in the U.S., “to capitalize on the talent pool there,” according to Fuloria.</p>
<p>Fundbox is refreshingly transparent about its financials, at least when it comes to revenue. The startup, which saw a pandemic-related boost in business, crossed $100 million in annual revenue run rate earlier this year. Today, it is “well and truly beyond” that, Fuloria said, although it is not yet profitable as it is focused on growth, he said.</p>
<p>Since the company launched its first product in 2013, it has “connected with” over 325,000 small businesses and transacted over $2.5 billion in working capital, the executive added. In 2021, Fundbox tripled its new customer acquisition rate. But the majority of its revenue comes from existing customers, who Fuloria describes as “incredibly loyal.” He believes one of the company’s biggest differentiators &#8212; besides its use of AI and data &#8212; is that it is focused on SMBs whose customers are other businesses, rather than consumers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, Fundbox works with SMBs that serve consumers like restaurants, such as businesses supplying food or companies supplying cleaning and staffing services to these restaurants.</p>
<p>“These B2B SMBs have the same challenges as everybody else except that they invoice their clients and then they wait to get paid,” Fuloria told TechCrunch. “All of this capital tied up in unpaid receivables is a huge drag on those SMBs. So one of the things that Fundbox does is provide tools to unlock that working capital that&#8217;s tied up in unpaid invoices, which actually adds up to over a trillion dollars in the U.S. alone.” Customers, he added, can receive approval in minutes, with access to capital as soon as the next business day.</p>
<p>Khosla led Fundbox’s Series A in 2014 and founding partner and managing director David Weiden said his firm was initially &#8212; and remains &#8212; impressed with Fundbox’s founders’ ability to recognize there were “dramatic increases in the availability of relevant data in the small business market.”</p>
<p>“Many companies talk about data and using AI; ironically, only a few have any data that demonstrates the actual effectiveness of their approach,” he wrote via email. “Fundbox, including over the exceptional pandemic period, delivered strong results and are on a path to continued growth and scale.”</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s customers range from sole proprietors with a few dozen employees and as little as a few hundred thousand dollars a year or businesses with as much as a few million dollars a year in annual revenue. Fundbox asks its customers to connect with it via some aspect of their transactional system, such as their invoicing app or even their bank account.</p>
<p>“We look at these business transactions sitting in their systems and put together what we call a business graph where you can imagine the nodes of the graph being all these small businesses that are trading with each other, with the customers being their vendors and the connections being their transactions,” Fuloria explained. “And that graph becomes our picture of the small business economy to derive signals or features that can be used to assess the risk of a B2B transaction or a B2B small business.”</p>

<p>The company then uses those risk assessments to provide tools, such as working capital on tap or the ability to get instant funding against an invoice. It also integrates with other companies&#8217; technology. For example, it&#8217;s partnered with Intuit and is natively integrated inside of QuickBooks. It also shows up in places like FreshBooks&#8217; accounting software or in Synchrony&#8217;s merchant center (Synchrony is an investor in Fundbox).</p>
<p>The small end of the small businesses are often ignored by large banks, Fuloria contends, because the average bank spends over $3,500 (largely in human capital) in assessing a small business’s risk. For loans that aren’t much more than that, it’s not exactly worth it. However, to be clear, Fundbox says it offers up to $150,000 in lines of credit.</p>
<p>“Our focus on using AI to make these decisions really helps us shine because more than 99% of all our decisions are completely automated without any human involvement whatsoever,” Fuloria said. “And that lets us really scale and serve customers very, very efficiently.”</p>
<p>While primarily having served as a lender, Fundbox is now expanding into payments and membership-based offerings (with the intent to generate a subscription revenue stream). The company recently launched Flex Pay, which is designed to provide small business owners with additional payment options and greater flexibility for business expenses.</p>
<p>For example, Fundbox Line of Credit customers now get three extra days to pay those expenses. Repayment options include a bank account, credit card or Line of Credit draw, essentially providing small business owners with another tool to buy now, pay later, according to Fuloria.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, next year Fundbox plans to develop a product aimed specifically at entrepreneurs with multiple small businesses as well as new businesses that lack the financial history to access capital through traditional means.<br />
Shrirang Apte, VP of HOOPP, believes Fundbox’s performance this year speaks to the market opportunity “in disrupting the highly underserved world of small business financing, which has traditionally lagged behind consumer financing innovations.”</p>
<p>Fundbox plans to use its new capital to expand its 300-person team, customer acquisition and expanding its product offerings. It recently hired a handful of new execs, including two former Capital One veterans — Khary Scott and Shawn Haigh to serve as VP and head of partnerships and VP of growth marketing, respectively.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon today <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/introducing-the-aws-energy-competency-partners/">announced</a> a new program that will formally identify AWS Partners who develop specialized solutions aimed at the energy industry. The new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/energy/partners/?partner-solutions-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.partnerNameLower&amp;partner-solutions-cards.sort-order=asc&amp;awsf.partner-solutions-filter-partner-type-storage=*all&amp;awsf.partner-solutions-filter-partner-usecase-storage=*all&amp;awsf.partner-solutions-filter-partner-location-storage=*all">AWS Energy Competency Program</a>, as it&#8217;s called, will identify these specialized partners who have already demonstrated the technical expertise and customer success that can help energy producers around the world build and implement AWS-powered solutions using the latest technology, while also navigating the transition to a more sustainable energy future.</p>
<p>Today, many AWS Partners work with the energy industry to help them take advantage of AWS technology, including for managing the operation of oil and gas assets from the exploration phases, to the gathering, processing, transportation, management, and maintenance of those operations, as well as those in the renewable and sustainable space. These industries are now accelerating the adoption of solutions like cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML), says Amazon.</p>
<p>The new AWS Energy Competency Program will help the industry better identify the AWS Partners who have the specific expertise when it comes to working with the world&#8217;s energy producers, including those that can help them develop a portfolio that includes sustainable and renewable energy assets.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240708" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At launch, the program includes 32 global partners who also worked with AWS to help develop the new program for energy producers. This group includes those who can help with specialized solution areas, industry verticals, or workloads. This is now one of the toughest designations an AWS Partner can achieve, notes Amazon, as partners have to undergo a rigorous technical validation related to energy industry-specific best practices.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240722" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240722" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240722" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AWS-Energy-Competency-reInvent-Launch-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="398" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AWS-Energy-Competency-reInvent-Launch-2.png 1344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AWS-Energy-Competency-reInvent-Launch-2.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AWS-Energy-Competency-reInvent-Launch-2.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AWS-Energy-Competency-reInvent-Launch-2.png?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AWS-Energy-Competency-reInvent-Launch-2.png?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AWS-Energy-Competency-reInvent-Launch-2.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240722" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>One partner, Slalom, has been helping North American energy company TC Energy manage 44,000 kilometers of natural gas pipelines. TC Energy worked with the partner to develop a business intelligence application that uses machine learning to help customers optimize gas scheduling and throughput. Another partner, Unleash Live, an AI video analytics provider, helped industrial engineering solutions provider Worley, which operates wind farms, solar parks, hydropower, natural gas projects, and more. Worsley is using Unleash Live to leverage drones and computer vision for its inspections.</p>
<p>Other partners can help provide solutions that include upstream, midstream, downstream, new energies, core business applications, health, safety, and environmental, and data and analytics, says Amazon. AWS Partners now interested in joining the program can view the Validation Checklists for both <a href="https://apn-checklists.s3.amazonaws.com/competency/energy/consulting/CTpftZxbZ.html">AWS Services Partners</a> and <a href="https://apn-checklists.s3.amazonaws.com/competency/energy/technology/CTfpLeXqi.html">AWS Software</a><a href="https://apn-checklists.s3.amazonaws.com/competency/energy/technology/CTfpLeXqi.html"> Partners</a> to get started.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter updated its <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/private-information-policy-update">private information safety policy</a> this morning to ban sharing images or videos of private individuals without their consent. The platform already banned users from sharing others&#8217; personal information without permission, like their address or location, identity documents, non-public contact information, financial information or medical data. But this update makes these anti-harassment and anti-doxxing policies more robust.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Beginning today, we will not allow the sharing of private media, such as images or videos of private individuals without their consent. Publishing people&#39;s private info is also prohibited under the policy, as is threatening or incentivizing others to do so.<a href="https://t.co/7EXvXdwegG">https://t.co/7EXvXdwegG</a></p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that Twitter will require consent from all individuals in a photo or video before its posted. But if a person depicted wants the media taken down, Twitter will take it down.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we are notified by individuals depicted, or by an authorized representative, that they did not consent to having their private image or video shared, we will remove it,&#8221; Twitter wrote in its <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/private-information-policy-update">update</a>. &#8220;This policy is not applicable to media featuring public figures or individuals when media and accompanying Tweet text are shared in the public interest or add value to public discourse.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in the case of public figures, Twitter clarified that it may remove content intended for harassment in line with its existing policies against <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/abusive-behavior">abusive behavior</a>, which also ban sharing non-consensual nude images. The company also says that when deciding whether to remove content about public figures, it will assess whether this information is already available in other public media, like TV and newspapers.</p>
<p>And also, in case you didn&#8217;t use the internet yesterday, Jack <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">stepped down</a> as CEO of Twitter.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/?trk=direct">AWS re:Invent</a>, the company&#8217;s customer conference taking place in Las Vegas this week, AWS announced a new open source autoscaling tool for Kubernetes clusters called <a href="https://karpenter.sh/">Karpenter</a>.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of cloud computing is the ability to scale automatically to meet your required resource needs &#8212;  or at least that&#8217;s theory. In reality, admins managing Kubernetes clusters have had to monitor them carefully to make sure that they had the right amount of resources or avoid service breakdowns.</p>
<p>Karpenter is designed to bring that cloud computing ideal into reality. AWS&#8217;s Channy Yun <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-karpenter-an-open-source-high-performance-kubernetes-cluster-autoscaler/">writing in a blog post</a> announcing the new tool, described its advantages.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240692" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;[Karpenter] helps improve your application availability and cluster efficiency by rapidly launching right-sized compute resources in response to changing application load. Karpenter also provides just-in-time compute resources to meet your application’s needs and will soon automatically optimize a cluster’s compute resource footprint to reduce costs and improve performance,&#8221; Yun wrote.</p>
<p>It works by analyzing your Kubernetes workloads to determine what resources you will require by looking at the pods that cannot launch due to a resource limitation. It then sends information to your cloud provider to add or remove compute based on this information.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note here that as an open source tool, this is not specifically designed for AWS cloud resources and can be used to send information to any cloud provider about the underlying Kubernetes cluster. Karpenter takes advantage of <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a>, the Kubernetes package manager to determine your Kubernetes workloads. It also requires permission to provision compute resources in an automated way.</p>
<p>Karpenter is an open source tool being offered under an Apache 2.0 license and is available today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">CloudTrucks wants to use technology to help trucking entrepreneurs operate their business: The California-based startup sells business management software that helps owner-operators manage cash flow and costs, generate revenue, handle insurance, and more, and it just raised a $115 million Series B.</p>
<p>The company will use the funds to increase headcount as it expands its business, which operates in the United States. CloudTrucks is hiring in almost all areas, with a focus on engineers and data scientists to help double down on product, as well as customer service professionals to support truckers on the road. The company also wants to broaden its digital integration with brokers and shippers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cater to owner-operators and truck drivers who have one or more trucks and are managing their business while also doing the job of moving goods from point A to point B,&#8221; Tobenna Arodiogbu, co-founder and CEO of CloudTrucks, told TechCrunch. &#8220;The job of being a trucking entrepreneur is getting harder and harder. Lots of tools are being built for brokers and shippers, but not nearly enough is being done for the truck driver who&#8217;s actually doing the really hard work.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239908" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Freight movement is expected to rise from 17.4 billion tons in 2015 to 25.5 billion tons by 2045, an increase that coincides with a decrease in truck drivers. Since the 1980s, the industry has experienced high turnover rates, in large part due to low wages and the poor health effects associated with the job. Without significant changes to the business model and talent pool, the truck driver shortage is estimated to hit 160,000 drivers by 2028, according to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/autonomous-trucks-lead-the-way.html">Deloitte</a>.</p>
<p>The autonomous trucking space promises to one day alleviate these labor issues, but that shift will take place over decades and likely include integration between humans handling first- and last-mile deliveries and self-driving systems managing highway transport, according to Deloitte. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/waymo-via-is-scaling-up-autonomous-trucking-operations-in-texas-arizona-california/">Waymo Via&#8217;s transfer hub model is a perfect example of this</a>.</p>
<p>Despite future projections of a driverless world, Arodiogbu sees a market need now. There are around 350,000 owner-operator truckers in the United States, according to the nonprofit <a href="https://www.ooida.com/foundation/research/owner-operator-and-professional-employee-driver-facts/">Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association</a>, but Arodiogbu reckons the target market is actually as large as a million truck drivers. Owner-operators usually own one truck and either lease onto a carrier or operate under their own authority, but CloudTrucks also targets entrepreneurs who have up to five trucks, as well as truckers who are contractors.</p>
<p>Before founding CloudTrucks, Arodiogbu started Scotty Labs, a startup focused on building remote operations and autonomous driving solutions for the trucking industry, which was later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/doordash-acquires-autonomous-driving-startup-scotty-labs/">acquired by DoorDash</a>. While running the company, Arodiogbu gained insights into the problems truck drivers had with managing their businesses and why the industry has been attracting fewer drivers, resulting in today&#8217;s truck driver shortage. These issues include things like trouble making revenue-generating decisions, the rising costs of insurance and compliance, and how long it takes to get paid.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just a job of driving, but it&#8217;s everything else that people have to manage,&#8221; said Arodiogbu. &#8220;An increasing number of truck drivers just don&#8217;t want to be company employees anymore, right? They want to take control of their time. They want to determine when they&#8217;re home and when they&#8217;re on the road. They want to determine when they get to spend time with their families.&#8221;</p>
<p>CloudTrucks launched three products over the past year to help solve trucking business challenges. CT Cash helps drivers get paid faster and alleviate cash flow constraints with instant pay and cash card options, as well as cash advances, so drivers don&#8217;t have to worry about not having enough funds for fuel or maintenance.</p>
<p>Flex, which is designed for small trucking businesses that are already managing their own insurance and compliance, helps with back office support. This product came from an existing product line called Virtual Carrier, which essentially puts drivers under CloudTrucks&#8217; authority. Included in this is a package deal where CloudTrucks manages everything for the driver, including compliance and insurance.</p>
<p>Included in both Flex and the Virtual Carrier is a &#8220;schedule optimizer&#8221; feature, which Arodiogbu described as a dispatcher in your pocket. CloudTrucks has the schedule and preferences for every driver in its system, so it&#8217;s able to send suggestions for available loads that can help maximize revenue given preferences and the states they&#8217;re willing to drive to. Drivers can book those loads within the platform, which helps simplify the whole process.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s Business Intelligence, a dashboard that gives drivers a breakdown of their performance, personal expenses and revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t really improve something that you don&#8217;t track, so with that in mind, we wanted to have a product that was very simple for a trucking entrepreneur to just look at the CloudTrucks app and, at a glance, see exactly how their business is performing,&#8221; said Arodiogbu.</p>
<p>As far as how CloudTrucks&#8217; business is performing, the company said its revenue has increased 9.5x since it raised its $20.5 million Series A in December 2020. The startup also said it&#8217;s seen the number of loads completed on its platform grow 8x since last year, but declined to provide a base for either of those increases. Arodiogbu did say that the company completes thousands of loads around the country per month.</p>
<p>CloudTrucks&#8217; Series B was led by Tiger Global with participation from Menlo Ventures, as well as investment from Flexport and angel investors Michael Ovitz and Opendoor CEO Eric Wu, and brought the startup&#8217;s total funding amount to $141.6 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Holoride, the Audi-backed startup that&#8217;s creating an in-vehicle virtual reality entertainment system designed for passengers, has begun publicly selling its <a href="https://www.holoride.com/newsroom/holoride-releases-cryptocurrency">Ride cryptocurrency token</a>.</p>
<p>The launch of the crypto is the latest move by Holoride to build up its extended reality (XR) ecosystem of games and experiences created by a community of developers. Vehicle passengers keen to experience virtual worlds or play games — all of which are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/holorides-in-car-vr-solution-is-the-best-thing-at-ces-2019/">in tune with the movement the car</a> they&#8217;re riding in — will have to use the Ride utility token to make purchases.</p>
<p>Holoride is aiming to offer its XR system in private vehicles next year, although details of which brands and when it might launch are scant. The company had previously said it would launch in summer 2022, but has since pulled back on specific timing for next year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239598" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the last few years, we have created a proprietary tech stack that connects car manufactures and content creators with passengers,&#8221; Nils Wollny, CEO and co-founder of Holoride, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Enhancing our platform with blockchain technology and launching our own Ride token is the logical next step in order to supercharge our ecosystem and allow for a fair and transparent participation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Back in May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/holoride-deploys-elrond-blockchain-and-nfts-in-prep-for-2022-market-launch/">Holoride announced it would be integrating Elrond&#8217;s blockchain</a> into its tech stack and using NFTs to incentivize developers to create more content on the platform while also attracting passengers who want to personalize their in-car experience. Both the NFTs and Ride are built on Elrond, and both can be used for transactions in Holoride&#8217;s ecosystem. The NFT is unique and cannot be replicated, whereas the Ride cyrptocurrency is interchangeable, as with any type of currency.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will enable users and content creators to mint unique NFTs based on their experiences in exchange for RIDE tokens,&#8221; said Wollny. &#8220;The resulting NFTs can then be bought and sold using Ride.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Incorporating blockchain, NFTs and cryptocurrency into the Holoride platform isn&#8217;t just a way to get attention with nebulous buzz words. Holoride is taking a bet on its ability to extend reality from the car seat to the metaverse, where the digital and virtual worlds intertwine with physical and augmented reality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That bet could pay off. However, Ride can only be used to buy games and entertainment within Holoride and cannot be traded with other currency, which could limit its reach or stunt growth.</p>
<p>A slew of big names have begun announcing metaverse projects, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">Facebook which went so far as to rename its parent company Meta</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/niantic-raises-300m-at-a-9b-valuation-to-build-the-real-world-metaverse/">Niantic (the makers of Pokémon Go)</a>, Amazon, Roblox, Unity Software and Microsoft. Meanwhile, as the building blocks of the metaverse begin to reach some semblance of maturity, so does the self-driving ride-hailing industry, with companies like Waymo, Cruise, Motional/Lyft and WeRide on the path to commercialization.</p>
<p>Wollny has told TechCrunch that he wants Holoride to be the &#8220;transportation company for the metaverse.&#8221; Even though Holoride will initially target private vehicles, the end game is to integrate into self-driving vehicles, giving passengers with plenty of down time a way to stay entertained.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.holoride.com/newsroom/terranet-and-holoride-announcement">Holoride announced a partnership with NEVS</a>, a Swedish electric car manufacturer, to integrate its tech into the automaker&#8217;s PONS mobility system, a self-driving shared mobility concept featuring Sango, a purpose-built AV. Holoride&#8217;s tech would continue to be bolstered by software development company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/audi-spinoff-holoride-collects-e10m-in-series-a-led-by-terranet-ab/"> Terranet&#8217;s VoxelFlow technology</a>, which relies on a combination of vehicle sensors to calculate the distance, direction and speed of an object. This informs Holoride&#8217;s platform in real time so that the user experience within the game is matched by the actual movements of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Ride is being sold on <a href="https://maiarlaunchpad.com/">Elrond&#8217;s Maiar Launchpad</a> (Crypto launchpads provide a way to raise capital for new projects, give investors time to get early and discounted access to token sales and help build a community around a project). Holoride will initially circulate 130 million tokens at $0.04 each, and there is a max supply of 1 billion tokens. 200 million tokens have already been sold at $0.02 via a private sale, which has since concluded, and another 50 million had been sold publicly before the launch of the crypto. In total, this would have brought the company $5 million.</p>
<p>The Holoride team mainly plans to use the proceeds of the Ride tokens for content creation, but will also allocate funds towards development, marketing and legal and security audits. As far as Ride token allocation goes, 25% will be filtered throughout the XR ecosystem Holoride is creating, which includes ecosystem supporters, key partnerships and growth opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular, developers, content <span style="font-weight: 400;">creators, automotive manufacturers, mobility providers, operational supporters or advisors and ambassadors,&#8221; said Wollny. </span></p>
<p>Another 20% of the total tokens will be allocated to the &#8220;community,&#8221; which Wollny says is reserved for early contributors from the crypto community, including beta users, technical audits and code reviews. Only 5% goes towards &#8220;public sale,&#8221; which means Holoride fans, supporters and believers, and the rest goes to selected financial and strategic investors, equity investors, Holoride&#8217;s treasury and the Holoride team.</p>
<p>Aside from purchasing experiences and other virtual items associated with them, Wollny said token holders will initially be able to use them towards ecosystem governance, as well as community benefits like subscriptions, upgrades and special events. The tokens will also be used to incentivize users into a &#8220;ride to play to earn&#8221; cycle where they can earn extra benefits for taking a sustainable ride in an electric car or sharing specific data, for example. In addition, content creators and car manufacturers may receive Ride as partner royalties, says Wollny.</p>
<p>Holoride is only a year or so away from launch, but it&#8217;ll need some serious scale to get to the point where such an involved ecosystem makes sense. At the very least, it might serve as a microcosm for how the metaverse will rely on the underlying principles of blockchain technology, like transparency, security, interoperability and participation. Wollny is optimistic that Holoride has the potential to be at the heart of the movement for how the metaverse will be built and how its users will manage their identity or create and capture value.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that everyone is all over the metaverse, cryptocurrencies and NFTs, the puzzle pieces might fit a little better,&#8221; said Wollny. &#8220;However, many things are still unsolved and the best it yet to come.&#8221;<b><i></i></b><b><i><br />

					<description><![CDATA[In all, Sapphire has brought in $3.7 billion in capital in the last 12 months.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sapphireventures.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sapphire Ventures</a> will inject $2 billion of newly raised capital into growth-stage enterprise companies from two new funds, Sapphire Ventures Fund VI and Sapphire Ventures Opportunity Fund III.</p>
<p>The new funding represents the venture capital firm’s largest raise to date, Nino Marakovic, CEO of Sapphire, told TechCrunch, giving it more than $8.8 billion in assets under management with team members across Austin, London, New York, Palo Alto and San Francisco.</p>
<p>In all, Sapphire has brought in $3.7 billion in capital in the last 12 months, which includes a separate <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sapphire-ventures-closes-1-7b-across-multiple-funds-and-begins-to-deploy-new-capital-301221841.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.7 billion</a> announced in February that will go into enterprise technology companies, Marakovic said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240424" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2240438" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240438" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2240438" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nino_Marakovic.jpg" alt="Nino Marakovic, Sapphire Ventures" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nino_Marakovic.jpg 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nino_Marakovic.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nino_Marakovic.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nino_Marakovic.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nino_Marakovic.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nino_Marakovic.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nino_Marakovic.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nino_Marakovic.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nino_Marakovic.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240438" class="wp-caption-text">Nino Marakovic, CEO of Sapphire Ventures. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sapphire Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>“Companies are raising larger rounds and that requires us to write larger checks to lead and be an active participant,” he added. “We pride ourselves on being an active adviser, and that  is our differentiator.”</p>
<p>Marakovic expects both funds to last through the end of 2022. Fund VI will invest in 20 to 30 companies, while the Opportunity Fund targets a smaller number of investments but larger check sizes.</p>
<p>Recently, Sapphire invested in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/verbit-lands-250m-series-e-at-a-2b-valuation-to-double-down-on-its-acquisition-strategy/">Verbit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/pubnub-raises-65m-to-build-and-run-data-streams-for-messaging-presence-and-other-real-time-aspects-of-virtual-spaces/">PubNub</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/yugabyte-stores-up-188m-more-for-its-open-source-distributed-sql-database-model-now-valued-at-1-3b/">Yugabyte</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/medable-2-1b-valuation-tiger-blackstone-gsr-clinical-trials/">Medable</a>.</p>
<p>Sapphire was founded in 1996 and invests at the Series B stage to IPO in the U.S., Europe and Israel. The firm is investing in value-added resources and is expanding in Europe and Israel with plans to open an office in Berlin and Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>It has 40 investment professionals investing in areas including enterprise SaaS, infrastructure software, fintech, healthcare IT and crypto-infrastructure. Notable investments by the firm include DocuSign, LinkedIn, Fitbit, Box, Sumo Logic and 23andMe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far in 2021, Sapphire invested $990 billion in capital, up from $970 million in 2020, and added 26 new companies into its portfolio. Among the firm’s 165 portfolio companies, there were over 70 exits, including 30 IPOs and 45 acquisitions.</p>
<p>With the new funds, the firm also announced it rounded out its leadership team, including Cristina Hohlman as CFO, Ellie Javadi as CMO and Kevin Burke as vice president of strategy;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Marakovic called today’s investment environment one where VC firms have to “adapt and do diligence ahead of the fundraise.”</p>
<p>“It used to be that you met with the company first,” he added. “If you are already domain experts, it is easier because you meet with the founders early on, before they raise, and build a relationship with them so you are ready for when they do raise.”</p>
<p>He expects more investments to go into software and business applications, with fintech and health IT also being “great opportunities,” and blockchain across all of those. Marakovic referred to blockchain as “the fundamental new building block we have high hopes for as we invest against web3.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cycode.com/">Cycode</a>, a startup that helps businesses secure their DevOps pipelines and software supply chains, today announced that it has raised a $56 million Series B funding round led by <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/">Insight Partners</a>. <a href="https://www.ylventures.com/">YL Ventures</a>, which led the company&#8217;s seed round, also participated in this round, which brings the total investment into the company to $81 million, including the $20 million Series A round it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/cycode-raises-20m-to-secure-devops-pipelines/">announced</a> about half a year ago.</p>
<p>The company argues that this is one of the largest funding rounds in the application security space. In part, that&#8217;s surely driven by the fact that the company was also able to show its investors some impressive growth numbers, with its ARR increasing 7x in the first three quarters of this year.</p>
<p>Cycode co-founder and CEO Lior Levy noted that the company&#8217;s growth is driven by an increased awareness of supply chain attacks and incidents, including the SolarWinds breach, as well as President Biden&#8217;s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">executive order</a> on improving the U.S.&#8217;s cybersecurity stance, which specifically calls out supply chain attacks. And while Cycode <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/cycode-raises-4-6m-seed-round-to-keep-your-source-code-safe/">launched</a> with a focus on securing the source code of a business&#8217; applications, today&#8217;s trend toward &#8220;infrastructure as code&#8221; has allowed it to significantly widen its scope.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240309" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Code has become the engine of the organization,&#8221; Levy said. &#8220;As it automates the entire software development lifecycle, it really created a need to look at everything from a holistic perspective, which we do.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240343" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240343" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2240343" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png" alt="" width="1024" height="594" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png 7064w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png?resize=1536,891 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png?resize=2048,1188 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2240343" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cycode</p></div></p>
<p>Levy noted that Cycode&#8217;s userbase includes Fortune 100 companies and small startups with fewer than 100 employees. &#8220;All of them have one thing in common: they all develop software and they all have software as part of their core, whether it&#8217;s being a software-enabled business or as a vendor. But given that everyone does software today, everyone is a potential customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>In recent months, Cycode launched its Knowledge Graph, which helps it connect all of a company&#8217;s DevOps tools and infrastructure services to build a map of a customer&#8217;s potential attack surfaces. Levy noted that this now allows the company to think like an attacker by being able to identify issues across a company&#8217;s software pipeline instead of only focusing on individual services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;Simply put, software supply chains are highly vulnerable absent thoughtful security measures,&#8221; said Jon Rosenbaum, principal at Insight Partners. &#8220;Cycode’s leadership in securing DevOps pipelines meets developers where they are while giving CISO’s peace of mind. There has been a continually increasing demand for Cycode’s solutions, and we’re excited to continue to support the business as it doubles down on R&amp;D and go-to-market efforts into the ScaleUp phase of growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cycode currently has just under 60 employees, with plans for doubling that by the middle of next year, including an expanded sales and marketing team in the U.S.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The ordering system is specifically designed so food distributors can launch mobile apps and websites to accept orders and payments online.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A majority of restaurants and grocery stores still order food from distributors via voicemail and pay with paper checks, without paper trails or the ability to access order history. <a href="https://www.usepepper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pepper</a> wants to change that.</p>
<p>The New York-based company developed an ordering system specifically for food distributors that supports catalogues of over 100,000 items and enables these companies to launch mobile apps and websites so that they can accept orders and payments online. This method, on average, increased revenue for customers by 15%, company CEO Bowie Cheung told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Cheung co-founded Pepper with Chetan Narain and Ivana Tesanovic in 2019. Cheung and Narain met at UberEats, where they saw technology infiltrate restaurants, yet not so much into the day-to-day workflows of the food distributors that worked with them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240324" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“People care about food waste and sustainability, but it is difficult to envision any operational change when the industry is so fragmented,” Cheung said. “We watched how rapidly technology went from non-existent to prolific in restaurants. There are 25,000 food distributors in the U.S. and almost no technology built for them. That is a hole we can fill.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pepper, a platform for restaurants and suppliers, pivots to deliver food to consumers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/pepper-a-platform-for-restaurants-and-suppliers-pivots-to-deliver-food-to-consumers/embed/#?secret=Fy5aE8YZhR" data-secret="Fy5aE8YZhR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In 2020 to address needs during the global pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/pepper-a-platform-for-restaurants-and-suppliers-pivots-to-deliver-food-to-consumers/">the company started Pepper Pantry</a>, a consumer-facing portal for customers to place orders directly with food distributors and have them delivered to their homes.</p>
<p>Now today, Pepper announced $16 million in Series A funding to expand what it started two years ago as it aims to work with over 25,000 restaurants and grocery stores in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>Index Ventures led the round and was joined by Greylock Partners, Imaginary Ventures, BoxGroup, Moving Capital and Brett Schulman. The latest round brings the total capital raised to date to $20 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pepper is pursuing what we think is the next big opportunity in the restaurant industry: enabling restaurants to purchase $200 billion of annual food inventory digitally instead of via phone and email,” said Damir Becirovic, principal at Index Ventures, and Pepper investor, in a written statement. “Pepper has built a great platform that they provide to food distributors, essentially enabling a Shopify-like e-commerce storefront for them.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.firstresearch.com/industry-research/Food-Wholesalers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. wholesale food distribution industry</a> has a combined annual revenue of about $991 billion. To meet that demand, Cheung plans to inject the new funding into three areas: onboarding more food distributors in the U.S. and Canada, product development and sales and marketing. He also plans to double the size of Pepper’s 24 employees in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Pepper prides itself on being low friction for customers to get up and running, in some cases without upfront costs, something Cheung said was not possible with some of Pepper’s competitors.</p>
<p>The company charges on a monthly basis based on the number of active users and can get customers going in about two months compared to hundreds of thousands of dollars in upfront costs and a six- to 12-month timeline from other companies, he added.</p>
<p>He believes that is why Pepper was able to recruit a network, in one year, that represents 20,000 unique buyers that bring in over $1 billion in sales altogether.</p>
<p>“For some supplies, that is enough friction, which is why they haven’t launched digital operations to date,” he added. “We can get our technology up quickly, so we don’t have to charge those fees. We also don’t charge ongoing consulting fees and are building out a library of features so customers can pick and choose what they need.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Developers often build machine learning models with the help of a third-party data set, which they add to their model, and they&#8217;re done. But data isn&#8217;t always static. That means building some sort of pipeline to collect the data at regular intervals, creating extra work.</p>
<p>Today at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/?trk=direct">AWS re:Invent in Las Vegas</a>, the company announced the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/">AWS Data Exchange for APIs</a>, a new tool that updates changing third-party APIs automatically, removing the need for building the updating mechanism.</p>
<p>AWS&#8217;s Alex Casalboni writing <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/data-exchange-for-apis-find-subscribe-use-third-party-apis-consistent-authentication/">in a company blog</a> post pointed out that by using an API, data scientists can get an answer to a specific question with changing information like a stock price quickly, eliminating the need for the pipeline. That&#8217;s great for a single API, but if you&#8217;re using multiple APIs, that creates a new set of problems around communication, authentication and governance related to the APIs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240670" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s where AWS Data Exchange for APIs comes in to help solve those issues. &#8220;Today, I’m happy to announce the general availability of AWS Data Exchange for APIs, a new capability that lets you find, subscribe to, and use third-party APIs with a consistent access using AWS SDKs, as well as consistent AWS-native authentication and governance,&#8221; Casalboni wrote in the blog post.</p>
<p>The key part here is that this is AWS-specific like many tools announced this week. If you are building your application or data model on top of AWS, this tool lets you access AWS software development kits (SDKs) and use AWS authentication and governance tooling to access and update third party APIs in this automated way.</p>
<p>Those third-party data providers get something here too. By listing their APIs in the Data Exchange catalog, more developers can see and use their data sources. &#8220;As a data provider, you make your API discoverable by millions of AWS customers by listing it in the AWS Data Exchange catalog using an OpenAPI specification and fronting it with an Amazon API Gateway endpoint,&#8221; Casalboni explained.</p>
<p>Third party providers offering data through the data exchange include Variety Business Intelligence, IMDb and Foursquare, among many others. The tool is available for both developers and API providers starting today.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chicago-based company, formerly known as WatchTower, </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/exclusive-watchtower-becomes-threeflow-raises-8m-series-a/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $8 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for its Series A round in January 2021. The latest round brings its total venture funding to $53 million since its founding in 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the Series A, the company has grown from roughly 20 to 84 employees and hired four new executives to oversee engineering, sales, marketing, and product, CEO Ryan Sachtjen told TechCrunch in an interview. Sachtjen said the company will use the proceeds from its latest round to double its employee base in 2022 across these functions.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240462" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A big part of our plan progression here for next year is making investments on the engineering side so that carrier integrations are more widely adopted,” Sachtjen said. The company will also announce a broader API strategy to strengthen connectivity with insurance carriers next year, which Sachtjen expects to be a major growth driver.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ThreeFlow’s product falls within a new category of software that it calls a “benefits placement solution” for insurance brokerages. Brokerages aggregate plans from insurance carriers and sell them to companies. In the past year, ThreeFlow facilitated over $600 million in transactions &#8212; double that of the year prior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brokers using ThreeFlow represent 7,600 employers and 40 insurance carriers across 34 US states today, and the company plans to continue its geographic expansion. The company now has over 100 enterprise contracts, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/exclusive-watchtower-becomes-threeflow-raises-8m-series-a/">up from 28 in January</a>.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the medical, dental, and vision insurance markets are “very mature,” Sachtjen said, companies are now looking to grow their offerings by adding new plans for employees including fertility, mental health, and financial wellness benefits, presenting new opportunities for ThreeFlow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brokers require a high degree of customization in their sales process because of the complexities of designing plans suitable for a variety of clients, a need that Sachtjen said has historically been filled by outdated, highly-manual systems like Microsoft Office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ThreeFlow’s solution hinges on three key tenets, per Sachtjen &#8212; it is purpose-built for brokers’ specific needs, supports the entire placement process end-to-end, and serves as a true shared system of record between insurance carriers and brokers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ThreeFlow’s deep relationships with brokers and carriers provide it with a trove of data it plans to leverage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We help pull that information together and provide it back to leadership on both the broker and carrier side, to help them make better decisions fundamentally at a leadership level, and to actually help them engage together more effectively between carriers and brokers, because there is a very dependent relationship structure between the two,” Sachtjen said.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest funding will support hiring staff and enable new data-as-a-service markets powered by quantum sensing, founder and CEO of Q-CTRL Michael Biercuk said. It also will continue to invest in developing its quantum control for quantum computing and quantum sensing for acceleration, gravity and magnetic fields, Biercuk added. To date, the company has raised more than $43 million (60 million AUD) in total capital. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Q-CTRL’s vision has always been to enable all applications of quantum technology. This new fundraising is critical in realizing our mission to deliver real value to the space, defense, and commercial sectors,” said Biercuk. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240590" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Q-CTRL provides infrastructure software that improves quantum computing performance by addressing the most pressing challenge in the field – hardware error and instability, Biercuk told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p>The Series B financing event comes on the heels of major technical and product development recently announced by Q-CTRL. It includes technical demonstrations using core Q-CTRL technology, known as quantum logic gates, to improve the performance of quantum algorithms executed on real quantum computers by 2680%.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company is also developing space-qualified quantum sensors and exploration technologies for Earth, the Moon and Mars with a consortium of Australian firms led by <a href="https://fleetspace.com/">Fleet Space Technologies</a>. Its quantum sensing clients include <a href="https://www.advancednavigation.com/">Advanced Navigation</a>, <a href="https://www.defence.gov.au/">the Australian Department of Defense</a>, Air Force Research Lab, and <a href="https://www.industry.gov.au/policies-and-initiatives/australian-space-agency">the Australian Space Agency</a>. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The team’s impressive quantum control software suite enables speed and agility at a moment of rapid acceleration for the entire quantum industry,” said Lewis Pinault, Partner of Airbus Ventures based in Tokyo. “We’re particularly excited about Q-CTRL’s widening span of advanced applications and solutions, including lunar development, geospatial intelligence and Earth observation, all increasingly critical in the global effort to address the accelerating planetary system crises we now face.”</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its revenue in FY2020/2021 was up 3X year on year, and the company generated over $9 million in sales and booking for its new quantum sensor business, which only commenced in late 2020, Biercuk said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Like most companies, the pandemic caused a substantial pause in growth, which resulted in significant losses in its planned international sales and marketing engagement, Biercuk said. Despite this, the company has grown from about 20 to 60 on its team since January 2020, Biercuk continued. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He added that the company operates a large team of quantum control specialists with over 30 PhD-level researchers driving its research and product development in quantum computing and quantum sensing.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company recently launched <a href="https://q-ctrl.com/products/black-opal/">Black Opal</a>, an interactive and accessible online learning platform that enables anyone to learn quantum computing. Biercuk said that it surpassed its ten days sales target in 2.5 days. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In 2017, Q-CTRL was spun off from the University of Sydney, where Biercuk works as a Quantum Physics and Quantum Technology professor. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.abacum.io/">Abacum</a>, a SaaS maker geared toward upgrading mid-sized companies&#8217; financial planning and analysis tools, has fast-followed the $7 million seed it raised earlier this year (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/yc-backed-abacum-nets-7m-to-empower-finance-teams-with-real-time-data-and-collaboration-tools/">April</a>) with a $25M Series A round. The latest funding brings its total raised to date to $32M.</p>
<p>The Series A is led by European VC Atomico, with participation from Creandum, FJ Labs, S16VC, and other existing investors.</p>
<p>It added that a number of &#8220;notable&#8221; unicorn founders and executives are also joining this round as angels &#8212; including Adyen CFO Ingo Uytdehaage; Infarm CFO Carmine Visconti; JobandTalent co-founders Felipe Navío and Juan Urdiales; and Blockfi founder Zac Prince.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240131" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As part of the investment, Atomico principal Terese Hougaard will join its board.</p>
<p>As we reported when we covered Abacum&#8217;s seed raise, a core focus for the software is on bringing a collaborative layer to financial planning and analysis &#8212; making it easier for financial teams to share data internally with the wider business by automating fiddly, repetitive manual tasks (such as copypasting data between spreadsheets or other manual data transformations that can be prone to human error).</p>
<p>Abacum co-founder and CEO Julio Martínez told TechCrunch the 2019-founded startup now has over 50 customers, spread across five continents.</p>
<p>These include a number of familiar scaleups given the mid-tier focus. (It slates the likes of Spain&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/typeform-a-platform-for-conversational-data-collection-raises-35m/">Typeform</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/22/uber-rival-cabify-has-raised-another-160m-at-a-1-4b-valuation/">Cabify</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/ebury-santander/">Ebury</a> among its sign-ups, for example, and while Abacum&#8217;s business is based in New York its co-founders are Spanish, and it has an office in Barcelona, so has evidently been leveraging links to the local ecosystem to drive uptake).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Asked about its growth rate this year, Martínez said: &#8220;We&#8217;ve multiplied 15x our ARR in the last year, and our ARR per client continues to expand as the value they find in the Abacum platform continues to grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, the majority of our customer base is split between North America and Europe. Regarding industries, we&#8217;re focused on fast-scaling tech companies. Fintech and SaaS are the most prominent sub-industries we deal with but there is no shortage of Mobility and Martech companies either,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Per Martínez, Abacum will use the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Series A funding &#8212; primarily &#8212; for product development and growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Our goal in the next months is to continue building more value for our customers in the Abacum platform with more functionality. On the commercial side, we are also growing our offices in the US and LatAm to serve our customers better in those markets,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p>Commenting in a supporting statement, Atomico principal Terese Hougaard added: “Modern finance teams are increasingly called upon as the central source of truth in a company, providing all other teams with the input they need to make key strategic decisions. The uncertainties presented by the pandemic have exacerbated this, with finance teams needing to accurately forecast and scenario plan faster than ever before. Abacum provides the platform strategic finance teams need to do exactly this: Aggregate and combine existing sources of business data, forecast, plan and &#8212; crucially &#8212; collaborate with all other teams in a company.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fantasy sports exchange founded by Irish betting veteran Paddy Power is bringing NFT-enabled live trading to rugby fans in a bid to expand globally. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://asx.ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Sports Exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ASX Sports), just signed a deal with New Zealand digital media company <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/">RugbyPass</a> to use its data to allow fans to participate in ASX&#8217;s virtual stock market for rugby games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASX Sports launched in May 2021 and took its exchange live on the Apple and Android app stores earlier this month. The exchange lets users buy and sell virtual shares in esports and fantasy players, reflecting their prices in real time based on player performance and fan demand. The virtual rugby games are set to begin on ASX’s exchange in early 2022 ahead of the </span><a href="https://www.sixnationsrugby.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six Nations Rugby Championship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Power told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240138" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RugbyPass reaches an audience of over 10 million viewers, the company says. For ASX Sports, which is explicitly targeting expansion in the United States market, rugby seems like an unexpected pick given </span><a href="https://lastwordonsports.com/rugby/2020/07/14/top-20-rugby-union-countries-registered-players/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its popularity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Europe, Australia, and Asia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the company, which just moved its headquarters to Miami from Dublin, is betting on rugby’s growing traction in the U.S, which has 8.8 million active rugby fans, per sports analytics firm Gemba.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“NFTs are such an exciting buzzword, and the U.S. is kind of where it&#8217;s at. It’s the home of next-generation fantasy, which is effectively what we are. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re Miami-based now, and that&#8217;s kind of opening plenty of opportunities for us,” Power said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While users of the ASX exchange will be able to buy and hold shares in specific players, the sports teams themselves and their sponsors will be the owners of the NFTs. The intricacies of partnership deals for virtual team ownership on ASX will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis by the teams, Power said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power previously worked in marketing for his father David Power’s company, </span><a href="https://www.paddypower.com/bet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paddy Power Betfair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which rebranded as Flutter Entertainment in 2019 and bought a majority stake in FanDuel, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/flutter-considers-fanduel-spinout-investors-want-draftkings-multiple.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the largest player in US sports betting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. ASX wants to position itself to partner with leagues like the NFL and NBA, as more U.S. states, particularly large markets like New York, look to legalize sports betting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASX is raising capital rapidly so it can compete for coveted partnerships against incumbents like Disney, Caesars and Fox Sports, as the regulatory landscape opens up. It crowdfunded 2.5 million euros</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ahead of its May launch, using the proceeds to hire a team of about 30 developers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to raise a Series A round early next year and is currently in talks with tier one sports franchises and leagues in the U.S., according to Power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASX hosted its first public game last week, a virtual version of the English Premier League’s Liverpool vs. Arsenal match.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We got thousands of players &#8212; we were delighted with that &#8212; and we had really good engagement as well as people trading during play,” Power said.</span></p>
