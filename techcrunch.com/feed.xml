										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The plan is simple: First, we create a knockoff of a popular digital service. Second, we cry political persecution. Third, we raise a bunch of money with a SPAC. And then, to cap it off, we take on AWS.</p>
<p>Got it?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s actually funny is that I am not kidding. That is not only a real plan, but one that we&#8217;ve now seen twice.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>We first got wind of the method of raising capital with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/">the Trump SPAC deal</a> taking a collection of ideas and very little product public. And then we got another dose yesterday <a href="https://story.rumble.com/rumble-inc-the-neutral-video-platform-to-go-public-through-combination-with-cantor-fitzgeralds-cf-acquisition-corp-vi-nasdaq-cfvi/">with online video hosting portal Rumble&#8217;s SPAC plan</a>. Both have long-term ambitions, or at least teasers, to take on the incumbent cloud players.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220369 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Good luck? That goal, about a hundred billion dollars, and 15 years might get you to quaternary status in the vicinity of where the big public clouds play.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s take a look at the Rumble scheme to conquer the digital world. After all, startups are designed to make big plans. Rumble&#8217;s plot to take on the combined heft of Amazon, Microsoft and Google is, if nothing else, not a small endeavor.</p>
<h2>Surely *this* is peak SPAC?</h2>
<p>Rumble, a self-described &#8220;neutral video platform,&#8221; is merging with CF Acquisition Corp. VI. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, per the companies. Here are <a href="https://story.rumble.com/rumble-inc-the-neutral-video-platform-to-go-public-through-combination-with-cantor-fitzgeralds-cf-acquisition-corp-vi-nasdaq-cfvi/">the financial terms of the deal</a>Â (modestly condensed):</p>
<blockquote><p>The transaction values Rumble at an initial enterprise value of $2.1 billion, with current Rumble shareholders having the ability to earn additional shares of the combined company if the stock reaches price hurdles of $15.00 and $17.50 per share. The transaction is expected to provide approximately $400 million in proceeds to Rumble, including a fully committed PIPE of $100 million at $10.00 per share and $300 million of cash held in the trust account of CFVI.</p></blockquote>
<p>You are correct in being surprised that Rumble is worth $2.1 billion, or will be next year when it combines with the blank-check company. After all, we don&#8217;t really know that much about it.</p>
<p>Crunchbase data has a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/rumble-inc-2-series-unknown--d2098ab7">single funding event</a> on record for the company, a May 2021 round with capital arriving from Peter Thiel and J.D. Vance. At the time, the company was worth around $500 million, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-j-d-vance-invest-in-rumble-video-platform-popular-on-political-right-11621447661?reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter">per The Wall Street Journal</a>. The Journal also notes that Rumble was founded in 2013, but only recently found more mainstream popularity after right-wing figures began to promote the service as &#8220;a more welcoming, free-speech alternative&#8221; to video offerings from major platform players like Meta and Alphabet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook Messenger <a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/12/03/close-out-the-year-with-messengers-new-expression-tools/">announced</a> today that it&#8217;s starting to test out a new &#8220;Split Payments&#8221; feature that introduces a way for users to share the cost of bills and expenses through the app. The company says the new feature is a &#8220;free and fast&#8221; way to handle finances through Messenger. The new feature is rolling out next week for U.S. users.</p>
<p>To use Split Payments, users need to click on the âGet Startedâ button in a group chat or the Payments Hub in Messenger. From there, you can split a bill evenly or modify the contribution amount for each individual in the group chat, either with or without yourself included. You&#8217;ll also have the option to enter a personalized message. Lastly, you will be asked to confirm your Facebook Pay details, after which your request will be sent and viewable in your group chat thread.</p>
<p>&#8220;If youâve struggled with dividing up (and getting paid back for) group dinners, shared household expenses or even the monthly rent, itâs about to get easier,&#8221; the company said in a blog post about the new feature.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242704" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The launch of Split Payments comes as Messenger added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/messenger-adds-venmo-like-qr-codes-for-person-to-person-payments-in-the-u-s/">Venmo-like QR codes</a> for person-to-person payments a few months ago. The codes launched in the U.S. and allow anyone to send or request money through Facebook Pay â even if theyâre not Facebook friends. The feature can be accessed under the âFacebook Payâ section in Messengerâs settings.</p>
<p>Facebook Pay firstÂ <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/11/simplifying-payments-with-facebook-pay/">launched</a> in November 2019, as a way to establish a payment system that extends across the companyâs apps for not just person-to-person payments, but for other things like donations and e-commerce.</p>
<p>Split Payments was introduced alongside a few other Messenger updates, including four new group AR effects designed with creators Emma Chamberlain, Zach King, Bella Poarch and King Bach. The company notes that it also recently launched two new &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; Soudmojis, which are emoji that play a sound when you send them within Messenger, and a new chat theme. Messenger also recently rolled out a new Taylor Swift Soudmoji to celebrate the release of &#8220;Red.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Friday, which means the whole crew was aboard for this particular episode.

And, frankly, we needed the full team because the holidays aren&#8217;t slowing any news down.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242345" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>First up? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/">Square becoming Block</a>, which we wanted to make fun of but mostly found to be reasonable given the company&#8217;s disparate interests.</li>
<li>From there we chatted about Inpathy&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/inpathy-aims-to-be-a-social-network-that-mirrosrs-real-human-experience/">neat take</a> on social networking, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/massive-wants-to-rent-your-spare-compute-power-to-pay-for-apps/">Massive&#8217;s $11 million funding round</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/butter-raises-7m-to-end-accidental-churn-due-to-payment-failure/">why Butter could help grease the skids</a> of many a subscription business.</li>
<li>Then it was time to trade startups for bigger companies, as we had to riff on Bret Taylor&#8217;s quasi-ascension to the top of Salesforce along with a host of other executive exits. Alex calls it cold resignation winter, but Meta clearly has put some people on the hot seat.</li>
<li>Better.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/better-com-gets-750m-cash-infusion-in-new-agreement-with-its-spac-backers/">was also in our remit this week</a>, due to its fundraising and layoffs. We debate if you should raise if it comes at the cost of your employees, and the morality of a Zoom layoff.</li>
<li>And, finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/sounding-board-lands-series-b-to-move-coaching-beyond-services-and-into-saas/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">Sounding Board&#8217;s Series B</a> reminded us that executive coaching, even and especially for the folks above, isn&#8217;t just a services business. It&#8217;s a SaaS business.</li>
</ul>
<p>See you here next week, unless Jack shaves off his beard and we&#8217;re forced to do a shot.</p>

<p>The round, which co-founder and CTO Georgina Kirby describes as a &#8220;late seed&#8221; &#8212; ahead of a planned Series A &#8220;in the next 12-18 months&#8221; &#8212; is led by Talis Capital with participation from previous investors<span class="m_3993107806375557245m2119360555473242954m-4424213529466934543apple-converted-space">Â </span>Playfair Capital<span class="m_3993107806375557245m2119360555473242954m-4424213529466934543apple-converted-space">Â </span>and<span class="m_3993107806375557245m2119360555473242954m-4424213529466934543apple-converted-space">Â </span>Ascension.</p>
<p>A number of angel investors have also joined the round, including Keith Gibbs, former CEO of AXA PPP Healthcare; Pam Garside, partner at Newhealth; Voyagers <span class="il">Health</span>-Tech Fund, led by David Rowan, founding editor of Wired; David Giampaolo, healthcare entrepreneur and founder of PI Capital; Deepali Nangia, venture partner at Speedinvest and Atomico Angel; Faisal Mehmud, VP and former medical director of Bristol Myers Squibb; and<span class="m_3993107806375557245m2119360555473242954m-4424213529466934543apple-converted-space">Â </span>KHP, a collaboration between King&#8217;s College London, King&#8217;s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Guy&#8217;s and St Thomas&#8217; NHS Trust.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242624" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup &#8212; which we billed as one &#8220;to watch&#8221; back in 2019 when we saw the founders pitching at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/ef11/">Entrepreneur First&#8217;s demo day</a> &#8212; combines behavioral science and AI to deliver timely patient support and nudges (for things like medication reminders) so they can more easily self-manage their treatment.</p>
<p>Vinehealth&#8217;s platform also acts as a channel through which patients can be remotely monitored by their clinicians as they provide feedback on symptoms and report any treatment side-effects.</p>
<p>So far its app has been downloaded around 15,000 times since being made available in January 2020 &#8212; which Kirby confirms covers all usage to date, so both for pure patient-support and for trials/research.</p>

<p>The patient-support app is offered free for cancer patients to download themselves &#8212; currently available in the UK and Ireland.</p>
<p>For pharma, Vinehealth provides its platform as a software-as-a-service &#8212; supporting drug companies in recruiting patients for trials and gathering PRO to help with R&amp;D and drug development.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been focused on pharma since the very beginning and we&#8217;re getting a lot of traction there and seeing a lot of opportunity,&#8221; says Kirby. &#8220;The patient support program and the clinical trial are extremely similar [products]&#8230; For pharma they&#8217;re different parts of the drug development process but in terms of the delivery of software, the things that patients need throughout that process &#8212; it&#8217;s extremely similar. So we&#8217;ve really narrowed down to that life science offering.&#8221;</p>
<p>She confirms Vinehealth is not going down the procurement route of trying to sell to healthcare services directly. So essentially the idea is for life sciences research to fund free provision of the support software to patients. (Although it can&#8217;t disclose any pharma customer names as yet.)</p>
<p>While, for monetization, it&#8217;s focused on serving the needs of drug companies, Vinehealth is equally keen to be seen as patient-centric &#8212; and wants its app to play a key clinician support role that promotes better patient outcomes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a web dashboard that is accessible through any browser for clinicians and doctors who want to be able to track their patients remotely and do this through running research studies or even within clinical trials,&#8221; says Kirby. &#8220;Those doctors and nurses can see that data in real-time but they can feed that into either appropriate points of the care pathway &#8212; obviously they&#8217;re not sitting there on the dashboard all day but there may times at which it&#8217;s very useful for them to see specific red flags and be able to know which patient to see see first and also to know how to make better clinical decisions using that kind of more real-time data &#8212; rather than the typical [fortnightly or monthly catch up with a patient].&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s kind of giving them that context and that rich longitudinal data that they&#8217;ve never had,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Vinehealth has</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> digitized the traditional paper-based questionnaires that cancer patients would typically be asked to fill in during a visit with their clinical team to report their symptoms and provide any wider feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Its premise is that moving that legacy process to </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a dedicated, user-friendly digital interface supports better patient self management, treatment outcomes and improved quality of life for people living with cancer &#8212; given the relative ease of reporting data via an app, combined with the wider support package it offers (it&#8217;s worked with charities Macmillan and Bowel Cancer UK to supply support content to the app).Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For example, Kirby says they use A/B testing and AI to configure personalized and timely recommendations to surface appropriate resources, as well as to determine how best to nudge and motivate patients to take medications and manage what can be complex medication regimes for cancer treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Vinehealth&#8217;s app wrapper can also dole out positive feedback to encourage patients to provide PRO.</span></p>
<p>Kirby points to (general)<a title="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/jXlYCG6nDsWy7XhNDf_J?domain=pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30231381/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30231381/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638616166684000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0MsW1g8AWhRWfwQqtSkmJU">Â evidence </a>that when patients track their PRO data effectively survival rates can increase &#8212; by up to 20%. &#8220;Better self management can have such a huge impact on survival,&#8221; she says, adding: &#8220;We want to show not only improvements in survival but in quality of life too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The blend of behavioral science and data-driven support Vinehealth&#8217;s approach involves stems from the combined expertise of the co-founders.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Rayna&#8217;s [Patel; co-founder and CEO] background is really in behavioral science; mine is in data science,&#8221; says Kirby. &#8220;And so when we came together we thought we can really leverage both sides here &#8212; and use the data to understand what people are going through and where those nudges can be most effective. And use behavioral science to deliver some really key nudges at the right time with the right wording that can really nudge people to build their habits and be able to feel more in control and be able to actually understand what&#8217;s going on and make some better decisions for their own care.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There are a number of nudges in the app &#8212; some small ones, some bigger ones. We build medication nudges and reminders to be delivered in a certain way that is really effective and isn&#8217;t just dismissed by patients. We have nudges for logging certain symptoms and what that leads on to &#8212; so certain supportive content. So you&#8217;re logging anxiety at certain levels, here&#8217;s some supportive content that could really help you with dealing with this particular symptom or side effect of your drug.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At different times it&#8217;s about the timing, the wording and the delivery of that nudge,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;If you try to change too many things at once research shows that you don&#8217;t change anything at all &#8212; so we&#8217;ve really carefully thought about how we nudge and how we try to help patients build better habits and how often we do that as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirby says the goal &#8212; in time &#8212; is also to use AI to incorporate more advances suggestions into the platform in the future, such as predictive symptom logging (i.e. &#8220;what is likely to occur for this particular drug for this particular patient&#8221;).</p>
<p>For now, Vinehealth has built a content recommender system which is specialized in oncology and personalized to the patient; tuned to their diagnosis, adapting to their ongoing input, and factoring in content that other similar patients are reading and finding supportive.</p>
<p>On the research side, Kirby says the largest study the platform has been used for to date is an ongoing study involving nine NHS Trusts and 300 patients &#8212; which is a piece of research that Vinehealth is undertaking itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re planning out a number of clinical trials that are slightly largely than that but still tbc in terms of exact numbers. The US studies are likely to be the larger ones,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>Health data is of course highly sensitive and Kirby confirms that consent for any third party research purposes is sought separately to the consent which a user of the patient-support product is asked for in order that Vinehealth can process their medical information to provide the service and give them personalized treatment support.</p>
<p>&#8220;That data is not shared with anybody &#8212; unless they have [given] explicit consent to do that. By just signing up to the platform they&#8217;re not consenting to sharing their data as part of a clinical trial. That is a completely separate piece of consent,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We make it extremely clear and don&#8217;t want to hide any sharing in any way &#8212; it has to be really obvious and really clear to a patient. Ultimately everyone wants to support patients. They want to give more opportunities for patients to be in those clinical trials, to be able to capture that data and feed that back in a way where &#8212; normally they&#8217;re suffering at home with these kind of side effects and that&#8217;s never getting back to the pharma company, for example &#8212; so we&#8217;re making it really clear what we&#8217;re doing and why we&#8217;re doing that and we give patients a choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirby does suggest that, in the future, the startup may also look to be able to provide &#8220;properly anonymized&#8221; data-sets based on purely aggregated insights provided by patients &#8212; so it might, for example, be able to highlight demographic groups that experience particular side effects of certain drugs. However she adds that that is not something it&#8217;s doing at the moment &#8212; &#8220;given our focus on trials and patient support programs&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the near term Vinehealth is gearing up for growth via a US launch &#8212; which it hopes will happen &#8220;early next year&#8221; &#8212; with the 18-strong team likely to double over the next six months or so and its first US hire already locked in.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main thing that we&#8217;ve been focused on since we fund raised is hiring a great team and growing that team and investing time in really building that out and making sure that everyone&#8217;s aligned on the mission and that we&#8217;re really building out a product that&#8217;s scalable to be able to take into these new markets,&#8221; says Kirby, adding: &#8220;Building a startup is all about having great people. You can have great technology but if you don&#8217;t have great people then you don&#8217;t really have anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the seed funding in a statement, Beatrice Aliprandi, principal at Talis Capital, said: âWeâre hugely excited to be partnering with Rayna and Georgina: weâd been keeping a close eye on Vinehealthâs growth for several months before we invested in the company, given its unique value proposition where healthcare outcomes work in direct correlation with financial outcomes. Itâs a win-win-win for patients, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies, which is rarely the case in the healthcare space where parties are often at odds with one another.</p>
<p>âFrom our first meeting, the resilience and mission-driven attitude of the founders was immediately clear and is really what made this opportunity so compelling. Both Rayna and Georgina are clearly incredibly driven to improve the lives and survival of cancer patients, and as a team they possess a unique combination of expertise, skills, and drive to make Vinehealth a success.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bret Taylor is on a roll: On Monday, he became the chair of Twitterâs board, and a day later, Salesforce made him its co-CEO and co-chair.</p>
<p>Enterprise reporter Ron Miller looked back at Taylorâs career to better understand how a one-time Google product manager ended up co-leading one of the worldâs most valuable companies.</p>
<p>To get a fuller perspective, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/3-analysts-break-down-bret-taylors-pretty-sweet-week/">Ron interviewed four analysts</a>:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242576" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Leary said Taylorâs elevation likely signals that Salesforce founder Marc Benioff is getting ready to transition âinto the next phase of his life, whatever that may be.â</p>
<p>Mueller, however, said power-sharing only succeeds âwhen the senior partner relinquishes responsibilities. That will be a first for Benioff, and we will see how this will pan out.â</p>

<p>Every blog post, Tweet and Instagram Story is an opportunity to explain to customers (and your board) how the company creates value or is a step ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>But quality will always beat quantity when it comes to content marketing; Googlebot may be hungry for new links, but potential customers demand expertise and insights.</p>
<p>âMarketers need a new plan of action that puts creativity before quantity, audience before engine, and sets connection as the top priority,â says Lindsay Tjepkema, CEO of audio and video content marketing platform Casted.</p>

<p>Companies that offer software as a service have been writing their own ticket in recent years, but are we entering a bear market?</p>
<p>Last month, the WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund was at a 52-week high of $65.51, but as of this week, that figure had fallen to $53.</p>
<p>âThatâs a decline of 19.1%,â writes Alex Wilhelm in The Exchange. âOr, 90 basis points under the 20% required for a particular asset â¦ to reach technical bear-market territory.â</p>

<p>Singaporeâs population is under 5 million, but according to KPMG, fintech investment in the nation-state will reach $3B this year, a significant chunk of the $42B global total.</p>
<p>By comparison, investors flowed $4.8B to Canadian fintech startups in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>One factor driving Singaporeâs fintech success is its high consumer adoption rates, but its government also directly supports related initiatives through its Green Finance Action Plan.</p>

<p>Singapore-based Grab started out by offering ride-hailing services, but it has since swelled to become a âsuper appâ that offers everything from food delivery to online payments.</p>
<p>The company went public via a SPAC on Thursday in the biggest U.S. debut by a company based in Southeast Asia. But by market close, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/grabs-spac-splat-caps-off-a-bad-week-for-blank-check-combinations/">shares had fallen 21% to $8.75</a>.</p>
<p>Looking back, a question Alex Wilhelm asked before trading began seems quite prescient:</p>
<p>âWhat are investors seeing in the company to make them confident enough to drop billions into its accounts and bid its shares higher?</p>

<p>Workers who want to accelerate their professional development no longer need to incur tens of thousands in debt.</p>
<p>Online education options are inexpensive and myriad, and âaccess to coaching and mentoring at the individual and group levels is improving,â writes Rhys Spence, head of research at European edtech-focused fund Brighteye Ventures.</p>
<p>To get a holistic sense of the opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs, he crafted a market map that charts professional learning startups.</p>
<p>âThese companies focus on a combination of both B2C and B2B models and have had substantial success on the B2B front,â says Spence.</p>
<p>âItâs a convenient way for employers to offer their teams opportunities for continuous personal development, tailored to an extent to their interests and priorities.â</p>

<p>Tencent, Didi and other China-based startups were able to go public in the U.S. thanks to a complex loophole known as a VIE, or variable-interest entity.</p>
<p>A VIE sets up an offshore company that allows non-Chinese citizens to get around restrictions on foreign ownership.</p>
<p>âThe model was always risky as heck,â reported Alex Wilhelm, âbut now the Chinese Communist Party is considering doing away with the side-step of its own rules,â which could have a devastating impact on the nationâs VC market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the past few years, Pinduoduo has been widely regarded as Alibaba&#8217;s strongest challenger. While Alibaba reported 863 million annual active consumers across its retail platforms <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p211118.pdf">in the twelve months ended September</a>, Pinduoduo&#8217;s <em>monthly</em> active users exceeded 740 million <a href="https://investor.pinduoduo.com/static-files/d552ef24-b612-43c2-bf8c-7b1e61ae27a4">in the quarter ended September</a>.</p>
<p>In its pursuit of new growth engines, Pinduoduo is taking a different route from its older rival. Both e-commerce titans are starting to see their growth plateau, but instead of doubling down on cloud computing like Alibaba, Pinduoduo is pouring money into agriculture.</p>
<p>In August, Pinduoduo unveiled its <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/24/2285429/0/en/Pinduoduo-posts-2Q-results-unveils-10-Billion-Agriculture-Initiative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 billion yuan ($1.57 billion)</a> agriculture program to &#8220;face and address critical needs in the agricultural sector and rural areas.&#8221; The initiative is all-encompassing, including possible equity funding for agritech startups and grants for fundamental research and talent training.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241385" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The program won&#8217;t be profit-driven, the company promised, and all profit from the second quarter and &#8220;any potential profits in future quarters would be allocated to the initiative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some see Pinduoduo&#8217;s investment in agriculture as an effort to alleviate rural poverty and is thus an answer to Beijing&#8217;s recent call for <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-08/18/c_1310133051.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;common prosperity,&#8221;</a> which denotes &#8220;affluence shared by everyone, both in material and cultural terms.&#8221; But the company has reiterated that agriculture was at its core business from the outset.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Pinduoduo took off by selling fruit online before gradually broadening its product categories. For many growers, e-commerce was a boon. Agriculture in China was dominated by millions of small family-owned farms, which relied on layers of distributors to sell their produce nationwide. The setup meant farmers often ended up with razor-thin profits.</p>
<p>To attract vendors of agricultural products, Pinduoduo has been waiving commissions and said on last week&#8217;s earnings call that it planned to maintain the policy for the &#8220;future quarters.&#8221; Once farmers sign up, the platform then trains them to be savvy digital store operators and marketers. When orders are placed, third-party logistics services transport the produce to consumers, thanks to a mature delivery network that took shape during China&#8217;s e-commerce boom.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pinduoduo isn&#8217;t the only Chinese internet platform trying to bring rural produce to urban households. Alibaba&#8217;s Taobao has long made &#8220;agricultural e-commerce&#8221; a key initiative and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/tiktoks-chinese-rival-kuaishou-becomes-a-popular-online-bazaar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video apps like Kuaishou</a> are helping farmers sell through live streaming.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok&#8217;s Chinese rival Kuaishou becomes a popular online bazaar&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/tiktoks-chinese-rival-kuaishou-becomes-a-popular-online-bazaar/embed/#?secret=wkLfGzTS5t" data-secret="wkLfGzTS5t" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But Pinduoduo wants to go beyond selling and also help tackle farmers&#8217; production problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trained as engineers, my team and I have devoted ourselves to finding technology solutions to implement across the agriculture supply chain,&#8221; Chen Lei, who took over Colin Huang as the firm&#8217;s CEO earlier this year, said <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4472091-pinduoduo-inc-pdd-ceo-chen-lei-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the earnings call</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our efforts in applying agriculture technology go beyond matching supply and demand, and extend into identifying upstream technology solutions to improve productivity, nutritional profiles and environmental sustainability. By strengthening agri-tech applications, we also hope to make agriculture attractive to a tech-savvy younger generation,&#8221; Chen added.</p>
<p>Besides selling and growing, Pinduoduo is working with research institutes to implement industry standards for products like meat and crops, the firm&#8217;s vice president of finance Jing Ma said on the earnings call.</p>
<p>As a Nasdaq-listed company, Pinduoduo is, of course, beholden to its investors. In Q3, the company posted a positive operating profit for the second consecutive quarter, in part thanks to reduced marketing expenses. In the meantime, the firm is shifting its focus to R&amp;D spending, which accounted for <a href="https://investor.pinduoduo.com/static-files/d552ef24-b612-43c2-bf8c-7b1e61ae27a4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 19%</a> of its operating expenses in Q3.</p>
<p>It will be a while before Pinduoduo&#8217;s agricultural investment starts to produce visible results, like, how will its technology help improve yield output for the 16 million farmers selling on Pinduoduo?</p>
<p>The company has shared some early accomplishments. Last year, for instance, it called on startups worldwide to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/pinduoduo-agritech/"> grow the sweetest and most environmentally sustainable strawberries</a> and claimed that the winning team&#8217;s precision-farming solution has already been deployed at some farms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People come together around the dinner table and the food they love, but for <a href="https://umamicart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Umamicart</a> founder and CEO Andrea Xu, it wasnât always easy to find the ingredients to make the foods she grew up eating with her family.</p>
<p>Xuâs parents are Chinese, but moved to Spain, opening up their own Chinese restaurant. She recalls the grocery stores not having the kinds of sauces, thinly-sliced meat cuts and vegetables common in Asian cuisine. Even when she moved to the U.S. for college, she and her friends would talk about what wasnât available in the one aisle of the grocery store dedicated to Asian cooking.</p>

<p>âFood has been a way to connect back to identity, but there was difficulty in accessing foods that were prevalent in my household,â she told TechCrunch. âIn the U.S., there are 29 million Asian Americans, yet there is still a hurdle to access products.â</p>
<p>With most anything available for delivery these days, Xu decided to put that to the test with Asian ingredients. In March, she and Will Nichols, formerly with FJ Labs, launched Umamicart, an online Asian grocer and delivery service offering both a curated and comprehensive selection of traditional and creative Asian products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Umamicart aims to be a one-stop shop for home cooks, offering staple products and pantry essentials, recipe inspirations and occasion-specific kits for cooking activities like holiday roast duck, DIY sushi night, hotpot and dumpling making.</p>
<p>Orders can be placed via the companyâs website â and soon a mobile app â with same-day delivery for New York City customers, or next-day delivery to ZIP codes in greater New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C. areas.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $6 million in seed capital in a round co-led by M13 and FJ Labs, with participation from Picus Capital, Starting Line, Golden Ventures, First Minute Capital and Goldhouse Ventures. This brings the companyâs total funding raised to $7 million, including a $1 million seed round.</p>
<p>Brent Murri, investor at M13, was introduced to Xu by FJ Labs, and said Umamicart was in line with the kinds of consumer technology his firm typically invests in, looking at the digitization of food. M13 has invested in similar companies, like Thrive Market and Shef.</p>
<p>âThe combination of Andrea and Will as co-founders is one of the best market fits I saw this year,â Murri said. âAndrea has learned from her parents and retained a lot of relationships with food distributors, while Will led Instacartâs New York City market, so he knows how to scale the grocery business. All of that set them apart.â</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Kurly, the Korean grocery startup, raises $200M on a $2.2B valuation after shifting IPO plans away from the NYSE&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/kurly-the-korean-grocery-startup-raises-200m-on-a-2-2b-valuation-after-shifting-ipo-plans-away-from-the-nyse/embed/#?secret=bEAvmpc2d7" data-secret="bEAvmpc2d7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He noted that grocery experts expect half of the U.S. population to <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/2021-online-grocery-sales-will-surpass-100-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make at least one digital grocery purchase</a> next year. However, the digitization of grocery stores is not equal to everyone, citing the Asian market as one that is largely offline, providing space for companies like Umamicart to offer a curated selection of food with good customer experience.</p>
<p>The new capital will enable the company to expand its delivery range, grow its team and add product catalogue and geographic service areas as Umamicart sees increased demand from customers. Xu would like to provide more diverse offerings for Southeast Asian cuisine and increase the number of recipes available to users.</p>
<p>âWe are also seeing huge interest from people who didnât exactly grow up eating Asian food, but have come to enjoy it and cooking it,â she added.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2020&amp;no=497217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global food delivery market</a> was estimated at around $111 billion last year, with forecasts showing that to be $154 billion in 2023, according to a report from ResearchAndMarkets.com. Overall interest in cooking and eating ethnic food continues to increase. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/324422/us-retail-sales-of-ethnic-foods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. retail sales of ethnic foods</a> was $12.5 billion in 2018, up from $11 billion in 2013, while <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/chinese-restaurants-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual spend at Chinese restaurants in the U.S.</a> was estimated to be just over $15 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>Umamicart itself saw 313% in quarter-to-quarter web traffic growth since its launch in March, is growing 20% to 30% month over month and now has more than 3,000 products.</p>
<p>The pandemic showed some key insights that when cooking with Asian cuisine, people prefer fresh products, but if those arenât accessible, it impedes cooking and people try to find swaps, Xu said.</p>
<p>âConsumers are also rejecting what is in the international or ethnic aisle and want to source products and brands that are better,â she added. âWe value that, so when they come to Umamicart, they know that what we put on our shelves is a vetted product, tried and true staples or the best new brands we were able to scout.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Swedish coworking space and investment fund Norrsken Foundation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/norrsken-opens-east-africa-startup-fund-and-hub-in-kigali/">announced the launch</a> of its first entrepreneurship hub outside the Scandinavian nation in Rwanda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center, located in Kigali, has finally opened up to the region, though it is happening</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â in two phases. The first, which took place yesterday, will welcome 250 entrepreneurs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> second phase hopes to bring in over 750 additional entrepreneurs to the Norrsken House in Kigali by December 2022, the company confirmed to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWe have massive demand we can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">satisfy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to become the biggest physical hub for startups in Africa,â said the managing director of Norrsken East Africa, <a href="https://rw.linkedin.com/in/pascal-murasira">Pascal Murasira</a>.Â </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">â</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">We believe Kigali isÂ on a path to become one of Africa&#8217;s leading clusters for tech and startups, and we want to help accelerate that journey.â</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242163" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kigali center is the first of 25 hubs the Norrsken Foundation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/12/with-norrsken-house-ex-klarna-executive-envisions-a-global-network-of-co-working-spaces-focused-on-impact/">plans to open globally</a> over the next decade, according to founder <a href="https://se.linkedin.com/in/niklasadalberth">Niklas Adalberth</a>, the Klarna co-founder who left the unicorn fintech in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foundation sees itself as ânonprofit, nonpolitical and nonpartisanâ with a mission to help entrepreneurs solve the âworldâs greatest challenges.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to its coworking space in Stockholm, Norrsken runs an impact accelerator program and an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/norrsken-foundation-is-closing-on-an-oversubscribed-impact-venture-fund-at-125-million-euros/">impact VC fund</a> of â¬130 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, alongside Norrsken House in Kigali, the foundation also manages an Africa-focused seed fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While Norrsken mentioned in 2019 that its seed investments ranged from $25,000 to $100,000, with plans to make later-stage investments from $100,000 to $1 million, it did not give any update on its fund size this time.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization only stated that it made a handful of investments into companies based in Rwanda, the<a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2021/11/17/2-rwanda-tech-startups-bank-funding-from-kigali-based-norrsken-foundation/"> two most recent ones</a> being Viebeg Technology and PesaChoice.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pandemic played a huge role in the project delays, Norrsken said it continues to follow the timeline it laid out when starting in 2019</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">â</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about launching Norrsken House </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the same way as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about launching a product. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get it out there before itâs ready, to involve users and get feedback on how to perfect it,â a companyâs spokesperson said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. âWe donât have all the answers, and we need our users to help us shape the final product. Construction will continue and operations will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gradually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> come online throughout the first half of 2022.â</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Norrsken opens East Africa startup fund and hub in Kigali&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/norrsken-opens-east-africa-startup-fund-and-hub-in-kigali/embed/#?secret=SR5ALqTtJc" data-secret="SR5ALqTtJc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with the pandemic triggering shifts in how we work and communicate globally from offline to remote, why is Norrsken continuing with the project? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Adalberth, it all boils down to a known fact that offline clusters help create billion-dollar companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, unicorns have popped up from cluster cities with economic, technological, innovative and real estate advancement: Think Silicon Valley, London, Stockholm, Beijing, Bengaluru, SÃ£o Paulo and Lagos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founder hopes to replicate this model within the Norrsken House in Stockholm and Kigali</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He believes Norrsken can create microcosms of these ecosystems with the center. And by bringing together 1,000 entrepreneurs solving real societal issues with their business models and connecting them to funding, network and mentorship, Norrsken aspires to create âimpact unicorns.â<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, unlike Stockholm, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is regarded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a unicorn factory in Europe, Kigali doesnât have a prominent big-name startup yet. And though it has a v<a href="https://report.startupblink.com/">ibrant startup and tech ecosystem</a>, it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lags behind other markets such as Lagos, Nairobi, Cairo, Cape Town and Johannesburg in terms of <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/01/30/startup-ecosystem-and-funding/">receiving VC funding</a>.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Norrsken chose Kigali as its first base in Africa because of Rwandaâs advantage in providing a friendlier <a href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB2019-report_web-version.pdf">business environment</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, internet penetration and infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">â</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we ended up with Kigali for a couple of different reasons. One is that we thought that we could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">perhaps</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make the highest impact in Kigali,â Adalberth said. â</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, from the World Bank, you know that Kigali is one of the easiest countries to do business in Africa. And it has built out infrastructure </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> internet, traffic, and so on. So itâs a good prerequisite to building unicorns, and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the final piece that was missing is what weâre trying to enable now with the Norrsken House.â</span></p>
<p>[gallery type="slideshow" size="medium" ids="2242615,2242609,2242614,2242618,2242619,2242616,2242612,2242613,2242610"]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Murasira, startups including PesaChoice, SPENN, Fixa, BioMassters and ZoraBots will move into the Norrsken House in this first phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other tenants are partner organizations such as Katapult VC, The Bestseller Foundation, The Howard Buffett Foundation and the Novartis Foundation, which is housing its East Africa health tech hub and accelerator program at the center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://briterbridges.com/briterafrilabs2019">research</a> by AfriLabs and Briter Bridges in 2019, Africa has more than 600 active tech hubs, with 10 African cities home to about 250 of those and the rest spread across the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These hubs such as Nigeriaâs CcHub and Kenyaâs iHub (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/nigerias-cchub-acquires-kenyas-ihub-to-create-mega-africa-incubator/">subsidiary</a> of the former) have contributed significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the growth of startups and innovation on the continent; some regard them as the backbone of Africaâs tech ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Adalberth noted, hubs as technology clusters set up suitable conditions to create successful tech companies. But Norrsken knows that if it seeks to replicate the ecosystems of Lagos, Cape Town and their successful counterparts that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital, it needs to take a multi-stakeholder approach that involves the government, private sector and academia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWe are a âhub of hubs.â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We offer infrastructure, access to networks, venture capital funds to invest in startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is going to be the biggest hub in the region and even before we launched, we received a lot of interest from international organizations, international funds, government, looking to work with us to be able to invest in the local startups,â Murasira said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âOur theory is that once we have these role models that we elevate via this venue, we can have more young people deciding to go into entrepreneurship as a career path. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if we maintain that momentum and build this, it will be a tremendous accomplishment for us and the East African tech ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.â</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zindi is all about using AI to solve real world problems for companies and individuals. And the South Africa-based crowd-solving startup has done that over the last three years they have been in existence.</p>
<p>Just last year a team of data scientists under Zindi used machine learning to improve air quality monitoring in Kampala as another group helped Zimnat, an insurance company in Zimbabwe predict customer behavior &#8212; especially on who was likely to leave and the possible interventions that would make them stay. Zimnat was able to retain its customers by offering custom-made services to those who would have otherwise discontinued.</p>
<p>These are some of the solutions that have been realized to counter the data-centered challenges that companies, NGOs and government institutions submit to Zindi.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242593" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Zindi announces these challenges and invites its community of data scientists to take part in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/zindi-taps-12000-african-data-scientists-for-solutions-on-covid-19/">solution-finding competitions</a>. Participating data scientists submit their solutions and the winner gets a cash prize. The hosts of the competitions get to use the best results to overcome the challenge they had &#8212; like in an air quality monitoring project by AirQo, which sought solutions for forecasting air pollution across Uganda, and in helping Zimnat cut its losses.</p>
<p>âSo AirQo now has a dashboard that allows the public to check air quality and air quality forecasts. One of the exciting things about this project is that AirQo hired two of the winners from the challenge to help with the implementation of the project,â said <a href="https://zindi.africa/">Zindi</a> co-founder and CEO, Celina Lee. South African Megan Yates and Ghanaian Ekow Duker are the platformâs other co-founders.</p>
<p>âAirQo also raised funding from Google, based on the solution that they built, and theyâll now be replicating it in other African countries,â said Lee about the competition that was organised in partnership with the Digital Air Quality East Africa (DAQ EA) project of the University of Birmingham and the AirQo project from Makerere University, Kampala.</p>

The crowd-solving startup recently secured $1 million in seed funding. <strong>Photo Credits</strong>: Zindi.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among other notable private and public organizations that have tapped Zindi include Microsoft, IBM and Liquid Telecom UNICEF and the government of South Africa.</p>
<p>So far, Lee is excited about what Zindi has achieved and is enthusiastic about the communityâs future given how the crowd-solving startup has grown since launch. The platform is now providing alternatives and stepping up competition against traditional consulting firms operating across Africa, which are often expensive.</p>
<p>Zindiâs users have grown three-fold from the start of last year to 33,000 data scientists from 45 countries in the continent. It has also paid data scientists $300,000 in prize money.</p>
<p>This number is set to grow as it hosts the third inter-university Umoja Hack Africa challenge in March next year, where college students will compete against one another for different solutions.</p>
<p>Zindi is using the inter-university competition to expose students to practical data science experiences and to solve real life challenges using AI. During last yearâs event the platform attracted about 2,000 students during the event that took place virtually because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>âStudents get to build their first machine learning models, and from there, it opens up all kinds of doors for their careers and education,â said Lee, who is originally from San Francisco.</p>
<p>Zindi currently has a jobs portal to âshorten the path from learning to earning.â The talent placement portal allows organizations to tap from its pool of talent by posting openings.</p>
<p>The crowd-solving platform is also planning to introduce a learning component that provides training material to budding data scientists, this is after it realized a knowledge gap and need for training. Besides, Lee said that most of Zindiâs users are university students in need of learning experience, and who require enhanced skills to solve world problems.</p>
<p>The new plans will be made possible by a $1 million seed funding the platform recently secured.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2242601 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Zindi-competition.png" alt="" width="2611" height="1503" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Zindi-competition.png 2611w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Zindi-competition.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Zindi-competition.png?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Zindi-competition.png?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Zindi-competition.png?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Zindi-competition.png?resize=1536,884 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Zindi-competition.png?resize=2048,1179 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Zindi-competition.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2611px) 100vw, 2611px" />Lee said, âFor us, it&#8217;s really about scaling the community and creating more value for all of our data scientists.â</p>
<p>âSo we&#8217;re going to be using the funding to introduce much more learning content, because one of the things we understand is that, especially in Africa, data science is such a new field. And a lot of our data scientists are still university students or very early in their careers. And they&#8217;re just looking for a chance to learn and build their skills.â</p>
<p>The seed round was led by San-Francisco based VC firm Shakti, with participation from Launch Africa, Founders Factory Africa, and five35.</p>
<p>All these plans are towards building a strong data science community in Africa and for the continent, according to Lee, who said that they want to grow their users to reach one million in the near future. This, she said, will be achieved by opening up training opportunities to early-career data scientists and by forming a strong community that encourages collaboration and mentorship.</p>
<p>Lee said, âand so where we want to eventually reach a million data scientists in Africa &#8211; we want to make data science something that any young person who&#8217;s interested in pursuing this career has access to the tools, the connections, and the experience that they need to make a successful career in this field.â</p>
<p>âOur vision is to make AI accessible to everyone.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Porsche&#8217;s venture arm has taken a minority stake in 1Komma5, a five-month-old German startup aiming to offer households everything needed for a carbon neutral home, including energy storage, charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and solar.</p>
<p>The investment, the amount of which was not disclosed, follows a series of deals made by Porsche Ventures in the past two years, including Israel-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/intel-samsung-and-porsche-among-investors-in-trieyes-74m-funding-round/">sensing technology startup TriEye</a>, online electric <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/porsche-and-yamaha-invest-3-75-million-in-e-micromobility-dealership-ridepanda/">micromobility dealership RidePanda</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/goodyear-ventures-porsche-ventures-invest-in-virtual-sensing-company-tactile-mobility/">virtual sensing startup Tactile Mobility</a>.</p>
<p>This investment is a bit of a departure from Porsche Ventures&#8217; typical mobility tech play.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242566" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;With this investment, we want to underline our ambition in the area of smart city and sustainability,&#8221; Patrick Huke, head of Porsche Ventures Europe and Israel told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The Hamburg, Germany startup was founded by Micha Grueber, who is the CFO, and Philipp SchrÃ¶der, whose previous stints were at Tesla and energy storage systems company Sonnen.</p>
<p>The company â its name a nod to theÂ goals of the Paris Climate Agreement to keep the increase of global temperatures down to 1.5Â°C â is taking an interesting route to its one-stop shop goal.</p>
<p>Today, companies are all focused on selling the components such as solar or energy storage, SchrÃ¶der said in a recent interview. At the same time, no one in Europe is focused on bringing together these decentralized assets. That is bound to cause problems, SchrÃ¶der contends.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There will be issues in a decentralized energy world if every home is having a heat pump and a charge point and storage system and they do not communicate on the grid level (or with each other) there will be issues,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>1Komma5 is aiming to bring everything together through its software as well as acquisitions. Specifically, 1Komma is seeking to buy leading electrical installation companies in Germany â and will eventually expand to other countries such as Austria and Switzerland â that focus on renewable energies such as solar, heat pumps and energy storage. 1Komma5 provides the enterprise software for these companies to handle administrative tasks and customer-relationship management as well as energy management software that ties the charging, solar and energy storage together.</p>
<p>What makes 1Komma5&#8217;s business interesting is its plan to interconnect these components like solar and energy storage at home level and at the grid level, SchrÃ¶der said.</p>
<p>The startup has made five acquisitions so far through cash and stock deals.</p>
<p>The young startup has grand ambitions to use 100 million euro in cash and stock over the next to two years to acquire more of these renewable energy-focused installation companies. It&#8217;s targetingÂ  installation companies that have revenue between 5 million and 20 million euro and skilled labor â not sales outfits that simply outsource to other contractors.</p>
<p>The funding from Porsche will be used to to help 1Komma5 expand, a plan that includes opening retail locations that embody a premium Apple design-like vibe where potential customers can learn about the essential building blocks of a carbon-neutral home. Customers to these stores might see a Porsche Taycan next to a home charger, energy storage and solar, for instance.</p>
<p>The first showrooms are planned at Hamburg&#8217;s Binnenalster and in Lingen an der Ems and are expected to open in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Porsche doesn&#8217;t have any immediate plans to offer 1Komma5 products to its own customer base. However,Â as Huke noted, Porsche Ventures makes strategic investments and it will be looking at different possibilities in the medium to long term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s ride-hailing behemoth Didi has begun the procedure of delisting from the New York Stock Exchange and applying to list in Hong Kong instead, the company <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4710244250289231?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> via a Weibo post on Friday morning.</p>
<p>The decision came days after Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-26/china-is-said-to-ask-didi-to-delist-from-u-s-on-security-fears" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> the Chinese government had asked Didi to delist from the U.S. out of security fears. Didi could not be reached for comment by TechCrunch at the time.</p>
<p>The move is anything but surprising. The SoftBank-backed mobility powerhouse has faced immense regulatory pressure since it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/china-roundup-data-security-clampdown/">failed to assure Beijing</a> its data practices were secure before its blockbuster IPO in July.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242564" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Over the past few months, China has rolled out a litany of new data regulations, including rules that would bolster user privacy protection and restrict cross-border data transfers. A Didi executive <a href="https://auto.sina.com.cn/news/hy/2021-07-03/detail-ikqcfnca4724348.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously said</a> it stored data in China and it was âabsolutely not possibleâ that it passed data to the U.S., just like &#8220;many other U.S.-listed Chinese firms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Didi, which had about 500 million annual users as of March, pulled itself from Chinese app stores after it came under a cybersecurity review in early July. People with the app installed on their phones can continue using it but new users or those who have switched phones would have to download Didi alternatives.</p>
<p>Didi&#8217;s market cap currently stands at $37.6 billion. Its shares have plunged from more than $15 apiece at debut to $7.8 as of Thursday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">With hybrid models taking off across many aspects of society, itâs clear that though they offer incredible flexibility, the boundary lines between work and personal life are becoming increasingly blurred and emotionally draining.</p>
<p>RitualÂ hasÂ alwaysÂ been a powerful forceÂ inÂ shaping ourÂ mental andÂ emotional states; theÂ gathering of people,Â physicalÂ totems,Â wardrobeÂ andÂ space designÂ allÂ work to choreographÂ that experience.Â But for people in the hybrid workforce,Â many of the ritualsÂ to which they&#8217;veÂ become accustomed are no longer accessibleâtheirÂ dailyÂ workÂ experience involves noÂ gathering, noÂ change in location,Â andÂ littleÂ (if any)Â wardrobe change.</p>
<p>We areÂ doublingÂ down on hybrid virtual experiences, even though studies reveal that young people who spend more than seven hours a day staring at a screen are more susceptible to depression, anxiety and have greater difficulty in completing tasks. Furthermore, employees are reporting fatigue and exhaustion from a sea of back-to-back meetings that stretch across multiple time zones, making the daysÂ feelÂ endless.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242291" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Given that so much of the population is currently reliant on computing devices to engage in everything from workÂ andÂ school to shopping, banking and healthcare,Â weÂ have toÂ start taking a harder look at howÂ weâreÂ designing and developing those devices to better equip us forÂ new rituals forÂ the hybrid virtual world.</p>
<p>Today, computing devices account for everyÂ possible scenario,Â from theÂ traditional desktopÂ workstation to the ultra-portable handheldÂ mobile phone.Â But what if the design of these objects could help usersÂ enforce the boundaries between work and personalÂ life?</p>
<p>For instance, aÂ device with a keyboard in front of a screen conveys âproductivity tool,â while a touch tablet experience feels moreÂ casualÂ andÂ entertainment-focused.Â What if remote workers could have theÂ optionÂ to switch between these two modalities to signal a switch from âworkâ to âpersonalâ?</p>
<p>Another area that has exploded into theÂ techÂ spotlight isÂ video chat and conferencingÂ tools. For many of us,Â the majority ofÂ our interactions are now playing out via virtual meetings on video conferencing apps. HD webcamsÂ and ring lightsÂ have been in high demand, and the number of virtual backgrounds and effects multiply daily.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But there are still many challenges and limitations to the video conferenceÂ experience, partlyÂ because itâs so dependent onÂ the hardwareÂ design.Â ToolsÂ likeÂ Zoom, Google Hangouts and Teams have all been racing to keep up with the latest upgrades, but the software can only go so farÂ withoutÂ tacklingÂ hardwareÂ hurdles likeÂ integrated lighting sources, improved audioÂ or evenÂ tactile feedback.</p>
<p>However, if we start toÂ acceptÂ these paradigm shiftsÂ of in-person to virtual, we can begin to design for the future normal with hardware upgrades like aÂ camera lens no larger than a pixel that disappears into theÂ screen to make it appear as if users areÂ making direct eye contact with their colleagues.Â Other areas, such asÂ the application of temperature andÂ tactile technologies, canÂ help us feel deeper connections with one anotherÂ via virtual spaces. There may also be new possibilities in exploring olfactory technologies as immersive experiences continue to evolve.</p>
<p>But what does this hardware evolutionÂ actually lookÂ like when it comes to production and consumption? While theÂ expediencyÂ and convenience of technology is certainly impressive,Â itÂ comes at a cost to our planet.</p>
<h2>Have consumers become Earthâs abusers?</h2>
<p>When IÂ think aboutÂ myÂ mostÂ cherishedÂ possessions,Â whatÂ theyÂ haveÂ in common is thatÂ they areÂ old and rare. Of course, this isÂ typicalÂ ofÂ valuableÂ items,Â but why couldnât we bring thisÂ value systemÂ to our tech products?Â While I swap out my iPhone every year or two,Â I take tremendous joy in upgrading parts on my DucatiÂ motorcycleÂ bit by bit. I would never think of tossing it out for a brand new one.</p>
<p>AsÂ consumerÂ demand for sustainable solutionsÂ increase,Â hardwareÂ companies mustÂ adjustÂ theirÂ offerings.Â Powerful brands likeÂ AppleÂ could be a great leader in strongÂ regenerative practices.Â Building your own desktop PC is nothing new (especially for hardcore gamers)Â but imagine aÂ future whereÂ all portable tech is modularÂ with swappable upgrades. What if 50 years from now, your smartphone from 2025Â isÂ aÂ stillÂ functionalÂ and highly valuedÂ piece of vintage tech?</p>
<p>The reality of our new normal is that theÂ plethoraÂ ofÂ devicesÂ isÂ not going away,Â whileÂ software developments areÂ continuing toÂ makeÂ leaps and bounds. Itâs time weÂ startedÂ thinking about ourÂ devicesÂ as objects to keep and care for, repairing and refurbishing things like phonesÂ and computers to keep up with the latestÂ advancements,Â much like weÂ do withÂ our cars or even our homes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re trying to get a mortgage or an auto loan, banks will put on their judging glasses and look into your past. Makes sense; it&#8217;s a reasonably reliable indicator as to whether you&#8217;ll be able to repay your loans or not. Student financing is a little different. Sure, your past plays a role, but for a lot of education, having a degree dramatically changes your earning potential, and hence your ability to repay. With a philosophy that the current student loan systems perpetuate the rich-get-richer systems, <a href="https://stridefunding.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stride Funding</a> is taking a different approach and just raised $12 million to help it take the business a few more steps into the future.</p>
<p>The issue at the heart of the company is one of equality and access to education &#8212; one of the most significant indicators as to whether someone will have an opportunity for financial upward mobility. As you might expect, there are layers of privilege (can your parents help pay for your loans) and &#8212; more specifically &#8212; institutionalized racism in the picture. It is with quixotic optimism that Stride Funding is taking on the $130 billion student loan industry, which currently has $1.6 trillion worth of loans outstanding.</p>
<p>Since closing its seed round in 2019, Stride increased the capital committed to students to over $50 million, with capital providers such as Silicon Valley Bank seeking to finance hundreds of millions of additional funds.The main thrust behind the company is to make education more available, especially to populations that have traditionally struggled to secure financing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241985" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Especially in student lending, there&#8217;s this massive gap in terms of access to capital,&#8221; says Tess Michaels, CEO and founder at Stride Capital. &#8220;Ninety-two percent of private loans require co-signers, and less than a fourth of students actually have access.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company today announced it closed a $12 million Series A financing, led by <a href="https://www.firework.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firework Ventures</a> (co-founded by Brigette Lau and Ashley Bittner). Other investors include impact investors such as <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/juvo-ventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juvo Ventures</a> and <a href="http://www.ghco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graham Holdings</a> â alongside previous investors GSV Ventures, Slow Ventures and Sinai Ventures. The Stride Funding team has a personal mission at the core of its business:</p>
<p>&#8220;Both my parents immigrated here to the States, and education was their pathway to economic mobility. Education is what opens doors. And unfortunately for a lot of historical reasons, I think a lot of folks, especially underrepresented populations, are just left out of the market,&#8221; says Michaels, highlighting how this difference further amplifies the gap between the haves and the have-nots. &#8220;I feel very tied to the mission. We have supported such a wide range of really, really amazing, inspiring students, from refugees to DACA students, women, underrepresented minorities, and so on. We get such encouraging stories all the time from students, and it just reinforces that this is something that is worth doing.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I admit I was thinking about the Oura Ring incorrectly. I was thinking of the device as an alternative to my Apple Watch. I suppose this is true, in the vaguest sense &#8212; likely for most people, itâs one or the other. After all, two activity trackers is overkill for most. Itâs also cost-prohibitive. At $299, weâre well within smartwatch territory on the pricing front.</p>
<p>Thereâs also the fact that, starting with the Ring 3, Oura is adding a $6/month subscription fee that kicks in after a six-month grace period. The new service arrives with additional features, but also sticks behind a paywall metrics that were previously free to users. The Oura Ring 3 is, in a word, an investment. But it isnât a smartwatch.</p>
<p>If anything, itâs a successor to the fitness band &#8212; a category we donât think about much these days, but one that utterly dominated the wearable category before Apple sunk its teeth into the space. Companies like Fitbit and Xiaomi still sell a ton of the things on an annual basis, but theyâve largely fallen out of fashion in favor of their more fully featured brethren. The more Iâve begun to think about the Oura Ring as a fitness band (or, perhaps more appropriately, <em>health </em>band), the more it has begun to make sense.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242507" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2240774" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240774" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2240774" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240774" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It is, in a sense, a passive device &#8212; not one that buzzes and beeps, constantly demanding attention throughout the day. The Oura Ring is a device to be worn and largely ignored, save for the occasional predetermined nudge for things like movement reminders. And if weâre being honest, thatâs always going to be the case here. Sure, many fitness bands have blurred the line with displays, but the ring form factor has some very real limitations with regard to real estate.</p>
<p>Rather, the Ring is designed to stay out of the way, collecting actionable sleep, health and fitness data that you can peruse later on a connected mobile app. And really, thatâs long been the selling point here. For the most part, a ring is better at staying out of your way than a fitness band. That was the appeal of Motivâs initial play &#8212; and while that product seemingly moved away from the fitness category, itâs a banner than Oura has been more than happy to pick up and run with.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240776" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240776" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2240776" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240776" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before we venture any further, a confession: Iâm not a ring guy. I donât particularly like rings and donât wear them (cue: âDon&#8217;t Fence Me Inâ). This is one of the big reasons Iâm not going to be a regular Oura user. Iâve also, honestly, become fairly attached to my smartwatch. That said, Iâve been wearing the Ring 3 for the prescribed two weeks. That was Ouraâs recommendation/soft demand for reviewing the product.</p>
<p>It was a strange request, as far as these things go. When reviewing hardware, you generally like to spend as much time with the product as possible. Easier said than done, sometimes. But here, the company insists that a fortnight is required for setting a kind of baseline measurement. Itâs not that readings are going to be bad for the first two weeks, so much as things will be better when youâve been wearing the device for a bit and Oura has a clearer idea of your habits, sleep and biometrics.</p>
<p>And itâs understandable, given that weâre all different, and customization is a key to any sort of health device. My guess is that sort of buy-in wonât be difficult to engender among those willing to plunk down $299 for a ring. Itâs also a relatively simple lift given that itâs a minimally invasive product. Again, as someone who isnât a ring person, it took some getting used to, but as a bit of a restless sleeper myself, itâs easier to wear to bed than a big, bulky smartwatch. Letâs take a moment to appreciate the built-in irony of a sleep-tracking device thatâs hard to wear to bed. The Oura Ring is not that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s comfortable. Because itâs a ring. Again, Iâm not a ring guy, but the simple fact of it occupying less real estate makes it less invasive. Design-wise, the product is virtually identical to its predecessor. Itâs a single-color metal band, round, but for a flatish edge that denotes the top of the product.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240777" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240777" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2240777" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240777" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>If you donât know your ring size, the company will send a sizing kit Ã  la Warby Parker, featuring a number of plastic dummy rings. Youâre encouraged to wear one around for 24 hours, as the human finger has a way of swelling and contracting during the day. I chose my size and color (a matte black) and waited. Ultimately, I found the final product to be a bit looser than its plastic counterpart, but the ring stayed on fine. And, indeed, I found that the exact fit tended to evolve over the day.</p>
<p>On the face of it, the device looks like a standard ring &#8212; and thatâs really the appeal. You will, however, sometimes see a green glow emanating from the inner circle, as the ringâs sensors grab a heart rate reading. Daytime heart rate monitoring is among a handful of new features available at launch, along with period production (something I admit that I did not have an opportunity to test) and improved temperature sensing. Based solely on those new features, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/the-oura-ring-is-the-personal-health-tracking-device-to-beat-in-2020/">3 represents an incremental update over the 2</a>.</p>
<p>The list of upcoming features arriving this year and next is a significantly longer one, including additional content like meditation and breathing sessions, workout heart rate monitoring, more accurate sleep staging and SpO2 blood oxygen sensing. In the case of that last one, in particular, itâs not entirely surprising it was delayed &#8212; and Ouraâs certainly not alone in turning on a key health sensing feature after launch. In this case, itâs not about FDA approval (not yet, at least), but rather implementation.</p>
<p>This stuff is tricky to get right, and that likely goes double when youâre not Samsung or Apple. It is, however, a long list of promised features that will likely leave many potential consumers wondering why the company didnât wait to launch a more fully realized product. I do ultimately wonder if itâs a piece of a deeper strategy to offer a base of hardware with the promise that features will continue to improve and roll out over the course of its life.</p>
<p>After all, thereâs no question that Oura has some long-term ambitions with this stuff. Look no further than the <a href="https://ouraring.com/blog/category/research-validation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myriad studies</a> in which the company has participated. A cursory glance at its blog shows everything from depression to the impact of phone usage on sleep to adapting to undersea environments. Not everything is going to prove out, and certainly most or many would lead to brand new features, but at the very least, thereâs some interesting insight here into precisely how much weâll ultimately be able to monitor or predict with sensors. Among other things, those studies do appear to have proven out the accuracy of measuring things like heart rate on a finger versus the wrist.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I prefer a wrist-worn tracker like the Apple Watch for its workout tracking. I was able to pair the two and use them to paint an overall picture of my activity. I recognize not everyone has the means &#8212; or desire &#8212; to do this, however. Where the Oura Ring ultimately succeeds versus more traditional trackers is its emphasis on actionable insights &#8212; thatâs precisely why the company is so insistent people let it determine a baseline before judging its efficacy.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2242516" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2242516" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2242516" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_7294.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="705" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_7294.jpeg 2550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_7294.jpeg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_7294.jpeg?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_7294.jpeg?resize=768,529 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_7294.jpeg?resize=680,468 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_7294.jpeg?resize=1536,1058 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_7294.jpeg?resize=2048,1410 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_7294.jpeg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2242516" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Things like recovery and readiness tend to be overlooked by these sorts of devices. Oura describes the latter thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Readiness is your main Oura score and is designed for you and only you, helping you discover what works for your body and lifestyle. Readiness is a holistic picture of your health â taking into account your recent activity, sleep patterns, and direct body signals (like resting heart rate, heart rate variability, and body temperature) that can signify if your body is under strain.</p></blockquote>
<p>Effectively, it takes all of the metrics it has been collecting and determines whether youâre doing a good enough job recovering between them. Recovery Time was a constant red flag for me. Which, fair enough. I could and probably should be doing a better job letting my body recover between workouts. Itâs certainly something to improve on, as the red âPay attentionâ notifications plainly indicate.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240780" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240780" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2240780" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240780" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Another place that pops up is sleep. Clicking over to the Home tab, the app notes, âYour heart rate decreased late last night, so you might not by fully recovered. To help your body recharge, how about taking a moment to unwind today?â It seems obvious on the face of it that, say, meditating at night (versus the morning when I usually do) or practicing breathing exercises before bed, would be better for my (admittedly restless) sleep than, say, doom scrolling with my buds on Twitter.</p>
<p>But in amongst the daily grind, itâs easy to lose sight of this fact. Iâve always said that one of the underrated and under discussed benefits of a wearable is that itâs kind of the tech equivalent of tying a string around your finger. Itâs an injection of mindfulness and a reminder of why you made that investment in the first place. We buy these things because we want to better ourselves. And in a world where technology too often does the opposite, some positive technological reinforcement is a net positive.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 2, 2021! Thereâs a lot going on. More fintech in Latin America. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/actuator-robots-for-bathrooms-agtech-food-and-architecture/">Actuator launching</a>. App Store Awards. The weekâs software selloff. Itâs a lot, so buckle in. Maybe the news slowdown will come next week? Hereâs hoping! â <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-admin/twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/">Better.com shows how not to fire people</a>: Hereâs a small tip: If you announce that you have raised or otherwise managed to access hundreds of millions of dollars, donât fire a bunch of your team right afterward. Not only is it bad PR â and it definitely is â itâs also just an awful thing to do. Anyways, Better.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/better-com-gets-750m-cash-infusion-in-new-agreement-with-its-spac-backers/">got access to half its SPAC money early</a> and then laid off 9% of its staff.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/super-app-grab-starts-trading-on-supersized-spac-combination/">Grab goes public, quickly sheds value</a>: The Grab SPAC was supposed to be a crowning moment of sorts for the company. And then, despite raising oodles of capital and avoiding the poison of shareholder redemptions, shares of Grab still ate it <em>hard</em> today. Despite stocks rising in the United States, the Nasdaq-listed Grab shed around 20% of its value, at least as I write this to you. Ouch.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/apple-announces-the-2021-app-store-award-winners-and-most-downloaded-apps-of-the-year/">Guess who won App Store Awards</a>: No really, guess. <em>I </em>would not have anticipated that a mobile League of Legends game would win the iPhone gaming prize. It feels a bit anachronistic that Apple picks favorites each year, a bit like the Grammys, if the Grammys also owned the music marketplace. Perhaps we should do some sort of Best of TechCrunch collection and see if Apple News picks it up.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/google-timnit-gebru-ai-research-dair/">Timnit Gebru gets the last laugh</a>: Following her high-profile exit from Google, former Alphabet AI ethicist Gebru âhas set up shop herself with a brand new research institute, DAIR, focused on the topics she felt were being sidelined at Google,â TechCrunch reports. The best revenge is living well, they say. That or founding your own company to do the damn work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/social-app-irl-makes-its-first-acquisition-with-deal-for-digital-nutrition-company-aabeze-labs/">IRL buys AaBeZe Labs</a>: This story makes me happy. Because there was a time when app names made no sense. And then startups started to have names like Vertical SaaS 4 Ur Industry, and it all got a bit corporate. IRL is a social app, while AaBeZe does âdigital nutrition.â Hell yeah, tech being weird. I will now go take 17 virtual supplements to avoid getting a virus.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/playground-launches-in-beta-to-help-creators-cultivate-community/">Say it with me: ~ community ~</a> Community became a buzzword in the startup space after it got super expensive to buy an audience from social networks. So, build your own community, and it makes acquiring customers cheaper! Viola! Thereâs more to it than that, but thatâs a bit of context regarding what Playground is up to. Per TechCrunch reporting, âPlayground is a social platform that seeks to help people discover and develop community while empowering creators to monetize their audience.â (Donât forget that if you say âmonetize communityâ three times in the mirror, you only get coal in your stocking.)</li>
<li>Two stories from Mexico: Mendel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/mexicos-mendel-secures-35m-to-tackle-corporate-spend-management-in-latam/">has raised $35 million</a> to work on the corporate spend issue that has proven so lucrative in the United States. And Kueski <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/mexican-bnpl-player-kueski-secures-202m-as-it-nears-100m-in-arr/">just added a bajillion dollars</a> to its accounts to help it grow its Mexico-focused BNPL solution.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/glorify-an-ambitious-app-for-christians-just-landed-40-million-in-series-a-funding-led-by-a16z/">Glorify raises venture capital money</a>: Nothing says âChristianityâ like raising venture capital to fund an app that sells folks religious material. And while weâre just muttering Matthew 19:24 to ourselves, we should note that a16z just backed Glorify to the tune of $40 million. We presume $4 million will get tithed.</li>
<li>How much does it cost to deliver groceries? Trick question. The answer is infinite capital. Evidence? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/instant-grocery-delivery-startup-jokr-bags-another-huge-round-to-enter-unicorn-status/">JOKR just raised again</a>, and Swiggy is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/swiggy-to-invest-700-million-in-express-delivery-service-instamart/">going to drop $700 million</a> on its own âinstantâ grocery delivery effort.</li>

<p>Bret Taylor is on a roll: On Monday, he became the chair of Twitterâs board, and a day later, Salesforce made him its co-CEO and co-chair.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">NVIDIA&#8217;s plan to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-arm-acquisition-softbank-000846113.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">acquire ARM</a> just hit a major stumbling block. The Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">has sued</a> to block the merger over concerns the $40 billion deal would &#8220;stifle&#8221; competition for multiple technologies, including datacenters and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-mercedez-benz-autonomous-vehicle-computer-173014585.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">car computers</a>. ARM is a &#8220;critical input&#8221; that fosters competition between NVIDIA and rivals, the FTC said, and a merger would give NVIDIA a way to &#8220;undermine&#8221; those challengers.</p>
<p>The FTC was also worried NVIDIA would have access to sensitive info from ARM licensees. The merger could reduce the incentive for ARM to develop tech that might run counter to NVIDIA&#8217;s business goals, officials added. The administrative trial is due to start August 9th, 2022.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The company didn&#8217;t appear bothered. NVIDIA characterized the lawsuit as the &#8220;next step&#8221; in the FTC process, and repeated its arguments in favor of the buyout. The acquisition would &#8220;accelerate&#8221; ARM&#8217;s product plans, foster more competition and still protect the chip architecture designer&#8217;s open licensing model, according to NVIDIA. You can read the full statement below.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Despite the claims, an FTC lawsuit is a huge issue for NVIDIA. The Commission files lawsuits like these when it believes a company is breaking the law â concessions might not be enough. It also comes after the European Commission launched an investigation into the purchase in October. NVIDIA is facing questions from major regulators clearly wary of the acquisition, and those agencies might not accept the answers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242458" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As it stands, NVIDIA&#8217;s competition likely isn&#8217;t happy. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-objects-nvidia-arm-purchase-191827082.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">Qualcomm reportedly objected</a> to the ARM deal in communications with the FTC (among other bodies) over fears NVIDIA might refuse to license designs. And when heavyweights like Apple, MediaTek and Samsung also depend on ARM, it&#8217;s doubtful the rest of the market would be enthusiastic. At the least, the trial would likely delay closure of the union past NVIDIA&#8217;s original 2022 target.</p>
<blockquote><p>As we move into this next step in the FTC process, we will continue to work to demonstrate that this transaction will benefit the industry and promote competition. NVIDIA will invest in Armâs R&amp;D, accelerate its roadmaps, and expand its offerings in ways that boost competition, create more opportunities for all Arm licensees and expand the Arm ecosystem. NVIDIA is committed to preserving Armâs open licensing model and ensuring that its IP is available to all interested licensees, current and future.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What goes up must come down. And what goes SPAC must go splat? We&#8217;ll keep workshopping that.</p>
<p>Regardless, shares of super app Grab took a pounding today after its SPAC combination was approved last night and began to trade this morning. Grab&#8217;s stock initially rose, before falling sharply as the day went on.</p>
<p>By the close of trading, Grab was worth $8.75 per share, or down 20.53%, per Yahoo Finance&#8217;s <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRAB?p=GRAB">count</a>. Shares fell another 1.7% as of the time of writing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242418" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But Grab&#8217;s lackluster performance was only one from SPAC-led debuts today. Buzzfeed also ran into a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/buzzfeed-suffers-wave-of-spac-investor-withdrawals-before-going-public-11638472756">redemption buzzsaw</a> while trying to get its SPAC deal done, while its staff was in <a href="https://twitter.com/bfnewsunion">open revolt</a> and its leadership tried to bring them into line by threatening to dock their pay &#8212; that will fix it, surely.</p>
<p>And there was more. MetroMile, the neoinsurance company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/pay-per-mile-auto-insurer-metromile-is-heading-to-public-markets-via-spac/">went public via a SPAC</a>, hit a new 52-week low today of $2.27 per share before recovering. Given that the company&#8217;s 52-week <em>high</em> was just over $20 per share, its declines are this side of legendary.</p>
<p>There are other splashes of SPAC blood on the public-market walls. Shares of Desktop Metal are under the $6 mark after shooting as high as $34.94 in the last year. That&#8217;s another SPAC combo that has largely deflated post-consummation. Who else? Lordstown: Today it&#8217;s worth $4.14 per share, despite being worth as much as $31.56 in the last year.</p>
<p>The list goes on. There will be some SPAC winners. SoFi is still above the $10 per share mark by a good margin, for example, butÂ <em>woof</em>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>What about Grab, though?</h2>
<p>When we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/super-app-grab-starts-trading-on-supersized-spac-combination/">were parsing Grab&#8217;s third-quarter results this morning</a>, we noted its falling revenues and rising losses. Those key performance metrics were pointing in the wrong direction.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fFQ9vtzxHJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/super-app-grab-starts-trading-on-supersized-spac-combination/">Super app Grab starts trading on supersized SPAC combination</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Super app Grab starts trading on supersized SPAC combination&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/super-app-grab-starts-trading-on-supersized-spac-combination/embed/#?secret=fFQ9vtzxHJ" data-secret="fFQ9vtzxHJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Still, with redemptions at effectively zero, and the <a href="https://www.axios.com/grab-trading-spac-merger-nasdaq-d4452495-01b0-46b7-9d6a-d6ef94746cef.html">SPAC backer holding for three years</a>, I presumed that there was something in Grab that I was missing. There was not, as it turned out.</p>
<p>The growth method of avoiding investor discontent is to post lots of revenue expansion, thus making evenÂ <em>rising</em> losses appear smaller, at least in percentage-of-revenue terms. Flat losses are better. And falling losses best, of course. But if revenue is in declineÂ <em>while</em> losses are going up, then things areÂ <em>bad</em>.</p>
<p>Not that Grab won&#8217;t pull it all together in time. It might! But going public with falling top line and rising red ink was never going to be easy. Perhaps we should be less surprised that Grab has managed little other than underperformance thus far as a public company.</p>
<p>Not a great week for SPACs.</p>

<p>In a discussion about culture versus history on this edition of the Gang, Denis Pombriant invokes the Beatles as examples of agents of change that used rock and roll to alter the arc of history. &#8220;Just understand that four kids from Liverpool changed the entire culture of the world. Not immediately, but over time.&#8221; With the release of almost 8 hours of footage documented the beginning of the group&#8217;s last year of existence, those of us who revere the output and impact that ended some 50 years ago have perhaps now reached our limit. As I endured the 3-part saga each night of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, I kept thinking that enough was finally enough.</p>
<p>Maybe Jack Dorsey thought the same thing as he quit his CEO job at Twitter. Conventional wisdom says he either was asked to leave by a board larded with corporate raiders and unhappy investors, or just plain was done. I think he did a pretty good job with a social network invented by him and loved by its embedded fans. Recent social software like newsletters and Clubhouse clones has brought the company to an interesting place in the road where it can serve the role of a postwar Hollywood studio managing the transition to a new era of subscription media.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241959" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Saturday morning I&#8217;m some two hours away from the end of the Beatles&#8217; Get Back, and it&#8217;s been much more than I&#8217;d imagined. For days I&#8217;ve been joking that this is finally the end of the story, but it&#8217;s nothing like that. The thing that was created may be over, but the group is really just now forming its place in the history of the world. Each day grows closer to the moment when Lennon hopes they&#8217;ve passed the audition, but we already know the answer from the earliest moments. Yes it is, it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>Harrison is the deepest into the essence of what they&#8217;ve created, with his anger fueling the project. The three song writers are done listening to each other on a pragmatic level, struggling with their fame but not willing to give any of it up just yet. Harrison and Ringo decrypt Octopus&#8217;s Garden, but the kernel in the scene is George&#8217;s command of the full Beatle envelope. As he sketches out the chord structure of Ringo&#8217;s tune, he foreshadows the second part of the project, the Abbey Road return to Beatle studio magic. As each chord resonates, the shimmer of the Beatle process appears, glows, and then is replaced by the next chord and process.</p>
<p>Lennon and McCartney exist more in relation to each other, each somewhat frozen in fatigue from grappling with the other. Harrison is more than willing to blow things up, but his ongoing narrative commentary is both accurate and positive in its optimism. He&#8217;s been living in this fishbowl long enough to know he is the only one of the group to prod it forward. When he injects Billy Preston into the sessions, everyone else can see what is obvious to Harrison. When McCartney runs down Let It Be, Preston disappears into the mix. Lennon thirsts for the live feel Preston summons, but McCartney won&#8217;t surrender his apparent control of the project by endorsing a new group member.</p>
<p>A different hierarchy emerges in the film: Without Lennon (asleep or anesthetized at home) the three default to McCartney but function only when Harrison is engaged. When McCartney senses the Frankenstein heâs enabled in Harrison, he retreats to the relative safety of Lennonâs call-and-response wit. Ringoâs eyes widen as he waits for his opening, a coiled cheshire cat. Harrison lays trap after trap for those who appear unobservant only to comment later on what was going down. George Martin is a third straight project deep into unraveling this slow motion meltdown, but appears surprisingly ineffective at adding punch to the rope-a-dope circulating in the room. Watch Harrisonâs eyes as he glancingly acknowledges the camera for only the frames necessary to raise a smile. He is the director, screenwriter, and auteur of this thing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Several remaining questions: what went on the day the group forbade the cameras at Saville Row? Before the pause and palpably after, the music tightens up as the band does some of its magic to the material. Harrison&#8217;s Get Back lead guitar switches places with Lennon&#8217;s rhythm guitar. The presumed wisdom is that the Quiet Beatle is laying out post-quitting the Twickenham sessions, but the results suggest otherwise. McCartney&#8217;s chops on the roof are transformational on all the tracks, a sign of the songs having locked into a pocket to be mined in the studio a few weeks later on Abbey Road tracks I Want You (She&#8217;s So Heavy), Something, and Come Together.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t believe the conventional wisdom. Now that we&#8217;ve all been in the room, who&#8217;s kidding who? Not McCartney, who talked divorce well before the project ran aground in the drafty Twickenham studio. Not Lennon, who months earlier knew the group was in trouble when their manager died. The Magical Mystery Tour debacle should have convinced them they couldn&#8217;t just wing a TV show, but they tried it again anyway. George Martin wasn&#8217;t their producer; he was their mentor. Ringo actually married a Bond girl. They spoke a secret language to each other. There was no Fifth Beatle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just two days after officially (and quietly) confirming that it intends to replace the International Space Station with a commercial station by 2030, NASA has awarded over $400 million in agreements to three companies to further develop private station plans.</p>
<p>The three companies, which received the awards under the agencyâs Commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) Destinations program, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nanoracks for $160 million</li>
<li>Blue Origin for $130 million</li>
<li>Northrop Grumman for $125.6 million</li>
</ul>
<p>NASA received eleven proposals in total, director of commercial spaceflight Phil McAlister said Thursday. He added that of the three chosen proposals, there was a diversity of technical concepts and a variety of logistical and launch vehicle options offered. &#8220;This diversity not only enhances the likelihood of success of NASA strategy, but it also leads to a high degree of innovation, which is critical in most commercial space endeavors,&#8221; he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242445" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The three companies have already released a handful of details about their proposals. Blue Origin is calling its station concept <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/blue-origin-boeing-and-others-join-sierra-space-to-build-commercial-space-station/">âOrbital Reef,â</a> and it is designing it with Boeing, Sierra Space and others. The team said it wants to launch the station in 2027. Meanwhile, Nanoracks is calling its station, which is being developed with its parent company Voyager Space and aerospace prime Lockheed Martin, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/voyager-nanoracks-and-lockheeds-starlab-is-the-latest-sign-that-the-low-earth-orbit-economy-is-coming/">âStarlab.â</a> While Northrop didnât give its station proposal a flashy name, itâs working with Dynetics to deliver a modular design based around its Cygnus spacecraft.</p>
<p>These substantial awards mark the first phase of a two-phase process as NASA seeks to ensure that there will be no gap between the retirement of the ISS and the introduction of a new station. NASA has repeatedly stressed, both to Congress and more recently in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/nasa-details-intent-to-replace-the-international-space-station-with-a-commercial-space-station-by-2030/">a report by the Office of Inspector General</a>, that the overall success of the development of a thriving economy in LEO is dependent upon avoiding this gap.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223413" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223413" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223413" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Underneath.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Underneath.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Underneath.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Underneath.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Underneath.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Underneath.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Underneath.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Underneath.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Underneath.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223413" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://www.blueorigin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Origin <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>âIf there is no habitable commercial destination in low Earth orbit after the ISS is decommissioned, NASA will be unable to conduct microgravity health research and technology demonstrations needed for long-duration human exploration missions to the Moon and Mars, significantly increasing the risk ofâor delayingâthose missions,â the agency said in the report.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To dodge this potential scenario, NASA has proposed for one or more commercial LEO âdestinationsâ (as it sometimes calls stations) to be operational by 2028 &#8212; giving a two-year overlap before the ISS is retired by the end of the decade. While that report raised doubts as to the feasibility of hitting that timeline, each of the three companies and NASA executives were confident in their ability to avoid a station gap.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that a decade after commercial cargo was launched, folks are still questioning the robustness and ingenuity and flexibility of the commercial pathway,&#8221; Jeffrey Manber said. &#8220;Sure, there are challenges going forward, [&#8230;] we have a robustness, we have a multiplicity of providers working on this. This is exactly the right way to go forward on risk mitigation, to have multiple providers on the commercial pathway.&#8221;</p>
<p>This first set of awards will help the companies develop their designs, work that is expected to continue through 2025.</p>
<p>In the second phase of the program, which is targeted to commence in 2026, NASA intends to certify for human use one or more stations &#8212; from this group of companies or other entrants &#8212; and ultimately become one of many customers purchasing in-orbit services and use of the stations. NASA said in a statement that this will allow it to focus on its Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon, and eventually human spaceflight to Mars.</p>
<p>Notably absent is Axiom Space, which won a separate award to send up modules to attach to the ISS before separating and self-orbiting as its own station, but the company clarified that it did not bid on CLD.</p>
<p>The big question, of course, is how much these stations will end up costing &#8212; and how much of the overall cost NASA will end up paying. McAlister said the agency &#8220;encourage bidders to maximize their financial contribution to these activities,&#8221; and he noted that non-NASA investment currently stood at around 60% with NASA&#8217;s contribution under 40%. But the three companies, and the agency, wouldn&#8217;t say much more about how much capital they&#8217;re anticipating expending for designing, launching and operating their stations.</p>
<p><em>The story has been updated with additional details from the media briefing.Â </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From its motorsport beginnings to today, Swedish electric automaker Polestar has come a long way. According to CEO Thomas Ingenlath, the Volvo spin-off is just getting started.</p>
<p>Ingenlath, along with members of the automaker&#8217;s leadership team, laid out a three-year plan for Polestar during a presentation in New York on Thursday that included an ambitious sales goal and a peek at its next electric vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cars are a very highly emotional affair,&#8221; Ingenlath said as he kicked off his pitch to media.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242429" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2242434" style="width: 8619px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Polestar_3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2242434" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2242434 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Polestar_3.jpg" alt="Polestar 3 electric vehicle" width="8609" height="6456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Polestar_3.jpg 8609w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Polestar_3.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Polestar_3.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Polestar_3.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Polestar_3.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Polestar_3.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Polestar_3.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Polestar_3.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 8609px) 100vw, 8609px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2242434" class="wp-caption-text">Polestar 3 electric vehicle teased at an event in December 2021. <strong>Image Credits:</strong>Â Polestar</p></div></p>
<p>At its core, the plan is to launch three new vehicles by 2024, expand the number of vehicles sold to about 290,000 units, and do so in new markets across Europe and Asia Pacific. The foundations for this expansion are the company&#8217;s own core values of design, sustainability, innovation and customer engagement.</p>
<p>Sustainability in particular was emphasized during the event, with Polestar reaffirming its mission to produce a carbon neutral car by 2030. This will be dependent on a number of sustainable practices big and small, from using recycled materials to changing how Polestar does business on the supply chain level.</p>
<p>We know very little about the upcoming Polestars 3 and 4, though Ingenlath insisted the ball was rolling on production of both, even offering a teaser image of the 3 to whet the EV aficionados&#8217; appetites. The all-electric SUV will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/polestar-to-build-its-first-all-electric-suv-in-the-united-states/">built in the United States</a>, specifically in Charleston, South Carolina.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Along with being produced in a climate-responsible manner, the Polestar 3 will also be equipped with hardware from lidar developer Luminar and Nvidia-sourced processors to make its advanced driver assistance system capable of automated driving on highways, though it seems this feature won&#8217;t be available at launch.</p>
<p>Little beyond that is known of the 3, and even less of the Polestar 4, though it&#8217;s billed as a premium sport SUV &#8220;Coupe,&#8221; with a more rakish fastback profile, according to the teaser graphics displayed during the presentation. Polestar has also used the Porsche Cayenne and Macan as price-point benchmarks for the 3 and 4, respectively, so we can infer that these competitors also set the bar for the level of luxury and performance both cars intend to challenge.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the car we know the most about is the furthest one away: the Polestar 5.</p>
<p>It was recently announced that the Precept Concept will indeed go into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/polestar-is-bringing-its-precept-sedan-to-market-in-2024-with-a-new-name/">full production as the 5th Polestar</a>, a four-door luxury sport GT. As it stands, the Precept is in a way a physical declaration of Polestar&#8217;s future and will inform the upcoming SUVs as well.</p>
<p>The jump from 29,000 units sold to 290,000 in three years sounds daunting, as well as increasing Polestar&#8217;s presence, but Ingenlath isn&#8217;t worried. &#8220;From here on in, Polestar is all about growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>With its production already underway, we&#8217;ll likely hear more about the Polestar 3 sooner than later.</p>
