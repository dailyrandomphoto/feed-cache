										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://getconsciousgrowth.com/">Remagine</a>, a financing platform offering banking services to high-growth companies with an ‘impact’ twist, has raised €20 million ($24M) in a Seed funding round. The Berlin-based startup has been operating in stealth mode, but already has 20 clients under its former brand name &#8216;Get Conscious Growth&#8217;. Its backers include former Global Head of Google Payment Jonathan Weiner and former COO of Venmo Michael Vaughn. Remagine’s lead investor is unmade but Techcrunch understands it comprises largely of debt financing.</p>
<p>The fintech will specialize in offering revenue-based financing for high-growth and impact-led businesses, which tends to be more founder-friendly than equity or debt products, allowing them to quickly secure funding while staying in control of their business. Remagine will rollout business accounts in the coming months from its base in Germany, and plans to expand across Europe.</p>
<p>While the fashion in fintech for a while now has been ‘Neo’ or ‘challenger’ banks, there is a new breed arriving: financing platforms. These offer banking services but also offer extra features aimed at new businesses. Another example is Rho in New York, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rho-a-startup-bank-aimed-at-high-growth-businesses-raises-15m-series-a-led-by-m13-ventures/">recently</a> raised $15m.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ‘twist’ is that Remagine is going to aim at business with a ‘sustainable and impactful’ bent to their business model which might have a ‘positive social and environmental impact’. Remagine itself says it is also committing to impact-driven initiatives and will contribute 10% of its profits to impact causes.<br />
 <br />
Founded by Julia M. Profeta Johansson and Sebastian Dienst, co-CEO Dienst said in a statement: “We believe capital and technology can be forces for good. When used together, they can be powerful tools that help shape the future. The challenge now is to shape it in a way that aligns people and planet with profit,” said “We believe that every business – big and small – can be more sustainable and impactful. Remagine has been created to help them achieve this.”<br />
 <br />
Johansson added: “Having already provided financing to numerous companies, the funds raised will allow us to support many more startups towards more impact. With the upcoming launch of our accounts and cards, we’re excited to continue to grow the team, invest further in our products, and help create a world where money and business are forces for good.”<br />
 <br />
Weiner said: “Sustainability and impact have become increasingly relevant for businesses over the past decade and today, research shows that nearly four-fifths of CEOs are planning to align their business strategy with social and environmental goals.. Remagine’s mission and business model enables founders to consider both their bottom line and their impact. This is the future of financing and we’re delighted to be a part of it.”<br />
 <br />
Remagine’s products will include Team cards (unlimited separate cards for team members to improve expense management); Multi-IBANs; analytics; zero negative interest; and free accounts. It’s competitors include <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/finom-e735">Finom</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pentafintech">Penta</a>, but these tend to focus more on SMEs rather than startups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Klook, the Hong Kong-based travel activities platform backed by SoftBank Vision Fund, announced the closure of $200 million in funding for its Series E round, lifting the startup&#8217;s total capital raised to date to $720 million.</p>
<p>Aspex Management, an investment fund focused on Asia Pacific led the round, alongside existing backers Sequoia Capital China, Softbank Vision Fund 1, Matrix Partners China, Boyu Capital, as well as a handful of new investors.</p>
<p>Securing sizable funding at a time the COVID-19 pandemic sacks the global economy is congratulatory, not to mention Klook is in an industry severely hit by the virus. The startup, which enables its mostly Asia-based users to book activities in overseas destinations, lost millions of orders over the first few months of travel restrictions. The company quickly regrouped for a pivot to staycation and software-as-a-service for local activity merchants, including ticketing, distribution, inventory management and marketing. Bookings subsequently rebounded.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There are things to do at home, as well as local things to do when people could travel,&#8221; co-founder and chief operating officer Eric Gnock Fah told TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/klook-post-covid/">in an interview last July</a>. &#8220;Now [the pandemic] is giving us an opportunity to add a new aspect to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The arrival of the new funding appears timely. Klook reached profitability in a number of markets by last July but overall was still in an aggressive expansion mode, it told TechCrunch at the time. Founded in 2014, Klook exceeded $1 billion in valuation in 2018 but declined to reveal its latest post-money valuation, which almost certainly has increased since it reached the unicorn status. The company currently has no plans to go public, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;COVID-19 pivot: Travel unicorn Klook sees jump in staycations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/klook-post-covid/embed/#?secret=AZrNMNuUsZ" data-secret="AZrNMNuUsZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan where COVID-19 restrictions have gradually eased, Klook said it saw increased spending on local activities, with bookings reaching near pre-COVID levels. At the height of the pandemic, Klook onboarded 150% more activities compared to the same period in 2019.</p>
<p>Today, Klook&#8217;s SaaS software powers millions of bookings for more than 2,500 merchants worldwide. With proceeds from the new investment, it will continue working on the development and roll-out of its merchant SaaS solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new capital further strengthens our leading position to take us from defense to offense, as domestic tourism becomes ubiquitous and international travel gradually returns,&#8221; said Ethan Lin, co-founder and chief executive at Klook.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During a visit to India in 2014, Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos made a splashy announcement: His firm was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/30/amazon-to-invest-2b-in-its-india-marketplace-as-competition-with-flipkart-intensifies/">investing $2 billion</a> in the South Asian nation, just a year after beginning operations in the country.</p>
<p>Amazon’s announcement underscored how far India had come to open up to foreign firms. The nation, which had largely kept doors shut to international giants between its independence in 1947 to liberalization in 1991, has slowly transformed itself into the world’s largest open market.</p>
<p>In a televised interview in 2014, Bezos said that there was a perception about India not being an easy place to do business. But Amazon’s growth in the country, he said, was proof that this belief is not accurate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Are there obstacles? There are always obstacles. Anywhere you go, every country has its own regulations and rules,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Six years, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">more than $4.5 billion of additional investments later</a>, Amazon today appears to be facing more obstacles than ever in India, the second-largest internet market with more than 600 million users.</p>
<p>Long-standing laws in India have constrained Amazon, which has yet to turn a profit in the country, and other e-commerce firms to not hold inventory or sell items directly to consumers. To bypass this, firms have operated through a maze of joint ventures with local companies that operate as inventory-holding firms.</p>
<p>India got around to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/27/amazon-walmart-india-e-commerce-restrictions/">fixing this loophole in late 2018</a> in a move that was widely seen as the biggest blowback to the American firm in the country at the time. Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart scrambled to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/01/amazon-flipkart-india-law/">delist hundreds of thousands of items</a> from their stores and made their investments in affiliated firms way more indirect.</p>
<p>Now the nation is set to further toughen this approach. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/india-ecommerce-amazon-walmart/exclusive-india-plans-foreign-investment-rule-changes-that-could-hit-amazon-idUSKBN29O0XG">reported</a> last week that New Delhi is considering making adjustments to some provisions that would prevent affiliated firms to hold even an indirect stake in a seller through their parent.</p>
<p>The Confederation of All India Traders, an Indian trade body that claims to represent over 80 million businesses, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/india-ecommerce-amazon-walmart/indian-trader-group-says-minister-pledges-strict-foreign-investment-rules-for-e-commerce-idUSKBN29R1BK">told the publication</a> that Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has assured the organization that it is working to shortly address concerns about alleged violations of current rules.</p>
<p>The forthcoming policy change is only one of the many headaches for the world’s largest e-commerce firm in India.</p>

Last year, during Bezos&#8217; visit to the country, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">they held several protests</a>. (Photo by SAJJAD HUSSAIN/AFP via Getty Images)</p></div></p>
<p>Amazon is aggressively fighting a battle to block a deal between its estranged partner Future Group and Reliance Retail, the two largest retail chains in India.</p>
<p>Last year, Future Group announced that it would sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/29/indias-reliance-retail-to-acquire-future-groups-retail-wholesale-and-logistics-businesses-for-3-4-billion/">to Reliance Retail for $3.4 billion</a>. Amazon, which in 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/amazon-future-coupons/">bought stakes in one of Future Group’s unlisted firms</a>, says that the Indian firm has breached its contract (which would have given Amazon the right to first refusal) and engaged in insider trading.</p>
<p>Despite technology giants and investors ploughing more than $20 billion to create an e-commerce market in India in the past decade, online retail still accounts for only a single-digit pie of all retail in the country.</p>
<p>In recent years, Amazon, Walmart and scores of other startups have embraced this realization and sought to work with neighborhood stores that dot tens of thousands of cities, towns and villages in India.</p>

<p>With Reliance Retail and telecom giant Jio Platforms, two subsidiaries of one of India’s largest corporates (Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/jiomart-the-e-commerce-venture-by-indias-richest-man-launches-in-additional-cities/">entering the e-commerce market</a>, and receiving the backing of global giants including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/india-approves-googles-4-5-billion-deal-with-reliances-jio-platforms/">Facebook and Google last year</a>, cornering a big stake in Future Group is one of the few ways Amazon can accelerate its growth in India.</p>
<p>The American e-commerce firm has had little luck so far in overturning the deal between the Indian firms. Last year, Amazon reached out to Indian antitrust body Competition Commission of India, and market regulator SEBI to block this transaction. Both the bodies have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/bse-sebi-amazon-reliance-retail-future-india/">ruled in favor</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/india-approves-reliances-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-brings-a-new-headache-to-amazon/">Future Group and Reliance Retail</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon must have foreseen this outcome because it initiated the legal proceedings at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/amazon-legal-notice-india-future-group-deal-reliance-retail/">an arbitration court in Singapore</a>. It’s no surprise that the firm chose to also pursue its legal argument outside of India.</p>
<p>Most cases that reach the Singapore International Arbitration Court have <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2020/12/12/why-more-indian-business-disputes-are-settled-elsewhere">come from India</a> in recent years. Vodafone, which has invested more than $20 billion in India, and has been dealt with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/vodafone-idea-shares-tumble-23-after-india-orders-it-to-pay-billions-in-dues/">billions of dollars in unpaid taxes by the country</a>, is another high-profile name to have knocked on the door in Singapore. After losing in India, it emerged victorious in the Singapore arbitration court last year.</p>
<p>Amazon on Monday <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Amazon-moves-Delhi-HC-to-enforce-Singapore-order-and-block-Reliance-Future-deal/articleshow/80453045.cms">filed a new petition</a> in Delhi High Court in which it is seeking to enforce SIAC&#8217;s ruling (which ordered last year that the deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/25/reliance-says-its-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-fully-enforceable-under-indian-law-despite-amazon-winning-an-arbitration-order/">should be temporarily halted</a>) and prevent the Indian firm from going ahead with the deal based on CCI and SEBI’s judgements.</p>
<p>The company alleges that Future Group “deliberately and maliciously” disobeyed the international arbitration ruling from SIAC. In its petition, Amazon is also seeking detention of Kishore Biyani, the founder and chairman of Future Group.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Vocal for Local&#8221;</h2>
<p>As India grappled with containing the spread of the coronavirus last year, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the 1.3 billion citizens to make the country “self-reliant” and “be vocal for local.”</p>
<p>The move to turn inwards contrasts with his major promise in the first few years of assuming power in 2014 when he pledged to make India more welcoming to foreign firms than before. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/technology/india-technology-american-giants.html">recent years</a>, India has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/india-modi-silicon-valley-future-internet/">proposed or enforced several regulations</a> that hurt American firms, though none appear to suffer as much as Amazon.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Last year, New Delhi started to enforce a 2% tax on all foreign billings for digital services provided in the country. The U.S. Trade Representative said earlier this month that India was taxing numerous categories of digital services that are “not leviable under other digital services taxes adopted around the world.”</span></p>
<p>The aggregate tax bill for U.S. companies could exceed $30 million per year in India, USTR’s investigation found. In conclusion, it found India’s digital tax move to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/us-says-india-italy-and-turkey-digital-taxes-are-discriminatory-but-wont-take-any-actions-for-now/">inconsistent with international tax principles</a>, unreasonable and burdening or restricting U.S. commerce.</p>
<p>Modi’s new way of life for India will be music to the ears of Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, an ally of the prime minister and India&#8217;s richest man.</p>
<p>Before selling stakes worth over $20 billion in Jio Platforms and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/reliance-retail-raises-1-3-billion-from-pif/">more than $6 billion in Reliance Retail</a> to marquee foreign investors, Ambani famously made a speech in 2019 in which he urged the need to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/18/in-india-amazon-and-walmart-face-off-against-the-countrys-richest-man/">protect Indians’ data in patriotic terms</a>.</p>
<p>“We have to collectively launch a new movement against data colonization. For India to succeed in this data-driven revolution, we will have to migrate the control and ownership of Indian data back to India &#8212; in other words, Indian wealth back to every Indian,” he said.</p>
<p>Why so many international firms have invested in one of Reliance’s properties remains a big question. A senior executive at an American firm told TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity (out of fear of retribution) that the investments in Jio Platforms, which is India’s largest telecom network with nearly 410 million subscribers, and Reliance Retail is a déjà vu moment for the nation, where a few decades ago one of the only ways to do business in the nation was to partner with a local firm with massive political clout.</p>
<p>In a series of tweets, <a href="https://twitter.com/tame_wildcard/status/1283352570614841344">Raman Chima</a>, a former policy executive at Google and who now works at nonprofit digital advocacy group Access Now, alleged that the Android-maker had weighed in 2011-12 partnering and investing in a firm like Reliance to “turn-the-page on Indian political risks.”</p>
<p>The idea prompted concerns about Google’s values, he claimed. “More than one executive involved in those discussions flagged concerns around Reliance’s reputation, particularly around problematic approaches towards gaining influence with policymaking civil servants and politicians, money, ethics in govt-business relationships.”</p>
<p>Amazon itself was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/amazon-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-a-9-9-stake-in-indias-reliance-retail/">rumored</a> to be interested in getting a multi-billion-dollar stake in Reliance Retail last year, but it appears the two firms have stopped engaging on any matter.</p>

<p>While Amazon sorts out these issues, last week delivered another blow to the firm. A senior executive with the firm as well as Indian makers of a mini-series for Amazon Prime Video are under threat of criminal prosecution in the country after Modi’s ruling party deemed the show offensive to the country’s Hindu majority.</p>
<p>A Hindu nationalist group, politicians with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and a BJP group representing members of India’s lower castes, were among those who had filed police reports against the nine-part mini-series “Tandav” and Amazon. The company bowed to the pressure and edited out some scenes.</p>
<p>“The true reason for the complaints against &#8216;Tandav&#8217; may be that the show holds up a mirror uncomfortably close to Indian society and some of the problems blamed on Mr. Modi’s administration. In the opening episode, the show features protesting students and disgruntled farmers, echoing events that have taken place in recent months,” The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/22/business/india-amazon-tandav.html">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>“Mirzapur,” another show of Amazon, also attracted a criminal complaint in India last week for hurting religious and regional sentiments and defaming the Indian town. The Indian Supreme Court has <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-notice-to-mirzapur-makers-amazon-prime-video-on-plea-over-portrayal-of-up-district-in-bad-light-101611211829348.html">issued notices</a> to the makers of “Mirzapur” and has sought responses.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned interview, Bezos said Amazon&#8217;s job was to follow all the unique rules various countries require it to comply with and &#8220;adapt our business practice to those rules.”</p>
<p>In India, the company is increasingly being asked how far it is willing to adapt its business practice. How far is it willing to bend that it&#8217;s no longer the Amazon people cared for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blackberry and Chinese search engine giant Baidu have agreed to expand a partnership that aims to give automakers the tools they need to launch next-generation connected and autonomous vehicles in China.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Baidu&#8217;s high-definition maps will be integrated into Blackberry&#8217;s QNX Neutrino Real-Time Operating System. The embedded system will be mass produced in the upcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the electric vehicle arm of GAC Group, one of the country&#8217;s top three automakers that produces more 2 million vehicles a year.</p>
<p>The aim of this new, expanded partnership is to &#8220;provide car manufacturers with a clear and fast path to the production of autonomous vehicles, with safety and security as the top priority,&#8221; according to a statement from Wang Yunpeng, senior director of the technology department of Baidu&#8217;s Intelligent Driving Group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The partnership between Baidu and Blackberry is notable because it inserts a foreign operating system into Chinese-made vehicles even as the government there has called for native tech.</p>
<p>Blackberry&#8217;s QNX software handles the functional safety, network security and reliability pieces, while Baidu has invested in the development of artificial intelligence and deep learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together, we can help car manufacturers quickly produce safe autonomous vehicles and promote the development collaboratively of the intelligent networked automobile industry,&#8221; Yunpeng said.</p>
<p>Blackberry, once the dominate force in the smart phone industry, has found success getting its QNX technology into vehicles. Today, the software is used in the advanced driver assistance, digital instrument clusters and infotainment systems of more than 175 million vehicles.</p>
<p>The agreement builds on the two companies January 2018 agreement to make BlackBerry QNX&#8217;s operating system the foundation for Baidu&#8217;s &#8216;Apollo&#8217; autonomous driving open platform.</p>
<p>The deal with Baidu also helps Blackberry continue to carve out market share in China, where it&#8217;s a more recent entrant. Last year, Blackberry announced QNX would be integrated into Tesla rival Xpeng&#8217;s electric vehicles in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;With BlackBerry QNX&#8217;s embedded software as its foundation, Baidu has made significant progress as part of its Apollo platform in establishing a commercial ecosystem for innovative technologies that OEMs can leverage for their next generation vehicles,&#8221; Dhiraj Handa, vice president of channel, partners and APAC, BlackBerry Technology Solutions, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Baidu&#8217;s autonomous driving program, known as Apollo, has been described as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/baidus-apollo-platform-becomes-the-android-of-the-autonomous-driving-industry/">“an Android for smart driving.</a>&#8221; The Apollo program has landed more than hundred manufacturing and supplier partners. Baidu has also been busy testing autonomous driving and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3101168/baidu-opens-its-robotaxis-public-beijing-making-it-third-city-china">launch a robotaxi fleet</a> in September.</p>
<p>The deal also comes on the heels of Baidu&#8217;s push beyond automotive software and into the production of vehicles. Baidu announced earlier this month that it plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/baidu-electric-car-making/">set up a new company</a> to produce electric vehicles with the help of Chinese automaker Geely. Baidu will provide so-called smart driving technologies while Geely handles will the design, engineering and manufacturing of the vehicles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">President Joe Biden said Monday the U.S. government would replace the entire federal fleet of cars, trucks and SUVs with electric vehicles manufactured in the United States, a commitment tied to a broader campaign promise to create 1 million new jobs in the American auto industry and supply chains.</p>
<p>The commitment, if it bears out, could give a boost to U.S. automakers, particularly those that have diverse portfolios that include passenger cars, commercial vans and light trucks.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Biden made the comments prior to signing the Made in America executive order, which places stricter rules on the federal government&#8217;s procurement practices. The government has existing &#8220;buy American&#8221; rules, which states that a certain amount of a product must be made in the U.S. for a purchase to qualify for a federal contract.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Biden said this order closes loopholes and aims to increase purchases of products made in the United States. The executive order increases that product threshold and the price preference for domestic goods — meaning the difference in price from which the government can buy a product for a non-U.S. supplier. It also updates the process for how the government decides if a product was sufficiently made in America.</p>
<p>In the midst of his speech, Biden said the buy American directive would extend to the federal government&#8217;s massive fleet of vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The federal government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we&#8217;re going to replace with clean electric vehicles made right here in America, by American workers, creating millions of jobs — a million auto worker jobs.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9LwXrS4vS6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/">GM targets delivery companies with new EV business unit BrightDrop</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GM targets delivery companies with new EV business unit BrightDrop&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/embed/#?secret=9LwXrS4vS6" data-secret="9LwXrS4vS6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The opportunity is a large one. The U.S. government had more than 645,000 vehicles in its fleet in 2019, the <a href="https://d2d.gsa.gov/report/federal-fleet-open-data-visualization">most recent data available</a> from the General Services Agency. Of those, about 224,000 are passenger vehicles and more than 412,000 are trucks.</p>
<p>&#8220;GSA is committed to exploring opportunities to leverage the purchasing and leasing power of the federal government to address the climate crisis, including greening the federal fleet,&#8221; a GSA spokesperson told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. &#8220;GSA currently manages over 224,000 passenger vehicles in its fleet to support the Federal Government’s mission. By leveraging clean energy vehicle technologies, GSA will support the President’s climate goals, while working with the American automotive manufacturing industry to ensure that these next generation vehicles are built in America by American workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The directive won&#8217;t be easy to fulfill. Many of these federal vehicles are leased, which could slow the transition depending on the contract lengths. There are other obstacles, including charging infrastructure and supply. And while it doesn&#8217;t appear to be a requirement, Biden has publicly stated numerous times — including Monday — that he supports union automotive jobs.</p>
<p>Tesla is considered the dominant U.S. manufacturer of electric vehicles. However, the company&#8217;s lack of union workers and the higher cost of its vehicles — even the less expensive Model 3 — could be a barrier.</p>
<p>Ford and GM might not have a vast supply of electric vehicles at the moment, but they do have union shops and both automakers are investing heavily to expand their EV offerings.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">GM launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/">new business unit</a> earlier this month to offer commercial customers an ecosystem of electric and connected products as part of the company’s $27 billion bid to become a leading electric automaker. The new business, called BrightDrop, will begin with two main products: an electric van called the EV600 with an estimate range of 250 miles and a pod-like electric pallet dubbed EP1.</p>
<p>GM has said it plans to bring 30 new electric vehicles to a global market through 2025. More than two-thirds of those launches will be available in North America and every one of GM’s brands, including Cadillac, GMC, Chevrolet and Buick, will be represented, according to the automaker.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ford revealed in November a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/ford-unveils-e-transit-its-45000-electric-workhorse/">configurable all-electric cargo</a> van called the E-Transit as part of its $11.5 billion investment in electrification. Ford has largely focused its electrification efforts on the consumer market, notably the Mustang Mach-E. The E-Transit, which will be built at its Kansas City Assembly Plant in Claycomo, Missouri, is aimed at the commercial sector.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5g5nmWFchJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/ford-unveils-e-transit-its-45000-electric-workhorse/">Ford unveils the 2022 E-Transit, its $45,000 electric workhorse</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ford unveils the 2022 E-Transit, its $45,000 electric workhorse&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/ford-unveils-e-transit-its-45000-electric-workhorse/embed/#?secret=5g5nmWFchJ" data-secret="5g5nmWFchJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There are a growing number of newer EV entrants as well, including Rivian, Lordstown Motors and Fisker. Rivian is expected to begin producing and delivering its electric pickup truck in July, followed by its all-electric SUV. Rivian is also developing and assembling electric vans for Amazon.</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s call to transform the fleet supports statements he made throughout his campaign. Biden pledged to &#8220;use all the levers of the federal government,&#8221; including purchasing power, R&amp;D, tax, trade, and investment policies to position the U.S. to be the global leader in the manufacture of electric vehicles and their input materials and parts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the United Kingdom <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prepares to sharpen its focus</a> on how it regulates big tech companies, Facebook is taking a big step up in the role it plays in presenting media to the U.K. public, and into how it works with the country&#8217;s media industry.</p>
<p>Today it is launching Facebook News in the U.K., Facebook&#8217;s first market outside of the U.S. for its dedicated, curated news portal &#8212; accessed, like the U.S. version, through a tab in the Android or iOS app menu.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical alignright size-large wp-image-2100449" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-12.05.33-AM.png?w=311" alt="" width="311" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-12.05.33-AM.png 574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-12.05.33-AM.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-12.05.33-AM.png?resize=137,300 137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-12.05.33-AM.png?resize=311,680 311w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-12.05.33-AM.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px" />The portal will launch with content from hundreds of local and national media organizations including Channel 4 <span class="il">News</span>, Daily Mail Group, DC Thomson, Financial Times, Sky <span class="il">News and</span> Telegraph Media Group. The Economist, The Guardian, The Independent, STV and hundreds of local <span class="il">news</span> sites from Archant, Iliffe, JPI Media, Midlands <span class="il">News</span> Association, and Reach, as well as &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; titles GQ, Cosmopolitan, Glamour, Vogue and others were<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/launching-facebook-news-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> announced</a> in an earlier list of partners last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Again, as with the U.S. version, users will be provided a list of curated top stories of the day; a list of personalized stories based on news sources you might already follow or interests you have (these might be from publications you don&#8217;t already follow); and dedicated news sections for sports, entertainment, health and science and technology. Users can indicate when they like stories, or when they want to hide them to train the algorithms better.</p>
<p>Facebook has confirmed to us that it will be working with a service called Upday to curate<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the stories that appear </span><span class="il" style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">on News. &#8220;T</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he product is a mix of curated, top stories and personalized links chosen by algorithm,&#8221; a spokesperson said. Upday appears to be a <a href="https://www.axelspringer.com/en/brands/upday-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joint collaboration</a> between </span>German publisher Axel Springer and Samsung, which also <a href="http://upday.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">runs a news service</a> on its phones powered by it.</p>
<p>It is not clear what the financial terms of the deal is between Facebook and Upday, but <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/01/facebook-to-pay-uk-media-millions-to-licence-news-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, the licensing deals Facebook is cutting with publishers to place their content in News collectively run into the tens of millions of pounds, with the biggest publishers making millions a year from the the agreements. While those figures might pale to what Facebook makes in ad revenues globally &#8212; that reaches into the tens of billions of dollars quarterly &#8212; they represent significant sums for the beleaguered U.K. media industry.</span></p>
<p>People have long used newsfeeds on Facebook and other social sites to catch up with news while also browsing posts from friends, Groups and Pages that they follow. Facebook News aims to take that a step further, as a curated page for links and headlines from hundreds of publications in the country to provide users of its mobile apps a one-stop place to read the stories of the moment.</p>
<p>Social media continues to be a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/bad-news-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">major source of news for consumers</a>, but as we&#8217;ve seen, a very skewed and flawed source at that.</p>
<p>Within that context, Facebook says that its intention with Facebook News is to provide a more balanced and dedicated mix of news to people beyond what they might encounter in their newsfeeds, while also tailoring it to users&#8217; interests.</p>
<p>It also helps that Facebook News provides yet another way for Facebook &#8212; which has made efforts in video, entertainment content, mentoring and job-hunting, Nextdoor-style community listings, peer-to-peer selling, and more &#8212; to continue diversifying away from the Newsfeed for those who have grown bored with that: now, people can come to the Facebook app to browse news, too.</p>
<p>Still, this international expansion has been a long time coming: Facebook News first launched as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/25/facebook-news-tab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test in the US more than a year ago, in October 2019</a>, before rolling out to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/facebook-news-launches-to-all-in-u-s-with-addition-of-local-news-and-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all users last June</a>.</p>
<p>No word from Facebook on how many users or engagement the U.S. version of Facebook News has picked up, except that &#8220;it has grown steadily,&#8221; according to a spokesperson.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why there&#8217;s been such a long gap between its first efforts in the U.S. and the U.K. launch today, but Facebook has had more going on in addition to securing those licensing deals to roll out in this market.</p>
<p>L<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">aunching a new news portal, with the message that it&#8217;s designed to &#8220;help&#8221; publishers, takes on a new dimension when you consider that</span> Facebook has also been i<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">n the crosshairs of regulators in Europe, who have been on a long-term mission to scrutinize the reach of big tech companies. In the UK, that is soon taking the form of a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;pro-competition&#8221; Digital Market Unit</a> that will re-examine the role companies like Facebook and Google play in advertising, media and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Whether those regulatory moves will impact how a service like Facebook News works, or what revenue cuts and usage data are shared with news partners, remains to be seen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the meantime, it&#8217;s full speed ahead for more scaling: Facebook </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/facebook-news-to-expand-internationally-to-the-u-k-germany-france-india-and-brazil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed plans last year</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> that its long-term aim is for a bigger international expansion for Facebook News, with the longer list of countries including Brazil, France, Germany, and India. In a blog post today, Facebook&#8217;s director of news partnerships in Europe, Jesper Doub, confirmed France and Germany were next in line for Facebook News, although no launch dates were specified.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If social networks and other platforms are to get a handle on disinformation, it&#8217;s not enough to know what it is — you have to know how people react to it. Researchers at MIT and Cornell have some surprising but subtle findings that may affect how Twitter and Facebook should go about treating this problematic content.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/false-news-fact-check-timing-0125">MIT&#8217;s contribution</a> is a counterintuitive one. When someone encounters a misleading headline in their timeline, the logical thing to do would be to put a warning before it so that the reader knows it&#8217;s disputed from the start. Turns out that&#8217;s not quite the case.</p>
<p>The study of nearly 3,000 people had them evaluating the accuracy of headlines after receiving different (or no) warnings about them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Going into the project, I had anticipated it would work best to give the correction beforehand, so that people already knew to disbelieve the false claim when they came into contact with it. To my surprise, we actually found the opposite,&#8221; said study co-author David Rand in an MIT news article. &#8220;Debunking the claim after they were exposed to it was the most effective.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Tv7mh8bBYj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/why-the-world-must-pay-attention-to-the-fight-against-disinformation-and-fake-news-in-taiwan/">Why the world must pay attention to the fight against disinformation and fake news in Taiwan</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why the world must pay attention to the fight against disinformation and fake news in Taiwan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/why-the-world-must-pay-attention-to-the-fight-against-disinformation-and-fake-news-in-taiwan/embed/#?secret=Tv7mh8bBYj" data-secret="Tv7mh8bBYj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When a person was warned beforehand that the headline was misleading, they improved in their classification accuracy by 5.7%. When the warning came simultaneously with the headline, that improvement grew to 8.6%. But if shown the warning afterwards, they were 25% better. In other words, debunking beat &#8220;prebunking&#8221; by a fair margin.</p>
<p>The team speculated as to the cause of this, suggesting that it fits with other indications that people are more likely to incorporate feedback into a preexisting judgment rather than alter that judgment as it&#8217;s being formed. They warned that the problem is far deeper than a tweak like this can fix.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no single magic bullet that can cure the problem of misinformation,&#8221; said co-author Adam Berinsky. &#8220;Studying basic questions in a systematic way is a critical step toward a portfolio of effective solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/01/people-follow-crowd-no-matter-its-politics">The study from Cornell</a> is equal parts reassuring and frustrating. People viewing potentially misleading information were reliably influenced by the opinions of large groups — whether or not those groups were politically aligned with the reader.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s reassuring because it suggests that people are willing to trust that if 80 out of 100 people thought a story was a little fishy, even if 70 of those 80 were from the other party, there might just be something to it. It&#8217;s frustrating because of how seemingly easy it is to sway an opinion simply by saying that a large group thinks it&#8217;s one way or the other.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BUER0op1i6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/biden-campaign-facebook-letter-trump-jr-army-for-trump/">Ringing alarm bells, Biden campaign calls Facebook &#8216;foremost propagator&#8217; of voting disinformation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ringing alarm bells, Biden campaign calls Facebook &#8216;foremost propagator&#8217; of voting disinformation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/biden-campaign-facebook-letter-trump-jr-army-for-trump/embed/#?secret=BUER0op1i6" data-secret="BUER0op1i6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;In a practical way, we’re showing that people’s minds can be changed through social influence independent of politics,&#8221; said graduate student Maurice Jakesch, lead author of the paper. &#8220;This opens doors to use social influence in a way that may de-polarize online spaces and bring people together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Partisanship still played a role, it must be said — people were about 21% less likely to have their view swayed if the group opinion was led by people belonging to the other party. But even so, people were very likely to be affected by the group&#8217;s judgment.</p>
<p>Part of why misinformation is so prevalent is because we don&#8217;t really understand why it&#8217;s so appealing to people, and what measures reduce that appeal, among other simple questions. As long as social media is blundering around in darkness they&#8217;re unlikely to stumble upon a solution, but every study like this makes a little more light.</p>

This is supposed to be a complement to the existing system where Twitter removes or labels particularly problematic tweets, rather than a replacement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/latch/">Latch</a> becomes the latest company to join the SPAC parade. Founded in 2014, the New York-based company came out of stealth two years later, launching a smart lock system. Though, like many companies primarily known for hardware solutions, Latch says it’s more, offering a connected security software platform for owners of apartment buildings.</p>
<p>The company is set to go public courtesy of a merger with blank check company TS Innovation Acquisitions Corp. As far as partners go, Tishman Speyer Properties makes strategic sense here. The New York-based commercial real estate firm is a logical partner for a company whose technology is currently deployed exclusively in residential apartment buildings.</p>
<p>“With a standard IPO, you have all of the banks take you out to all of the big investors,” Latch founder and CEO Luke Schoenfelder tells TechCrunch. “We felt like there was an opportunity here to have an extra level of strategic partnership and an extra level of product expansion that came as part of the process. Our ability to go into Europe and commercial offices is now accelerated meaningfully because of this partnership.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The number of SPAC deals has increased substantially over the past several months, including recent examples like Taboola. According to Crunchbase, Latch has raised $152 million, to date. And the company has seen solid growth over the past year &#8212; not something every hardware or hardware adjacent company can say about the pandemic.</p>
<p>As my colleague Alex noted on Extra Crunch today, “Doing some quick match, Latch grew booked revenues 50.5% from 2019 to 2020. Its booked software revenues grew 37.1%, while its booked hardware top line expanded over 70% during the same period.”</p>
<p>“We’ve been a customer and investor in Latch for years,” Tishman Speyer President and CEO Rob Speyer tells TechCrunch. “Our customers &#8212; the people who live in our buildings &#8212; love the Latch product. So we’ve rolled it out across our residential portfolio […] I hope we can act as both a thought partner and product incubator for them.”</p>
<p>While the company plans to expand to commercial offices, apartment buildings have been a nice vertical thus far &#8212; meaning the company doesn’t have to compete as directly in the crowded smart home lock category. Among other things, it’s probably a net positive if you’re going head to head against, say Amazon. That the company has built in partners in real estate firms like Tishman Speyer is also a net positive.</p>
<p>Schoenfelder says the company is looking toward such partnerships as test beds for its technology. “Our products have been in the field for many years in multifamily. The usage patterns are going to be slightly different in commercial offices. We think we know how they’re going to be different, but being able to get them up and running and observe the interaction with products in the wild is going to be really important.”</p>
<p>The deal values Latch at $1.56 billion and is expected to close in Q2.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Three years ago, we released the first edition of the Matrix Fintech Index. We believed then, as we do now, that fintech represents one of the most exciting major innovation cycles of this decade. In 2020, all the long-term trends forcing change in this sector continued and even accelerated.</p>
<p>The broad movement away from credit toward debit, particularly among younger consumers, represents one such macro shift. However, the pandemic also created new, unforeseen drivers. Among them, millennials decamped from their rentals in crowded cities to accelerate their first home purchases to the benefit of proptech companies and challenger mortgage players alike.</p>
<p>E-commerce saw an enormous acceleration in growth rates, furthering adoption of online payments platforms. Lastly, low interest rates and looming inflation helped pave the way for the price of Bitcoin to charge toward $30,000. In short, multiple tailwinds combined to produce a blockbuster year for the category.</p>
<p>In this year’s refresh of the Matrix Fintech Index, we’ll divide our attention into three parts. First, a look at the public stocks’ performance. Second, liquidity. Third, we highlight one major trend in the sector: Buy Now Pay Later, or BNPL.</p>
<h2>Public fintech stocks rose 97% in 2020</h2>
<p>For the fourth straight year, the publicly traded fintechs massively outperformed the incumbent financial services providers as well as every mainstream stock index. While the underlying performance of these companies was strong, the pandemic further bolstered results as consumers avoided appearing in-person for both shopping and banking. Instead, they sought &#8212; and found &#8212; digital alternatives.</p>

<p>Our own representation of the public fintechs’ performance is the Matrix Fintech Index &#8212; a market cap-weighted index that tracks the progress of a portfolio of 25 leading public fintech companies. The Matrix fintech Index rose 97% in 2020, compared to a 14% rise in the S&amp;P 500 and a 10% drop for the incumbent financial service companies over the same time period.</p>

<p>E-commerce undoubtedly stood out as a major driver. As a category, retail e-commerce grew 35% YoY as of Q3, propelling PayPal and Shopify to add over $160 billion of market capitalization over the year. For its part, PayPal in the third quarter signed up 15 million net new active accounts (its highest ever).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A walk is, more often than not, a solitary experience. As far as the age of COVID-19 is concerned, that’s probably more bug than feature. It’s a way to escape the confines of a shutdown for a few glorious moments, to get some air and, for better or worse, reflect on the day that’s passed or the one to come.</p>
<p>It can, like many things these days, however, be isolating.</p>
<p>For me, long weekend walks have been a sort of lifesaver throughout this bizarre year. Following two months of being completely sidelined over (non-COVID) health issues, I began walking more per week than I ever have. It was a slow process at first &#8212; frankly, never leaving my one-bedroom apartment for April and May made it so it was physically painful to walk around the block when I finally felt comfortable going outside.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These days, I walk every morning, regularly crossing the bridge into Brooklyn and Manhattan. Until I started using Apple’s new Fitness+ service a few times a day, it was easily my main source of exercise. In November, however, my Apple Watch Activity bars swapped the more generic gray for the Fitness+ yellow. But even as I’ve made a point to do a couple of indoor exercises a day, I still start each day with a walk. Rain, snow, this weekend’s sub-freezing weather &#8212; skipping a day would feel like breaking a promise to myself.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100227" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100227" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2100227" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_6696.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="496" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_6696.jpg 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_6696.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_6696.jpg?resize=300,145 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_6696.jpg?resize=768,372 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_6696.jpg?resize=680,330 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_6696.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100227" class="wp-caption-text">My actual bars (not sure what happened in September &#8212; maybe testing a competitor&#8217;s device)</p></div></p>
<p>This morning Apple dropped the first five installments (episodes?) of Time to Walk. The feature is an attempt to expand the Fitness+ experience beyond the confines of its titular iOS app. A largely Watch-based experience, the feature leverages much of the wearable’s existing features (and Apple’s growing software ecosystem) to offer a more tailored and multimedia experience than you would get listening to a podcast or music alone.</p>
<p>As with the canny arrival of Fitness+ (December) and handwashing for watchOS (September), Apple says the timing was something of a happy coincidence. The company had been working on the feature well before COVID-19 entered the picture.</p>
<p>“Everything from Time to Walk and our launch of Fitness+ was something we had been working on well before COVID,” the company’s senior director of Fitness Technologies Jay Blahnik tells TechCrunch. “From the very beginning, we thought of Fitness+ as a place where everyone was welcome. We wanted it to feel like a place where, whether you’re new to fitness or very fit, there was something for everyone.”</p>
<p>For many, a walk (or push, in the case of those who use a wheelchair for mobility) is square one when it comes to daily workouts. For my part, I was certainly far more comfortable taking quick strolls around the neighborhood. With limits on space and no real exercise equipment to speak of beyond a kettlebell and yoga mat, attempting to approximate the gym experience at home has seemed a fool’s errand.</p>
<p>April found me trying some YouTube yoga classes with limited efficacy. Like most attempts to exercise, it didn’t stick. Walking every day was the only thing that did. And for the first time in my life, COVID-19 found me walking without any particular destination in mind. That old cliché about it being about the journey not the destination is fine when you don’t mind constantly being late to meetings. Walking for the sake of itself, however, changes the dynamic significantly. I speak to artists, writers and musicians on a regular basis for my podcast. The common sentiment is a familiar one: You simply can’t force creativity. But for those who make a point to regularly walk and run, it’s perhaps the most surefire way to kickstart the process.</p>

<p>Time to Walk is Apple’s attempt to capture some of that lightning in a bottle &#8212; to follow a rotating cast of big names as they walk through locations that mean something to them. The company says it’s been making an effort to meet guests where they are and essentially coach them through the process. The ability to do so is, of course, depends on their given location &#8212; especially with all of the sorts of travel restrictions that have been in place since early last year.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Apple says, the decisions of where to record are made by the guests. “Some guests said, ‘this is where I want to go,’ ” says Blahnik. “And some guests were like, ‘no, I want to to do the walk I normally do.’ For us, it’s not about Shawn Mendes in the Grand Canyon, it’s about where they want to go. Sometimes that’s limited by COVID, but what we found delightful was for many people, they loved to take the walk they loved to take.”</p>
<p>The first four guests &#8212; Mendes, Dolly Parton, Draymond Green and Uzo Aduba &#8212; run the gamut on approaches. “We think about the stories, we think about the diverse guest,” says Blahnik. We think about all of the ways you’d like the conversations to go. But what was important to us was that the idea resonated with them. The idea of going out for a walk, having a lovely conversation and hearing stories that could give you a different perspective.”</p>
<p>Parton, who turned 75 earlier this month, recorded her session in a studio &#8212; in contrast to the other three names. She relates a handful of stories largely revolving around her upbringing in Sevier County (pronounced “severe”), Tennessee. There’s a story about a Christmas tree and one about opening a literacy center with the help of her father (who struggled with his own ability to read and write).</p>
<p>She somewhat self-effacingly relates a story about the time her hometown erected a statue of her. “So I went home, and I said, ‘Daddy, did you know they&#8217;re putting a statue of me? Do you know about the statue down at the courthouse?’ ” Parton explains. “And Daddy said, ‘Well, yeah, I heard about that.’ He said, ‘Now, to your fans out there, you might be some sort of an idol. But to them pigeons, you ain&#8217;t nothing but another outhouse.’ ”</p>
<p>According to Parton, her father would visit the statue at night with a bucket of soap and water to clean the pigeons’ mess off his daughter’s likeness. Her segment culminates with something approaching a behind the music-style segment, describing stories behind three of her own songs: “Coat of Many Colors,” “Circle of Love” and “9 to 5.” The latter is the real gem of the bunch, contrasting her morning routines to costars Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, while describing the role her acrylic nails played in the songwriting and recording process.</p>

<p>Green’s stories are more emblematic of the rest. On a walk around Malibu, the Warriors power forward discusses some inspiration stories on and off the court, from being told he would never be a star to a time he tried and failed to cheat on a test in school. The stories are purposefully personal. Aduba relates some of her own struggles to break into acting, as she walks her amusingly named dog Fenway Bark through Fort Green Park in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>The guests share images relating to their stories or snapshots of where they go on their walks, which are delivered to the wrist with a haptic buzz. At they end of the journey, they share three handpicked songs that can be saved to a playlist on Apple Music, similar to what the company has done for its Fitness+ workouts.</p>
<p>Write-ups of the Time to Walk have thus far compared it to podcasting &#8212; understandably so, given that it’s an on-demand, audio-first experience. Though the feature, which downloads directly onto the Watch when the new installment drops once a week, has its own flavor, according to Apple.</p>
<p>“Often podcasts are hosted,” Blahnik says, by way of distinction. “In our journey to build out this experience, we certainly considered if there should be a host walking with this person. What we realized is that, for what we were trying to create, the intimacy of having the singular guest talk to you felt a lot more like you were on a walk with them. The notion that it’s not happening in a studio (in almost all cases), that they’re walking someplace that inspires them. You’ll hear that with Draymond and Shawn &#8212; with Shawn he’s huffing and puffing up that hill and it’s kind of nice because you’re in that moment together.”</p>
<p>Time to Walk isn’t raw, exactly. It is an Apple production, after all. The company’s certainly not tossing out found audio here. But the content does seem more off-the-cuff than many of its productions, even as it’s packaged together with a slick intro and a trio of songs at the end. But it&#8217;s a nice change of pace for those looking for something that feels a little more personal than we’re accustom to from some of the names involved.</p>
<p>Your own mileage will vary, depending on, among other things, your interest in the guest. Though, there’s always a chance someone you’ve never been particularly interested in &#8212; or even heard of &#8212; will offer some unique tidbit or interesting way of looking at things. That’s one of the potential upsides of having Apple doing the curating here &#8212; there’s some interesting potential for discovery. And even in the case of artists you’re familiar with, there’s good potential to discover something new.</p>
<p>The weekly 20 to 45-minute audio supplement won’t make the actual act of walking any less solitary &#8212; but for a little while, at least, it’s nice to feel like someone’s along for the ride.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starting next month, Facebook will open up academic access to a dataset of 1.3 million political and social issue ads, including those that ran between August 3 and November 3, 2020 — Election Day in the U.S.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s Ad Library, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/28/facebook-ads-library/">launched in 2019</a>, offers a searchable database of all ads running on Facebook and Instagram. Implemented after the 2016 Russian election interference fiasco, the database allows researchers and reporters to drill down into ads by topic, company and candidate, displaying data about when an ad ran, who saw it and how much it cost.</p>
<p>Facebook says the decision to offer a deeper look into ads on the platform comes after feedback from the research community, which specifically requested more information about targeting. Facebook&#8217;s extremely granular ad targeting tools are of particular interest to researchers, who will soon have access to why certain people saw ads, including data on location and interest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We recognize that understanding the online political advertising landscape is key to protecting elections, and we know we can’t do it alone,&#8221; Facebook Product Manager Sarah Clark Schiff wrote in the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/increasing-transparency-around-us-2020-elections-ads/">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s ad targeting systems have plunged the company into hot water in the past. In 2016, Facebook disabled a targeting option for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/11/facebook-sort-of-disables-ethnic-affinity-targeting/">&#8220;ethnic affinity&#8221; in credit, housing and employment-related ad categories</a> following reporting on how those tools could be abused for illegal discrimination. In 2018, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/facebook-is-removing-over-5000-ad-targeting-options-to-prevent-discriminatory-ads/">removed 5,000 additional ad targeting options</a> due to similar potential for discriminatory advertising practices. And the extent to which the Trump campaign sailed into the White House on the strength of its <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/how-facebooks-ad-technology-helps-trump-win/606403/">microtargeting Facebook ad operations</a> is still a matter of debate.</p>
<p>Regardless of how you feel about the tools themselves, Facebook&#8217;s public-facing ad library has been an invaluable tool for reporters, providing both issue-specific deep dives and an easy at-a-glance view of political spending by party, race and candidate. The new targeting data won&#8217;t live on the public Ad Library but will instead be limited to the Facebook Open Research &amp; Transparency platform, which is only accessible by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/337950863944028">university-linked researchers</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning, Qualtrics, a software company that tracks customer and employee sentiment, filed a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1747748/000162828021000759/qualtricss-1a3.htm">new S-1 document</a>. The new filing raises Qualtrics&#8217; expected IPO price range, providing the Utah-based unicorn with a higher potential valuation in its impending debut.</p>
<p>Qualtrics previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/sap-agrees-to-buy-qualtrics-for-8b-in-cash-just-before-the-survey-software-companys-ipo/">sold to SAP</a> for $8 billion while on the path to going public; after a time inside the larger software company, Qualtrics announced it would spin out as its own public company. TechCrunch previously explored the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1747748/000162828021000498/qualtricss-1a2.htm">company&#8217;s initial IPO filing</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/a-first-look-at-qualtrics-ipo-pricing/">first IPO pricing interval</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, we described it as just that: Qualtrics&#8217; first IPO price range. We expected the company to raise its targets. Why? At its initial $22 to $26 per-share price range, it simply felt undervalued compared to current-market analogs and benchmarks.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about its new price range.</p>
<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>Qualtrics is a SaaS company that is growing at a moderate clip and is nearly break-even if you remove the cost of share-based compensation. And at a run rate of around $800 million in its most recent quarter, it&#8217;s a large firm.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not just another fast-growing SaaS firm that&#8217;s crested $100 million in ARR that is still running stiff deficits, it&#8217;s a different beast. That makes the effort to triangulate its valuation all the more fun.</p>
<p>At its new interval and with some minor share-count tweaks detailed in its new filing, Qualtrics will raise as much as $1.68 billion in its debut, a figure that is exclusive of some transactions associated with the IPO.</p>
<p>With its new $27 to $29 per-share IPO price range, Qualtrics is shooting a <em>little</em> bit higher than before. But before we get too sure that the company is being conservative, let&#8217;s get some new valuation numbers:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Former Facebook employee and current <a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1lw211ts92n62/The-Unusual-Ambitions-of-Chamath-Palihapitiya">enfant terrible of high finance</a> Chamath Palihapitiya is making news again with<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005213/en/%C2%A0Sunlight-Financial-LLC-a-Premier-Residential-Solar-Financing-Platform-to-List-on-NYSE-Through-Merger-With-Apollo-Affiliated-Spartan-Acquisition-Corp.-II"> a $1.3 billion twofer SPAC and PIPE deal</a> into the solar energy financing company, Sunlight Financial.</p>
<p>Sunlight Financial is essentially a lending company that gives solar installers a way to provide loans to homeowners to finance solar power and battery installations and other home improvement projects.</p>
<p>While it may be another indication of the <a href="https://twitter.com/web/status/1353749263654805504?s=20">Roaring &#8217;20s come back to haunt global financial markets</a> in the lead-up to a catastrophic meltdown of the global financial system, there&#8217;s at least some method to the madness with Sunlight.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s because there&#8217;s a lot of tailwinds behind a business that&#8217;s lending money <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/a-biden-presidency-doesnt-need-a-green-new-deal-to-make-progress-on-climate-change/">to provide better access to solar power, energy storage and energy efficiency upgrades</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A Biden presidency doesn&#8217;t need a Green New Deal to make progress on climate change&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/a-biden-presidency-doesnt-need-a-green-new-deal-to-make-progress-on-climate-change/embed/#?secret=tAXBxplDvB" data-secret="tAXBxplDvB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The investment, alongside Coatue, Franklin Templeton and BlackRock, will value the lender at $1.3 billion. A healthy figure, but one that&#8217;s not astronomical, especially given the $705 million in financing that Sunlight Financial has raised over its history, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sunlight-financial/company_financials">according to Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/unpacking-chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-deals-for-latch-and-sunlight-financial/">Alex Wilhelm noted earlier today</a>, Sunlight Financial would have likely tapped public markets sooner or later, given a pretty solid financial performance &#8212; even during the pandemic:</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking at the numbers, it’s somewhat clear that the company could have gone public in a year or two; another year’s growth, and it would have had enough revenue to pursue a traditional debut. Via this SPAC-led deal it will get out sooner and have more cash while it scales. Perhaps that is the value of the SPAC here for Sunlight.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sunlight also has the benefit of being a publicly traded renewable energy play at a time when those companies are in short supply and high demand from institutional investors.</p>
<p>Over the course of 2020, big money moved to find ways to support businesses that can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/whats-behind-this-years-boom-in-climate-tech-spacs/">help mitigate the effects of climate change or slow the rapidly warming temperatures</a> on the planet.</p>
<p>“Industry commitments to mitigate climate change risk is providing investors with visibility that there is momentum among decision-makers to drive change,” said Richard Manley, the managing director and head of sustainable investing at <a href="https://www.cppinvestments.com/about-us/our-investment-teams/team-active-equities/active-equities-sustainable-investing#:~:text=Richard%20Manley&amp;text=Richard%20leads%20the%20team%20responsible,opportunities%20across%20our%20investment%20programs.">CPP Investments</a>, in an interview last year. “There’s an appreciation within the public markets that the exciting transition solutions either within core operating subsidiaries or investments in the VC arms of corporate companies haven’t provided public equity investors the really focused opportunities they’ve wanted.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ixiGWLSvFa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/whats-behind-this-years-boom-in-climate-tech-spacs/">What&#8217;s behind this year&#8217;s boom in climate tech SPACs?</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With the launch of Palihapitiya&#8217;s latest SPAC, that trend seems set to continue in 2021. As Rob Day, a longtime investor in climate tech wrote in a direct message late last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[The] current wave [of SPACs] is because over the past 24 months the institutional investor universe has come fully into believing that climate solutions are going to be a major growth area in the 2020s and beyond, but they weren’t seeing options available to them for investing into,” according to Day.</p>
<p>“The available publicly traded ‘green’ companies were already getting really bought up, and the private equity options were underwhelming as well (smallish in the case of VC, low returns in the case of large-format projects). Throw in a Robinhood market of retail investors with a lot of enthusiasm for EVs and such, and you have a nice recipe for this to happen.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is launching what it calls &#8220;a community-based approach to misinformation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Birdwatch project <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/twitter-is-building-birdwatch-a-system-to-fight-misinformation-by-adding-more-context-to-tweets/">first came to light last fall</a> thanks to product sleuth <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane">Jane Manchun Wong</a>. Now Twitter has launched a pilot version via <a href="https://twitter.com/i/birdwatch">the Birdwatch website</a>.</p>
<p>The goal, as explained in <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation.html">a blog post</a> by Twitter&#8217;s Vice President of Product Keith Coleman, is to expand beyond the labels that the company already applies to controversial or potentially misleading tweets, which he suggested are limited to &#8220;circumstances where something breaks our rules or receives widespread public attention.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Coleman wrote that the Birdwatch approach will &#8220;broaden the range of voices that are part of tackling this problem.&#8221; That brings more perspectives to these issues and goes beyond the simple question of, &#8220;Is this tweet true or not?&#8221; It may also take some of the heat off Twitter for individual content moderation decisions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="33b4rhpqt3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/twitter-is-building-birdwatch-a-system-to-fight-misinformation-by-adding-more-context-to-tweets/">Twitter is building &#8216;Birdwatch,&#8217; a system to fight misinformation by adding more context to tweets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter is building &#8216;Birdwatch,&#8217; a system to fight misinformation by adding more context to tweets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/twitter-is-building-birdwatch-a-system-to-fight-misinformation-by-adding-more-context-to-tweets/embed/#?secret=33b4rhpqt3" data-secret="33b4rhpqt3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Users can sign up on the Birdwatch site to flag tweets that they find misleading, add context via notes and rate the notes written by other contributors based on whether they&#8217;re helpful or not. These notes will only be visible on the Birdwatch site for now, but it sounds like the company&#8217;s goal is to incorporate them to the main Twitter experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable,&#8221; Coleman said. &#8220;Eventually we aim to make notes visible directly on Tweets for the global Twitter audience, when there is consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the potential for plenty of argument and back-and-froth on contentious tweets, it remains to be seen how Twitter will present these notes in a way that isn&#8217;t confusing or overwhelming, or how it can avoid weighing in on some of these arguments. The company said Birdwatch will use rank content based on algorithmic &#8220;reputation and consensus systems,&#8221; with the code shared publicly. (All notes contributed to Birdwatch will also be available for download.) You can <a href="https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/about/ranking-notes/">read more about the initial ranking system here</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know there are a number of challenges toward building a community-driven system like this — from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isn’t dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors,&#8221; Coleman said. &#8220;We’ll be focused on these things throughout the pilot.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a year defined by economic and civil unrest, it should come as little surprise that workplace organizing has been on the upswing. The COVID-19 pandemic in particular (coupled with the ever-present effects of late capitalism) has brought long-standing questions of employment stability and safety to the forefront of many.</p>
<p>Of course, much of this dates to well before the pandemic was in full swing. In February, we noted that both scooter startup Spin and food delivery service Instacart voted to unionize. That same month, Kickstarter became one of the most prominent tech companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/kickstarter-workers-vote-to-unionize/">to form a union</a>, with online code collaboration tool <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/online-code-collaboration-tool-glitch-votes-to-unionize/">Glitch</a> following suit in March.</p>
<p>Work place organizing is a broad and expansive topic in the world of technology. It’s a concept that is beginning to take hold in a diverse array of workplaces, ranging from contractors and factory workers at places like Amazon to salaried office jobs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox remains under scrutiny over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">competition concerns</a>, the tech giant has released an <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/?">update</a> claiming experimental ad-targeting techniques it&#8217;s developing as part of the plan to depreciate support for third-party cookies on its Chrome browser show results that are &#8220;nearly as effective as cookie-based approaches&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google has been working on a technique &#8212; called <a href="https://github.com/WICG/floc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/WICG/floc&quot;}">Federated Learning of Cohorts</a> (FLoC) &#8212; to target ads based on clustering users into groups with similar interests, which it claims is superior from a privacy perspective versus the current (dysfunctional) &#8220;norm&#8221; of targeting individuals based on third parties tracking everything they do online.</p>
<p>It wants FLoCs to enable interest-based advertising to continue after it ends support for third-party trackers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="r4HgR1JPLB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">Google wants to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome within two years</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google wants to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome within two years&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/embed/#?secret=r4HgR1JPLB" data-secret="r4HgR1JPLB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However, the proposal has alarmed advertisers who argue it&#8217;s anti-competitive. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">earlier this month</a> the U.K.&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened an investigation of the Privacy Sandbox proposal after complaints from a coalition of digital marketing companies and others from newspapers and technology companies alleging Google is abusing a dominant position by depreciating support for third-party trackers.</p>
<p>On the privacy front, Google&#8217;s self-styled Privacy Sandbox isn&#8217;t exactly attracting effusive plaudits, either.</p>
<p>T<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/dont-play-googles-privacy-sandbox-1">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> has, for example, dubbed FLoCs &#8220;the opposite of privacy-preserving technology&#8221; &#8212; warning in 2019 that the approach is akin to a &#8220;behavioral credit score&#8221;. It said then that the proposals risk sustaining discrimination against vulnerable groups of people, whose online activity would be pattern-matched with others without their say-so; and could also lead to leaking sensitive info about them to third parties &#8212; without offering web users any way to escape being put in an &#8220;interest based&#8221; ad targeting bucket. </span></p>
<p>With objections piling up on sides of the aisle (advertiser versus user) &#8212; and now active regulatory scrutiny of the competition issue &#8212; Google has its work cut out to sell its preferred replacement for tracking cookies to all the relevant stakeholders. Though advertisers (and competition regulators) currently seem front of mind for the tech giant.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/?">update about the Privacy Sandbox proposals</a> today, Google appears to be hoping to alleviate advertisers&#8217; concerns that the demise of tracking cookies will degrade their ability to lucratively target internet users &#8212; writing that tests of the FLoC technology suggest advertisers will continue to see &#8220;at least 95% of the conversions per dollar spent when compared to cookie-based advertising&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how much test data was involved in Google generating that percentage, however. (We asked and Google did not have an immediate response.) So there&#8217;s zero meat on the bone of the &#8220;95% minimum&#8221; claim.</p>
<p>Its spokesman did note that it will be opening up public testing in March &#8212; and expects advertisers to join in kicking FLoC&#8217;s tires then. So there&#8217;s clearly going to be more detail to come on this front.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chrome intends to make FLoC-based cohorts available for public testing through origin trials with its next release in March and we expect to begin testing FLoC-based cohorts with advertisers in Google Ads in Q2,&#8221; writes Chetna Bindra, group product manager for user trust and privacy in the blog post, adding: &#8220;If you’d like to get a head start, you can run your own simulations (as we did) based on the principles outlined in this <a href="https://github.com/google/ads-privacy/blob/master/proposals/FLoC/FLOC-Whitepaper-Google.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/google/ads-privacy/blob/master/proposals/FLoC/FLOC-Whitepaper-Google.pdf&quot;}">FLoC whitepaper</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unsurprising that Google continues to emphasize the relative openness with which it&#8217;s developing the Privacy Sandbox proposals &#8212; as that may help it fight antitrust accusations. But it&#8217;s also noteworthy being as the adtech industry, which has been fighting to block/delay its depreciation of third-party cookies, is busy spinning up its own contenders to replace trackers &#8212; and developing those competing proposals typically with a lot less transparency than Google.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LHPGFn3xox"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">Google proposes new privacy and anti-fingerprinting controls for the web</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google proposes new privacy and anti-fingerprinting controls for the web&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/embed/#?secret=LHPGFn3xox" data-secret="LHPGFn3xox" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nonetheless, Google seems a whole lot more comfortable quantifying FLoC&#8217;s potential impact on ad revenue (tiny, per its latest claim) versus articulating what privacy gains internet users might expect from the proposed shift from individual tracking to run behavioral ads to being stuck in labelled buckets to run behavioral ads.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s blog post has a few fuzzy mentions &#8212; like &#8220;viable privacy-first alternatives&#8221; and &#8220;hiding individuals &#8216;in the crowd&#8217; ” &#8212; but there&#8217;s no metric or data offered on how much privacy users stand to gain if its preferred post-cookie future comes to pass.</p>
<p>Test results it published in <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/privacy/google-releases-results-from-early-tests-of-cohort-based-advertising/">October</a> also focused on seeking to demonstrate to advertisers that FLoCs can deliver on other relevant ad metrics. Funnily enough, internet users&#8217; privacy &#8212; and what happens when <em>degrees</em> of privacy are lost &#8212; is rather harder for Google&#8217;s computer scientists to measure.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;advertisers can expect to see at least 95% of the conversions per dollar spent when compared to cookie-based advertising&quot;. What&#39;s the per cent of privacy improvement? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GDPR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GDPR</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DigitalServicesAct?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DigitalServicesAct</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ePrivacy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ePrivacy</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lukasz Olejnik (@lukOlejnik) <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1353693697821581313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;The idea is to make it so that no one can reconstruct your cross-site browsing history,&#8221; said the company&#8217;s spokesman when we asked about how the proposal will improve users&#8217; privacy standing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to address non-transparent forms of tracking, across websites, with privacy-safe mechanisms for consumers, and make it so it can&#8217;t happen. And to do so while still enabling opportunity and fair compensation for publishers and advertisers. So it&#8217;s really not even a matter of trying to approximate a kind of privacy: We&#8217;re trying to address a root critical concern of users, full stop,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>FLoCs are just one part of Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox proposals. The company is working on a slew of aligned efforts to simultaneously replace various other key components of the adtech ecosystem. And it gives an overview of some of these in the blog post &#8212; covering proposals for (post-cookie) conversation measurement; ad-fraud prevention; and anti-fingerprinting.</p>
<p>Here it dwells briefly on retargeting/remarketing &#8212; referring to a new Chrome proposal (called Fledge) that it says it&#8217;s considering for a &#8220;trusted server&#8221; model &#8220;specifically designed to store information about a campaign’s bids and budgets&#8221;. This will also be made available for advertisers to test later this year, Google adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last year, several members of the ad tech community have offered input for how this might work, including proposals from Criteo, NextRoll, Magnite and RTB House. Chrome has published a new proposal called <a href="https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/master/FLEDGE.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/master/FLEDGE.md&quot;}">FLEDGE</a> that expands on a previous Chrome proposal (called <a href="https://github.com/WICG/turtledove" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/WICG/turtledove&quot;}">TURTLEDOVE</a>) and takes into account the industry feedback they’ve heard, including the idea of using a &#8220;trusted server&#8221; &#8212; as defined by compliance with certain principles and policies &#8212; that’s specifically designed to store information about a campaign’s bids and budgets. Chrome intends to make FLEDGE available for testing through origin trials later this year with the opportunity for ad tech companies to try using the API under a “bring your own server” model,&#8221; it writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology advancements such as FLoC, along with similar promising efforts in areas like measurement, fraud protection and anti-fingerprinting, are the future of web advertising — and the Privacy Sandbox will power our web products in a post-third-party cookie world,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>Discussing Fledge&#8217;s potential, <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik">Dr Lukasz Olejnik</a>, an independent researcher and consultant, said there&#8217;s still a lot of uncertainty over how it might impact user privacy. &#8220;The Fledge experiment looks potentially interesting but it mixes in various proposals in this test. Such a mix would need to get a specific privacy assessment as the offered privacy qualities might be different than originally claimed. Furthermore, the current tests will have many privacy precautions intended for the future, turned off initially. It will be tricky to gradually turn them on,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major project to <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> the venture capital investors of Europe and their cities.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey of VCs in Stockholm, and Sweden generally,</a> will capture how the country is faring, and what changes are being wrought amongst investors by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>The deadline is the end of this week.</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We’d like to know how Sweden&#8217;s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and, generally, how your thinking will evolve from here.</p>
<p>Our survey will only be about investors, and <strong>only the contributions of VC investors will be included.</strong> More than one partner is welcome to fill out the survey. (Please note, if you have filled the survey out already, there is no need to do it again).</p>
<p>The shortlist of questions will require only brief responses, but the more you can add, the better.</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6"><strong>You can fill out the survey here.</strong></a></p>
<p>Obviously, investors who contribute will be featured in the final surveys, with links to their companies and profiles.</p>
<p>What kinds of things do we want to know? Questions include: Which trends are you most excited by? What startup do you wish someone would create? Where are the overlooked opportunities? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? How is your local ecosystem going? And how has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Latch is an enterprise SaaS company that makes keyless-entry systems for buildings; Sunlight Financial offers point-of-sale financing for residential solar systems.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning, investor and SPAC raconteur Chamath Palihapitiya <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1353674959789256705">announced two new</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1353673101901369345">blank-check deals</a> involving Latch and Sunlight Financial.</p>
<p>Latch, an enterprise SaaS company that makes keyless-entry systems, has raised $152 million in private capital, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/latch/company_financials">according to Crunchbase</a>. Sunlight Financial, which offers point-of-sale financing for residential solar systems, has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sunlight-financial/company_financials">raised north of $700 million</a> in venture capital, private equity and debt.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to chat about the two transactions.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no escaping SPACs for a bit, so if you are tired of watching blind pools rip private companies into the public markets, you are not going to have a very good next few months. Why? There are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-spacs-attack-a-new-force-is-invading-wall-street-11611378007?mod=djemalertNEWS">nearly 300 SPACs</a> in the market today looking for deals, and many will find one.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Think of SPACs are increasingly hungry sharks. As a shark get hungrier while the clock winds down on its deal-making window, it may get less choosy about what it eats (take public). There are enough SPACs on the hunt today that they would be noisy even if they were not time-constrained investment vehicles. But as their timers tick, expect their deal-making to get all the more creative.</p>
<p>This brings us back to Chamath&#8217;s two deals. Are they more like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/2021-a-spac-odyssey/">the Bakkt SPAC</a>, which led us to raise a few questions? Or more akin to the Talkspace SPAC, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/how-vcs-and-founders-see-2021-differently/">we found pretty reasonable?</a> Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>Keyless locks = Peloton for real estate</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the Latch deal.</p>
<p>New York-based Latch sells &#8220;LatchOS,&#8221; a hardware and software system that works in buildings where access and amenities matter. Latch&#8217;s hardware works with doors, sensors and internet connectivity.</p>
<p>The company has raised a number of private rounds, including a $126 million deal in August of 2019 that valued the company at $454.3 million on a post-money basis, <a href="http://pitchbook.com">according to PitchBook</a> data. The company raised another $30 million in October of 2020, though its final private valuation is not known.</p>
<p>As Chamath tweeted this morning, Latch is <a href="https://www.latch.com/news/latch-announces-planned-merger-with-tishman-speyer-sponsored-spac">merging with TS Innovation Acquisitions Corp</a>, or $TSIA. The SPAC is associated with Tishman Speyer, a commercial real estate investor. You can see the synergies, as Latch&#8217;s products fit into the commercial real estate space.</p>
<p>Up front, Latch is not a company that is only reporting future revenues. It has a history as an operating entity. Indeed, here&#8217;s its financial data per <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1826000/000119312521015400/d73403dex992.htm">its investor presentation</a>:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100002" style="width: 387px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100002" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2100002 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-25-at-10.03.29-AM.png?w=377" alt="" width="377" height="170" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-25-at-10.03.29-AM.png 377w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-25-at-10.03.29-AM.png?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-25-at-10.03.29-AM.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-25-at-10.03.29-AM.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100002" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Latch</p></div></p>
<p>Doing some quick match, Latch grew booked revenues 50.5% from 2019 to 2020. Its booked software revenues grew 37.1%, while its booked hardware top line expanded over 70% during the same period.</p>
<p>That could be due to strong hardware installation fees, which could later result in software revenues; the company claims an average of a six-year software deal, so hardware revenues that are attached to new software incomes could low key declaim long-term SaaS revenues.</p>
<p><em>Update: Adding some clarity here, the above are &#8220;booked&#8221; revenues, which I&#8217;ve made more clear, not actual revenues. Its net revenues, better known as actual revenues, were $18 million, with $14 million of that coming from hardware. So, today, the company is certainly more hardware-heavy than I first thought. Damn non-S-1 filings!</em></p>
<p>While <a href="https://twitter.com/loganbartlett/status/1353684437775638529">some were quick to note</a> that the company is far from pure-SaaS &#8212; correct &#8212; I suspect that the model that could get some traction amongst investors is that this feels a bit like Peloton for real estate. How so? Peloton has large hardware incomes up front from new users, which convert to long-term subscription revenues. Latch may prove similar, albeit for a different customer base and market.</p>
<p>Per the deal&#8217;s reported terms, Latch will be worth $1.56 billion after the transaction. The combined entity will have $510 million in cash, including $190 million from a PIPE &#8212; a method of putting private money into a public entity &#8212; from &#8220;BlackRock, D1 Capital Partners, Durable Capital Partners LP, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, Chamath Palihapitiya, The Spruce House Partnership, Wellington Management, ArrowMark Partners, Avenir and Lux Capital.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.goalsetter.co/">Goalsetter</a>, a platform that helps parents teach their kids financial literacy, announced the raise of a $3.9 million seed round this morning, led by Astia.</p>
<p>PNC Bank, Mastercard, U.S. Bank, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, Elevate Capital, Portfolia&#8217;s First Step and Rising America Fund and Pipeline Angels also participated in the round. The round also saw participation from a handful of individual investors including Robert F. Smith, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, Baron Davis, Sterling K. Brown, Ryan Bathe, CC Sabathia and Amber Sabathia.</p>
<p>Goalsetter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/12/goalsetter-gives-parents-a-way-to-teach-their-kids-how-to-save-money/">launched in 2019</a> out of the Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator. Founded by Tanya Van Court, who lost over $1 million in the 2001 bubble burst, the platform teaches financial literacy to children of all ages, helping them learn economic concepts, lingo and the principles of financial health.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After long stints at Nickelodeon and ESPN, Van Court understands deeply how kids learn and what keeps their attention. She vowed to make sure that her children were never ignorant of what it takes to protect their wealth and create more.</p>
<p>The app also allows parents to give allowances through the app, and even pay out their own specified amount for every quiz question the kid gets right in the app. Plus, family and friends can give &#8220;goal cards&#8221; instead of gift cards, helping kids save for the things they really want in the future.</p>
<p>The company recently launched a debit card for kids, as well, letting parents control the way the card is used and even lock it until their kids have passed the week&#8217;s financial literacy quiz.</p>
<p>Families save an average of $120 a month on the platform, and Van Court says that two families saved over $10,000 in the last year.</p>
<p>The company is also launching a massive campaign next week for Black History Month with the goal of closing the wealth gap among Black children and kids of color through financial education.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to put a debit card into your teenager&#8217;s hands,&#8221; said Van Court. &#8220;That&#8217;s great. That teaches them how to spend money. It&#8217;s another thing to teach kids the core concepts about how to build wealth, or to know the difference between putting your money into an investment account, or putting your money into a CD versus a mutual fund versus a savings account. We teach what interest rates are, and what compound interest means. Our focus is on financial education because it&#8217;s not enough to teach kids how to spend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goalsetter raised $2.1 million in 2019 and now adds this latest round to that for a total of $6 million raised. This latest round was oversubscribed, giving Van Court the opportunity to be super selective about her investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every single one of these investors has a demonstrated commitment prior to people marching in the streets in April, to social justice and to investing in diversity and inclusion initiatives and people,&#8221; said Van Court. &#8220;Every single one of them. That was really important because we were oversubscribed and we had the luxury of being able to pick who our investors were. Every one of the investors that we invited to our table were investors who we knew invited folks who look like us in 2019 and 2018 and 2017 to their table.&#8221;</p>
