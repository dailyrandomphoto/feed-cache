										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Space may be the endless frontier, but here on Earth, we define space in the modern sense as something enclosed. Walls, fences and barriers enclose space, define it and make it legible. In fact, the sense of limits is so strong these days with place that we often have to add qualifiers like “open space” to describe wholly natural environments like parks and forests as places without spatial limits.</p>
<p>While enclosures have been with us for centuries, the barriers they raise have never been so high or politically fraught. In the United States, one of the most controversial aspects of the Trump administration was over the erection of a southern border wall with Mexico. With climate change accelerating and migrants increasing all around the world though, walls are becoming a common occurrence and political tool. Just this week, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58289893">Greece erected fencing along its border with Turkey</a> in preparation for an expected deluge of Afghan refugees fleeing violence in the wake of the Taliban’s seizure of Kabul.</p>
<p>John Lanchester has taken these themes of barriers, fear, and politics and intensified them in his atmospheric novel appropriately titled “<a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/the-wall/">The Wall</a>.”</p>
<p>The conceit is simple: a thinly-disguised United Kingdom, ravaged by climate change and heavy migration from outside the island, erects a universal wall across all of its shores, posting sentries every few meters or so to monitor the barriers for any potential intruders. Their sole mission: to keep <i>them</i> out, whoever they might be. Failure is symbolically punished with exile and banishment, with the watchers becoming the watched.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2195176" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg?w=447" alt="" width="447" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg?resize=197,300 197w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg?resize=768,1169 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg?resize=447,680 447w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg?resize=1009,1536 1009w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Wall.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px" /></p>
<p>We predominantly follow a pair of sentries who, as the above rule all but implicates for the plot, will become exiled in the course of their duties. What we get then is a meditation on the meaning of home, and also the meaning of barriers and dislocation in a world that is increasingly hostile to being a refuge for much of anyone.</p>
<p>While the plot and characters are a bit lackluster, what is fascinating with the novel is how well it manages to create an environment and ambiance of dread, of a society at the end of its journey. People live, parties are hosted, work is done, but all these activities takes place in a world where the jet stream has presumably disappeared, plunging our hypothetical U.K. into the cold abyss. That theme of gray, morose darkness exudes throughout the book, describing everything from the construction of the wall itself to the personalities of the people that inhabit this world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s the ironic tension that propels the book forward, of global warming heating us up while we simultaneously develop the distant sangfroid to fight the ravaging effects of that heat. We are human, but wooden, divorced from the connection and community we have known in order to protect what little we have left.</p>

	</p>
<p>That social coolness also inhabits a new set of class differences, not only between native citizens and refugees, but between generations as well. The younger generation, coming to terms with what has happened to their planet, simply no longer follow the instructions of their supposedly wise elders. A mental barrier has been constructed: how can you learn lessons from the people who allowed <i>this</i> to happen? Yet, the boiling anger has long since cooled to an isolated frostiness — acceptance of reality forces the inter-generational conversation to just move on.</p>
<p>Lanchester is astute and subtle in these extensions of the premise, and they are the most enjoyable part of what is — intentionally — a colorless work. The irony again is that this is probably best read on the beach in the middle of summer, an antidote to the heat of our world. I wouldn’t recommend it for the winter months.</p>
<p>There has been more and more “climate fiction” published over the past few years as the issue of climate change has reached prominence in the global consciousness. Many of these are offshoots of science fiction, with long and meandering discussions of technology, policies, and markets and more depending on the work. That can provide intellectual succor in a way and for a certain type of reader.</p>
<p>What Lanchester does is eschew the minutia and technologies pretty much entirely and instead simply situates us in a realistic future — a space that could even be our home. The limits of our imagination are compacted and we are forced to think in tighter quarters. It’s a thought-provoking look at a world whose frontiers are coming closer and closer to all of us all the time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When did indoor air become cold and clean?</p>
<p>Air conditioning is one of those inventions that have become so ubiquitous, that many in the developed world don’t even realize that less than a century ago, it didn’t exist. Indeed, it wasn’t so long ago that the air inside our buildings and the air outside of them were one and the same, with occupants powerless against their environment.</p>
<p>Eric Dean Wilson, in his just published book, “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/After-Cooling/Eric-Dean-Wilson/9781982111298">After Cooling: On Freon, Global Warming, and the Terrible Cost of Comfort</a>,” dives deep into the history of this field. It took more than just inventing the air conditioner to make people want to buy it. In fact, whole social classes outright rejected the technology for years. It took hustle, marketing skill, and mass societal change to place air conditioning at the center of our built environment.</p>
<p>Wilson covers that history, but he has a more ambitious agenda: to get us to see how our everyday comforts affect other people. Our choice of frigid cooling emits flagrant quantities of greenhouse gas emissions, placing untold stress on our planet and civilization. Our pursuit of comfort ironically begets us more insecurity and ultimately, less comfort.</p>
<p>It’s a provocative book, and TechCrunch hosted Wilson for a discussion earlier this week on a Twitter Space. If you missed it, here are some selected highlights of our conversation.</p>
<p><i>This interview has been condensed and edited.</i></p>
<p><b>Danny Crichton</b>: The framing story throughout the book is about your travels with your friend Sam, who works to collect Freon and destroy it. Why did you choose that narrative arc?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><b>Eric Dean Wilson</b>: Sam at the time was working for this green energy company, and they were trying to find a way to take on green projects that would turn a profit. They had found that they could do this by finding used Freon, specifically what&#8217;s called CFC-12. It&#8217;s not made anymore, thank goodness, but it was responsible in part for partially destroying the ozone layer, and production of it was banned by the 90s.</p>
<p>But <i>use</i> of it, and buying and selling it on the secondary market, is totally legal. This is sort of a loophole in the legality of this refrigerant, because the United States government and the people who signed the Montreal Protocol thought that when they stopped production of it that it would pretty much get rid of Freon by the year 2000. Well, that didn&#8217;t happen, which is kind of a mystery.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2195126" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/After-Cooling.jpg?w=429" alt="" width="429" height="648" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/After-Cooling.jpg 429w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/After-Cooling.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/After-Cooling.jpg?resize=199,300 199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/After-Cooling.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" /></p>
<p>So Sam was driving around the United States, finding Freon on the internet, and meeting people (often people who are auto hobbyists or mechanics or something like that) who happened to have stockpiled Freon, and he was buying it from them in order to destroy it for carbon credits on California&#8217;s cap-and-trade system. And the interesting thing about this is that he was going to basically the 48 contiguous states, and meeting people that were often global warming deniers who were often hostile to the idea of the refrigerant being destroyed at all, so he often didn&#8217;t tell them upfront that he was destroying it.</p>
<p>What was really interesting to me is that, aside from a cast of colorful and strange characters, and sometimes violent characters actually as well, was the fact that sometimes after establishing a business relationship first, he was able to have really frank conversations about global warming with people who were otherwise not very open to it.</p>
<p>In a time in which we&#8217;re told that Americans are more divided than ever politically, that we&#8217;re not speaking to each other across ideological divides, I thought this was a curious story.</p>
<p><b>Crichton</b>: And when it comes to greenhouse gases, Freon is among the worst, right?</p>
<p><b>Wilson</b>: I should be really clear that the main global warming gases are carbon dioxide and methane and some other ones as well. But molecule for molecule, CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) are thousands of times greater at absorbing and retaining heat, meaning that they&#8217;re just thousands of times worse for global warming, molecule for molecule. So even though there&#8217;s not that many of them in terms of parts per million in the atmosphere, there&#8217;s enough to really make a sizable contribution to global warming.</p>
<p>The irony is that the replacements of CFCs — HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons) — for the most part, don&#8217;t really do anything to destroy the ozone layer, which is great. But they&#8217;re also super global warming gases. So the ozone crisis was solved by replacing CFCs with refrigerant that exacerbated the global warming crisis.</p>
<p><b>Crichton</b>: Now to get to the heart of the book, you focus on the rise of air conditioning, but you start by giving readers a wide view of what life was like before its invention. Why did you do that?</p>
<p><b>Wilson</b>: This was a surprise — I did not go into the book thinking that I was going to find this. Before air conditioning really took off in the home, there was a really different sense of what we would call personal comfort, and something that I really argue in the book is that what we&#8217;ve come to think of as personal comfort, and specifically, thermal comfort, has changed. What I argue in the book is that it&#8217;s really in part a cultural construction.</p>
<p>Now, I want to be really careful that people don&#8217;t hear that I&#8217;m saying that it&#8217;s <i>entirely</i> a construction. Yes, when we get too hot or too cold, then we can die, for sure. But what&#8217;s really interesting to me is that there&#8217;s a lot of evidence to show that before air conditioning began at the beginning of the twentieth century, people weren&#8217;t really hungry for air conditioning.</p>
<p>There was this greater sense that you could deal with the heat. I put that really carefully, because I don&#8217;t want to say that they suffered through it. Certainly there were heat waves and summers that got too hot. But there was a real sense that you could manage the heat through analog ways, like sleeping outside, sleeping in parks, or designing buildings that incorporate passive cooling. The thing that really disturbed me was that through the twentieth century, we really kind of forgot all that, because we didn&#8217;t need that knowledge anymore because we had air conditioning. So modernist architecture began to kind of ignore the outside conditions, because you could construct whatever conditions you wanted inside.</p>
<p>I think the question that nobody really asked all along is, is this good for everyone? Should we have a homogenized standard of comfort? Nobody really asked that question. And there&#8217;s a lot of people that find that the kind of American model of an office or American model of comfort is not comfortable, both in the United States, and in other places.</p>
<p><b>Crichton</b>: Even beyond a homogenized standard though, you want readers to understand how comfort connects all of us together.</p>
<p><b>Wilson</b>: I think that one of the pernicious things about the American definition of comfort is that it has been defined as <i>personal</i> comfort. And the reason why I keep using that is because it&#8217;s defined as individual comfort. And so what would it mean to think about comfort as being always connected to somebody else, as more ethical that way? Because it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>The truth is that our comfort is related to other people, and vice versa. It’s really asking us to think interdependently, instead of independently, which is how we&#8217;re often encouraged to think, and that&#8217;s a huge, huge ask. Actually, that&#8217;s a huge task and a huge paradigm shift. But I really think if we&#8217;re really trying to think ecologically, and not just sustainably, we have to think about how we&#8217;re all connected and how these infrastructures, how they influence other people in other parts of the world.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><b>Crichton</b>: Air conditioning didn’t take off right away. In fact, its inventors and customers really had to push hard to get people to want to use it.</p>
<p><b>Wilson</b>: Air conditioning really got its start in the early twentieth century, in order to control the conditions in factories. I was surprised to find out that air conditioning was used in places to make things hotter, or more humid and slightly hotter in a place like a textile factory, where if it&#8217;s not humid enough, cotton threads can break.</p>
<p>Outside the factory, movie theaters were really the first time that thermal comfort was used as a commodity. There were all kinds of other commodifications of comfort, but this was really the first time that the public could go someplace to feel cooler. And the funny thing is is that most movie theaters in the 20s and 30s were freezing cold, they were not what I would call comfortable, because the people who were running them didn&#8217;t really understand that air conditioning works best when it&#8217;s noticed least, which is a hard sell. In the 20s, though, it was a novelty, and the way that you caught people&#8217;s attention on a summer day was to crank the AC up, which felt good for like five minutes, and then it was terribly uncomfortable and you had to shiver through an hour and a half of the rest of the movie.</p>
<p><b>Crichton</b>: I’m jumping ahead, but what does the future look like as global warming persists and our cooling increases in line with that heat?</p>
<p><b>Wilson</b>: In so many cooling situations, there are major alternatives, like redesigning our buildings so that they require way less energy and way less cooling. There are really amazing architects who are looking to things like termite mounds, because the colonies that they build sort of have brilliantly engineered rooms with different temperatures.</p>
<p>That said, I was surprised how much our opinion on comfort could change by simply understanding that it <i>could</i> change. I think that we have to make the world of tomorrow desirable, and we can take a nod from the commercial advertising industry. We have to sell this future as one that we actually want, not as something that we&#8217;re giving up. And I think the narrative is always like, “Oh, we have to stop doing this, we have to lower this, we have to give this up.” And that&#8217;s certainly true. But I think if we understand that as not something that we&#8217;re giving up, but actually something that we&#8217;re gaining, then it makes it a lot easier. For people, it makes it feel a lot more possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the most unfortunate fault lines in climate change politics today is the lack of cooperation between environmentalists and the national security community. Left-wing climate activists don’t exactly hang out with more right-leaning military strategists, the former often seeing the latter as destructive anti-ecological marauders, while the latter often assume the former are unrealistic pests who would prioritize trees and dolphins over human safety.</p>
<p>Yet, climate change is forcing the two to work ever closer together, as uncomfortable as that might be.</p>
<p>In “All Hell Breaking Loose,” emeritus professor and prolific author Michael T. Klare has written a meta-assessment of the Pentagon’s strategic assessments from the last two decades on how climate will shape America’s security environment. Sober and repetitive but not grim, the book is an eye-opening look at how the defense community is coping with one of the most vexing global challenges today.</p>
<p>Climate change weakens the security environment in practically every domain, and in ways that might not be obvious to the non-defense specialist. For the U.S. Navy, which relies on coastal access to shipyards and ports, rising sea levels threaten to diminish and even occasionally demolish its mission readiness, such as when Atlantic hurricanes hit Virginia, one of the largest centers for naval infrastructure in the United States.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2195153" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?w=451" alt="" width="451" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg 1696w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?resize=199,300 199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?resize=768,1159 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?resize=451,680 451w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?resize=1018,1536 1018w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?resize=1357,2048 1357w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-Hell-Breaking-Loose.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /></p>
<p>While perhaps obvious, it bears repeating that the U.S. military is as much a landlord as a fighting force, with hundreds of bases spread across the country and around the world. A large percentage of these installations face climate-related challenges that can affect mission readiness, and the cost to harden these facilities is likely to reach tens of billions of dollars — and perhaps even more.</p>
<p>Then there is the question of energy. The Pentagon is understandably one of the greatest users of energy in the world, requiring power for bases, jet fuel for planes, and energy for ships on a global scale. Procurement managers are obviously concerned about costs, but their real concern is availability — they need to have reliable fuel options in even the most chaotic environments. That critical priority is increasingly tenuous with climate change, as transit options for oil can be disrupted by everything from a bad storm to a ship stuck in the Suez Canal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is where the Pentagon’s mission and the interests of green-minded activists align heavily, if not perfectly. Klare provides examples of how the Pentagon is investing in areas like biofuels, decentralized grid technology, batteries and more as it looks to secure resiliency for its fighting forces. The Pentagon’s budgetary resources might be scorned by critics, but it’s uniquely positioned to pay the so-called green premiums for more reliable energy in ways that few institutions can realistically afford.</p>
<p>That political alignment continues when it comes to humanitarian response, although for vastly different reasons. One of the Pentagon’s chief concerns with global warming is that it will be increasingly waylaid from its highest priority missions — such as protecting against China, Russia, Iran and other long-time adversaries — into responding to humanitarian crises. As one of the only American institutions with the equipment and logistical know-how capable of deploying thousands of responders to disaster zones, the Pentagon is the go-to source for deployments. For Defense, the difficulty is that the armed forces aren’t trained for humanitarian missions — they’re trained for fighting wars. Attacking ISIS-K and managing a camp of climate refugees are decidedly different skills.</p>
<p>Climate activists are fighting for a more stable and equitable world, one that doesn’t lead to millions of climate refugees fleeing from famine and scorching temperatures. The Pentagon similarly wants to shore up fragile states in the hopes of avoiding deployments outside of its core mission. The two groups speak different languages and have different motivations, but the objectives are much the same.</p>

</ul>

	</p>
<p>The most interesting dynamic of climate change and national security is, of course, how the global strategic map changes. Russia is a major winner, and Klare provides an exacting account on how the Pentagon is securing the Arctic now that the ice has melted and shipping lanes have opened at the pole for much of the year and <a href="https://www.vox.com/22295520/climate-change-shipping-russia-china-arctic">soon to be year round</a>. For the first time, America has run training missions for its armed forces on how to operate in the Arctic and prepare for potential contingencies in the region.</p>
<p>Klare’s book is readable, and its subject is electrifyingly fascinating, but this is not a brilliantly written text by any stretch of the imagination. I dubbed it a meta-assessment because it absolutely reads as if it was written by a team of defense planning specialists in the E Ring. It’s a multi-hundred page think tank paper — and as a reader, you either have the stamina to read that or you don’t.</p>
<p>More caustically, the book’s research and primary citations center on the Pentagon’s assessment reports and Congressional testimony and some secondary reporting in newspapers and elsewhere. There are few to no mentions of direct interviews with the participants here, and that’s a major problem given the extremely political nature of climate change in modern U.S. discourse. Klare certainly observes the politics, but we don’t know what generals and the civilian defense leadership would really say if they didn’t have to sign off publicly on a government report. It’s a massive gulf — and begs the question of how much we really get a true picture of the Pentagon’s thinking with this volume.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the book is an important contribution, and a reminder that the national security community — while protective of its interests — can also be an important vanguard for change on climate disruption. Activists and wonks should drop the animosity and talk to each other a bit more often, as there are alliances to be made.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to climate change, it might seem that a book entitled “How to Do Nothing” would not only be irrelevant, but also downright obscene and even dangerous. Not to mention that after more than a year of pandemic living, many people are understandably fatigued at the prospect of continuing to keep their lives empty of social activities.</p>
<p>Yet, messing with our notions of action and contemplation is precisely the plan that Jenny Odell has laid out in her lapidary work, a meditation that is, ironically, a call to action.</p>
<p>Odell is a Bay Area star, who has been an artist in residence at a variety of institutions from the Internet Archive to Recology, San Francisco’s trash pickup and processing company. Her artistic work centers on attention, of focusing on the details that envelop us in this world and what we can learn from them. It’s an activity that leads her to birdwatching and long walks in Oakland’s public parks such as the Morcom Rose Garden.</p>
<p>Her book, it might be helpful to note, is subtitled “Resisting the Attention Economy” and Odell has made it her mission to help wean a generation, and well, a population off the spasmodic negativity that emanates from our social media platforms. In fact, she has a more ambitious goal: to wean people off the notion that productivity is the only value to life — that action is the only useful metric by which to measure ourselves. She wants to direct our attention to more important things.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2195169" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Do-Nothing.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Do-Nothing.jpeg 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Do-Nothing.jpeg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Do-Nothing.jpeg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Do-Nothing.jpeg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>“I fully understand where a life of sustained attention leads. In short, it leads to awareness,” she writes in the introduction. The key word here is sustained — and that’s also the connection with sustainability and the climate more broadly.</p>
<p>We don’t lack for information, data or opinions. In fact, we are overwhelmed with the dross of human thought. Some studies have shown that modern knowledge workers read more words per day than ever before in history — but they’re reading social media posts, emails, Slack messages and other ephemera that are each nibbling and collectively devouring our attention. What’s left is, for many of us, not much of any thought at all. The world is more frenetic and chaotic than ever before, but in the process, we have traded a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in this world for an incessant deluge of media. Odell wants us to take that imbalance and level it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For her, that means practicing a more sustained form of attention. That’s a skill most of us have little practice with (a deficit we may not even be aware of, ironically), and indeed, sustaining attention might even mean regularly refusing to engage with the world around us. That’s a good thing in her analysis. “At their loftiest, such refusals can signify the individual capacity for self-directed action against the abiding flow; at the very least, they interrupt the monotony of the everyday.”</p>
<p>Controlling our attention, directing it, and filtering out the noise of contemporary life results not in further atomization and narcissism, but rather a more collective sense of being. “When the pattern of your attention has changed, you render your reality differently. You begin to move and act in a different kind of world,” she writes. Suddenly, the trees and flowers that were once backdrops to our walks to brunch become complex and elegant life in their own right. We deepen our camaraderie with our friends and colleagues in ways that we never could with an emoji in Slack. We build up the potential to work together to solve problems.</p>

	</p>
<p>Our sustained attention also allows us to notice the details of what is changing around us, the subtle variations of our environment that come from a warming planet. “Things like the American obsession with individualism, customized filter bubbles, and personal branding—anything that insists on atomized, competing individuals striving in parallel, never touching—does the same violence to human society as a dam does to a watershed.” We can’t fix what we don’t see, and with our fragmented attention, we really don’t see much.</p>
<p>The irony of course is that while technology products dissolve attention — building them takes an extraordinary amount of it. While some startup founders strike it rich on a whim and others are injected with product ideas from friends or VCs, the vast majority learned to sustain their attention on a market or customer for sometimes extraordinarily long periods of time in order to notice the gaps in a market. A founder recently told me that he had been working with customers in his market for more than a decade before he eventually understood a need that wasn’t being fulfilled with existing solutions.</p>
<p>What’s missing in the tech and startup community today is connecting that user empathy and focus on product-market fit to the attention we need in all the other aspects of our lives today. Odell analyzes it a bit more negatively than I would: we actually have these skills and in fact, use them quite specifically. We just don’t use them broadly enough to bring our minds to look at our friendships, communities and planet in a deeper light.</p>
<p>Doing nothing allows us to see what matters and what doesn’t. When it comes to solving big problems, particularly some of the most intractable like climate change, it’s precisely doing nothing that allows us to see the right path to doing something.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bill Gates has solved many problems in his (professional) life, and in recent decades, he’s been dedicated to the plight of the world’s poor and particularly their health. Through his foundation work and charitable giving, he’s roamed the world solving problems from malaria and neglected tropical diseases to maternal health, always with an eye toward the novel and typically cheap solution.</p>
<p>It’s that engineering brain and mode of thinking that he brings to bear on climate change in his book “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the <i>Breakthroughs We Need</i>” (yes, it’s italicized on the cover — we really do need them). Gates describes a bit of his evolution from software mogul to global health wizard to concerned climate citizen. If you look at challenges like neglected tropical diseases, for instance, climate change abundantly affects the prevalence of mosquitos and other vectors for infection. No one can avoid climate change when analyzing food security in developing nations.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2195135" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?w=465" alt="" width="465" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg 1752w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?resize=103,150 103w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?resize=205,300 205w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?resize=768,1122 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?resize=465,680 465w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?resize=1051,1536 1051w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?resize=1402,2048 1402w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bill-Gates-Book.jpg?resize=34,50 34w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" /></p>
<p>With this early narrative, Gates is attempting to connect perhaps not with climate change skeptics (it’s hard to connect with them on a good day anyway), but instead to build a bridge to the skeptical-but-ready-to-rethink crowd. He admits that he didn’t think much of the problem until he saw its effects first hand, opening the door to at least some readers who may be ready to undertake a similar intellectual journey.</p>
<p>From there, Gates delivers an extremely sober (one could easily substitute dry) analysis of the major components of greenhouse gas emissions and how we get to net zero by removing 51 billion tons of CO2-equivalent emissions per year, which in chapter order are energy production (27%), manufacturing (31%), agriculture (19%), transportation (16%), and air conditioning (7%).</p>
<p>Gates is an engineer, and it shows and it is marvelous. He places a great emphasis throughout the book on understanding scale, of constantly trying to disentangle the numbers and units we hear about in the press and actually trying to understand whether a particular innovation might make any difference whatsoever. Gates offers the example of an aviation program that will save “17 million tons” of CO2, but points out that the figure is really just 0.03% of global emissions and isn’t necessarily likely to scale up more than it already has. With this framing, he’s borrowing the approach of effective altruism, or the idea that charitable dollars should flow to the projects that can provide the biggest verifiable improvement to quality of life for the least cost.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Gates is a capitalist, and his framework for judging each potential solution is to calculate a “Green Premium” for their use. For instance, a carbon-free cement manufacturing process might cost double the more normal carbon-emitting one. Compare those added costs with the actual savings these substitutions would have on greenhouse gas emissions, and voila: you have an instant guide on the most efficient means to solving climate change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The answer he comes up with tends to be quite portable in the end. Electrify everything, decarbonize electricity, carbon capture what’s left, and be more efficient. If that sounds hard, that’s because it is, and Gates notes the challenges in an aptly-named chapter entitled “This Will Be Hard” which begins with the line “Please don’t let the title of this chapter depress you.” I’m not sure you needed to buy the book to figure that out.</p>
<p>Gates ends up being an end-to-end conservative figure throughout the book. It’s not just his general approach of protecting the status quo, which is obviously latent in solutions which are essentially substitutable tweaks to our way of life and shouldn’t be surprising given the messenger. It’s also the surprising conservatism of his views on the power of technology to solve these problems. For a person who has quite literally invested billions in clean energy and other green technologies, there is surprisingly little magic that Gates proposes.

<p>Read in concert with some of the other books in this group of climate change reviews, and one can’t help but feel a sort of calculated naiveté on the part of Gates, a sense that we should just keep playing our cards a little while longer and see if we get a last-minute royal flush. There are early signs of solutions, but most aren’t ready for scale. Some technologies are already available, but would require prodigious outlays to retrofit cars, homes, businesses, and more to actually impact our emissions numbers. Then there’s everyone outside of the West, who deserve access to modern amenities. It’s all so easy, and yet, so out of reach.</p>
<p>The book’s strengths — and simultaneously its weaknesses — is that it is apolitical, fact-laden and ready to be read by all but the most ardent climate change skeptics. But it also acts as a gateway drug of sorts: once you understand the scales of the problem, the scopes of the solutions, and the challenges of Green Premiums and policy implementation, you’re left with the feeling that there is no way we are going to do this in the next few years anyway, so what’s really the point?</p>
<p>Gates ends the book by saying that “We should spend the next decade focusing on the technologies, policies, and market structures that will put us on the path to eliminating greenhouse gases by 2050.” He’s not wrong, but it’s also an evergreen comment, in a world that won’t be evergreen for much longer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Books on climate change, as diverse as the library is, tend to fall into a couple of categories. There are the field guides and observational accounts that chronicle the destruction of our world and make it legible for readers worldwide. There are the policy and tech analyses that splay out options for the future, deliberating tradeoffs and offering guidance to individuals and governments on their decisions. There are the histories that look at missed opportunities, and the geological histories that show what our world was really like over the eons.</p>
<p>Then there’s the much darker category of dystopia.</p>
<p>Dystopic visions of the future are engaging precisely because they are visions. That makes them easy fodder for climate fiction (“cli-fi”) novels or even video games like Final Fantasy VII, a stream of work that has accelerated much in the way that carbon has in the atmosphere. Yet, it’s a field that almost uniquely remains focused on the imagination, of “what if” scenarios and running those contexts to their narrative conclusions.</p>
<p>What makes “How Everything Can Collapse: A Manual for our Times” a rare read is that it is both dystopic and non-fiction.</p>
<p>The book, which was translated into English last year and first published in French in 2015, argues for a hard acceptance of what the authors Pablo Servigne and Raphaël Stevens dub “collapsology.” Less a movement like the Extinction Rebellion and Deep Adaptation communities that have risen up in the Anglophone world, collapsology is centered around a multi-disciplinary and systematic inquiry into the state of our world, our civilization, and our society.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2195144" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-Everything-Can-Collapse.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-Everything-Can-Collapse.jpg 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-Everything-Can-Collapse.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-Everything-Can-Collapse.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-Everything-Can-Collapse.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>In this, they spurn the American frame of progress and technological advancement to solve challenges, as well as humanity’s innate hopeful desire to see a better world going forward. Instead, they want to understand what’s really happening today, and whether the stresses, shocks, and crises that smash into our consciousness on a regular basis are really just a mirage or a phenomenon far more profound.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It shouldn’t be hard to glean what their answer is. Servigne and Stevens walk through earth systems like energy and food production and more as they scout for tipping points, physical limits, and the other impassable barriers to society’s exponential development. What they find is troubling, of course. Exponential human population growth over more than a century has led to practically insatiable demand for every resource and alimentation that the planet has in stock.</p>
<p>That’s a story many of us are familiar with, but where it gets interesting is when they start to systematically explore what that demand has done for efficiency. Perhaps the most striking example they offered was the history of petroleum and Energy Return on Energy Invested, or the amount of oil and gas it takes to drill for that very resource. ERoEI, they note, has declined from 35:1 in 1990 to a factor today of about 11:1. Fuel is getting harder to find — and that means we use more fuel to drill for less fuel. It’s a negative feedback loop — and worse, an exponential one — and there’s little reason to expect these trends to reverse.</p>
<p>These sorts of negative feedback loops are everywhere in earth systems today if you look closely for them. The permafrost is melting in the Arctic, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/14/amazon-rainforest-now-emitting-more-co2-than-it-absorbs">Amazon rainforest today emits more carbon dioxide than it absorbs</a>, higher temperatures are making it more difficult and more expensive to grow food. All this at a time when the human population is expected to add several billion more individuals this century.</p>
<p>As with any system, there are lock-ins where components can’t adapt because they are connected to other systems. We can’t replace gas because the entire financial and industrial system is predicated on an abundant and relatively affordable form of energy. We could try to limit the use of automobiles and trucks, but few people (in the West at least) live anywhere near the farms or mining sites where the key sustaining goods of our society come from. Those ears of corn and bags of potatoes are going to have to travel to us, or we to them, but either way, traveling is going to take place.</p>
<p>In the authors’ collective minds, collapsology is about coming to terms with the reality of the systems all around us and just reading the dials. It’s about accepting tipping points, discontinuities, and other non-linear paths in these systems and projecting what they mean for our own lives and those of others. It’s a call to reality, rather than a call to arms. Just look, the authors practically say.</p>
<p>While the first half of the book is mostly centered around exploring systems and how they inter-connect, the second half of the work explores us as humans, and debating collapsology as a phenomenon. Is it too negative? Why do we have psychological barriers that prevent us from seeing the fragility of our ecosystems and our planet? How will art and movies and books adapt to our new context? How are we going to respond to the challenges that are about to confront us in a much more visceral way? The answers — when they are available — are interesting if not always novel.</p>

	</p>
<p>It’s fascinating to see a bit of a cultural counterpoint to the American sensibility. In some ways, collapsology is just the latest manifestation of French existentialism, updated for the twenty-first century. The book doesn’t provide solutions, nor does it necessarily argue that progress must happen or even that it could happen. Instead, it just observes the human condition, and the conditions around humans. Humans are diverse, and they are going to react to the cataclysm in the diverse ways one would come to expect.</p>
<p>The book offers no solution and paints a dreary future that’s just on the cusp of dystopia. But the title is fascinating, since it posits a conditional rather than an assurance. The world “can collapse” not that it “will collapse.” A reader will be forgiven for thinking the latter is the case the book is making, but ultimately, Servigne and Stevens believe that the only way to avoid collapse is to fully see the world in all its complexity. Collapsology then is really anti-collapsology, or deeply understanding the brittleness of our systems before the limits are reached. That’s a refreshingly intellectual point of view, if not necessary a salve to the fears we read and see and feel every day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The climate is finally hitting a climax. Decades of discussions and reports by scientists have yielded pathbreaking works by writers like Elizabeth Kolbert, and today, climate fiction and non-fiction are even becoming global bestselling works. Everyone wants to read about collapse, dystopia, the aftermath — it’s in the very air we breathe after all, what with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/following-the-ipccs-report-we-need-more-technology-to-respond-to-more-disasters/">the IPCC just reporting once again</a> that all numbers point hotter, redder, and closer to us than ever.</p>
<p>The shelves of climate change books extend ever farther, and yet, one can’t help but feel that not much is changing about such a dynamic topic. There are always more details to unravel of course: another species that’s meeting the end of its precarious existence, a river that no longer flows, a town losing its last sparks of civilization. Yet, we know the tropes and the typical plots at this point (or just deny any of it is happening so it doesn’t matter anyway). The most challenging problem on the Earth today is, frankly, getting a bit repetitive.</p>
<p>The upshot is that there are still original works, works that push the edges of our understanding, reformulate some of the old tropes, and can deliver a forceful punch that unmoors our thinking and forces us to confront the familiar destruction with a new empathy.</p>
<p>I wanted to find the most intriguing books for engineers and technologists who are interested in more systematic ways for understanding what is happening to our planet. Not so much on point solutions (although we have one book on that), but rather books that can develop our thinking about <i>how</i> to understand the changes that are by now inevitably coming.</p>
<p>And so, I picked out and reviewed six books that I think represent a strong canon by which to develop our intuitions about climate change, not just as an environmental problem, but as an economic, social, and personal one as well. They range from systems-thinking analyses and prototypical non-fiction to personal reflections and an atmospheric novel. Each in its own way can help us come to terms with what will be the most challenging collective mission in our lives.</p>

Instead, I found an incredible opportunity mid-pandemic in one of the most unexpected places: An ecommerce-focused, AI-driven, image-editing startup in Stuttgart focused on automating the digital imaging process across all retail products.</p>
<p>My experience in Japan taught me the difficulty of moving to a foreign country for work. In Japan, having a point of entry with a professional network can often be necessary. However, Europe has an advantage here thanks to its many accessible cities. Cities like Paris, London, and Berlin often offer diverse job opportunities while being known as hubs for some specialties.</p>
<p>While there has been an uptick in fully remote jobs thanks to the pandemic, extending the scope of your job search will provide more opportunities that match your interest.</p>
<h2>Search for value in unlikely places, like retail</h2>
<p>I’m working at the technology spin-off of a luxury retailer, applying my expertise to product images. Approaching it from a data scientist’s point of view, I immediately recognized the value of a novel application for a very large and established industry like retail.</p>
<p>Europe has some of the most storied retail brands in the world — especially for apparel and footwear. That rich experience provides an opportunity to work with billions of products and trillions of dollars in revenue that imaging technology can be applied to. The advantage of retail companies is a constant flow of images to process that provides a playing ground to generate revenue and possibly make an AI company profitable.</p>
<p>Another potential avenue to explore are independent divisions typically within an R&amp;D department. I found a significant number of AI startups working on a segment that isn’t profitable, simply due to the cost of research and the resulting revenue from very niche clients.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Companies with data are companies with revenue potential</h2>
<p>I was particularly attracted to this startup because of the potential access to data. Data by itself is quite expensive and a number of companies end up working with a finite set. Look for companies that directly engage at the B2B or B2C level, especially retail or digital platforms that affect front-end user interface.</p>
<p>Leveraging such customer engagement data benefits everyone. You can apply it towards further research and development on other solutions within the category, and your company can then work with other verticals on solving their pain points.</p>
<p>It also means there’s massive potential for revenue gains the more cross-segments of an audience the brand affects. My advice is to look for companies with data already stored in a manageable system for easy access. Such a system will be beneficial for research and development.</p>
<p>The challenge is that many companies haven’t yet introduced such a system, or they don’t have someone with the skills to properly utilize it. If you finding a company isn’t willing to share deep insights during the courtship process or they haven’t implemented it, look at the opportunity to introduce such data-focused offerings.</p>
<h2>In Europe, the best bets involve creating automation processes</h2>
<p>I have a sweet spot for early-stage companies that give you the opportunity to create processes and core systems. The company I work for was still in its early days when I started, and it was working towards creating scalable technology for a specific industry. The questions that the team was tasked with solving were already being solved, but there were numerous processes that still had to be put into place to solve a myriad of other issues.</p>
<p>Our year-long efforts to automate bulk image editing taught me that as long as the AI you’re building learns to run independently across multiple variables simultaneously (multiple images and workflows), you’re developing a technology that does what established brands haven’t been able to do. In Europe, there are very few companies doing this and they are hungry for talent who can.</p>
<p>So don’t be afraid of a little culture shock and take the leap.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What does a company have to do to differentiate wireless earbuds in 2021? The near ubiquity of good hardware has made this an increasingly difficult question to answer. I’ve probably tested around 10 different sets of buds over the last year or so, and honestly, they were all pretty good.</p>
<p>Companies like Nura and Nothing are taking interesting approaches to the category, but for hardware makers who also sell their own handsets, sometimes being the best pair of headphones for a specific mobile device is enough.</p>
<p>OnePlus is in something of a void between the two worlds. The company makes its own phones, of course, but doesn’t pull in numbers approaching goliaths like Samsung and Apple. Fittingly, the OnePlus Buds Pro walk that line &#8212; serving as a solid pair of buds that play nicely with its own devices, while sprinkling in a few &#8212; at the very least &#8212; interesting additions that somewhat differentiate them from a crowded field.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OnePlus’s fully wireless earbuds are unexceptional, but at least they’re pretty cheap&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/oneplus-fully-wireless-earbuds/embed/#?secret=rFwIBSrcQX" data-secret="rFwIBSrcQX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>OnePlus’s work in the category has been &#8212; to this point &#8212; unexceptional at best, and downright lackluster at worst. I was very much unimpressed when the company finally entered the fully wireless category last year, after a tethered play in the space. The sub-$100 price point was nice, but they otherwise felt like a set that could have flown maybe three or four years ago, when the pickings were far slimmer.</p>

<p>The Pros are, mercifully, better in practically every respect. That has to be a bit of a relief for the company, as one of its co-founders launched his own new headphones within a month of their product. At $150, the product comes in at a $50 premium over both the Ear (1) and its standard buds. It’s a fair price for what you’re getting here, however, taking a broader look at the current landscape.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I should note, that for this review, I took the headphones for a spin with a non-OnePlus Android phone I had handy, as well as an iPhone. That requires the use of the HeyMelody OnePlus/Oppo app, which is, in a word, lacking. But it gets the job done with some key features. There’s a fit test to ensure that you have a good seal, and OnePlus Audio ID, which helps you create a custom sound profile.</p>
<p>The latter is a rudimentary version of what Nura offers with an old-school sound test that runs you through a number of different tones, asking whether you can hear the playback. It’s a bit of a slog, but it ultimately makes a difference. The result was a fair bit fuller and richer when I finished. Unfortunately, there’s not a lot of EQ customization beyond that. That said, I really don’t have a lot to complain about on the sound side of things, beyond an over reliance on bass.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189194" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189194" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189194" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9966.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9966.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9966.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9966.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9966.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9966.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9966.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9966.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9966.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189194" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The noise canceling, which can either be controlled on the app or via the headphones’ stems, is also effective. A long (three-second) click of the stems, meanwhile, will pop up one of the buds’ most unique features: Zen Mode Air. It’s a clever if unnecessary addition in an era when every tech company is thinking about mindfulness. The feature pipes white noise into your eyes. The default is “Warm Sunrise” &#8212; kind of a meadow soundscape with chirping birds and insects. There are four other preloaded sounds, including campfires and the beach. It’s not a feature I ever thought I’d need, but in year where everything is stressful basically all of the time, I kind of dig it.</p>
<p>On the design side, companies have one of two choices these days. You can either embrace the AirPod or try something defiantly different. It’s pretty clear with a glance which direction OnePlus went. It’s a bit less pronounced on the matte black pair the company sent for review, but the white versions are unmistakable. The metal stems appear to be tossed in so as to not make them infringingly close to the market leaders.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189199" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189199" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189199" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9957.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9957.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9957.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9957.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9957.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9957.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9957.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9957.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9957.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189199" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>From a comfort perspective, they’re tough to beat. I’ve had them in for extended periods and gone running with them in and have no complaints. I guess there’s something to the AirPods design, after all. Battery life is pretty stellar, with five to seven hours on the buds (depending on ANC usage) and a combined 28 to 38 (ditto) with the slim case factored in. The case also supports wireless charging &#8212; an increasingly ubiquitous feature at this price point.</p>
<p>OnePlus clearly wanted to hew close to its budget roots by launching with the $99 buds first. But I think there’s something to the Google approach of showing what you can do with a more premium model and then dropping the budget take. There’s a strong case to be made that these were the headphones OnePlus should have released a year or two ago. But, hey, better late than never.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/china-proposes-strict-control-of-algorithms/">China to crack down on algorithms:</a> </strong>The push to more closely regulate and control China’s domestic technology market continued Friday with a government body announcing a draft set of rules for algorithms. The new rules come as China seeks to limit corporate data collection and more. Irony, of course, is dead.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/corporate-venture-capital-follows-the-same-trend-as-other-vc-markets-up/">Corporations can’t get enough startup equity:</a></strong> That’s our takeaway from digging into the recent, record results from the corporate venture capital (CVC) world. CVCs are taking part in more, bigger startup funding rounds. We dug into the why and the how of the latest data.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/"><strong>Apple makes smallest App Store concession:</strong></a> Per a settlement today, TechCrunch reports that Apple will now allow apps to “share information on how to pay for purchases outside of their iOS app or the App Store.” Apple called the change a clarification, which was interesting. Apple’s grip on the App Store is still tight, but we may be seeing indicators that its hold is slipping modestly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Up top, let’s talk about a16z, the venture capital conglomerate. Sure, it has crypto funds and main funds and other funds aplenty. But today the group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/andreessen-horowitz-just-rolled-out-a-400-million-fund-thats-expressly-for-seed-deals/">announced a $400 million capital pool just for seed deals</a>. The fund size indicates that a16z is either expecting to pay lots for seed equity or that it is going to make a host of bets. We’ll see.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/electric-vehicle-company-rivian-has-confidentially-filed-for-an-ipo/"><strong>Rivian files to go public:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In case you were looking for yet another EV company to add to your personal investments, good news! Rivian has filed privately to go public! Frankly, we&#8217;re excited by this deal; Lordstown this is not. The company recently closed $2.5 billion in external capital, bringing it to more than $10 billion in total. We want to know what all that funding has bought the firm in terms of results.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/forbes-jumps-into-hot-media-liquidity-summer-with-a-spac-combo/">Forbes is also going public:</a></strong> Via a SPAC, we should note, but yes, Forbes the media-and-magazine company is taking advantage of the boom in blank-check combinations to take itself public. We dug into its deck to see what the company has coming up and how heavily COVID-19 impacted its results.</li>
<li>Toast is also going public, but your humble servant failed to get a post up on the matter by the time it was newsletter o’clock. More to come on TechCrunch.com.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/zeal-banks-13m-to-offer-employers-a-build-your-own-payroll-product-infrastructure/"><strong>Payroll API startup Zeal raises Series A:</strong></a> The embedded fintech space is busy, and competitive, which makes what Zeal is building rather interesting. Is there a big enough market for just a payroll API product? A few years ago I would have quibbled, but if the OKR startup world has taught me anything, it’s to not underestimate how much demand there is in the world for software.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/as-5g-demand-grows-sitenna-helps-telcos-find-more-cell-tower-locations-faster/"><strong>Sitenna wants to help telcos place 5G antennas:</strong></a> Coming in the next batch of Y Combinator-backed startups, Sitenna is looking for a piece of the capital wave that will push 5G mobile connectivity into our lives. The startup is neat, so read the post, but also keep in mind that demo day for YC is next week, so we’re heading into a very heavy news cycle over the next few days.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/sastrify-snags-7m-to-help-smes-manage-saas-buying/">Sastrify raises $7M:</a> </strong>Based in Cologne, Sastrify wants to help companies buy and manage their SaaS spend. Why does the world need this? Well, now that all software is a subscription fee, not overpaying and generally knowing what one is paying for is a big deal. And big deals plus some founder work equals a startup. Notably, Sastrify is already cash-flow-positive despite its youth.</li>

<h2>The pre-pitch: 7 ways to build relationships with VCs</h2>
<p>Many founders must overcome a few emotional hurdles before they&#8217;re comfortable pitching a potential investor face-to-face.</p>
<p>To alleviate that pressure, Unicorn Capital founder Evan Fisher recommends that entrepreneurs use pre-pitch meetings to build and strengthen relationships before asking for a check:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the &#8216;we actually aren’t looking for money; we just want to be friends for now&#8217; pitch that gets you on an investor’s radar so that when it’s time to raise your next round, they’ll be far more likely to answer the phone because they actually know who you are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pre-pitches are good for more than curing the jitters: These conversations help founders get a better sense of how VCs think and sometimes lead to serendipitous outcomes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors are opportunists by necessity,&#8221; says Fisher, &#8220;so if they like the cut of your business’s jib, you never know — the FOMO might start kicking hard.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok has banned the popular &#8220;milk crate challenge&#8221; from its platform due to concerns that users participating in the trend could be seriously injured. The challenge saw TikTok users stacking milk crates into a pyramid and then attempting to climb across the unstable structure.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from the company told TechCrunch in an email that &#8220;TikTok prohibits content that promotes or glorifies dangerous acts, and we remove videos and redirect searches to our Community Guidelines to discourage such content. We encourage everyone to exercise caution in their behavior whether online or off.”</p>
<p>In most videos depicting the trend, TikTok users are seen tumbling to the ground as they try to climb up one side of the makeshift pyramid and down the other. The ban comes after several healthcare workers took to social media to voice their concerns about the trend and the danger it poses to those participating in it.</p>
<p>Searching for the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=milkcratechallenge&amp;lang=en">trend’s hashtag on the app</a> now brings up a “no results found” notice. The search results page notifies users that “this phrase may be associated with behavior or content that violates our guidelines. Promoting a safe and positive experience is TikTok&#8217;s top priority.” However, some videos depicting the trend are still visible on the app if users search for incorrect spellings of keywords associated with the challenge, such as &#8220;milk craate&#8221; or &#8220;milk cratee.&#8221; It’s worth noting that although these videos don’t have a significant amount of views, they&#8217;ve still managed to slip through the cracks of the ban and remain on the app.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s rise to popularity has seen numerous dangerous challenges go viral on the platform over the past few years. In 2019, a popular &#8220;throw it in the air&#8221; trend involved TikTok users forming a circle where nobody is allowed to move and then putting a phone on the floor to record them throwing an item up in the air on top of themselves to see who the object hits on its way down. Last year, a popular &#8220;skull-breaker&#8221; trend that went viral on the app <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/04/tiktok-challenge-skull-breaker/">prompted criminal charges</a> after a teen was hospitalized as a result of the challenge. The trend involved tricking a person to fall backward on their head.</p>
<p>Dangerous trends like these, including the most recent milk crate challenge, have forced TikTok to take action to prevent its users from putting themselves in harmful situations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Forget what you&#8217;ve heard: There are <em>many</em> shortcuts to success.</p>
<p>Tapping into someone else&#8217;s experience is a tried-and-true method, which is why two-time Y Combinator participant Chris Morton wrote a guest post for Extra Crunch with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/you-cant-hack-your-yc-application-but-heres-what-to-avoid/">advice for founders hoping to be accepted</a> by the famed accelerator.</p>
<p>Morton, who has also reviewed thousands of YC applications, shares his thoughts on when to submit an application, what to do if you miss the deadline and whether you&#8217;ll need to relocate if accepted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember that your application should be good enough to get an interview, not win a prize,&#8221; says Morton. &#8220;Go back to work instead of spending more time perfecting an application.”</p>

<p>In an interview with reporter Anna Heim, Romania-based marketer Robert Katai discussed some of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/romanian-marketing-expert-robert-katai-explains-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-content/">the methods he uses to help clients refine their content and branding strategies</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today, content creation is free — everybody can do it. The hard part is how you distribute and amplify that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Katai also shared his impressions of Romania&#8217;s startup ecosystem, suggestions for maintaining top-of-mind status with customers, and reinforced the often-overlooked need to continually repurpose content to grab mindshare.</p>
<p>Like our other growth marketing interviews, there&#8217;s no paywall.</p>

<p>Latin America&#8217;s increasingly dynamic venture capital scene has been making headlines of late. To learn more about why investors are so enthusiastic, senior reporter Mary Ann Azevedo spoke to several who are actively engaged with the region:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shu Nyatta, managing partner, SoftBank</li>
<li>Ethan Choi, partner, Accel</li>
<li>Julie Ruvolo, director of venture capital, LAVCA</li>
<li>Bill Cilluffo, partner, QED Investors</li>
<li>Ana Cristina Gadala-Maria, principal, QED Investors</li>
<li>Ross Darwin, principal, Owl Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p>“I am not surprised by all the activity,” Mary Ann writes. “However, I am a bit taken aback by the sheer number of rounds, the caliber of firms leading them and the sky-high valuations.</p>
<p>“It seems that the region is finally, and deservedly, being taken seriously. This is likely just the beginning.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Corporations are not remaining on the sidelines of the fiery 2021 venture capital game, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim note in The Exchange.</p>
<p>After parsing data from CB Insights and Stryber and chatting with a handful of investors, Alex and Anna concluded that the corporate venture capital market looks a lot like other VC markets.</p>
<p>“Perhaps this should not be a surprise,” they write. “We’ve seen non-venture funds flow into the later stages of startup land, pushing VCs toward earlier-stage and more venture-y deals. Why would CVCs be immune to the same trend?”</p>

<p>Corporate spending management startup Brex raised a $300 million Series C and acquired Buyer just a week after rival Brex announced it had acquired Israeli fintech Weav.</p>
<p>Ryan Lawler and Alex Wilhelm dug into the Ramp-Brex rivalry, and what those acquisitions say about their diverging strategies.</p>
<p>“From a high level, all of the recent deal-making in corporate cards and spend management shows that it’s not enough to just help companies track what employees are expensing these days,” they write.</p>
<p>“As the market matures and feature sets begin to converge, the players are seeking to differentiate themselves from the competition.”</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim interviewed VCs and corralled data to present a detailed picture of Boston&#8217;s startup funding scene.</p>
<p>“Boston is benefiting from larger structural changes to at least the U.S. venture capital market, helping close historical gaps in its startup funding market and access funds that previously might have skipped the region,” they write.</p>
<p>“And local university density isn’t hurting the city’s cause, either, boosting its ability to form new companies during a period of rich investment access.”</p>

<p>Half of the companies offering instant grocery delivery in Europe were founded last year as the pandemic reshaped most aspects of our existence.</p>
<p>To date, they&#8217;ve raised about $2 billion, but Picus Capital&#8217;s Alexander Kremer says startup lessons from China suggest that “instant delivery is not the magic bullet to crack the dominance” of old-school grocery players.</p>
<p>“If the performance of online grocery platforms in China (a market five to seven years ahead of Europe in terms of online retail) is anything to go by, a range of B2C business models would be more likely to displace the traditional grocery retailers.”</p>

<p>Marketing automation can help boost key metrics, but it can also be a disservice to brands by perpetually devaluing goods and services, ShareThis’ Michael Gorman writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>Companies with a narrow focus on driving conversions are missing the bigger picture: AI can help create richer experiences that identify consumer actions and intent while also improving customer experiences.</p>
<p>“We live in a world rich with data, and insights are growing more vibrant every day,” he writes.</p>

<p>Fintech startups based in Israel raised more than $1.8 billion in 2019, but in Q1 2021, companies in the category raised $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Facilitating a wide range of services, more than a dozen fintech unicorns have already emerged in a country that has a population slightly smaller than Los Angeles County, many of them started by entrepreneurs who lacked financial backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;So what is it about Israeli-founded fintech startups that stand out from their scaling neighbors across the pond?&#8221; asks Flint Capital&#8217;s Tel Aviv-based investor, Adi Levanon.</p>

<p>Technical jargon is one of the most annoying aspects of technology marketing.</p>
<p>Sadly, it tends to perpetuate itself: Marketers are terrified of making a wrong move, so they tend to copy what everyone else is doing.</p>
<p>If you want to attract customers and drive higher conversions, cut the jargon.</p>
<p>“Do everything you can to be immediately understood and you’ll have a much better chance of cutting through the noise and pushing clear and persuasive benefits in a way no prospect can resist,” advises Konrad Sanders, CEO of The Creative Copywriter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Linux is set for a big release this Sunday August 29, setting the stage for enterprise and cloud applications for months to come. The 5.14 kernel update will include security and performance improvements.</p>
<p>A particular area of interest for both enterprise and cloud users is always security and to that end, Linux 5.14 will help with several new capabilities. Mike McGrath, vice president, Linux Engineering at Red Hat told TechCrunch that the kernel update includes a feature known as core scheduling, which is intended to help mitigate processor-level vulnerabilities like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/03/kernel-panic-what-are-meltdown-and-spectre-the-bugs-affecting-nearly-every-computer-and-device/"> Spectre and Meltdown</a>, which first surfaced in 2018. One of the ways that Linux users have had to mitigate those vulnerabilities is by disabling hyper-threading on CPUs and therefore taking a performance hit.</p>
<p>&#8220;More specifically, the feature helps to split trusted and untrusted tasks so that they don’t share a core, limiting the overall threat surface while keeping cloud-scale performance relatively unchanged,&#8221; McGrath explained.</p>
<p>Another area of security innovation in Linux 5.14 is a feature that has been in development for over a year and a half that will help to protect system memory in a better way than before. Attacks against Linux and other operating systems often target memory as a primary attack surface to exploit. With the new kernel, there is a capability known as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28241033">memfd_secret ()</a> that will enable an application running on a Linux system to create a memory range that is inaccessible to anyone else, including the kernel.</p>
<p>&#8220;This means cryptographic keys, sensitive data and other secrets can be stored there to limit exposure to other users or system activities,&#8221; McGrath said.</p>
<p>At the heart of the open source Linux operating system that powers much of the cloud and enterprise application delivery is what is known as the Linux kernel. The kernel is the component that provides the core functionality for system operations.</p>
<p>The Linux 5.14 kernel release has gone through seven release candidates over the last two months and benefits from the contributions of 1,650 different developers. Those that contribute to Linux kernel development include individual contributors, as well as large vendors like Intel, AMD, IBM, Oracle and Samsung. One of the largest contributors to any given Linux kernel release is IBM&#8217;s Red Hat business unit. IBM <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/with-the-acquisition-closed-ibm-goes-all-in-on-red-hat/">acquired</a> Red Hat for $34 billion in a deal that closed in 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;As with pretty much every kernel release, we see some very innovative capabilities in 5.14,&#8221; McGrath said.</p>
<p>While Linux 5.14 will be out soon, it often takes time until it is adopted inside of enterprise releases. McGrath said that Linux 5.14 will first appear in Red Hat&#8217;s Fedora community Linux distribution and will be a part of the future Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 release. Gerald Pfeifer, CTO for enterprise Linux vendor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/15/suse-is-once-again-an-independent-company/">SUSE</a>, told TechCrunch that his company&#8217;s openSUSE Tumbleweed community release will likely include the Linux 5.14 kernel within &#8220;days&#8221; of the official release. On the enterprise side, he noted that SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP4, due next spring, is scheduled to come with the 5.14 kernel.</p>
<p>The new Linux update follows a major milestone for the open source operating system, as it was 30 years ago this past Wednesday that creator Linus Torvalds (pictured above) first publicly announced the effort. Over that time Linux has gone from being a hobbyist effort to powering the infrastructure of the internet.</p>
<p>McGrath commented that Linux is already the backbone for the modern cloud and Red Hat is also excited about how Linux will be the backbone for edge computing — not just within telecommunications, but broadly across all industries, from manufacturing and healthcare to entertainment and service providers, in the years to come.</p>
<p>The longevity and continued importance of Linux for the next 30 years is assured in Pfeifer&#8217;s view. He noted that over the decades Linux and open source have opened up unprecedented potential for innovation, coupled with openness and independence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will Linux, the kernel, still be the leader in 30 years? I don&#8217;t know. Will it be relevant? Absolutely,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Many of the approaches we have created and developed will still be pillars of technological progress 30 years from now. Of that I am certain.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Most founders fall into an extremely common trap: Just because you produced outstanding results for the last round of investors doesn&#8217;t mean new investors will believe you. This new cohort hasn’t seen that performance firsthand, and they have no reason to trust you yet.</p>
<p>As a founder approaching your next round, it&#8217;s common to wonder, &#8220;How do I get this new group of investors to trust that I will perform?&#8221;</p>
<p>In our experience, founders who fundraise successfully are great at building relationships, and they usually deliver what we call &#8220;the pre-pitch.&#8221; This is the &#8220;we actually aren’t looking for money; we just want to be friends for now&#8221; pitch that gets you on an investor’s radar so that when it’s time to raise your next round, they’ll be far more likely to answer the phone because they actually know who you are.</p>
<p>But the concept of the pre-pitch goes deeper than just having potential investors be aware of your existence. Building relationships with potential future investors requires you to think less like a founder and more like a marketer — much of the relationship heavy lifting comes long before it’s time to ask for a capital commitment.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If an investor has made a deal in your space, there’s a good chance they know an earlier-round investor who could potentially be a good fit for you today.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>There’s a host of advantages to the pre-pitch approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good practice: You’re not asking for money. Instead, you’re offering a sneak peek. Since your relationship-builder pre-pitch doesn’t have millions on the line, you’ll invariably be less anxious, which leads to better relationships. Remember: If it’s not a good fit, who cares?</li>
<li>Candid feedback: When you’re not asking for money, you’re more likely to receive honest feedback that you might not get in a high-stakes environment.</li>
<li>Set the baseline: You should go over where you’re currently at, why it’s actually not time to raise capital quite yet (the inverse of “Why Now”), and what you still have to accomplish until the time is right.</li>
<li>Performance-based trust: Put your performance where your mouth is by showing your potential investor where you are today and what you expect to do in the short term. Later on, you can prove to them that you achieved what you said you would.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7 ways to build relationships with VCs</h2>
<p>Now you’re probably wondering, &#8220;What the heck do I say to build a good relationship with that next-round investor?&#8221; Here are a few notes on how to approach the pre-pitch:</p>
<h3>Seek the relationship, not the money</h3>
<p>Acknowledge you’re early, but mention that you think it could potentially be a good fit later on. State it up front that you’re seeking a relationship and want to find out if you could eventually be a good fit for one another. Don’t sneak in an ask; let the relationship blossom organically.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example: &#8220;We’re actually not raising yet, and we’re probably too early for you. But I think this is something you might be very interested in, and thought it made sense to reach out, open up a relationship and see if there might be a fit.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In an effort to provide the most optimized experience for Chromebook customers, Microsoft apps (Office and Outlook) will be transitioned to web experiences (Office.com and Outlook.com) on September 18, 2021,&#8221; Microsoft wrote in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft&#8217;s statement also noted that &#8220;this transition brings Chromebook customers access to additional and premium features.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Microsoft web experience will serve to transition its base of Chromebook users to the Microsoft 365 service, which provides more Office templates and generally more functionality than what the app-based approach provides. The web approach is also more optimized for larger screens than the app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of how Microsoft wants Chromebook users to get access to Office and Outlook, the plan is for customers to, &#8220;&#8230;sign in with their personal Microsoft Account or account associated with their Microsoft 365 subscription,&#8221; according to the statement. Microsoft has also provided</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-install-and-run-microsoft-office-on-a-chromebook-32f14a23-2c1a-4579-b973-d4b1d78561ad"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">online documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to show users how to run Office on a Chromebook.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chromebooks run on Google&#8217;s Chrome OS, which is a Linux-based operating system. Chromebooks also enable Android apps to run, as Android is also Linux based, with apps downloaded from Google Play. It&#8217;s important to note that while support for Chromebooks is going away, Microsoft is not abandoning other Android-based mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those Chromebook users that have already downloaded the Microsoft Office apps, the apps will continue to function after September 18, though they will not receive any support or future updates. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With more than 270,000 stickers, Stipop&#8217;s library of colorful, character-driven expressions has a little something for everyone.</p>
<p>The company offers keyboard and social app stickers through ad-supported mobile apps on iOS and Android, but it&#8217;s recently focused more on providing stickers to developers, creators and other online businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to gather so many artists because we actually began as our own app that provided stickers,&#8221; <a href="https://stipop.io/">Stipop</a> co-founder Tony Park told TechCrunch. The team took what they learned from running their own consumer-facing app — namely that collecting and licensing hundreds of thousands of stickers from artists around the world is hard work — and adapted their business to help solve that problem for others.</p>
<p>Stipop was the first Korean company to go through Yellow, Snapchat&#8217;s exclusive accelerator. The company is also part of Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2021 cohort.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1RFqmpYo3I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Stipop&#8217;s sticker library is accessible through an SDK and an API, letting developers slot the searchable sticker library into their existing software. The company already has more than 200 companies that tap into its huge sticker trove, which offers a &#8220;single-day solution&#8221; for a process that would otherwise necessitate a lot more legwork. Stipop launched a <a href="https://developers.stipop.io/">website</a> recently that helps developers integrate its SDK and API through quick installs.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can just add a single line of code inside their product and will have a fully customized sticker feature [so] users will be able to spice up their chats,&#8221; Park said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Park points out that stickers encourage engagement — and for social software, engagement means growth. Stickers are a playful way to send characters back and forth in chat, but they also pop up in a number of other less obvious spots, from dating apps to e-commerce and ridesharing apps. Stipop even drives the sticker search in work collaboration software Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>The company has already partnered with Google, which uses Stipop&#8217;s sticker library in Gboard, Android Messages and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/google-acquires-gif-platform-tenor/">Tenor</a>, a GIF keyboard platform that Google bought in 2018. That partnership drove 600 million sticker views within the first month. A new partnership between Stipop and Coca-Cola on the near horizon will add Coke-branded stickers to its sticker library and the company is <a href="https://stipop.io/brands">opening its doors to more brands</a> that understand the unique appeal of stickers in messaging apps.</p>
<p>Park says that people tend to compare stickers and gifs, two ways of wordlessly expressing emotion and social nuance, but stickers are a world unto themselves. Stickers exist in their own creative universe, with star artists, regional themes and original casts of characters that take on a life of their own among fans. &#8220;Sticker creators have their own profession,&#8221; Park said.</p>
<p>Visual artists can also find a lot of traction releasing stickers, even without sophisticated illustrations. And since they&#8217;re all about meaning rather than refinement, non-designers and less skilled artists can craft hit stickers too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stickers are great for them because it [is] so easy to go viral,&#8221; Park said. The company has partnered with 8,000 sticker creators across 25 languages, helping those artists monetize their creations and generate income based on how many times a sticker is shared.</p>
<p>Stickers command their own visual language around the world, and Park has observed interesting cultural differences in how people use them to communicate. In the West, stickers are often used in place of text, but in Asia, where they&#8217;re used much more frequently, people usually send stickers to enhance rather than replace the meaning of text.</p>
<p>In East Asia, users tend to prefer simple black and white stickers, but in India and Saudi Arabia, bright, golden stickers top the trends. In South America, popular stickers take on a more pixelated, unique quality that resonates culturally there.</p>
<p>&#8220;With stickers, you fall in love with [the] characters you send&#8230; that becomes you,&#8221; Park said.</p>

The data surrounding the global shift to remote work is piling up and our post-pandemic professional landscape is starting to take shape.</p>
<p>Are you ready to lead a digital workforce?</p>
<p>The seismic shift in how we work requires a reassessment of how we manage, even for — or <em>especially</em> for — seasoned leaders. How do you wrangle a highly educated, decentralized workforce and rally them around a singular mission? How do you become a better people manager amid a workplace sea change?</p>
<p>As a seasoned CMO who has managed global workforces, I’ve finally hit my stride as a remote-only manager, all while navigating a global pandemic and riding my company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/okr-focused-gtmhub-raises-30m-series-b-after-growing-3x-in-2020/">unprecedented growth</a>. What’s the secret sauce to managing today’s remote workforce? Strengthen your team by creating authentic workplace transparency, using numbers as a universal language and providing meaning behind your team’s work.</p>
<p>The biggest secret behind my management practices? It’s possible to produce more success with less stress. Consider these three ways I’ve strengthened my team and, in turn, become a more nimble manager.</p>
<h2>Focus your team on meaningful work</h2>
<p>A Harvard Business Review study found that <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/11/9-out-of-10-people-are-willing-to-earn-less-money-to-do-more-meaningful-work">knowledge workers are more fulfilled</a> when they understand what organizations are trying to achieve and how their work lifts up their workplaces as a whole. In other words, meaning motivates your digital workforce.</p>
<p>On the surface, communicating your organization’s overarching mission, its reason for being, seems like a simple enough task. But I challenge you to ask each one of your team members to define your organization’s mission. If you have 10 employees, I bet you get nine or 10 different answers.</p>
<p>Instead of expecting employees to find your organization’s mission and vision on PowerPoint decks or on the website’s “about us” page, use the proven objectives and key results (OKRs) methodology.</p>
<p>The next piece of the puzzle helps you raise the visibility around <em>why</em> your employees are doing what they’re doing every day and creates a culture of motivation through meaning. Collaborate with your employees to create individual OKRs that identify goals and metrics for achievement. These OKRs should detail exactly how each employee contributes to the organization’s success and become the impetus behind<em> everything </em>an employee does.</p>
<p>I tell my workforce to review their OKRs every morning to help them focus on what’s important. It is like daily meditation for your business. So I didn’t worry when my director of marketing recently moved and had a baby. Because we had worked together to set thoughtful OKRs, my team member’s objectives and results were well defined. She knew where to focus her limited time. No distractions from the cacophony of requests. No anxiety over letting down her team. Just peace of mind that she was focusing on the right tasks.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The design space has undergone major changes in the last decade. What once was dominated by a single player in Adobe has now become a burgeoning software landscape, with a handful of major players answering the needs of designers across every industry.</p>
<p>One such player is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/canva/">Canva</a>, the startup valued at over $15 billion. The company started out with a consumer-facing product, making design accessible to non-designers. But on the back of launching an enterprise-centric suite of tools, the growth of Sydney-based Canva has been staggering.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Canva co-founder and CEO Melanie Perkins join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Disrupt (Sept 21-23)</a> for a fireside chat.</p>
<p>Since launching the company in 2013, Perkins has led its growth to now see more than 55 million users each month, ranging from individual creators to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to Perkins about how she shifted the company from individual creators to a B2B platform, what it&#8217;s like to run an industry-specific startup in the midst of a fundamental evolution — see: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/05/design-may-be-the-next-entrepreneurial-gold-rush/">Design may be the next entrepreneurial gold rush</a> — and how she&#8217;s handled this period of monumental growth for the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the global market for startup investing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">presses to new heights in terms of dollars invested this year</a>, and deal volume ticks up in several regions, corporations are diving into the action.</p>
<p>Data from <a href="http://cbinsights.com">CB Insights</a> and <a href="https://stryber.com/">Stryber</a> indicate that corporate investors are taking part in deals worth more than ever, even if corporate venture capital (CVC) deal activity is not up uniformly around the world.</p>

<p>In a sense, it’s not surprising that CVCs are seeing the deals that they participate in rising in size &#8212; the global venture capital market has trended toward larger deals and more dollars for some time now. But questions lie inside the eye-popping figures: How are corporate investors adapting to a more rapid-fire and expensive venture capital market? We also wanted to know if CVCs are shaking up their deal sourcing, and whether the classic corporate venture tension between strategic investing and deploying capital for financial return is seeing a focus mix shift.</p>

(TechCrunch last covered CVC outfit WIND Ventures <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/wind-ventures-gears-up-to-invest-in-startups-looking-at-latin-america/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Let’s talk data and then dig into the nuance behind the numbers.</p>
<h2>A boom in deal value</h2>
<p>Precisely measuring CVC activity is interestingly difficult. When we discuss the value of venture capital deals, for example, what counts and what doesn’t is a matter of taste. For example, how to treat the SoftBank Vision Fund. Do deals that it leads that include venture capital participation count toward larger VC activity for a given period of time? What about investments led by crossover funds?</p>
<p>No matter what you choose, aggregate venture capital data will always include dollars invested by non-venture entities. So you do the best you can. CVC has the same problem, amplified. Because CVCs are often participatory to deals, instead of leading them, especially in the later stages of startup investing today, tallying concrete corporate venture investment is difficult. So we proceed in the same manner as we do with aggregate venture data counting, including deals that a particular investor type participated in.</p>
<p>Perfect, no. But it’s consistent, which is what we likely care about more. All that’s to say that when we observe the following deal and dollar data, CB Insights notes plainly that for its purposes, “‘CVC-backed funding’ and ‘CVC-backed deals’ refer to corporate venture capital participation in these funding rounds.”</p>
<p>Fair enough. Per <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/corporate-venture-capital-trends-h1-2021">CB Insights&#8217; H1 2021 CVC report</a>, CVCs participated in $78.7 billion in funding activity in the first half of 2021, a record for a half-year period. That dollar figure was derived from some 2,099 deals around the world. Precisely how strong those figures are is not clear from their absolute scale.</p>
