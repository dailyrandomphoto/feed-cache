										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">However the outcome of today’s vote count turned out, there was one thing we knew for certain: it wasn’t going to mark the end of the battle between Amazon and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. With voting having broken overwhelmingly in Amazon’s favor, the union was quick to challenge the results.</p>
<p>The RWDSU was quick to offer TechCrunch a statement from President Stuart Appelbaum after no votes broke the 50% threshold, noting, “We demand a comprehensive investigation over Amazon&#8217;s behavior in corrupting this election.”</p>
<p>Amazon, unsurprisingly, was quick to take a victory lap. In a blog post credited to “Amazon Staff,” the company writes:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Thank you to employees at our BHM1 fulfillment center in Alabama for participating in the election. There’s been a lot of noise over the past few months, and we’re glad that your collective voices were finally heard. In the end, less than 16% of the employees at BHM1 voted to join the RWDSU union. It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the company was quick to state that the election is “over,” the RWDSU is hopeful, both in terms of future organizing at the Bessemer warehouse and for what the movement will mean for unionizing efforts at Amazon, going forward.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AIQ7k0ThKS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/more-tech-workers-are-starting-to-unionize/">More tech workers are starting to unionize</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;More tech workers are starting to unionize&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/more-tech-workers-are-starting-to-unionize/embed/#?secret=AIQ7k0ThKS" data-secret="AIQ7k0ThKS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a press conference held earlier today, Appelbaum suggested that Amazon told workers that they would have to vote against the union if they wanted to keep their jobs.</p>
<p>“We believe a rerun election is going to be very likely,” the union president told media. “I think that if Amazon considers this a victory, they may want to reconsider it. At best, it’s a Pyrrhic victory. Look at what happened during this period. We exposed atrocious working conditions at Amazon for everybody to see.”</p>
<p>Appelbaum’s comments seem to refer, in part, to numerous reports of workers urinating in bottles over concerns about stringent quotas. In the midst of an aggressive social media campaign at the apparent behest of CEO Jeff Bezos, the company initially denied reports, before conceding they may apply to some drivers. Amazon was quick to deflect blame to broader industry issues, however.</p>
<p>“Amazon didn’t win—our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union,” the company added in its post. &#8220;Our employees are the heart and soul of Amazon, and we’ve always worked hard to listen to them, take their feedback, make continuous improvements, and invest heavily to offer great pay and benefits in a safe and inclusive workplace. We’re not perfect, but we’re proud of our team and what we offer, and will keep working to get better every day.”</p>
<p>A key part to the RWDSU’s challenge is a ballot box the company reportedly pressured the USPS to install, in defiance of a National Labor Relations Board ruling. Appelbaum said the box “creates the impression of surveillance.”</p>
<p>He added that the union has already been in communication with workers at other Amazon facilities, explaining, “We have already started talking to workers at other facilities, as well, before this election.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security researchers say APKPure, a widely popular app for installing older or discontinued Android apps from outside of Google&#8217;s app store, contained malicious adware that flooded the victim&#8217;s device with unwanted ads.</p>
<p>Kaspersky Lab <a href="https://securelist.com/apkpure-android-app-store-infected/101845/?/kaspersky/april8/index.html">said that</a> it alerted APKPure on Thursday that its most recent app version, 3.17.18, contained malicious code that siphoned off data from a victim&#8217;s device without their knowledge, and pushed ads to the device&#8217;s lock screen and in the background to generate fraudulent revenue for the adware operators.</p>
<p>But the researchers said that the malicious code had the capacity to download other malware, potentially putting affected victims at further risk.</p>
<p>The researchers said the APKPure developers likely introduced the malicious code, known as a software development kit or SDK, from an unverified source. APKPure removed the malicious code and pushed out a new version, 3.17.19, and the developers <a href="https://apkpure.com/apkpure/com.apkpure.aegon/versions">no longer list</a> the malicious version on its site.</p>
<p>APKPure was set up in 2014 to allow Android users access to a vast bank of Android apps and games, including old versions, as well as app versions from other regions that are no longer on Android&#8217;s official app store Google Play. It later launched an Android app, which also has to be installed outside Google Play, serving as its own app store to allow users to download older apps directly to their Android devices.</p>
<p>APKPure is ranked as <a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/apkpure.com">one of the most popular sites</a> on the internet.</p>
<p>But security experts have long warned against installing apps outside of the official app stores as quality and security vary wildly as much of the Android malware requires <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/android-malware-system-update/">victims to install malicious apps</a> from outside the app store. Google scans all Android apps that make it into Google Play, but some have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/16/android-users-tricked-adware-apps/">slipped through the cracks</a> before.</p>
<p>TechCrunch contacted APKPure for comment but did not hear back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Given the pandemic, huge changes are being wrought in tech events, something which used to be the lifeblood of the industry. Many a startup has pitched to win funding, and many a hackathon has formed teams that went on to greater things. It’s a sad fact that this era is over, at least until the pandemic has fully passed, but this could take some time. Two significant European events have now had to change in order to carry their brands into new realms.</p>
<p>European breakout success story <a href="http://Infobip.com">Infobip</a> (which has raised over $200 million) was born out of Croatia. And so was the seminal developer conference <a href="https://shiftconf.co/">Shift</a>. With Infobipo needing that engineering community, and Shift needing a more stable home in uncertain times, it seems only natural that Infobip would put developers front and center of their company strategy with the acquisition of Shift, and appointing its founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanburazin/">Ivan Burazinto</a> the board as Chief Developer Experience Officer. Shift will now form the basis of Infobip’s all-new Developer Experience department.<br />
 <br />
As Burazin said: “The vision was always to become one of the largest developer conferences in the world, and also to strengthen Croatia’s connection to the world of software developers. So now with the backing of a Unicorn and the freedom to keep working on independently – the vision seems to have finally become possible.”</p>
<p>He says Shift won’t disappear, but will now expand globally, first to the US and then to Latin America and southeast Asia, initially in remote events.<br />
 <br />
Infobip CEO Silvio Kutić said: “Infobip is on a growth trajectory to expand rapidly into the B2C vertical, or more specifically Business-to-Developer (B2D) space. Having Ivan on board with his experience as the founder of Codeanywhere, a B2D SaaS company, and creator of Shift, the largest developer conference in the region, will be an asset to us going forward.”<br />
  <br />
Meanwhile, a key startup and founder/investor-oriented conference &#8220;Tech Open Air Berlin” is also changing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tech Open Air (TOA), was known for its technology and startup festival, which attracted upwards of 20,000 people in Berlin every summer, but it has now pivoted into a new brand: <a href="http://toaklub.com">TOA Klub</a>. This will now be a “cohort-based learning and doing platform.” The 4-6 weeks of online programs will be aimed at help professionals progress in the tech industry.</p>
<p>TOA Klub will offer Founders Klub (for founders learning to startup); Investors Klub (for newbie investors); Crypto Klub (a “crash course in the crypto field”); and Co-Creators Klub (for founders looking to pivot and grow).</p>
<p>The first confirmed mentors and speakers include Rolf Schrömgens (Founder, Trivago), Dominik Richter (Founder, HelloFresh) or Jeanette zu Fürstenberg (Founding Partner, La Famiglia VC).</p>
<p>Nikolas Woischnik, founder of TOA said: “The world will come out of this pandemic having digitally aged by decades, not years.  The complexity of our business environment has greatly accelerated. At TOA this gives our long-time mission of &#8220;making people, organizations and the planet futureproof&#8221; ever more purpose. With the launch of Klub, it is time for us to leverage technology to deliver on our mission in a more impactful and accessible way.”</p>
<p>I for one am glad these greats brands have found new homes, because I know the brands and the founders both carry huge respect in the European startup scene.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bain Capital Ventures managing director Sarah Smith talks about how to ensure the critical early hires are the right ones to grow a business.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From building out Facebook&#8217;s first office in Austin to putting together most of Quora&#8217;s team, Bain Capital Ventures managing director Sarah Smith has done a bit of everything when it comes to hiring. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">TechCrunch Early Stage</a>, she spoke about how to ensure the critical early hires are the right ones to grow a business. As an investor at Bain Capital Ventures, Smith has a broad view into the problems that companies face as they search for the right candidate to spur organizational success.</p>
<p>In our conversation, Smith touched on a number of issues such as who to hire and when, when to fire, and how to ensure diversity from the earliest days.</p>
<hr />
<h3>What to consider when you first think about hiring</h3>
<p>When a company is making its first hires — and then evolving into a bigger organization — the processes and needs may change, but the culture should be consistent from the beginning, according to Smith. From there, an emphasis on good early managers is critical.</p>
<blockquote><p>I would really encourage you to take some time to think about what kind of company you want to make first before you go out and start interviewing people. So that really is going to be about understanding and defining your culture. And then the second thing I&#8217;d be thinking about when you&#8217;re scaling from, you know, five people up to, you know, 50 and beyond is that managers really are the key to your success as a company. It&#8217;s hard to overstate how important managers, great managers, are to the success of your company.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ll talk a little bit about how to think about that, as there&#8217;s a lot of questions around helping people grow into management for the first time. You, as a founder, might be managing people for the first time, so how to think about setting up the company for success.</p>
<p><em><strong>(Timestamp: 4:15)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Joby Aviation founder JoeBen Bevirt has spent a more than a decade developing an all-electric, vertical take-off and landing passenger aircraft — an effort that was largely shrouded in secrecy until January 2020 when the company announced a $590 million Series C round of funding that was led by Toyota Motor Corporation. (that round later expanded to $620M).</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The buzzy announcements continued with Joby&#8217;s acquisition of Uber Elevate and then culminated in February with its bid to become a publicly traded company through a merger with Reinvent Technology Partners, a special purpose acquisition company from well-known investor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Zynga founder Mark Pincus.</p>
<p>Joby is just getting started. The company plans to use capital generated via its public listing to fund the launch of passenger service, which is expected to begin in 2024. And Joby still must complete certification of its aircraft and develop manufacturing facilities, but it is already on its way to achieving both. The company is also planning to begin construction on a 450,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, designed in conjunction with Toyota, later this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The upshot: Bevirt has a lot to share. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re excited to announced that Bevirt and Hoffman will will join us on our virtual stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hoffman&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hoffman&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>. The virtual event, which features the best and brightest minds in the world of mobility, will be held on June 9. Bevirt and Hoffman will discuss building a startup — and keeping it secret while raising funds — the future of flight and of course, SPACs.</p>
<p>The pair will join other speakers TechCrunch has announced, a list that so far, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/investors-clara-brenner-quin-garcia-and-rachel-holt-are-coming-to-tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">includes investors</a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/clara-brenner" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Clara Brenner</strong></a> of Urban Innovation Fund, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/quin-garcia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Quin Garcia</strong></a> of Autotech Ventures and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/rachel-holt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Rachel Holt</strong></a> of Construct Capital as well as Starship Technologies co-founder and CEO/CTO Ahti Heinla. Stay tuned for more announcements in the weeks leading up to the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We approach it (SPACs) as venture capital at scale,&#8221; Hoffman told TechCrunch in a February interview. So it&#8217;s not a &#8216;this year thing,&#8217; it&#8217;s a next three years, next five years, next 10 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yes, Hoffman believes SPACs are here to stay. Although we plan to check in on his stance in June. &#8220;I think that it&#8217;s valuable to the market and valuable to society have multiple, different paths, by which companies can go public,&#8221; Hoffman said.</p>

<p>As for Bevirt, the move to go public marks Joby&#8217;s readiness to be more open with the rest of the world.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We think that this is a really exciting moment, where we stand on the threshold of really redefining mobility,&#8221; Bevirt said in a previous interview. &#8220;And we really want to bring the world along on our exciting journey. Previously, only a very exclusive set of investors has had access to be part of our journey, and it&#8217;s really exciting for us to be able to share that more broadly.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If we’ve said it once, we’ve said it 1,000 times. Startup Alley is ground zero for entrepreneurial opportunity. It’s where hundreds of savvy, exhibiting startups increase their brand recognition, connect with investors, grow their network, expand their customer base and garner invaluable media coverage.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> takes place on September 21-23, and we’ve added new features and experiences to help Startup Alley exhibitors make the most of the virtual expo area. Ready to make a minimal investment for maximum opportunity? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalley&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=TRUE">Buy a Startup Alley Pass for $199</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Play beat the clock:</strong> That super early-bird price remains in effect only until <strong>May 13 at 11:59 pm (PST).</strong> Get moving, and you’ll save $50.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s what’s new in Startup Alley this year, starting with yet another reason to get your exhibitor&#8217;s pass ASAP.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalley&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">Startup Alley+</a>:</strong> TechCrunch will select 50 Startup Alley exhibitors to form an elite cohort. These founders receive — at no additional cost — access to a curated pre-Disrupt experience. You’ll compete in a pitch-off at Extra Crunch Live, attend a series of founder masterclasses and receive introductions to top early-stage investors. It’s specifically designed to provide more opportunities for exposure and growth before Disrupt even opens.</p>
<p>The timing matters because Startup Alley+ begins in July at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising</a> — and the cohort attends for free. If you want a crack at this opportunity, get your exhibitor pass now.</p>
<p><strong>The Startup Alley Crawl:</strong> Every tech category gets a dedicated, hour-long crawl. TechCrunch editors will select several startups from each category and interview the founders live from the Disrupt stage. We’ll list the specific times for each on in the agenda closer to the event.</p>
<p><strong>From Startup Alley to Startup Battlefield:</strong> TechCrunch will award two stand-out startups a Startup Battlefield Wild Card. Those founders will get to compete in the thrilling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/">Startup Battlefield</a> for a chance to win $100,000.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone pitches:</strong> Every exhibiting startup is eligible for this opportunity. You’ll have two minutes to throw your best pitch across the plate and receive feedback from pitch-savvy TechCrunch staff. Talk about an opportunity to improve and impress. Your pitch session can have long-term benefits — as told to us by Jessica McLean, the Director of Marketing and Communications at Infinite-Compute.</p>
<p>“Disrupt is a great avenue to network with potential investors. It carries a lot of street cred and talking about our CEO’s experience pitching in Startup Alley helps us make those connections and start important conversations.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has removed 16,000 groups that were trading fake reviews on its platform after another intervention by the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the regulator <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-intervention-leads-to-further-facebook-action-on-fake-reviews">said today</a>.</p>
<p>The CMA has been leaning on tech giants to prevent their platforms being used as thriving marketplaces for selling fake reviews since it began investigating the issue in 2018 &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/21/ebay-and-facebook-told-to-tackle-trade-in-fake-reviews/">pressuring both eBay and Facebook</a> to act against fake review sellers back in 2019.</p>
<p>The two companies pledged to do more to tackle the insidious trade <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/facebook-and-ebay-pledge-to-do-more-to-tackle-trade-in-fake-reviews-after-pressure-from-uk-regulator/">last year</a>, after coming under further pressure from the regulator &#8212; which found that Facebook-owned Instagram was also a thriving hub of fake review trades.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RKEZTgIZqm"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/facebook-still-full-of-groups-trading-fake-reviews-says-consumer-group/">Facebook still full of groups trading fake reviews, says consumer group</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook still full of groups trading fake reviews, says consumer group&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/facebook-still-full-of-groups-trading-fake-reviews-says-consumer-group/embed/#?secret=RKEZTgIZqm" data-secret="RKEZTgIZqm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The latest intervention by the CMA looks considerably more substantial than last year&#8217;s action &#8212; when Facebook removed a mere 188 groups and disabled 24 user accounts. Although it&#8217;s not clear how many accounts the tech giant has banned and/or suspended this time it has removed orders of magnitude more groups. (We&#8217;ve asked.)</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> We understand that the regulator has focused on the removal of groups trading misleading/fake reviews, rather than individual accounts &#8212; as banned or suspended users are able to create new profiles, whereas removing the group in which fake reviews are being traded is seen as a more effective way to impact and deter the activity.</p>
<p>Facebook was also contacted with questions but it did not answer what we asked directly, sending us this statement instead:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have engaged extensively with the CMA to address this issue. Fraudulent and deceptive activity is not allowed on our platforms, including offering or trading fake reviews. Our safety and security teams are continually working to help prevent these practices.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the CMA has been raising the issue of fake review trading, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/facebook-still-full-of-groups-trading-fake-reviews-says-consumer-group/">Facebook has been repeatedly criticised</a> for not doing enough to clean up its platforms, plural.</p>
<p>Today the regulator said the social media giant has made further changes to the systems it uses for &#8220;identifying, removing and preventing the trading of fake and/or misleading reviews on its platforms to ensure it is fulfilling its previous commitments&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why it&#8217;s taken Facebook well over a year &#8212; and a number of high profile interventions &#8212; to dial up action against the trade in fake reviews. But the company suggested that the resources it has available to tackle the problem had been strained as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts, such as home working. (Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx">full year revenue</a> increased in 2020 but so too did its expenses.)</p>
<p>According to the CMA changes Facebook has made to its system for combating traders of fake reviews include:</p>
<ul>
<li>suspending or banning users who are repeatedly creating Facebook groups and Instagram profiles that promote, encourage or facilitate fake and misleading reviews</li>
<li>introducing new automated processes that will improve the detection and removal of this content</li>
<li>making it harder for people to use Facebook’s search tools to find fake and misleading review groups and profiles on Facebook and Instagram</li>
<li>putting in place dedicated processes to make sure that these changes continue to work effectively and stop the problems from reappearing</li>
</ul>
<p>Again it&#8217;s not clear why Facebook would not have already been suspending or banning repeat offenders &#8212; at least, not if it was actually taking good faith action to genuinely quash the problem, rather than seeing if it could get away with doing the bare minimum.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, essentially makes that point, saying: &#8220;Facebook has a duty to do all it can to stop the trading of such content on its platforms. After we intervened again, the company made significant changes &#8212; but it is disappointing it has taken them over a year to fix these issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to keep a close eye on Facebook, including its Instagram business. Should we find it is failing to honour its commitments, we will not hesitate to take further action,&#8221; Coscelli added.</p>
<p>A quick search on Facebook&#8217;s platform for UK groups trading in fake reviews appears to return fewer obviously dubious results than when we&#8217;ve checked in on this problem in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/21/ebay-and-facebook-told-to-tackle-trade-in-fake-reviews/">2019</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/facebook-and-ebay-pledge-to-do-more-to-tackle-trade-in-fake-reviews-after-pressure-from-uk-regulator/">2020</a>. Although the results that were returned included a number of private groups so it was not immediately possible to verify what content is being solicited from members.</p>
<p>We did also find a number of Facebook groups offering Amazon reviews intended for other European markets, such as France and Spain (and in one public group aimed at Amazon Spain we found someone offering a &#8220;fee&#8221; via PayPal for a review; see below screengrab) &#8212; suggesting Facebook isn&#8217;t applying the same level of attention to tackling fake reviews that are being traded by users in markets where it&#8217;s faced fewer regulatory pokes than it has in the UK.</p>

When Kunst first launched her firm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/cleo-capital-sets-10m-target-to-fund-female-entrepreneurs/">she targeted a $10 million close.</a> She ended up closing $3.14 million of that goal, and now, she’s back to double down.</p>
<p>Fund II’s $20 million target, if closed, would allow Cleo Capital, which invests in primarily pre-seed companies, to start leading rounds. The firm has already been writing $1 million checks and targets about a 15-20% ownership in its rounds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“One of the reasons why we are a pre-seed fund is because in seed, especially late-seed, you have everyone from family offices to TikTok stars and rolling funds competing for hot rounds,” she said. “No one is competing in pre-seed.”</p>
<p>There are firms such as Precursor and Hustle Fund that back pre-seed companies, and cut checks around $100,000 and $25,000 to start, respectively. Kunst sees the ability to write a $1 million pre-seed check as a “huge advantage.” Usually early-stage founders without family money or deep networks have to spend a big chunk of time raising their first round. It’s a lot of time to spend fundraising and not building a company. If a firm can cut a big pre-seed check, she thinks that Cleo is “buying back six months of a company‘s runway,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/as-covid-19-era-drags-on-vcs-look-beyond-zoom-calls-for-due-diligence-and-sourcing/">Like many firms</a>, Cleo Capital has turned to creative measures to diversify deal flow in the era of Zoom investing and pandemic business. For example, Cleo Capital<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/cleo-capitals-sarah-kunst-launches-a-fellowship-for-laid-off-workers/"> launched a fellowship program</a> for laid off workers during COVID-19 to promote entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Matt Pauker, a repeat founder who has sold companies to Coinbase and HP Enterprise, was one of the advisors of that program. Pauker has joined Cleo Capital as a general partner presumably to line up with the timing of Fund II.</p>
<p>While the firm has no racial or gender investment focus, about 92% of its current investments are companies started by underrepresented founders.</p>
<p>The firm’s portfolio includes Planet FWD, mmhmm, Lunch Club, and StyleSeat. As for new opportunities, Kunst says that Cleo Capital is looking at anything that helps the individual turn into a collective. With the growth of the creator economy and solo-entrepreneurs, people need to figure out the future of income, health care, and benefit, Kunst explained.</p>
<p>“All of these things are hard for people to do as an individual,” she said. The majority of Cleo Capital’s portfolio is based outside of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Cleo Capital&#8217;s raise comes just over a week after two venture capital firms founded by Black venture capitalists announced new funds, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/harlem-capital-fund-ii/">Harlem Capital</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/closing-on-103-million-mac-venture-capital-is-changing-the-face-of-venture-capital/">MaC Venture Capital.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Efforts to unionize Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama warehouse were defeated by a wide margin in the second day of vote counting. More than half of the 3,215 votes cast broke in favor of the retailer. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which would have served as the workers&#8217; union, had the vote passed, was quick to challenge the results.</p>
<p>RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement offered to TechCrunch,</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon has left no stone unturned in its efforts to gaslight its own employees. We won’t let Amazon’s lies, deception and illegal activities go unchallenged, which is why we are formally filing charges against all of the egregious and blatantly illegal actions taken by Amazon during the union vote. Amazon knew full well that unless they did everything they possibly could, even illegal activity, their workers would have continued supporting the union.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s why they required all their employees to attend lecture after lecture, filled with mistruths and lies, where workers had to listen to the company demand they oppose the union. That’s why they flooded the internet, the airwaves and social media with ads spreading misinformation. That’s why they brought in dozens of outsiders and union-busters to walk the floor of the warehouse. That’s why they bombarded people with signs throughout the facility and with text messages and calls at home. And that’s why they have been lying about union dues in a right to work state. Amazon’s conduct has been despicable.</p></blockquote>
<p>This initial defeat represents a large setback in the biggest unionization push in Amazon’s 27 year history. What might have represented a sea change for both the retail giant and blue collar tech workers has, for now, been fairly soundly defeated.</p>
<p>Amazon has, of course, long insisted that it treats workers fairly, making such union efforts unnecessary. The company cites such standards as a $15 an hour minimum wage, a factor the company initial pushed back on, but ultimately instated after pressure from legislators.</p>
<p>It was a hard fought battle on both sides. A number of legislators threw their weight behind unionization efforts, in an unlikely alliance that ranged from Bernie Sanders to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/marco-rubio-says-he-stands-with-amazon-warehouse-workers/">Marco Rubio</a>. The conservative Florida Senator noted the company&#8217;s “uniquely malicious corporate behavior.” President Joe Biden also sided with the workers, calling himself, “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company will no doubt tout the results as vindication. It noted in an early statement, &#8220;[O]ur employees are smart and know the truth—starting wages of $15 or more, health care from day one, and a safe and inclusive workplace. We encourage all of our employees to vote.”</p>
<p>In a blog post following the news, the company noted,</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true. Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us. And Amazon didn’t win—our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union. Our employees are the heart and soul of Amazon, and we’ve always worked hard to listen to them, take their feedback, make continuous improvements, and invest heavily to offer great pay and benefits in a safe and inclusive workplace. We’re not perfect, but we’re proud of our team and what we offer, and will keep working to get better every day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the expected challenges from the union are lingering questions around ballot boxes reportedly installed by the company in violation of labor board terms.&#8221;[E]ven though the NLRB definitively denied Amazon&#8217;s request for a drop box on the warehouse property, Amazon felt it was above the law and worked with the postal service anyway to install one,&#8221; the RWDSU writes. &#8220;They did this because it provided a clear ability to intimidate workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bessemer warehouse, which employees around 6,000 workers, was opened at the end of March 2020, as the company looked to expand the operation of its essential workers during the impending lock down. The conversation has surface variously long standing complaints around the company&#8217;s treatment of blue collar workers, including numerous reports that employees urinate in water bottles, in order to meet stringent performance standards.</p>
<p>The company initially denied these claims during a social media offensive, but later clarified its stance in an apology of sorts, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/03/amazon-addresses-pee-bottle-denial-tweet/">appearing to shift the blame</a> to wider industry problems. The company also ran anti-union ads on its subsidiary, Twitch, before the streaming platform pulled them, stating that they &#8220;should never have been allowed to run.&#8221;</p>
<p>All told, 3,215 were cast, representing more than half of the workers at the Alabama warehouse. In spite of Amazon winning more than half the votes, counting will continue. Challenges are likely to stretch on for weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital mortgage lender Better.com has raised a $500 million round from Japanese investment conglomerate SoftBank that values the company at $6 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing is notable for a few reasons. For one, that new $6 billion valuation is up 50% from the $4 billion it was valued at last November when it raised $200 million in Series D financing. It’s also up tenfold from its $600 million valuation at the time of its </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/better-com-raises-160m-series-c-at-600m-valuation-to-speed-up-mortgage-lending/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Series C raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, it’s further proof that mortgage – a traditionally “unsexy” industry that has long been in need of disruption – is officially hot. For all its controversy, when SoftBank invests, people pay attention.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic and historically-low mortgage rates fueled acceleration in the online lending space in a way that no one could have anticipated. That, combined with the general fervor in venture funding, means it’s not a big surprise that Better.com has raised $700 million in just a matter of months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment brings Better.com’s total funding raised to over $900 million since its 2014 inception. Other backers include Goldman Sachs, Kleiner Perkins, American Express, Activant Capital and Citi, among others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-invest-500-million-in-mortgage-startup-better-11617899907">Wall Street Journal</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank is buying shares from Better’s existing investors, and agreed to give all of its voting rights to CEO and founder Vishal Garg “in a sign of its eagerness” to invest in the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a one-on-one interview at Lendit Fintech’s USA 2020 virtual event in October, Garg had told me that an IPO was definitely in the works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll do it when it’s right,” he said. “One of the core tenets of American capitalism is the ability for your customers to buy your stock.”</span></p>
<p>And in February, Bloomberg had reported that the startup had  tapped Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. for a planned initial public offering in the U.S. But there&#8217;s been no further word since. It&#8217;s not unusual for companies to raise large sums before an IPO. Affirm did it <a href="https://finledger.com/2020/11/18/affirm-drops-s-1-revealing-sharply-rising-revenue-on-a-narrower-net-loss/">last year</a>, for example.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also last October, Varg had told me that before the pandemic, Better was processing about $1.2 billion a month in loans. But as of October 2020, it was funding over $2.5 billion per month, and had gone from 1,500 staffers to about 4,000 worldwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When the pandemic started we were doing less than sort of like $50 million a month of revenue,” he said at the time. “We’re two-and-a half times that now.”</span></p>
<p>Since then, those numbers have gone up even more. A company spokesperson told me today that Better.com funded $14 billion in loan volume in the first quarter of 2021 alone and that it is currently funding over $4 billions in loans a month. For some context,  Better.com funded $25 billion in loan volume in all of 2020. And, it currently has 6,000 employees – up 2,000 from last October.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The 2022 Chevy Bolt EUV may look like a larger, slightly longer Chevrolet Bolt, but under that boxy exterior lies a whole lot of tech that&#8217;s both affordable and very advanced. With the launch of the Chevy Bolt EUV, and its available suite of advanced driver assistance systems, GM is putting both advanced driver assistance technology and electric drivetrains within reach of the masses.</p>
<p>As part of GMs much-touted goal to introduce 30 new electric vehicles in the next four years, the company recently launched an updated Bolt, as well as the all-new Bolt EUV, or Electric Utility Vehicle. I had two separate opportunities to test prototypes of the Bolt EUV with GM&#8217;s advanced Super Cruise system.</p>
<p>While the Bolt and Bolt EUV share similar DNA, they are two different vehicles. The EUV is the longer and larger of the two, with more bells and whistles, like Super Cruise: An advanced driver assistance system that allows for hands-free driving on certain highways, available as a $2,200 option. Super Cruise is not available on the 2022 Bolt.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p>The Bolt EUV is powered by a 288-cell, 65-kWh battery pack that Chevy says makes 200 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque. Chevrolet estimates that the EUV will get 250 miles on a full charge, and when charging on the go, can regain up to 95 miles of range in 30 minutes on a Level 2 charger.</p>
<p>On household power, (specifically 240V) the EUV will take around 7-8 hours to charge up to 100%, which is how Chevy says it expects most consumers will power their crossover. To assist with that, Chevrolet had teamed up with home charging installer Qmerit to offer free charger installation if you buy or lease a new Bolt or EUV. Installation of a home charger can cost as much as $2,000, so it&#8217;s a decent incentive.</p>
<p>The Bolt EUV won&#8217;t get the upgraded Ultium battery pack and underlying architecture that&#8217;s coming on the Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyric and other future GM electric vehicles. Instead, the Bolt EUV is built on the BEV2 architecture, the same one on which the 2021 Bolt is built. As mentioned, it also gets Super Cruise as an optional add-on.</p>
<p>Since Super Cruise&#8217;s introduction in 2017, the system has been siloed in Cadillac products, showing up on the 2018 CT6 and finally expanding to the 2021 CT5. The Bolt EUV is the first production vehicle outside of a luxury GM brand to offer the system even as paid upgrade.</p>
<p>The Bolt EUV starts at $33,995, which is $2,500 less than the 2021 Bolt that is sitting on dealer lots today. The 2022 Chevy Bolt ($31,995) is also around $4,500 cheaper than the 2021 Bolt. Chevy&#8217;s press department says that the goal is to &#8220;make EVs attainable to everyone.&#8221; Although this is also likely an effort to bring the new vehicles in line with earlier Bolt models that qualified for the $7,500 federal tax credit. That incentive in the U.S. disappeared after GM sold 200,000 EVs nationwide.</p>
<p>The Launch Edition, which included the optional Super Cruise, a lighted charging port and special badging, carried a sticker price of $43,495. As of this writing, reservations for the Launch Edition are completely full, but you can still reserve an LT or Premier trim in the 2022 Bolt EUV. Super Cruise, however, is only available as a $2,200 option on the Premier trim, which starts at $38,495. Keep in mind, these prices are all before including any state or local tax incentives or rebates for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>In contrast, a Tesla Model Y Long Range model, the most affordable of the bunch since Tesla dropped that vehicle&#8217;s base option, starts at $41,990 before incentives. Getting Tesla&#8217;s so called Full-Self Driving feature — which is not self-driving and is actually a driver assistance system — will cost you an additional $10,000.</p>

<h2>User experience: Super Cruise</h2>
<p>Super Cruise, while impressive, tends to err on the side of caution when it comes to implementing the technology. The system allows for drivers to take their hands and feet off the controls on more than 200,000 miles of mapped divided highway all over the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can bring congestion and crashes to zero, then developing fully-autonomous driving is worth it,&#8221; Jeremy Short, the vehicle chief engineer who is responsible for the engineering, development, validation, testing and manufacturing of the Bolt EUV, said during my second time with the crossover. &#8220;The next 10 years are going to get really interesting in the autonomy space. Five years ago, would you have thought we would have what we have now with Super Cruise?&#8221;</p>
<p>That being said, Super Cruise isn&#8217;t perfect, and GM continues to iterate the product, even on the Bolt EUV. During my first drive in a Bolt EUV prototype from Marina Del Rey to Burbank and back in peak Los Angeles rush hour traffic, Super Cruise seemed a little bit &#8220;off.&#8221; The system ping-ponged in the wide lanes on the highway. When the vehicle was moving under 30 mph, the system lost track of the lane markings on mapped highways like the extremely busy 405, causing it to drift toward the other lanes and switch off a number of times.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, on a second prototype drive that followed a 50-mile loop originating in Carson, the system appeared to have gained its sea legs. However, both Short, who was following in another prototype vehicle, and I noted that Super Cruise in the EUV still had problems when traffic slowed below 10 mph. When cars ahead slowed, the EUV would slow appropriately, but then begin to drift across the lane once traffic moved forward, as if it had lost the lane markings. Eventually, the alert to take over would sound and Super Cruise would shut off.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did notice some ping-ponging at low speeds,&#8221; Short said after our drive. He then joked that it will require some more engineers driving that stretch of road to teach the system to navigate it without bouncing around the lane. He also said that speed and California&#8217;s strange concrete roadbeds (they have textured surfaces that can look like lane markings to AI) can affect Super Cruise. &#8220;Think of it like tracer fire; the more data you have coming in, the more accurate the car can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Short says that the Super Cruise system is continually learning and updating &#8212; even if it&#8217;s fully baked on vehicles like the CT5 and CT6. Every time Super Cruise is added to a new vehicle, the sensors, software and processing needs to be updated and tweaked because each car has different weights, potential speeds, dimensions, steering and braking, space for sensors and features. For example, you will be able to get a version of Super Cruise on the 2022 Cadillac Escalade which includes automatic lane changing features. The 2022 Bolt EUV, however, doesn&#8217;t get those sensors and therefore can&#8217;t automatically change lanes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each vehicle that has Super Cruise implemented has different anatomy so it needs to process and do different things,&#8221; Short said. &#8220;The Super Cruise on the Bolt EUV was developed at the same time that engineers were developing it on the Escalade. There&#8217;s very different steering and braking in each car so the two systems are different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Super Cruise qualifies as an advanced Level 2 autonomous vehicle. As the driver, you still have to remain alert, and attentive, but you can remove your hands from the steering wheel and your feet from the pedals on roads where Super Cruise is available. Sensors embedded in the steering wheel track your eyes (even at night or when you&#8217;re wearing dark sunglasses) to ensure that you are paying attention to the road ahead and not watching a movie, napping or glancing at your phone. The system doesn&#8217;t give you much leeway to take your eyes off the road while using Super Cruise, either. At 65 mph, you can reach over and change the radio station on the 10.2-inch infotainment screen but alarms will sound if you look away for more than just a few seconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were on a long drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas,&#8221; Short explained after I asked about it, &#8220;you&#8217;d essentially be a front passenger. Both you and your passenger would be looking down the road, keeping your eyes up for any potential issues. When I did that trip with a friend and used Super Cruise, I felt the same level of fatigue that he did, which is to say, not much.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The other bells and whistles</h2>
<p>We haven&#8217;t had the typical full week to test the 2022 Bolt EUV to fully evaluate. However, there was enough time to evaluate some of the vehicle&#8217;s features.</p>
<p>Chevy&#8217;s new onboard infotainment and navigation system runs on the company&#8217;s Infotainment 3 software. The system&#8217;s voice control, which has natural language processing, allowed me to do a quick search to find local charging stations.</p>
<p>The drawback? The system brought up a number of charging stations, but didn&#8217;t indicate which ones were available, in service, out of service, or if they were part of the EvGo system, the charging company that GM has partnered with. Driver&#8217;s also can&#8217;t page through results while using Super Cruise because the driver monitoring system will notice that their eyes aren&#8217;t on the road ahead.</p>
<p>In order to find EvGo chargers, owners need to use the myChevrolet App to locate the chargers and then send the directions to the navigation system. While driving, the system does lock out some features, and Short notes that you won&#8217;t be able to flip through pages of apps.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this plays out once we get more time in the EUV. That being said, it&#8217;s not likely to be as seamless as the Tesla charging experience.</p>
<p>At its core, the 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV offers some of the most advanced driver assistance technology on the market in an EV package for an attainable price. After spending two separate four-hour stints in prototype versions of the EUV, it&#8217;s clear that this compact SUV has the space, power and high-tech capability that will allow it to go head-to-head with the likes of the Tesla Model Y, Volvo&#8217;s XC40 Recharge, Ford&#8217;s Mach-E and Volkswagen&#8217;s ID.4.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and  and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> were all here to chat through the week’s rigamarole of news. <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> took some well-deserved time off, but that meant we got to poke a little fun at him and create a Special Edition segment to start off the show.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jokes aside, this week was yet another spree of creator economy, edtech, and new fund announcements, with fresh and unexpected news hailing from Natasha&#8217;s home state, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Box got a lifeline in the form of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/">$500 million check from KKR</a>, and as Danny mentions, Box CEO Aaron Levie shifts his role a bit, too.</li>
<li>Patreon, an early startup in the creator economy space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/patreon-triples-valuation-to-4-billion/">has tripled its valuation to $4 billion.</a> Another, not-so-old startup with the same reported valuation? Clubhouse. We threaded the line between the two, and gave some color on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=clubhouse+monetization+techcrunch&amp;rlz=1C5GCEA_enUS901US901&amp;oq=clubhouse+monetization+techcrunch&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3826j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">a new monetization feature</a> rolled out.</li>
<li>As an aside, looks like Clubhouse is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/twitter-said-to-have-held-acquisition-talks-with-clubhouse-on-potential-4b-deal/">everyone&#8217;s favorite app to tweet about</a> so much so that even Twitter is reportedly considering an acquisition.</li>
<li><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.axios.com/masterclass-new-funding-25-billion-valuation-f75521cd-3a85-4215-b4fa-c2ae48da9765.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;utm_source=twitter">MasterClass raising new funding at $2.5 billion valuation.</a> That is up from a $800 million valuation just last year, and shows that aspirational teaching packaged as celebrity-taught Youtube-like videos with Netflix-like quality is enough to be considered edtech.</li>
<li>Speaking of edtech, a series of exits have caught our attention. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/how-is-edtech-spending-its-extra-capital/">The consolidation has begun! </a></li>
<li>We spoke about two new funds. First, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/new-jersey-announces-10m-seed-fund-aimed-at-black-and-latinx-founders/">New Jersey is proposing a $10 million fund</a> that would go to Black and LatinX founders. Second, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/index-closes-200-million-dedicated-seed-fund-to-intensify-multi-stage-thesis/">Index raised nine-figures for seed startups,</a> beating Sequoia&#8217;s seed fund by a measly $5 million.</li>
<li>The show closed with two early-stage funding rounds you don&#8217;t want to miss &#8211; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/walnut-affirm-for-healthcare-seed/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Walnut</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/real-raises-10m-from-lightspeed-megan-rapinoe-and-others-to-rethink-therapy/">Real</a> &#8211; as well as a conversation on the future of telehealth.</li>
</ul>
<p>What a show! We&#8217;ll be back with the full trio next week, and until then, stay safe and thank you for listening.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For years now, a growing number of tech companies &#8212; large and small &#8212; have either relocated their headquarters to Austin or opened another office or campus in the Texas capital. They&#8217;ve been drawn to the city for a number of factors, including its laid-back lifestyle, no state tax, a business-friendly environment and lower cost of living (for now).</p>
<p>The impact on the city’s startup ecosystem is noticeable in the growing number of entrepreneurs (many of whom worked at some of the tech giants who have a big presence in the city) and investors calling Austin home.</p>
<p>Most recently, Tesla’s plans to build a gigafactory in the city and Oracle’s announcement that it was relocating its headquarters here have made national headlines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The comparisons to the Bay Area abound &#8212; from the burgeoning and maturing startup scene to an overheated and competitive housing market.</p>
<p>All the while, venture capitalists see several key areas of opportunities. At one point, Austin was once a big enterprise software city. While software is still big here, a number of other sectors are growing including CPG (consumer packaged goods) and real estate tech, among others.</p>
<p>What follows is a survey of some of the top VCs in the city and their projections about the growth of Austin’s ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s who we spoke to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eric Engineer, S3 Ventures</li>
<li>Morgan Flager, Silverton Partners</li>
<li>Joshua Baer, Capital Factory</li>
<li><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Answer by Unorthodox Ventures Founding Contrarian Carey Smith\n\nWho knows? The problem with prognosticating is there’s never any follow up. “Futurists” spin predictions, and the public consumes them like cotton candy, and no one bothers to check back years later and see how accurate they were. It’s hard enough just to characterize the scene as it is right now. There are so many companies of so many different sizes doing so many different things, and there isn’t really a unifying characteristic beyond growth and innovation. It really could go any direction.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:513,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0}">Carey Smith, Unorthodox Ventures</span></li>
<li>Krishna Srinivasan, LiveOak Venture Partners</li>
<li>Zaz Floreani,<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Next Coast Ventures</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Where do you see Austin's startup scene five years from now? The city has attracted a wide range of people over the years, including more big tech and startups very recently. How will it add up to something more than the sum of the parts? &quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:513,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0}"><strong>Where do you see Austin&#8217;s startup scene five years from now?

					<description><![CDATA[Bucky Moore, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, gives founders tactical advice on the process of raising a Series A round.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During a seed funding round, a founder needs to convince a venture capital investor on a vision. But during a Series A fundraise, napkin-stage ideas don’t make the cut — a founder needs product progress, numbers, and revenue (or at least a plan to eventually generate some).</p>
<p>In many ways, the stakes are higher for a Series A — and Bucky Moore, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, joined <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/early-stage-2021/">TechCrunch Early Stage</a> last week to give founders tactical advice on the process of raising one.</p>
<p>Moore spoke about storytelling over semantics, pricing, and where his firm sees itself “raising the bar” for startups.</p>
<p>Here are a few key points; a full video and a transcript of the entire conversation are linked at the bottom.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Explain to investors why you are raising now</h2>
<p>More companies will raise seed rounds than Series A rounds, simply due to the fact that many startups fail, and venture only makes sense for a small fraction of businesses out there. Every check is a new cycle of convincing and proving that you, as a startup, will have venture-scale returns. Moore explained that startups looking to move to their next round need to explain to investors why now is their moment.</p>
<blockquote><p>The way I think about “why now” is [that] it is an opportunity for you as a founder to convey a unique insight and understanding of your market opportunity, the history of the space that you&#8217;re in, why companies have succeeded or failed in that space, historically speaking, and what are the known challenges from a go-to-market perspective; what headwinds will you be up against at a macro level. These are all things that I think people like me get really excited about when hearing unique insight from founders, because it suggests that they&#8217;ve really studied their market opportunity, and they understand it. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 2:19)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<p>This is where bootstrapping French startup, <a href="https://nlpcloud.io">NLPCloud.io</a>, is plying a trade in MLOps/AIOps &#8212; or &#8216;compute platform as a service&#8217; (being as it runs the queries on its own servers) &#8212; with a focus on natural language processing (NLP), as its name suggests.</p>
<p>Developments in artificial intelligence have, in recent years, led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/17/openai-text-generator-dangerous/">impressive advances in the field of NLP</a> &#8212; a technology that can help businesses scale their capacity to intelligently grapple with all sorts of communications by automating tasks like Named Entity Recognition, sentiment-analysis, text classification, summarization, question answering, and Part-Of-Speech tagging, freeing up (human) staff to focus on more complex/nuanced work. (Although it&#8217;s worth emphasizing that the bulk of NLP research has focused on the English language &#8212; meaning that&#8217;s where this tech is most mature; so associated AI advances are not universally distributed.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Production ready (pre-trained) NLP models for English are readily available &#8216;out of the box&#8217;. There are also dedicated open source frameworks offering help with training models. But businesses wanting to tap into NLP still need to have the DevOps resource and chops to implement NLP models.</p>
<p>NLPCloud.io is catering to businesses that don&#8217;t feel up to the implementation challenge themselves &#8212; offering &#8220;production-ready NLP API&#8221; with the promise of &#8220;no DevOps required&#8221;.</p>
<p>Its API is based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/hugging-face-raises-40-million-for-its-natural-language-processing-library/">Hugging Face</a> and <a href="https://spacy.io">spaCy</a> open-source models. Customers can either choose to use ready-to-use pre-trained models (it selects the &#8220;best&#8221; open source models; it does not build its own); or they can upload custom models developed internally by their own data scientists &#8212; which it says is a point of differentiation vs SaaS services such as Google Natural Language (which uses Google&#8217;s ML models) or Amazon Comprehend and Monkey Learn.</p>
<p>NLPCloud.io says it wants to democratize NLP by helping developers and data scientists deliver these projects &#8220;in no time and at a fair price&#8221;. (It has a tiered <a href="https://nlpcloud.io/#plans">pricing model</a> based on requests per minute, which starts at $39pm and ranges up to $1,199pm, at the enterprise end, for one custom model running on a GPU. It does also offer a free tier so users can test models at low request velocity without incurring a charge.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea came from the fact that, as a software engineer, I saw many AI projects fail because of the deployment to production phase,&#8221; says sole founder and CTO Julien Salinas. &#8220;Companies often focus on building accurate and fast AI models but today more and more excellent open-source models are available and are doing an excellent job&#8230; so the toughest challenge now is being able to efficiently use these models in production. It takes AI skills, DevOps skills, programming skill&#8230; which is why it&#8217;s a challenge for so many companies, and which is why I decided to launch NLPCloud.io.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform launched in January 2021 and now has around 500 users, including 30 who are paying for the service. While the startup, which is based in Grenoble, in the French Alps, is a team of three for now, plus a couple of independent contractors. (Salinas says he plans to hire five people by the end of the year.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of our users are tech startups but we also start having a couple of bigger companies,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The biggest demand I&#8217;m seeing is both from software engineers and data scientists. Sometimes it&#8217;s from teams who have data science skills but don&#8217;t have DevOps skills (or don&#8217;t want to spend time on this). Sometimes it&#8217;s from tech teams who want to leverage NLP out-of-the-box without hiring a whole data science team.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have very diverse customers, from solo startup founders to bigger companies like BBVA, Mintel, Senuto&#8230; in all sorts of sectors (banking, public relations, market research),&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Use cases of its customers include lead generation from unstructured text (such as web pages), via named entities extraction; and sorting support tickets based on urgency by conducting sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>Content marketers are also using its platform for headline generation (via summarization). While text classification capabilities are being used for economic intelligence and financial data extraction, per Salinas.</p>
<p>He says his own experience as a CTO and software engineer working on NLP projects at a number of tech companies led him to spot an opportunity in the challenge of AI implementation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realized that it was quite easy to build acceptable NLP models thanks to great open-source frameworks like spaCy and Hugging Face Transformers but then I found it quite hard to use these models in production,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;It takes programming skills in order to develop an API, strong DevOps skills in order to build a robust and fast infrastructure to serve NLP models (AI models in general consume a lot of resources), and also data science skills of course.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to look for ready-to-use cloud solutions in order to save weeks of work but I couldn&#8217;t find anything satisfactory. My intuition was that such a platform would help tech teams save a lot of time, sometimes months of work for the teams who don&#8217;t have strong DevOps profiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;NLP has been around for decades but until recently it took whole teams of data scientists to build acceptable NLP models. For a couple of years, we&#8217;ve made amazing progress in terms of accuracy and speed of the NLP models. More and more experts who have been working in the NLP field for decades agree that NLP is becoming a &#8216;commodity&#8217;,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;Frameworks like spaCy make it extremely simple for developers to leverage NLP models without having advanced data science knowledge. And Hugging Face&#8217;s open-source repository for NLP models is also a great step in this direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;But having these models run in production is still hard, and maybe even harder than before as these brand new models are very demanding in terms of resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>The models NLPCloud.io offers are picked for performance &#8212; where &#8220;best&#8221; means it has &#8220;the best compromise between accuracy and speed&#8221;. Salinas also says they are paying mind to context, given NLP can be used for diverse user cases &#8212; hence proposing number of models so as to be able to adapt to a given use.</p>
<p>&#8220;Initially we started with models dedicated to entities extraction only but most of our first customers also asked for other use cases too, so we started adding other models,&#8221; he notes, adding that they will continue to add more models from the two chosen frameworks &#8212; &#8220;in order to cover more use cases, and more languages&#8221;.</p>
<p>SpaCy and Hugging Face, meanwhile, were chosen to be the source for the models offered via its API based on their track record as companies, the NLP libraries they offer and their focus on production-ready framework &#8212; with the combination allowing NLPCloud.io to offer a selection of models that are fast and accurate, working within the bounds of respective trade-offs, according to Salinas.</p>
<p>&#8220;SpaCy is developed by a solid company in Germany called Explosion.ai. This library has become one of the most used NLP libraries among companies who want to leverage NLP in production &#8216;for real&#8217; (as opposed to academic research only). The reason is that it is very fast, has great accuracy in most scenarios, and is an opinionated&#8221; framework which makes it very simple to use by non-data scientists (the tradeoff is that it gives less customization possibilities),&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/hugging-face-raises-15-million-to-build-the-definitive-natural-language-processing-library/">Hugging Face</a> is an even more solid company that <a title="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/hugging-face-raises-40-million-for-its-natural-language-processing-library/" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/hugging-face-raises-40-million-for-its-natural-language-processing-library/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/hugging-face-raises-40-million-for-its-natural-language-processing-library/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618050204207000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmZDvxn9bG1Q7PE1ap2fYv2iJmDw">recently raised $40M</a> for a good reason: They created a disruptive NLP library called &#8216;transformers&#8217; that improves a lot the accuracy of NLP models (the tradeoff is that it is very resource intensive though). It gives the opportunity to cover more use cases like sentiment analysis, classification, summarization&#8230; In addition to that, they created an open-source repository where it is easy to select the best model you need for your use case.&#8221;</p>
<p>While AI is advancing at a clip within certain tracks &#8212; such as NLP for English &#8212; there are still caveats and potential pitfalls attached to automating language processing and analysis, with the risk of getting stuff wrong or worse. AI models trained on human-generated data have, for example, been shown reflecting embedded biases and prejudices of the people who produced the underlying data.</p>
<p>Salinas agrees NLP can sometimes face &#8220;concerning bias issues&#8221;, such as racism and misogyny. But he expresses confidence in the models they&#8217;ve selected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the time it seems [bias in NLP] is due to the underlying data used to trained the models. It shows we should be more careful about the origin of this data,&#8221; he says. &#8220;In my opinion the best solution in order to mitigate this is that the community of NLP users should actively report something inappropriate when using a specific model so that this model can be paused and fixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if we doubt that such a bias exists in the models we&#8217;re proposing, we do encourage our users to report such problems to us so we can take measures,&#8221; he adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://vybecard.com">Vybe</a> has raised a $2.9 million funding round (€2.4 million) to build a challenger bank for teens. The company is currently testing its product with a soft launch. Users get a Mastercard payment card paired with an e-wallet.</p>
<p>Each Vybe account comes with its own IBAN so that users can send and receive money. If you want to open an account and you are younger than 18 years old, you have to go through the KYC process (know your identity) with your parent.</p>
<p>As for parents, they can set up some limits on card payments or even block the card. Parents also can view transactions. The startup plans to generate revenue from interchange fees as well as partner with brands and offer a reward system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Vybe isn’t technically live, the company has attracted 375,000 downloads. Overall, 260,000 teens have preordered a card already. Thousands of cards have been delivered and the first metrics are encouraging. Early adopters tend to use their card once every two days.</p>
<p>Today’s fund is a round extension from existing investors. Investors include Ronan Le Moal (the former CEO of Crédit Mutuel Arkéa), Kick Club and Manoel Amorim.</p>

<p>Banking products for teenagers are a lucrative segment. In France, there are several companies trying to position themselves on this segment, such as <a href="https://www.kard.eu">Kard</a>, <a href="https://www.pixpay.fr">PixPay</a> and <a href="https://www.xaalys.com">Xaalys</a>. Most of these companies charge a subscription fee to access the service.</p>
<p>Other fintech companies that aren’t specifically targeting young people could also work well with teenagers. For instance, young users can open a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/revolut-launches-revolut-junior-to-help-you-manage-allowance/">Revolut Junior</a> or <a href="https://lydia-app.com">Lydia</a> account and receive money from their parents.</p>
<p>In the U.S., startups offering debit cards for children are about to reach unicorn status. As The Information’s Kate Clark <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/kid-debit-card-startup-greenlight-valued-at-2-billion-in-andreessen-led-round">reported</a>, <a href="https://www.greenlightcard.com">Greenlight</a>, <a href="https://current.com">Current</a> and <a href="https://www.step.com">Step</a> are all raising new funding rounds with a valuation between $1 billion and $2 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The office shut-down at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic last year spurred huge investment in digital transformation and a wave of tech companies helping with that, but there were some distinct losers in the shift, too &#8212; specifically those whose business models were predicated on serving the very offices that disappeared overnight. Today, one of the companies that had to make an immediate pivot to keep itself afloat is announcing a round of funding, after finding itself not just growing at a clip, but making a profit, as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.snackmagic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SnackMagic</a>, a build-your-own snack box service, has raised $15 million in a Series A round of funding led by Craft Ventures, with Luxor Capital also participating.</p>
<p>(Both investors have an interesting track record in the food-on-demand space: Most recently, Luxor co-led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$528 million round in Glovo in Spain</a>, while Craft backs/has backed the likes of Cloud Kitchens, Postmates and <a href="https://www.craftventures.com/portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many more</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding comes on the back of a strong year for the company, which hit a $20 million revenue run rate in eight months and turned profitable in December 2020.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Shaunak Amin said in an interview that the plan will be to use the funding both to continue growing SnackMagic&#8217;s existing business, as well as extend into other kinds of gifting categories. Currently, you can ship snacks anywhere in the world, but the customizable boxes &#8212; recipients are gifted an amount that they can spend, and they choose what they want in the box themselves from <a href="https://www.snackmagic.com/menu/featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SnackMagic&#8217;s menu</a>, or one that a business has created and branded as a subset of that &#8212; are only available in locations in North America, serviced by SnackMagic&#8217;s primary warehouse. Other locations are given options of pre-packed boxes of snacks right now, but the plan is to slowly extend its pick-and-mix model to more geographies, starting with the U.K.</p>
<p>Alongside this, the company plans to continue widening the categories of items that people can gift each other beyond chocolates, chips, hot sauces and other fun food items, into areas like alcohol, meal kits and nonfood items. There&#8217;s also scope for expanding to more use cases into areas like corporate gifting, marketing and consumer services, as well as analytics coming out of its sales.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spain&#8217;s Glovo picks up $528M as Europe&#8217;s food delivery market continues to heat up&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/embed/#?secret=0ChlxZslt1" data-secret="0ChlxZslt1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Amin calls the data that SnackMagic is amassing about customer interest in different brands and products &#8220;the hidden gem&#8221; of the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the most interesting things,&#8221; he said. Brands that want to add their items to the wider pool of products &#8212; which today numbers between 700 and 800 items &#8212; also get access to a dashboard where they monitor what&#8217;s selling, how much stock is left of their own items, and so on. &#8220;One thing that is very opaque [in the CPG world] is good data.&#8221;</p>
<p>For many of the bigger companies that lack their own direct sales channels, it&#8217;s a significantly richer data set than what they typically get from selling items in the average brick and mortar store, or from a bigger online retailer like Amazon. &#8220;All these bigger brands like Pepsi and Kellogg not only want to know this about their own products more but also about the brands they are trying to buy,&#8221; Amin said. Several of them, he added, have approached his company to partner and invest, so I guess we should watch this space.</p>
<p>SnackMagic&#8217;s success comes from a somewhat unintended, unlikely beginning, and it&#8217;s a testament to the power of compelling, yet extensible technology that can be scaled and repurposed if necessary. In its case, there is personalization technology, logistics management, product inventory and accounting, and lots of data analytics involved.</p>
<p>The company started out as Stadium, a lunch delivery service in New York City that was leveraging the fact that when co-workers ordered lunch or dinner together for the office &#8212; say around a team-building event or a late-night working session, or just for a regular work day &#8212; oftentimes they found that people all hankered for different things to eat.</p>
<p>In many cases, people typically make separate orders for the different items, but that also means if you are ordering to all eat together, things would not arrive at the same time; if it&#8217;s being expensed, it&#8217;s more complicated on that front too; and if you&#8217;re thinking about carbon footprints, it might also mean a lot less efficiency on that front too.</p>
<p>Stadium&#8217;s solution was a platform that provided access to multiple restaurants&#8217; menus, and people could pick from all of them for a single order. The business had been operating for six years and was really starting to take off.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were quite well known in the city, and we had plans to expand, and we were on track for March 2020 being our best month ever,&#8221; Amin said. Then, COVID-19 hit. &#8220;There was no one left in the office,&#8221; he said. Revenue disappeared overnight, since the idea of delivering many items to one place instantly stopped being a need.</p>
<p>Amin said that they took a look at the platform they had built to pick many options (and many different costs, and the accounting that came with that) and thought about how to use that for a different end. It turned out that even with people working remotely, companies wanted to give props to their workers, either just to say hello and thanks, or around a specific team event, in the form of food and treats &#8212; all the more so since the supply of snacks you typically come across in so many office canteens and kitchens were no longer there for workers to tap.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting, but perhaps also unsurprising, that one of the by-products of our new way of working has been the rise of more services that cater (no pun intended) to people working in more decentralised ways, and that companies exploring how to improve rewarding people in those environments are also seeing a bump.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, we wrote about a company called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/alyce-an-ai-based-personalised-corporate-gifting-startup-raises-30m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alyce raising $30 million for its corporate gifting platform</a> that is also based on personalization &#8212; using AI to help understand the interests of the recipient to make better choices of items that a person might want to receive.</p>
<p>Alyce is taking a somewhat different approach than SnackMagic: it&#8217;s not holding any products itself, and there is no warehouse but rather a platform that links buyers with those providing products. And Alyce&#8217;s initial audience is different, too: instead of internal employees (the first, but not final, focus for SnackMagic) it is targeting corporate gifting, or presents that sales and marketing people might send to prospects or current clients as a please and thank you gesture.</p>

<p>But you can also see how and where the two might meet in the middle &#8212; and compete not just with each other, but the many other online retailers, Amazon and otherwise, plus the consumer goods companies themselves looking for ways of diversifying business by extending beyond the B2C channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don’t worry about Amazon. We just get better,&#8221; Amin said when I asked him about whether he worried that SnackMagic was too easy to replicate. &#8220;It might be tough anyway,&#8221; he added, since &#8220;others might have the snacks but picking and packing and doing individual customization is very different from regular e-commerce. It&#8217;s really more like scalable gifting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investors are impressed with the quick turnaround and identification of a market opportunity, and how it quickly retooled its tech to make it fit for purpose.</p>
<p>“SnackMagic’s immediate success was due to an excellent combination of timing, innovative thinking and world-class execution,” said Bryan Rosenblatt, principal investor at Craft Ventures, in a statement. “As companies embrace the future of a flexible workplace, SnackMagic is not just a snack box delivery platform but a company culture builder.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Corporate catering company <a href="https://www.elior.fr">Elior</a> has acquired French startup <a href="https://nestorparis.com">Nestor</a> for an undisclosed amount. Nestor originally started with a simple idea to differentiate itself from food delivery giants, such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and others.</p>
<p>Every day, the startup offered a single menu for lunch. If you liked what was on the menu, you could order and get it delivered 10 to 20 minutes later. By offering a single menu, a delivery person could deliver several clients in a single ride. Similarly, by managing its own kitchen, Nestor could improve its margins as it didn’t have to pay third-party restaurants.</p>
<p>Since I first covered Nestor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/30/nestor-focuses-on-delivering-lunch-for-office-workers-in-paris/">in 2016</a>, the company has been capital efficient and mostly focused on this unique product offering. Elior says that Nestor managed to reach 10,000 meals per week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the past few months, Nestor has tried to launch new offers. For instance, companies can switch to Nestor for their canteens. The startup delivers meals in fridges directly. It reminds me of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/foodles-raises-another-10-million-for-its-cloud-canteen/">Foodles</a>, another French startup focused on canteen-like services.</p>

<p>Nestor can also deliver individually packed lunches in case you are spending the day with some clients for a big meeting. <a href="https://popchef.com">Popchef</a> has also pivoted to focus more on that segment.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition, Nestor is going to focus more and more on the B2B market. While Elior is working with big companies in glass towers, it has been quite hard to convince small and medium companies to open a canteen in the office.</p>
<p>The sales pitch could be summed up in two sentences. Nestor clients don’t need to have their own kitchen as everything is prepared in advance. And employees don’t have to browse Deliveroo at lunch time to find something that isn’t a burger or a pizza.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.iyunomg.com/">Iyuno-SDI Group</a>, a provider of translated subtitles and other media localization services, announced today it has raised $160 million in funding from SoftBank Vision Fund 2. The company said this makes the fund one of its largest shareholders.</p>
<p>Iyuno-SDI Group was formed after Iyuno Media Group <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iyuno-completes-acquisition-of-sdi-media-and-announces-new-company-as-iyuno-sdi-group-301256565.html">completed its acquisition of SDI Media last month</a>. In a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/how-localization-leader-iyuno-media-group-opens-entertainment-to-international-audiences/">recent interview with TechCrunch</a>, Iyuno-SDI Group chief executive officer David Lee, who launched Iyuno in 2002 while he was an undergraduate in Seoul, described how the company&#8217;s proprietary cloud-based enterprise resource planning software allows it to perform localization services — including subtitles, dubbing and accessibility features — at scale.</p>

<p>Iyuno also built its own neural machine translation engines, trained on data from specific entertainment genres, to help its human translators work more quickly. The company’s clients have included Netflix, Apple iTunes, DreamWorks, HBO and Entertainment One.</p>
<p>Now that its merger is complete, Iyuno-SDI Group operates a combined 67 offices in 34 countries, and is able to perform localization services in more than 100 languages.</p>
<p>SoftBank Group <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/iyuno-media-group-series-a--2d6e9d8c">first invested in Iyuno Media Group through SoftBank Ventures Asia</a>, its venture capital arm, in 2018. SoftBank Vision Fund 2 will join Lee and investors Altor, Shamrock Capital Advisors and SoftBank Ventures Asia Corporation on Iyuno-SDI Group’s board of directors.</p>
