										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber and Kia Europe are teaming up to offer drivers in 20 European markets deals on buying, leasing, financing or renting Kia’s e-Niro and e-Soul, the latest move by the ride-hailing giant to achieve its emissions goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber has committed to being a zero-emission mobility platform across Europe by 2030, and hopes to get up to 30,000 Uber drivers into Kia’s BEV range by the same year. Kia is the latest in Uber&#8217;s collection of automakers offerings its drivers discounted rates on electric cars. In May, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/uber-and-arrival-partner-to-create-an-ev-for-ride-hail-drivers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber also announced a partnership with EV manufacturer Arrival</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create a purpose-built electric car for ride-hail drivers, and in September 2020, </span><a href="https://plants.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2020/sep/0908-uber.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber partnered with GM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to give Canadian and American drivers discounts to the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent legislation adopted by the European Union aims to </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56828383"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cut carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, compared to 1990 levels. Uber&#8217;s partnership with Kia anticipates increasingly strict emissions regulations around the continent. To keep up, Uber is also targeting to have more than 100,000 electric vehicles across its European platform by 2025 and 50% of miles driven in Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Lisbon, London, Madrid and Paris to be in zero-emissions vehicles. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Kia hopes to use this partnership to popularize its BEVs as it prepares to launch 11 new electric models by 2026. The e-Niro crossover has 239 miles of range and a lithium-ion battery that charges in 54 minutes up to 80% on a DC fast charger. The e-Soul subcompact crossover, with a cute and boxy exterior, offers up to 243 miles of range on a full charge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even with the discounts, the Kia models that are currently on offer on </span><a href="https://www.uber-vs.com/gb/en/locations/london/#kia"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PartnerPoint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Uber’s portal for London-based drivers shopping around for EVs, are still quite pricey. Kia is giving drivers a discount of around 8% on its vehicles to finance, as opposed to an average of 13% from Nissan and even 22% with Hyundai. That means Kia&#8217;s vehicles a cost between £29,877.40 ($42,15432) and £36,471.40 ($51,457.86), which is around the same price as, if not more than a </span><a href="https://uk.talent.com/salary?job=uber+driver#:~:text=The%20average%20uber%20driver%20salary%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20is,to%20%C2%A355%2C900%20per%20year."><span style="font-weight: 400;">London driver’s annual salary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Despite this, it seems drivers are taking advantage of the discounts and other incentives, like 5% financing interest rates and the <span style="font-weight: 400;">the <a href="https://www.uber.com/gb/en/u/ride-journey-to-electric/">Clean Air Fee</a>, which collects 3 pence (4 cents) per ride to put towards the cost of an EV and has saved London drivers an average of £3,000 ($4,233), according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In London, more than 3.5 million trips have taken place in fully electric vehicles since the launch of the Clean Air Plan in 2019, according to Uber. Some 50% of new cars joining the platform in London are now fully electric, compared to 8% of new vehicles in wider markets. Over the past year, the number of EVs on Uber’s platform has jumped from 700 to 2,100, and Uber wants to double that by the end of the year.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this announcement, Uber also said it plans to continue expansion of Uber Green, which allows riders to request a lower emissions vehicle and drivers to get a reduced 15% service fee for each Uber Green trip, across Europe to 60 cities by the end of the year. This feature is currently only available for any London rider starting their trip inside Zone 1, but Uber says now is a good time for drivers to take advantage of lower running costs and greater earning potential through the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber drivers in Europe can find information about EV offers through the driver app, direct mail and driver webinars, the company said. Prices for vehicles won’t vary depending on driver location. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the gig economy came the need for ID verification, thus startups like OnFido (raised $188.8 million) appeared, alongside several others. But this sector is by no means ‘done’ yet.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://ocrlabs.com/">OCR Labs</a>, which emerged from Australia, has announced a €12.5M / $15 million Series A funding round led by Turkish investors Oyak Group, to expand its services and team to the UK, Turkey and Europe. Halkin Ventures invested in its seed round. The startup specializes in digital ID verification, customer onboarding, identity fraud, and regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>OCR Labs, founded in 2018 by Daniel Aiello and Matthew Adams, says its technology uses &#8220;five proprietary technologies in one solution, including identity document optical character recognition (OCR), document fraud assessment, liveness detection, video fraud assessment, and face matching”. This supports AML and KYC regulations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Daniel Aiello, Co-Founder, and CPO of OCR Labs, commented, “The need for digital verification is growing exponentially. This past year we’ve seen more demand from new sectors as they try to navigate the pandemic and an inability to operate in person&#8230;No one wants to spend hours trying to prove who they are, whether it’s for a job or for a bank account, and we also want to know we’re protected against identity theft and fraud. Digital ID verification has a key role to play, but this year we’ve also seen the limitations if hybrid models are used. People are a barrier and a risk, but fully automated technology can have a huge impact on many industries and privacy. OCR Labs is built to be secure, frictionless and fast, and capable of recognizing ID documents the world over.”</p>
<p>OCR Labs is used by recruitment business REED in the UK. Russ Cohn, an early member of the Google UK leadership team, has been appointed OCR&#8217;s General Manager of International Operations, based out of London.</p>
<p>Cohn commented: “The technology that Matt and Dan have created is completely automated, so it doesn&#8217;t rely on any humans behind the scenes. That&#8217;s very key at the moment. We’ve seen how COVID has impacted having that hybrid solution, so automation increases the speed and delivery of the technology to our users… A lot of competitors outsource and use different vendors to put together a solution.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite the pandemic’s economic impact, Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystem has proven to be very resilient. In fact, a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lhxlufo5lQaAtSOrzwWz5986e0L1eIJz/view">new report</a> from investment firm Golden Gate Ventures predicts a record number of exits will happen in the region over the next couple of years, thanks to factors like a maturing ecosystem, more secondary buyers and the emergence of SPACs.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s comprehensive <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lhxlufo5lQaAtSOrzwWz5986e0L1eIJz/view">“Southeast Asia Exit Landscape Report 2.0,”</a> is a followup to a <a href="https://www.insead.edu/sites/default/files/assets/dept/centres/gpei/docs/golden-gate-ventures-insead-sea-exit-landscape.pdf">previous report </a>published in 2019.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights from the latest report, along with additional insight from Golden Gate Ventures partner Michael Lints, its lead author. For both reports, Golden Gate Ventures partnered with business school INSEAD to survey general and limited partners in the region. It also draws on Golden Gate Ventures’ proprietary database, which dates back to 2012 and tracks information like the time between funding rounds and fundraising success rates, as well as public databases, reports and expert commentary from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The overall exit landscape</h2>
<p>Despite the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact, tech proved to be resilient globally (for example, there were a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/as-tech-stocks-rally-bring-on-the-ipos">number of initial public offers</a> in the United States at record prices). While Southeast Asia’s tech ecosystem is relatively younger, Lints told TechCrunch its resiliency was driven by companies founded years ago that suddenly saw an increase in demand for their services because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“We’ve built infrastructure over the past eight to nine years, when it comes to e-commerce, logistics, some on the healthcare side as well, and when the pandemic happened, people were suddenly stuck at home,” Lints said. He added “If you look at the pickup for most of the e-commerce companies, they at least doubled their revenue. For last-mile logistics companies, they’ve increased their revenue. There was a lot of pickup on the digital healthcare side as well.”</p>
<p>While tech fared well compare to many other industries, one downside was that the COVID-19 pandemic caused overall global venture capital investment to decline. Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystem was not immune, and had less exits, but it still did relatively well, with $8.2 billion invested in 2020, according to a report by Cento Ventures and Tech In Asia.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Grab to go public in the US following $40 billion SPAC deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/grab-to-go-public-in-the-us-following-40-billion-spac-deal/embed/#?secret=v54wnBFI5R" data-secret="v54wnBFI5R" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It’s important to note that more than half of that funding was raised in very large rounds by unicorns like Grab, Go-jek and Traveloka, but Cento Ventures found there was also an increase in investments between $50 million to $100 million for other startups. These are usually Series B and C rounds, which Golden Gate Ventures says creates a strong pipeline for potential exits over the next three to four years.</p>
<p>“If you go back even just two years, the amount of B rounds that are happening now, I’ve never seen that number before. It’s a definite increase,” said Lints.</p>
<p>Investments are also continuing to flow into Southeast Asia. According to the report, there was $6 billion of funding in just the first quarter of 2021 (based on data from DealStreet Asia, PWC and Genesis Ventures), making it the strongest start to a year in the region’s history.</p>
<p>This bodes well for the possibility of mergers and acquisitions in 2021. The report found that there were less exits in 2019 and 2020 than in 2018, but not just because of the pandemic—many startups wanted to remain venture-backed for longer. Golden Gate Ventures expects M&amp;A activity will pick up again. In 2021, it forecasts acquisition deals worth more than $30 million, large mergers and an increase in SPACs.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s in the pipeline</h2>
<p>Golden Gate Ventures predicts that a total of 468 startup exits will happen between 2020 and 2022, compared to the 412 forecast in the previous edition of its report. This is due to more late-stage private equity investors, including secondary buyers, SPACs and a welcoming public market.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6oEXfjMQ3x"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/the-roadmap-to-startup-consolidation-in-southeast-asia-is-becoming-clearer/">The roadmap to startup consolidation in Southeast Asia is becoming clearer</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The roadmap to startup consolidation in Southeast Asia is becoming clearer&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/the-roadmap-to-startup-consolidation-in-southeast-asia-is-becoming-clearer/embed/#?secret=6oEXfjMQ3x" data-secret="6oEXfjMQ3x" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lints said secondary buyers will include a mix of family offices, conglomerates and venture funds that want a higher allocation in a company or to pre-empt a forthcoming round.</p>
<p>“What I think is interesting is some of the later-stage funds, so private equity funds, and not only ones that are in Southeast Asia, but even foreign ones, are now looking to get a position in companies that they assume will be able to raise a Series D or Series E over the next few years. That’s something I haven’t seen before, it’s relatively new in the market,” he added.</p>
<p>Golden Gate Ventures expects M&amp;A activity to continue being the main way Southeast Asian startups exit, potentially accounting for up to 80% of deals, followed by secondary sales (15%) and IPOs (5%).</p>
<p>In fact, there was a record number of M&amp;A deals in 2020, despite the pandemic. Golden Gate Ventures estimates that 45 deals happened, especially in e-commerce, fintech, media, adtech and social networking, as larger companies acquired startups to grow their tech stacks.</p>
<p>More companies going public will create a cascading effect through Southeast Asia’s ecosystem. The report forecasts that companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/02/grab-buys-kudo/)Grab, (https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/18/gojek-coins-ph-philippines/">Gojek</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/singapore-based-retail-analytics-company-trax-raises-640m-series-e-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2-and-blackrock">Trax</a>, who have already made several high-profile acquisitions, will continue buying startups if they list publicly and have more liquidity.</p>
<h2>Series B and C deals</h2>
<p>While there will be more exits, there are also more opportunities for companies to raise larger later-stage rounds to stay private, if they want to—a sign of Southeast Asia’s maturing ecosystem, said Lints.</p>
<p>As the pandemic unfolded in 2020, the number of pre-seed and seed deals fell. On the other hand, the report found that it became quicker for startups to raise Series B or C rounds, or less than 21 months on average.</p>
<p>“If you look at typical exits between 2015 to 2017, you could argue that some of those exits might have been too early because the company was still in a growth trajectory, but there was hardly any follow-on funding for them to expand to a new country, for instance, or build out a new product,” said Lints. “So their only revenue to raise money was to be acquired by a larger company so they could keep building the product.”</p>
<p>“I think now you’re able to raise that Series C round, which allows you to expand the company and stay private, as opposed to having to drive towards an exit,” he added. “I think that shows the maturity of the ecosystem now and, again, it’s a huge advantage because founders have these amazing things they want to build, and now actually have the capital to do so and to really try to compete, and that has definitely been a big change.”</p>
<p>Another good thing is that the increase in later-stage funding does not appear to be creating a pre-seed and seed funding gap. This is partly because early employees from mature companies that have raised massive rounds often branch out and become founders themselves. As they launch startups, they have the benefit of being familiar with how fundraising works and a network. For example, a significant number of alumni from <a href="https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/alumni-of-tech-companies-pushing-southeast-asias-next-wave-of-entrepreneurship">Grab, Gojek and Lazada have gone on to found companies</a>.</p>
<p>“They seem to be raising a lot faster, and I think the second thing that’s happening across the board is we’re seeing more scouts putting really early checks into companies,” said Lints. “My assumption is if you look at the Series A pipeline, which is still pretty long, that has to come from a large number of pre-seed and seed deals.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Singapore is poised to become Asia&#8217;s Silicon Valley&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/singapore-is-poised-to-become-asias-silicon-valley/embed/#?secret=0a2b5HcCBq" data-secret="0a2b5HcCBq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Funds want to cash out</h2>
<p>Another factor that may drive an increase in exits—especially M&amp;A deals—are funds that have reached the point where they want to cash out. Golden Gate Ventures’ 2019 report forecast that the first batch of institutional venture funds launched in 2010 to 2012 will start reaching the end of their lifecycle in 2020. This means the general partners of these funds are exploring exit opportunities for their portfolios, leading to an increase in secondary and M&amp;A deals.</p>
<p>This in turn will increase the number of secondary markets, which have typically been low in Southeast Asia. The original investors won’t necessarily push for portfolio companies to sell themselves, but instead look at secondary buyers who might be keen on mergers and M&amp;A deals.</p>
<p>“The thing we’ve seen over the last 18 months is there’s been a larger pickup in the secondary markets, where later-stage investors, in some cases family-owned businesses or family offices, are looking to get access to deals that were started eight, nine or 10 years ago. You’ll see the cap tables of these companies change, and that does mean the founders will have different shareholders,” said Lints.</p>
<p>“These are typically for companies that are performing well, where you can foresee that they will be able to fundraise within the next 12 months. For the ones that are in a more difficult position, I think it’s going to be tricky,” he added. “When you have a portfolio of companies as a fund, that doesn’t necessarily mean that you can sell all 20 of them, so I think for some founders, the impact will be that they will need to make a decision to continue the business and buy back the shares their investors are holding, or are they going to liquidate the business or look for a trade sale.”</p>
<h2>SPAC opportunities</h2>
<p>The biggest SPAC news in Southeast Asia was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/grab-to-go-public-in-the-us-following-40-billion-spac-deal/"> Grab’s announcement it will go public in the United States following a $40 billion SPAC deal</a>. Lints expects more Southeast Asian companies to take the SPAC route when going public. Not only does the process give them more flexibility, but for startups that want to list in the U.S., working with a SPAC can help them.</p>
<p>“My guess is with New York allowing direct listings, I think more and more people will shy away from the traditional IPO route and look at what is the fastest and most flexible way to list on a stock exchange. For Southeast Asia, listing has never been easy, so I think SPACs will definitely open the floodgates,” said Lints.</p>
<p>Barriers not only include regulatory filings, pre-IPO roadshows and high costs, but also “concern whether the international retail investor or public markets actually understand these companies in Southeast Asia,” he added. “If you have a very strong sponsor team that is running the SPAC, they can be super helpful in positioning the company, doing the marketing and getting interest from the market as well.”</p>
<p>Both the <a href="https://www.sgx.com/regulation/public-consultations/20210331-consultation-paper-proposed-listing-framework-special">Singapore Exchange</a> and<a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2021/03/07/idx-to-allow-spacs-hopes-indonesian-unicorns-will-go-public-locally.html"> Indonesian Stock Exchange</a> are preparing to allow SPACs in an effort to attract more tech listings.</p>
<p>Lints said this will allow companies to consider a dual listing in Southeast Asia and the U.S. for larger returns. “A dual listing would be an amazing option and I think through the avenue of SPACs, that makes a lot of sense.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://upflow.io">Upflow</a> has raised a $15 million Series A round. The company wants to help you chase late payments. It optimizes how you collect payments from your customers in order to improve your cash-cycle.</p>
<p>Investors in today’s funding round include 9yards Capital, existing investor eFounders, as well as N26 co-founder Maximilian Tayenthal, Uber SVP of Delivery Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, auxmoney co-founder and CEO Raffael Johnen.</p>
<p>People who run a business often tell you that getting paid is a consuming task. When you create an invoice, chances are your customer will wait a few weeks before paying you. Most companies end up with a backlog of outstanding invoices sitting in an Excel spreadsheet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They keep an eye on their bank account to manually reconcile those payments. And, of course, they often have to send an email or call a customer to tell them that now is the time.</p>
<p>Upflow acts as the central repository to see all your invoices, track payments, communicate with your team and send reminders. But Upflow doesn’t want to replace your existing tools. Instead, the company has built integrations with popular business tools that you’re already using.</p>
<p>For instance, you can connect your Upflow account with QuickBooks, Xero, Netsuite, Chargebee and Stripe Billing. You can charge your clients from your existing invoicing platform. Upflow imports your invoices, clients and payments. When Upflow notices a late payment, you receive a notification and can start sending automated or personalized emails.</p>
<p>The startup also thinks current B2B payment methods are outdated. In the U.S., too many companies still rely on paper checks. In France, copying IBAN information from an email to your bank account can be cumbersome.</p>
<p>When you send an invoice using Upflow, customers get a link with several payment methods. You can connect your Upflow account with Stripe Payments to enable card payments for instance. And the startup is slowly building a network of companies that have used Upflow at some point. 1.5 million companies have interacted with the product — it represents over $1 billion in payments.</p>
<p>“We are on a mission to revolutionize the way that companies get paid. At Upflow, we provide a solution that adds connectivity and clarity to a company&#39;s payment and invoicing stack. Where systems were previously closed and disconnected, Upflow&#39;s platform enables smooth and clear processes,” co-founder and CEO Alexandre Louisy said in a statement.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand to the U.S. Upflow already has a few customers there, such as Lattice, Front and Adikteev, but it’s just a start. The startup will open an office in New York.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jaguar Land Rover is developing a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle based on the new Defender SUV and plans to begin testing the prototype next year.</p>
<p>The prototype program, known as Project Zeus, is part of JLR&#8217;s larger aim to only produce zero-tailpipe emissions vehicles by 20236. JLR has also made a commitment to have zero carbon emissions across its supply chain, products and operations by 2039.</p>
<p>Project Zeus is partially funded by the UK government-backed Advanced Propulsion Center. The automaker has also tapped AVL, Delta Motorsport, Marelli Automotive Systems and the UK Battery Industrialization Center to help develop the prototype. The testing program is designed to help engineers understand how a hydrogen powertrain can be developed that would meet the performance and capability (like towing and off roading) standards that Land Rover customers expect.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity without combustion. The electricity generated from hydrogen is used to power an electric motor. Some automakers, researchers and policymakers have advocated for the technology because hydrogen-powered FCEVs can be refueled quickly, have a high-energy density and don&#8217;t lose as much range in cold temperatures. The combination means EVs that can travel longer distances.</p>

<p>Few fuel cell EVs, otherwise known as FCEVs, are on the market today in part because of a lack of refueling stations. The Toyota Mirai is one example.</p>
<p>Data from the International Energy Agency and recent commitments by automakers suggests that might be changing. Last month, BMW Chairman Oliver Zipse said the automaker plans to produce a small number of <a href="https://www.bmw.com/en/innovation/how-hydrogen-fuel-cell-cars-work.html">hydrogen fuel-cell powered</a> X5 SUVs next year.</p>
<p>The number of FCEVs in the world nearly doubled to 25,210 units in 2019 from the previous year, the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/hydrogen">latest data from the IEA shows</a>. The United States has been the leader in sales, although there was a dip in 2019, followed by China, Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>Japan has been a leader on the infrastructure end as it aims to have 200,000 FCEVs on the road by 2025. The country had installed 113 stations as of 2019, nearly twice as many as the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know hydrogen has a role to play in the future powertrain mix across the whole transport industry, and alongside battery electric vehicles, it offers another zero tailpipe emission solution for the specific capabilities and requirements of Jaguar Land Rover&#8217;s world class line-up of vehicles,&#8221; Ralph Clague, the head of hydrogen and fuel cells for Jaguar Land Rover said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://carro.sg/">Carro</a>, one of the largest automotive marketplaces in Southeast Asia, announced it has hit unicorn valuation after raising a $360 million Series C led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2. Other participants include insurance giant MSIG and Indonesian-based funds like EV Growth. About 90% of vehicles sold through Carro are secondhand, and it offers services that cover the entire lifecycle of a car, from maintenance to when it is broken down and recycled for parts.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Carro started as an online marketplace for cars, before expanding into more verticals. Co-founder and chief executive officer Aaron Tan told TechCrunch that, roughly speaking, the company&#8217;s operations are divided into three sections: wholesale, retail and fintech. Its wholesale business works with car dealers who want to purchase inventory, while its retail side sells to consumers. Its fintech operation offers products for both, including B2C car loans, auto insurance and B2B working capital loans.</p>
<p>Carro’s last funding announcement was in August 2019, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/carro-jualo-series-b-extended/">said it had extended its Series B to $90 million</a>. The company’s latest funding will be used to fund acquisitions, expand its financial services portfolio and develop its AI capabilities, which Carro uses to showcase cars online, develop pricing models and determine how much to charge insurance policyholders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It also plans to expand retail services in its main markets: Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. Carro currently employs about 1,000 people across the four countries and claims its revenue grew more than 2.5x during the financial year ending March 2021.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic helped Carro’s business because people wanted their own vehicles to avoid public transportation and became more receptive to shopping for cars online. Those factors also helped competitors like OLX Autos and Carsome<a href="https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/how-are-olx-autos-carro-and-carsome-faring-amidst-the-covid-19-pandemic/"> fare well during the pandemic</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Used car marketplace Carsome gets $30 million Series D for its Southeast Asia growth plans&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/used-car-marketplace-carsome-gets-30-million-series-d-for-its-southeast-asia-expansion/embed/#?secret=ywR74lOb7B" data-secret="ywR74lOb7B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The adoption of electric vehicles across Southeast Asia has resulted in a new tailwind for Carro, because people who buy an EV usually want to sell off their combustion engine vehicles. Carro is currently talking to some of the largest electric vehicle companies in the world that want to launch in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>“For every car someone typically buys in Southeast Asia, there’s always a trade-in. Where do cars go, right? We are a marketplace, but on a very high level, what we’re doing is reusing and recycling. That’s a big part in the environmental sustainability of the business, and something that sets us apart of other players in the region,&#8221; Tan said.</p>
<p>Cars typically stay in Carro’s inventory for less than 60 days. Its platform uses computer vision and sound technology to replicate the experience of inspecting a vehicle in-person. When someone clicks on a Carro listing, an AI bot automatically engages with them, providing more details about the cost of the car and answering questions. They also see a 360-degree view of the vehicle, its interior and can virtually start the engine to see how it sounds. Listings also provide information about defects and inspection reports.</p>
<p>Since many customers still want to get an in-person look before finalizing a purchase, Carro recently launched a beta product called Showroom Anywhere. Currently available in Singapore, it allows people to unlock Carro cars parked throughout the city, using QR codes, so they can inspect it at any time of the day, without a salesperson around. The company plans to add test driving to Showroom Anywhere.</p>
<p>“As a tech company, our job is to make sure we automate everything we can,” said Tan. “That’s the goal of the company and you can only assume that our cost structure and our revenue structure will get better along the years. We expect greater margin improvement and a lot more in cost reduction.”</p>
<p>Pricing is fixed, so shoppers don’t have to engage in haggling. Carro determines prices by using machine-learning models that look at details about a vehicle, including its make, model and mileage, and data from Carro’s transactions as well as market information (for example, how much of a particular vehicle is currently available for sale). Carro’s prices are typically in the middle of the market’s range.</p>
<p>Cars come with a three or seven-day moneyback guarantee and 30-day warranty. Once a customer decides to buy a car, they can opt to apply for loans and insurance through Carro’s fintech platform. Tan said Carro’s loan book is about five years old, almost as old as the startup itself, and is currently about $200 million.</p>
<p>Carro’s insurance is priced based on the policyholders driving behavior as tracked by sensors placed in their cars. This allows Carro to build a profile of how someone drives and the likelihood that they have an accident or other incident. For example, someone will get better pricing if they typically stick to speed limits.</p>
<p>“It sounds a bit futuristic,” said Tan. “But it’s something that’s been done in the United States for many years, like GEICO and a whole bunch of other insurers,” including Root Insurance, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/root-targets-6b-valuation-in-pending-ipo-a-boon-for-insurtech-startups/">recently went public</a>.</p>
<p>Tan said MSIG’s investment in Carro is a “statement that we are really trying to triple down in insurance, because an insurer has so much linkage with what we do. The reason that MSIG is a good partner is that, like ourselves, they believe a lot in data and the difference in what we call ‘new age’ insurance, or data-driven insurance.”</p>
<p>Carro is also expanding its after-sale services, including Carro Care, in all four of its markets. Its after-sale services reach to the very end of a vehicle’s lifecycle and its customers include workshops around the world. For example, if a Toyota Corolla breaks down in Singapore, but its engine is still usable, it might be extracted and shipped to a repair shop in Nairobi, and the rest of its parts recycled.</p>
<p>“One thing I always ask in management meetings, is tell me where do cars go to die in Indonesia? Where do cars go to die in Thailand? There has to be a way, so if there is no way, we’re going to find a way,” said Tan.</p>
<p>In a statement, SoftBank Investment Advisers managing partner Greg Moon said, “Powered by AI, Carro’s technology platform provides consumers with full-stack services and transparency throughout the car ownership process. We are delighted to partner with Aaron and the Carro team to support their ambition to expand into new markets and use AI-powered technology to make the car buying process smarter, simpler and safer.”</p>

<h2>How contrarian hires and a pitch deck started Nubank’s $30 billion fintech empire</h2>
<p>Founded in 2013 and based in São Paulo, Brazil, Nubank serves more than 34 million customers, making it Latin America&#8217;s largest neobank.</p>
<p>Reporter Marcella McCarthy spoke to CEO David Velez to learn about his efforts to connect with consumers and overcome entrenched opposition from established players who were friendly with regulators.</p>
<p>In the first of a series of stories, she interviewed Velez about his early fundraising efforts. For a balanced perspective, she also spoke to early Nubank investors at Sequoia and Kaszek Ventures, Latin America&#8217;s largest venture fund, to find out why they funded the startup while it was still pre-product.</p>
<p>“There are people you come across in life that within the first hour of meeting with them, you know you want to work with them,” said Doug Leone, a global managing partner at Sequoia who&#8217;d recruited Velez after he graduated from grad school at Stanford.</p>
<p>Marcella also interviewed members of Nubank&#8217;s founding team to better understand why they decided to take a chance on a startup that faced such long odds of success.</p>
<p>“I left banking to make a fifth of my salary, and back then, about $5,000 in equity,” said Vitor Olivier, Nubank&#8217;s VP of operations and platforms.</p>
<p>“Financially, it didn’t really make sense, so I really had to believe that it was really going to work, and that it would be big.”</p>

<p>Battery recycling startup Redwood Materials, which was founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/redwood-materials-is-setting-up-shop-near-the-tesla-gigafactory-as-part-of-broader-expansion/">has purchased 100 acres of land</a> near the Gigafactory that Panasonic operates with Tesla in Sparks, Nevada.

<p><em>This week, we talk to Anna Rubanova. A comedy writer-turned podcast producer, she&#8217;s worked on myriad podcasts, including &#8220;The Thrilling Adventure Hour&#8221; and &#8220;Election Profit Makers&#8221; (featuring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/how-i-podcast-election-profit-makers-david-rees/">recent How I Podcaster, David Rees</a>). Rubanova serves as an executive producer at Forever Dog and has hosted programs for WNYC Studios and Stitcher Premium. She co-produces and hosts the narrative sketch comedy show &#8220;<a href="http://www.lefthandedradio.com/">Left Handed Radio</a>&#8221; with Adam Bozarth. </em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I use my phone a lot. I used to write down ideas for sketches and would inevitably forget what made them good. &#8220;When I win the lottery, I’m gonna teach a fish how to smoke.&#8221; That&#8217;s in one of my notes and I have no idea what it&#8217;s referring to. With a voice memo, I can capture the feel of the bit immediately. The recording can serve as a jumping off point for a fully written sketch, maybe a prompt for improv. I might re-record it using a better mic or, screw it, use it as is. I go with whatever is funniest or, sometimes, good enough. You can always justify it later with context. With enough music, restoration or SFX, the worst-quality audio sounds intentional. Plus, there&#8217;s no point in doing something &#8220;correctly&#8221; in podcasting. It&#8217;s like trying to make the perfect sandwich. Anyone who thinks there&#8217;s one way to podcast or do radio or utilize two slices of bread is a fraud or a solipsist.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165863" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165863" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2165863" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165863" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Anna Rubanova</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of podcast perfection, Left Handed Radio is my everything. It&#8217;s a portfolio, creative outlet, comedy scrapbook and excuse to play with my best friend and partner in all things, Adam Bozarth. We make sketches, stream-of-consciousness monologues, anything that strikes us as funny or interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last decade, we&#8217;ve accumulated a good deal of recording equipment. Nothing fancy: a couple of Zooms, two AudioTechnica 2020 USB mics, and a Rhode shotgun. Most of what we have was meant for DIY filmmaking. There was a post-YouTube short-form comedy boom about a decade ago. When all those branded content sites went down, we stopped messing with video and leaned harder into animation and podcasting. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narrative audio is my passion. Podcasting is my job. Like I said, we don&#8217;t collect equipment but, as producers of up to 12 shows at a time, we needed to invest in plug-ins and software. The easiest DAW for dialogue has to be Audition. Logic is great for building out soundscapes and, obviously, music. We record remote calls to Audition and mark edit points like we would in a studio. (Thank you, Loopback!) Two years ago, I dropped a whopping $1,000 on restoration software. In the pandemic, that software has saved me hours of work. When everyone is recording from home, literally anything can go wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are the days when clipping and plosives were our biggest concern. One time, a podcaster (i.e. someone with their own podcast) called into a show I was producing from a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">rooftop party</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By the time I finished restoring the recording, nobody could tell. (Thank you, RX-7; I wish I could afford RX-8.) Plug-ins aren&#8217;t just useful, they can be delightful. We have one that can make audio sound like it&#8217;s coming from a loudspeaker underneath a woolen blanket. Have I found a good use for it? No, not yet. But I can imagine the possibilities.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last fall, Google&#8217;s in-house incubator Area 120 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/google-launches-a-work-tracking-tool-and-airtable-rival-tables/">introduced</a> a new work-tracking tool called <a href="https://tables.area120.google.com/about">Tables</a>, an AirTable rival that allows for tracking projects more efficiently using automation. Today, Google says Tables will officially &#8220;graduate&#8221; from Area 120 to become an official Google product by joining Google Cloud, which it expects to complete in the next year.</p>
<p>The Tables project was started by long-time Google employee, now Tables&#8217; GM, Tim Gleason, who spent 10 years at the company and many more before that in the tech industry. He said he was inspired to work on Tables because he always had a difficult time tracking projects, as teams shared notes and tasks across different documents, which quickly got out of date.</p>
<p>Instead of tracking those sorts of notes and tasks associated with a project across various documents that have to be manually updated by team members, Tables uses bots to help take on some of the administrative duties involved in guiding team members through a project &#8212; like scheduling recurring email reminders when tasks are overdue, messaging a chat room when new forms are received, moving tasks to other people&#8217;s work queues, or updating tasks when schedules are changed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The team saw Tables as a potential solution for a variety of use cases, including of course project management, as well as IT operations, customer service tracking, CRM, recruiting, product development and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2049986" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2049986" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2049986" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="460" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=768,520 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=680,460 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=1536,1040 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2049986" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The service was launched last September to test product market fit, Google says, and quickly found traction.</p>
<p>According to VP/GM and Head of Platform for Google Cloud <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitzavery/">Amit Zavery</a>, early customer feedback was positive and the team saw customers adopting the service for multiple projects &#8212; another strong signal for its potential growth. He declined to say how many customers were already using the service, however.</p>
<p>The pandemic also likely played a role in Tables&#8217; adoption, Zavery noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you saw what happened with COVID, I think work-tracking became a pretty big area of interest for many customers who we&#8217;re speaking to,&#8221; he says, explaining that everyone was trying to quickly digitize.</p>
<p>Popular use cases included inventory management, healthcare supply tracking and use in mortgage-lending workflows. However, the team found Tables was adopted across a variety of industries beyond these, as hoped. On average, customers would use Tables in a department with around 30 to 40 people, they found.</p>
<p>Most customers were abandoning more manual processes to use Tables instead, not coming from a rival service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things were very fragmented in different documents or with different people, so using technologies like this really seems to have resonated very well,&#8221; Zavery says. &#8220;Now you had one central place for structured information you can access and do things on top of it versus trying to have 15 different sheets and figuring out how they are related because there&#8217;s no structure behind each of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another factor that prompted Tables&#8217; adoption was how quickly people could be productive, thanks in part to its ability to integrate with existing data warehouses and other services. Currently, Tables supports Office 365, Microsoft Access, Google Sheets, Slack, Salesforce, Box and Dropbox, for example.</p>
<p>Tables was one of only a few Area 120 projects to launch with a paid business model, along with ticket seller Fundo, conversational ads platform AdLingo and Google’s recently launched Orion WiFi. During its beta, an individual could use Tables for free, with support for up to 100 tables and 1,000 rows. The paid plan was supposed to cost $10 per user per month, with support for up to 1,000 tables and 10,000 rows. This plan also included support for larger attachments, more actions and advanced history, sharing, forms, automation and views.</p>
<p>However, Google never began charging for its paid tier during the beta, it says.</p>
<p>As Tables graduates into Google Cloud&#8217;s lineup, it will be integrated with Google&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-acquires-appsheet-to-bring-no-code-development-to-google-cloud/">no-code app building platform</a>, <a href="https://www.appsheet.com/">AppSheet</a>, which has a free tier, allowing the freemium model to continue. Users who want additional features will be able to upgrade to a premium plan. It will also be offered as a standalone product, for those who want that experience.</p>
<p>Google will leverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/google-opens-workspace-to-everyone/">Workspace</a> to get Tables in front of more users, as well.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Lwu4WVpwPK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/google-opens-workspace-to-everyone/">Google opens Workspace to everyone</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google opens Workspace to everyone&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/google-opens-workspace-to-everyone/embed/#?secret=Lwu4WVpwPK" data-secret="Lwu4WVpwPK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;it&#8217;s going to be delivered through Workspace integration, because that&#8217;s a very large community of users who expect some similar kind of functionality,&#8221; Zavery says. &#8220;That will be a big differentiator, when you talk about the breadth of things we can do &#8212; because of having that community of users on Sheets, the things they do with Drive, and the data they collect &#8212; we can automatically add this and augment their experience.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2049988" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2049988" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2049988" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="505" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png 3232w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=300,223 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=768,570 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=680,505 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=1536,1141 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=2048,1521 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/project-task-mgmt.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2049988" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The project taps into the growing interest in no-code, spreadsheet-powered database platforms &#8212; like AirTable, for example, which had<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/airtable-raises-185m-and-launches-new-low-code-and-automation-features/"> closed on $185 million</a> in Series D funding in the days before Tables&#8217; release, valuing its business at $2.585 billion, post-money.</p>
<p>As Tables transitions to Google Cloud, the Tables beta version will remain free until a fully supported Cloud product becomes available in the next year. At that point, users will migrate to the new service.</p>
<p>Over time, Tables plans to add more functionality as it ties in with AppSheet, to make using the service more seamless &#8212; so people don&#8217;t have to hop around from one product to another to accomplish tasks. It will also work to provide better ease of use, mobile support and connectivity with more backend systems.</p>
<p>Official pricing hasn&#8217;t been finalized but shouldn&#8217;t be very different from the beta version.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automattic is expanding its lineup of online writing platforms with its acquisition of<a href="https://dayoneapp.com/"> Day One,</a> a popular journaling app for Mac and Apple mobile devices. The app has been downloaded more than 15 million times since its <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/a-message-to-day-one-users">March 2011 launch</a> on the Mac and iTunes App Store, offering users a private place to share their thoughts. Since then, it&#8217;s been awarded the App Store Editor’s Choice, App of the Year and the Apple Design Award, along with praise from various reviewers.</p>
<p>Deal terms are not being disclosed. Day One had been bootstrapped and self-funded for ten years.</p>
<p>The addition makes for an interesting expansion of Automattic&#8217;s now growing collection of online writing tools, which today include blogging platforms WordPress.com and Tumblr &#8212; the latter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/verizon-is-selling-tumblr-to-wordpress-parent-automattic/">as of 2019</a>, when Automattic took the aging social blogging network off parent company Verizon&#8217;s hands for a fraction of its earlier $1 billion acquisition price. (Verizon still owns TechCrunch, too&#8230;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">for now</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike WordPress and Tumblr, which tend to focus on publishing to a public audience, Day One&#8217;s focus has been on privacy. The app offers end-to-end encryption for all your journal entries, which can include text, media and even audio recordings. It has also offered advanced features like automatic backups, auto-import of Instagram posts, voice transcriptions, templates, rich text formatting, location history and optional printed books, as well as integrations with other platforms like Spotify, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and more.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Private equity firm Apollo to buy Verizon Media assets for $5B, will rename business &#8216;Yahoo&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/embed/#?secret=hH4MmT4gNq" data-secret="hH4MmT4gNq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With its addition to Automattic, Day One will allow users to choose to publish select journal entries to WordPress.com and Tumblr, and, soon, import content from either platform back into Day One, too. The app may also make sense as a way for existing Tumblr users to sync their private entries over to a more protected and backed-up writing tool &#8212; instead of accidentally publishing them to their main blog.</p>
<p>Automattic, <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2021/06/14/day-one-the-journaling-app-joins-automattic/">in an announcement</a>, notes Day One CEO Paul Mayne will continue to lead the development of Day One following the acquisition. The team of 12 will also remain intact.</p>
<p>“We are working hard and making sure that their teams are smoothly integrated, and together we can continue to build a collective and robust culture,” Maybe told TechCrunch. He said there will be no transition process for current customers — everything will continue to work as usual.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/day-one-at-automattic"> in a blog post</a>, Mayne hints at why he sold the app, noting the deal will allow Day One access to the same technological, financial and security benefits that help power WordPress.com and Tumblr.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is incredibly exciting news. For the past 10 years since I started Day One, I’ve worked to not only create the best digital journaling experience in the world, but one that will last,&#8221; shares Mayne. &#8220;By joining Automattic, I’m now more confident than ever that the preservation and longevity of Day One is sure,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Mayne also noted there were no current plans to change the private nature of Day One, but the app would integrate with other Automattic products going forward, while continuing to sustain itself via a subscription model. Existing customers will see no changes to pricing, we’re told.</p>
<p><em>Updated, 6/14/21, 9:43 PM ET with additional details from Mayne. </em></p>

We sat on the small stage at TechCrunch Disrupt, for example, with Garry Tan one year, and Charles Hudson another.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every day in the United States, more than 100 people die because of a car crash. Some are teenagers, like the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-30/writer-michael-lewis-tabitha-soren-daughter-dies-in-crash">daughter of writer Michael Lewis and Tabitha Soren, and her boyfriend</a>, who died in a wrong-way crash. Some are well known, like Kevin Clark, who played the drummer in “School of Rock,” who was <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2021/5/26/22454359/kevin-clark-dies-school-of-rock-crash-avondale-western-chicago">hit and killed by a driver while bikin<span style="text-decoration: underline;">g</span></a>. Others are not household names, like <a href="https://www.kob.com/albuquerque-news/police-charge-26-year-old-woman-in-connection-to-fatal-dwi-related-crash/6125812/">Janell Katesigwa, who was killed by a drunk driver in Albuquerque, New Mexico,</a> and left behind four children.</p>
<p>Something else happens every day, too: a lack of congressional urgency to require available technology to prevent the next tragedy.</p>
<p>Sadly, what is stopping advanced technology from preventing these deaths is business as usual in Washington, which means a lot of talk about saving lives, but little action.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Vehicle safety is based on using layers of protection that have led to a five-fold reduction in the occurrence of car crash deaths in the United States over the last 50 years.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Existing advanced vehicle safety technology, such as driver monitoring systems, automatic emergency braking and lane-departure warnings, can dramatically reduce crashes like the three described above &#8212; and the thousands of others that are a result of drunk, drugged, drowsy and distracted driving.</p>
<p>But only if the technology becomes standard equipment in new vehicles. When technology &#8212; underwritten by standards, bolstered by oversight and backstopped by accountability &#8212; can annually spare tens of thousands of families from tragedy, our federal government must act.</p>
<p>Over the coming weeks and months, Congress will debate the future of motor vehicles in the United States. The debate will be focused on renewing the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act, which is also referred to as the “highway bill.”</p>
<p>But make no mistake: While issues such as the future of the gas tax and arcane parliamentary procedures will grab headlines, vital decisions will be made about whether the growing and preventable public health crisis of car crash deaths will be prioritized or once again considered non-essential.</p>
<p>Despite the estimated <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/2020-fatality-data-show-increased-traffic-fatalities-during-pandemic">38,680 highway fatalities</a> last year, which represented a 7.2% increase over 2019, some federal policymakers have failed to focus on available remedies that would result in fewer funerals and a reduction in lifelong debilitating injuries.</p>
<p>Perhaps the delay is a result of too many in Congress who believe the only available solution is rushing unsupervised driverless vehicles into the marketplace. Even if a green light for mass driverless vehicle production were given today, it would be decades before they could make a significant impact on improving overall safety. This single-minded focus on a unicorn to fix all transportation issues misunderstands the technical challenges and misreads the public mood.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/aaa-survey-finds-86-of-drivers-afraid-to-ride-in-automated-vehicles/">AAA survey found 86% of respondents</a> would not trust riding in driverless vehicles, <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2021/05/drivers-should-know-if-they-are-sharing-the-road-with-self-driving-test-vehicles/">while another found consumers do not feel comfortable sharing the road with them</a>. The technology industry’s habit of beta-testing unproven software on the public, combined with car companies’ track record of delaying safety in exchange for profit, will not increase consumer trust of the safety, inclusivity and equity of driverless technology.</p>
<p>Vehicle safety is based on using layers of protection that have led to a five-fold reduction in the occurrence of car crash deaths in the United States over the last 50 years. Seatbelts and airbags protect you when you crash. Electronic stability control and anti-lock brakes help you avoid rolling over. Regulations provide minimum levels of performance and recalls serve as a backstop to provide oversight when there is a defect.</p>
<p>It is hard to remember, but there was once a time when dual braking systems, intended to provide a safe stop even in the event of a catastrophic failure of one braking system, were considered revolutionary. Now such a layer of protection is standard.</p>
<p>At a time when the promise of automated vehicle technology could make or break America’s place atop the automobile industry, many in Congress want to ignore history and cut away layers of protection to rush driverless vehicles into the marketplace. One Senate proposal creates a fast track for manufacturers to sell tens of thousands of automated vehicles based on a flimsy promise that their vehicle is as safe as the least safe vehicle meeting current minimum standards. No one should forget that the Ford Pinto met all the minimum standards when it was recalled for exploding upon impact when hit from behind. Driverless vehicles should be held to a higher standard than the minimum.</p>
<p>Congress has an opportunity to help build public trust in the safety of driverless technology by requiring existing innovations that will be the building blocks of driverless vehicles into cars right away, with immediate benefits. For example, in the future, automated vehicles will need driver monitoring systems to make smooth handoffs between machine and driver, automated braking to avoid crashes and lane-keeping technology to keep vehicles where they belong. Today these systems, when working correctly, can help limit crashes by assisting human drivers, just as someday these features may assist computer drivers. Using technology to save lives now does not preclude saving more lives later.</p>
<p>As Congress begins to actively debate the future of the automobile industry, there is a lot of talk about upgrading roads, encouraging electric battery-powered vehicles and accelerating the introduction of driverless cars. Yet, there is not nearly enough talk about what is needed to make us all safer sooner.</p>
<p>There have been a variety of reasonable bills introduced to help the U.S. catch up to the rest of the developed world when it comes to vehicle safety and safeguarding pedestrians. They include improving the safety of our back-seat passengers in crashes, better recall procedures, and more robust and transparent data collection, along with requiring advanced safety features now common around the world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have a long way to go and no time to waste. The European Union, despite a larger population and an almost identical number of vehicles and land size, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/news/2021-04-20-road-safety_en">had under 19,000 crash deaths last year</a>, less than half of the U.S. death toll. Further, the EU’s record-low vehicle-related deaths came without a single driverless vehicle on the road, but with robust consumer information and a regulatory scheme that mandates safety.</p>
<p>In the U.S., however, car manufacturers concerned about challenges from new market entrants &#8212; foreign and domestic &#8212; are lobbying for looser regulations and immunity from responsibility for automated vehicle crashes. Congress must push the industry to move quickly to protect lives before profits and stand behind their products when things inevitably go wrong. The best time to appropriately assign accountability regarding who will be held responsible if a car with a computer driver kills your loved ones, or a systemwide defect impacts an entire driverless fleet, is before the crash.</p>
<p>Moreover, history demonstrates that thoughtful requirements for all vehicles, crafted in a way to keep pace with major innovations in the automobile industry, have always been necessary to ensure vehicle safety is not reserved for the rich alone.</p>
<p>Federal legislation requiring objective performance standards based on data collected from driverless cars being tested on public streets can provide a path to this future. Yet Congress seems poised to do little, or nothing, once again. It is time for policy makers to reconcile the notion that the long-term viability of the driverless vehicle industry and keeping public roads safer now with incremental improvements, federal oversight and legal responsibility are not opposing ideas but necessary partners.</p>
<p>There is no question the U.S. can lead in the coming era of vehicle innovation while improving safety for all drivers, passengers and pedestrians. Success in this ambitious task will require moving forward quickly with existing safety technology and dispensing with the idea that innovations, safety and accountability are incompatible when, in fact, each is integral to the long-term success of the other.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raquel Urtasun, the former chief scientist at Uber ATG, is the founder and CEO of Waabi, an autonomous vehicle startup that came out of stealth mode last week. The Toronto-based company, which will focus on trucking, raised an impressive $83.5 million in a Series A round led by Khosla Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urtasun joined Mobility 2021 to talk about her new venture, the challenges facing the self-driving vehicle industry and how her approach to AI can be used to advance the commercialization of AVs.</span></p>

<hr />
<h2>Why did Urtasun decide to found her own company?</h2>
<p>Urtasun, who is considered a pioneer in AI, led the R&amp;D efforts as a chief scientist at Uber ATG, which was acquired by Aurora in December. Six months later, we have Waabi. The company&#8217;s <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">mission is to take an AI-first approach to solving self-driving technology. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>I left Uber a little bit over three months ago to start this new company, Waabi, with the idea of having a different way of solving self-driving. This is a combination of my 20-year career in AI as well as more than 10 years in self-driving. Thinking about a new company was something that was always in my head. And the more that I was in the industry, the more that I started thinking about going away from the traditional approach and trying to have a diverse view of how to solve self-driving was actually the way to go. So that&#8217;s why I decided to do this company. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 1:21)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Supreme Court has given LinkedIn another chance to stop a rival company from scraping personal information from users&#8217; public profiles, a practice LinkedIn says should be illegal but one that could have broad ramifications for internet researchers and archivists.</p>
<p>LinkedIn lost <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/15/linkedin-sues-scrapers/">its case against Hiq Labs</a> in 2019 after the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the CFAA does not prohibit a company from scraping data that is publicly accessible on the internet.</p>
<p>The Microsoft-owned social network argued that the mass scraping of its users&#8217; profiles was in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or CFAA, which prohibits accessing a computer without authorization.</p>
<p>Hiq Labs, which uses public data to analyze employee attrition, argued at the time that a ruling in LinkedIn&#8217;s favor &#8220;could profoundly impact open access to the Internet, a result that Congress could not have intended when it enacted the CFAA over three decades ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Supreme Court said it would not take on the case, but instead ordered the appeal&#8217;s court to hear the case again in light of its recent ruling, which found that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/supreme-court-hacking-cfaa-ruling/">a person cannot violate the CFAA</a> if they improperly access data on a computer they have permission to use.</p>
<p>The CFAA was once dubbed <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/12/worst-law-technology-strikes-again-2017-review">the “worst law”</a> in the technology law books by critics who have long argued that its outdated and vague language failed to keep up with the pace of the modern internet.</p>
<p>Journalists and archivists have long scraped public data as a way to save and archive copies of old or defunct websites <a href="https://gizmodo.com/were-archiving-yahoo-answers-so-youll-always-know-how-b-1846643969">before they shut down</a>. But other cases of web scraping have sparked anger and concerns over privacy and civil liberties. In 2019, a security researcher <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/16/millions-venmo-transactions-scraped/">scraped millions of Venmo transactions</a>, which the company does not make private by default. Clearview AI, a controversial facial recognition startup, claimed it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">scraped over 3 billion profile photo</a>s from social networks without their permission.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Gatik's Apeksha Kumavat, Nuro's Amy Jones Satrom and Starship Technologies' Ahti Heinla joined us to discuss their companies’ unique approaches to autonomous delivery. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We kicked off this year’s TC Sessions: Mobility with a talk featuring three leading players in the field of autonomous delivery. Gatik co-founder and chief engineer Apeksha Kumavat, Nuro head of operations Amy Jones Satrom, and Starship Technologies co-founder and CTO Ahti Heinla joined us to discuss their companies’ unique approaches to the category.</p>
<p>The trio discussed government regulation on autonomous driving, partnerships with big corporations like Walmart and Domino’s, and the ongoing impact the pandemic has had on interest in the space.</p>
<h2>The pandemic effect</h2>
<p>Delivery is one of the countless categories that have been profoundly impacted by COVID-19. Interest in autonomous delivery has compounded, but will this be a permanent sea change? Or will things regress some when life returns to normal?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Kumavat:</strong> Even before the pandemic hit, this whole e-commerce trend was already on the rise. No one wants their deliveries to be done after a week or two weeks. Everyone is expecting them to be done on the same day, as well as curbside pickup options. There was already a rise in the expectations of e-commerce and on-demand deliveries even before the pandemic hit. Post-March 2020, what we have seen is a huge increase in that trajectory. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 1:55)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Jones Satrom:</strong> When you think about the number of trips the consumer used to take just for shopping, that’s roughly 40% of the trips they would take. They now have habits around that kind of stuff. It’s a timesaver for the consumer. We do see those trends continuing and we do see folks sustaining the online ordering piece and wanting to be able to get things when they want them. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 8:39)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Redwood Materials, the battery recycling startup founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, has purchased 100 acres of land near the Gigafactory that Panasonic operates with Tesla in Sparks, Nevada as part of an expansion plan that aligns with the Biden Administration&#8217;s drive to increase adoption of electric vehicles and boost domestic battery recycling and supply chain efforts.</p>
<p>The company said Monday that its existing 150,000-square-foot facility in Carson City, Nevada will also nearly triple in size. Redwood is adding another 400,000 square feet onto the Carson City recycling facility, which is expected to be operational by the end of the year.</p>
<p>As part of its growth plans, Redwood is also hiring hundreds of workers. The company, which is backed by Amazon, employs 130 people today and expects to add more than 500 jobs over the next two years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Redwood&#8217;s expansion announcement follows the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/08/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-supply-chain-disruptions-task-force-to-address-short-term-supply-chain-discontinuities/">Biden Administration&#8217;s 100-day review</a> of the U.S. supply chain and the release of a<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/FCAB%20National%20Blueprint%20Lithium%20Batteries%200621_0.pdf?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosgenerate&amp;stream=top"> Department of Energy&#8217; document</a> that lays out a plan to improve the domestic supply chain for lithium-based batteries.</p>
<p>&#8220;America has a clear opportunity to build back our domestic supply chain and manufacturing sectors, so we can capture the full benefits of an emerging $23 trillion global clean energy economy,&#8221; Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm said Monday in a statement. &#8220;Private sector investment like this is a sign that we can&#8217;t slow down. The American Jobs Plan will unlock massive opportunities for US businesses as it spurs innovation and demand for technologies&#8211;like vehicle batteries and battery storage&#8211;creating clean energy jobs for all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redwood Materials, which was founded in 2017, is trying to create a circular supply chain. The company has a business-to-business strategy, recycling the scrap from battery cell production as well as consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. Redwood collects the scrap from consumer electronics companies and battery cell manufacturers like Panasonic. It then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and then supplies those back to Panasonic and other customers. The aim is to create a closed loop system that will ultimately help reduce the cost of batteries and offset the need for mining.</p>
<p>Redwood Materials has a number of customers, and has only publicly disclosed that it is working with Panasonic, Amazon and AESC Envision in Tennessee</p>
<p>Redwood Materials says it recovers about 95% to 98% of the elements from the batteries such as nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper. Today, it receives 3 gigawatt-hours annually, a figure that the company says is equivalent to about 45,000 cars.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In December 1991, about 20 days before the Soviet Union formally disintegrated, my family landed in San Francisco as religious refugees fleeing persecution. I was a 9-year-old kid who had just experienced his first airplane trip and was utterly mesmerized by the skyscrapers of the city’s skyline as we drove past. It felt like arriving into the future.</p>
<p>My parents had almost nothing to their names. No degrees or specialized skills. Not a word of English. Only a few hundred dollars in cash from selling most of our possessions in Russia. They had just learned that half of our “luggage” &#8212; makeshift bags that were hand-sewn by my mother out of used floor rugs — was lost in transit.</p>
<p>Our journey wasn’t made possible by some employer seeking specialized labor, nor by a merit assessment that deemed our family as economically valuable immigrants. Instead, it was made possible by many Americans seeing inherent value in human beings seeking a better life. From people who wrote letters to Congress to increase refugee quotas, to sponsoring families who shared their homes and paychecks and lives to support arriving families, to organizations like<a href="https://worldrelief.org/"> World Relief</a>, which funded unsecured loans to pay for airline tickets for those who couldn’t afford them &#8212; all did their part with no expectation of economic gain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			I worry that outlier success stories &#8212; especially those that are filled with considerable luck and privilege like mine &#8212; can send the wrong message.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Integration into life in the United States wasn’t easy. Our family had to rely on welfare for several years as our parents learned English in night classes and attempted many different ways to make a living for our family of eight. Not being able to find a full-time job, my father tried every mail-order contract gig he could learn about &#8212; from cutting out thousands of leather pieces for shoes to soldering electronic boards to order to translation of documents from English to Russian. Eventually, he started his own business repairing and maintaining computers.</p>
<p>In every moment, I saw my parents seeking to pay back what others had selflessly done for us. They taught me there’s dignity to doing good work, even if it’s work that others don’t find glamorous. Even a decade later, our family was still barely scraping by financially. As I was applying to colleges as a senior in high school, our entire family would pack up our minivan on most evenings after dinner to clean dental clinics to make ends meet.</p>
<p>This is the point in my tale where it might make the most sense to insert my own story of living out a wildly unbelievable version of the American dream — especially for a refugee.</p>
<p>I could tell you how after college I co-founded Webflow, a <a href="https://webflow.com/no-code">no-code software development</a> company that employs nearly 300 people and is now valued at over $2 billion. And how stories like mine are the reason why we should open our doors to more refugees to come to the United States.</p>
<p>However, I worry that outlier success stories &#8212; especially those that are filled with considerable luck and privilege like mine &#8212; can send the wrong message. These tales can imply that the value and worth of immigrants and refugees are primarily economic. I worry that especially now, at a time when immigration has become a politically polarizing issue in this country, the conversation about the value of immigrants will continue shifting toward being purely merit-based.</p>
<p>Too often, if “merit” is the criterion, human beings are seen as worthy of joining our country if and only if they’re the “best of the best” or the “cream of the crop” in some skill or industry. In such cases, people are judged solely by how much economic value they can create in the short term.</p>
<p>Yes, merit-based immigration has an important place in our economy to solve shorter-term skill gaps in various industries. But if we <em>only</em> focus on that, I believe that our nation will have lost an important part of its character and heritage. We shouldn’t reduce our efforts to offer a safe haven to people whose lives are threatened back home. Turning our backs on the most vulnerable only to focus on the most economically advantageous would betray the spirit of what I believe makes the United States a beacon of hope and opportunity for so many people.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can get outsized economic benefits in the longer term by accepting more refugees. I know this because for every startup founder story like mine, there are hundreds of thousands of hard-working refugees who needed some help at first but are now contributing massively to our tax base as nurses, doctors, lawyers, firefighters and business owners. In fact, refugees<a href="https://immigrationforum.org/article/immigrants-as-economic-contributors-immigrant-entrepreneurs/#:~:text=Refugees%20have%20a%20higher%20rate,percent%20of%20non%2Drefugee%20immigrants."> have the highest rate of entrepreneurship</a>.</p>
<p>After experiencing hardship and oppression in their originating countries, refugees have unparalleled drive to make a better living for themselves, their families and their communities &#8212; which helps lift our entire economy.</p>
<p>My hope is that more people are given this kind of opportunity and that more industry leaders will start to advocate for immigration on humanitarian terms &#8212; not just economic ones. It will make our economy stronger in the end.</p>
<p>When given the chance to live freely without fearing for our lives, my family and so many others like us will work harder than most to contribute to society. Why? Because we feel a deep sense of gratitude to a nation that welcomed and accepted us because of, first and foremost, who we are as human beings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This weekend, all of your friends morphed one by one into animated, Pixar-inspired characters. This isn’t a fever dream, and you’re not alone.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Snapchat released a <a href="https://lens.snapchat.com/bad1396b0f8d494d845b1d6438c115f2">Cartoon 3D Style Lens</a>, which uses AR to make you look like a background character from “Frozen.” On Snapchat, over 215 million users have engaged with the Cartoon 3D lens, and it&#8217;s been viewed more than 1.7 billion times. Naturally, even though TikTok’s own AR cartoon effects aren’t quite as convincing as Snapchat’s, people are turning to TikTok to share videos of themselves as Disney princesses, because of course they are.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that a Disney-esque AR trend has gone viral. In August 2020, Snapchat had 28.5 million new installs, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/snapchat-had-a-big-august-amid-tiktok-uncertainty/">its biggest month</a> since May 2019, when it got 41.2 million new installs. It might not be a coincidence that in early August 2020, Snapchat released the <a href="https://lens.snapchat.com/0ad185e6dd5e418a9659fa96dce788e0">Cartoon Face lens</a>, which users realized could be used to “Disneyfy” their pets &#8212; the tag <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@djangosmiles/video/6860585253157752070?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">#disneydog</a> got 40.9 million views across platforms on TikTok. Then, Snapchat struck viral gold again in December, when they released the <a href="https://lens.snapchat.com/449d01c9513c40288d74397352cb304e">Cartoon lens</a>, which rendered more realistic results for human faces than the previous iteration.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to Sensor Tower, Snapchat&#8217;s global installs continued to climb month-over-month throughout the rest of 2020, though installs slightly declined in December. Still, Snapchat got 36 million downloads that month. Now, after the newest Cartoon Style 3D lens went viral again, Snapchat hit No. 6 on the App Store’s free apps charts, compared to TikTok’s No. 2 slot. Still, Snapchat downloads in May were 32 million, down from 34 million in April, while TikTok saw 80.3 million installs in May, up from 59.3 million in April.</p>

<p>But there’s a new app in the No. 1 slot that also made an impact on this weekend’s cartoon explosion. Released in March, Voilà AI Artist is yet another platform that turns us into cartoon versions of ourselves. Unlike the AR-powered effects on Snapchat or TikTok, Voilà is a photo editor. Users upload a selfie, and after watching an ad (the ad-free version costs $3 per week), it reveals what you would look like as a cartoon.</p>
<p>Voilà AI Artist was only downloaded 400 times globally in March 2021. By May, the app surpassed 1 million downloads, and during the first two weeks of this month alone, the app has been downloaded more than 10.5 million times.</p>

<p>Again, like the repetitive iterations on the “Disneyfy” trend, apps like Voilà aren’t new. FaceApp went viral in 2019, showing people what they’ll look like when they’re old, graying and wrinkled. The app became the center of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/faceapp-responds-to-privacy-concerns/">privacy controversy</a>, since it uploaded users’ photos to the cloud to edit their selfies with AI. FaceApp made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/faceapp-responds-to-privacy-concerns/">a statement</a> that it “might store updated photos in the cloud” for “performance and traffic reasons,” but that “most images” are deleted “within 48 hours.” Still, this ambiguous language set off the warning bells, urging us to think about the potentially nefarious implications of seeing what we’ll look like in 60 years. Two years earlier, FaceApp put out a “hotness” filter, which made users’ skin lighter &#8212; FaceApp apologized for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/25/faceapp-apologises-for-building-a-racist-ai/">racist AI</a>. Voilà, which is owned by Wemagine.AI LLP in Canada, has also been criticized for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@a_ali_flores/video/6972879431211715845?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">its AI’s eurocentrism</a>. As these apps grow in popularity, they can also uphold some of our culture’s most harmful biases.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165717" style="width: 515px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165717" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2165717" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-14-at-12.59.16-PM.png?w=505" alt="" width="505" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-14-at-12.59.16-PM.png 1018w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-14-at-12.59.16-PM.png?resize=111,150 111w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-14-at-12.59.16-PM.png?resize=223,300 223w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-14-at-12.59.16-PM.png?resize=768,1034 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-14-at-12.59.16-PM.png?resize=505,680 505w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-14-at-12.59.16-PM.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165717" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Voilà</p></div></p>
<p>Like FaceApp, Voilà requires an internet connection to use the app. Additionally, its <a href="https://www.wemagine.ai/terms">terms</a> outline that users grant the company “a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use in any way, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute Uploaded and Generated content.” Basically, that means that if you upload an image to the platform, Voilà has the right to use it, but they don’t own it. This isn’t abnormal for these apps &#8212; when we <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/termsofuse">upload photos to Instagram</a>, for example, we also grant the platform the right to use our images.</p>
<p>Still, it’s a good thing that apps like Voilà force us to consider what we give up in exchange for the knowledge that we’d make a good Disney princess. Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">TikTok updated its U.S. privacy policy</a> to dictate that the app “may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information” from users’ content. This includes “faceprints and voiceprints,” terms that TikTok left undefined. When TechCrunch reached Tiktok for comment, they couldn’t confirm why the terms now changed to allow for the automatic collection of biometric data, which refers to any features, measurements or characteristics of our body that distinguish us, even fingerprints.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that as Voilà climbed to the No. 1 slot on the App Store, Snapchat re-upped their Pixar-inspired AR lens. Facebook’s own Spark AR platform is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebooks-spark-ar-platform-expands-to-video-calling-with-multipeer-api/">rolling out new features</a>, and last week at WWDC, Apple announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apples-realitykit-2-allows-developers-to-create-3d-models-for-ar-using-iphone-photos/">major update to RealityKit</a>, its AR software. But these trends reveal more about our growing comfort with face-altering AR than they do about our nostalgia for Disney.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fraud protection startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nsure-ai-payment-assurance">nSure AI</a> has raised $6.8 million in seed funding, led by DisruptiveAI, Phoenix Insurance, AXA-backed venture builder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/kamet-ventures/">Kamet</a>, Moneta Seeds and private investors.</p>
<p>The round will help the company bolster the predictive AI and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/machine-learning/">machine learning</a> algorithms that power nSure AI&#8217;s &#8220;first of its kind&#8221; fraud protection platform. Prior to this round, the company received $550,000 in pre-seed funding from Kamet in March 2019.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv-headquartered startup, which currently has 16 employees, provides fraud detection for high-risk digital goods, such as electronic gift cards, airline tickets, software and games. While most fraud detection tools analyze each online transaction in an attempt to decide which purchases to approve and decline, nSure AI&#8217;s risk engine leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify fraudulent transactions.</p>
<p>NSure AI, which is backed by insurance company AXA, <a href="https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/88074/nsureai-raises-68-million">said</a> it has a 98% approval rating on average for purchases, compared to an industry average of 80%, allowing retailers to recapture nearly $100 billion a year in revenue lost by declining legitimate customers. The company is so confident in its technology that it will accept liability for any fraudulent transaction allowed by the platform.</p>
<p>Founders Alex Zeltcer and Ziv Isaiah started the company after experiencing the unique challenges faced by retailers of digital assets. The first week of their online gift card business found that 40% of sales were fraudulent, resulting in chargebacks. The founders began to develop their own platform for supporting the sale of high-risk digital goods after no other fraud detection service met their needs.</p>
<p>Zeltcer, co-founder and chief executive, said the investment &#8220;enables us to register thousands of new merchants, who can feel confident selling higher-risk digital goods, without accepting fraud as a part of business.”</p>
<p>NSure AI, which currently monitors and manages millions of transactions every month, has approved close to $1 billion in volume since going live in 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mac-reddin-7a275716b">Mac Reddin</a>, the co-founder and CEO of<a href="https://www.commsor.com/"> Commsor</a>, met the first professional investor for his company’s $16 million Series A on Lunch Club, a marketplace for 1:1 video introductions. Commsor, which sees itself as an operating system for community managers, then experienced firsthand the benefit of matching people within similar industries in an engaging, online setting.</p>
<p>It’s thus quite fitting that, months later, Commsor is adding a company to its tech stack that is focused on private networking within communities. Commsor has scooped up <a href="https://www.meetsy.io/">Meetsy</a>, a startup that helps people within communities facilitate creative and spontaneous conversations with each other. Meetsy, a fully bootstrapped business, was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/btramer/">Bradley Tramer</a> and sold for an undisclosed price.</p>
<p>Commsor launched months ago to be the solution that helps community managers prove that they’re not wasting the budget and their work is tied to real, valuable outcomes. Commsor could pull an insight like, “Here are three Google engineers that are using your [insert community platform name here]. so maybe it’s time to approach Google and ask if they want an enterprise contract.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pvDhJ1Ljay"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/chief-community-officer-is-the-new-cmo/">Chief community officer is the new CMO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chief community officer is the new CMO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/chief-community-officer-is-the-new-cmo/embed/#?secret=pvDhJ1Ljay" data-secret="pvDhJ1Ljay" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With the acquisition, Commsor’s ambition appears to be broadening a bit. In order for a community to be outwardly valuable to a business, it has to be inwardly healthy. The members have to connect, riff and have a chance to debate that shared interest that placed them there in the first place. Meetsy works within companies, matching employees to employees, alumni programs, and with venture capitalists that want their portfolio companies to connect with one another as well.</p>
<p>“If Commsor helps you prove the business value of community, and Meetsy helps you build a better community, those two together compound into an even bigger impact.”</p>
<p>Even as growing vaccination rates in the United States may turn on the faucet for in-person interactions, many think there will continue to be a virtual component to interactions, especially with distributed teams. Surely enough, the wave of super-connector apps has grown larger as remote work gets deeper roots. The aforementioned Lunch Club <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/01/lunchclub-tops-100-million-valuation-amid-quarantine-usage-spike.html">was last valued at $100 million,</a> Workvivo raised $16 million in financing and Gatheround landed a $3.5 million seed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/gatheround-raises-millions-from-homebrew-bloomberg-and-stripes-coo-to-help-remote-workers-connect/">round last month</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every virtual event tool I&#8217;ve seen how some sort of networking built into it, but it&#8217;s usually what I&#8217;d consider &#8216;dumb networking&#8217;,&#8221; Reddin said. He&#8217;s alluding to the common &#8220;speed dating&#8221; strategy of placing random people with each other for a few minutes, and then shuffling to repeat.</p>
<p>Meetsy, he said, has refined a robust matching system so a community manager can come in and define people by their self-chosen attributes. It can then fill out match rules based on guidelines for how they want matches to happen. For example, Meetsy could make sure that fintech VCs only meet fintech startups to spark a future investment, or that employees only can meet without employees outside of their current team to promote cross-collaboration.</p>
<p>“That way it&#8217;s not just smashing two rocks together and hoping sparks fly,” Reddin said.</p>
<p>The two companies will continue to exist underneath existing branding, but Meetsy users might be able to get a discount on Commsor or benefit from future bundling features. Meetsy has always been free to use but will experiment with new paid features in the future such as white-labeling capabilities, or a tier-system that requires companies to pay once they hit a certain scale of community members.</p>
<p>Tramer, the founder of Meetsy, said that combining tools with Commsor will help community managers “foster meaningful connection at scale and measure the impact of those connections.”</p>
<p>“In five years, I see &#8216;curated introductions&#8217; as a core pillar of community engagement alongside events and forums,” he said.</p>
