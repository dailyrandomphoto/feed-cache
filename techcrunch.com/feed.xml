										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Researchers at Harvard&#8217;s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering have created a set of fish-shaped underwater robots that can autonomously navigate and find each other, cooperating to perform tasks or just placidly school together.</p>
<p>Just as aerial drones are proving themselves useful in industry after industry, underwater drones could revolutionize ecology, shipping, and other areas where a persistent underwater presence is desirable but difficult.</p>
<p>The last few years have seen interesting new autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, but the most common type is pretty much a torpedo — efficient for cruising open water, but not for working one&#8217;s way through the nooks and crannies of a coral reef or marina.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>For that purpose, it seems practical to see what Nature herself has seen fit to create, and the Wyss Institute has made a specialty of doing so and creating robots and machinery in imitation of the natural world.</p>
<p>In this case Florian Berlinger, Melvin Gauci, and Radhika Nagpa, all co-authors on a new paper <a href="http://robotics.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.abd8668">published in Science Robotics</a>, decided to imitate not just the shape of a fish, but the way it interacts with its fellows as well.</p>
<p>Having been inspired by the sight of schooling fish during scuba diving, Nagpa has pursued the question: &#8220;How do we create artificial agents that can demonstrate this kind of collective coherence where a whole collective seems as if it’s a single agent?&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095527" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095527" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2095527" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of a fish-shaped robot" width="1024" height="463" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg 1425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg?resize=768,347 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg?resize=680,307 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095527" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Berlinger et al., Science Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>Their answer, Blueswarm, is a collection of small &#8220;Bluebots&#8221; 3D-printed in the shape of fish, with fins instead of propellers and cameras for eyes. Although neither you nor I is likely to mistake these for actual fish, they&#8217;re far less scary of an object for a normal fish to see than a six-foot metal tube with a propeller spinning loudly in the back. The Bluebots also imitate nature&#8217;s innovation of bioluminescence, lighting up with LEDs the way some fish and insects do to signal others. The LED pulses change and adjust depending on each bot&#8217;s position and knowledge of its neighbors.</p>
<p>Using the simple senses of cameras and a photosensor at the very front, elementary swimming motions, and the LEDs, Blueswarm automatically organizes itself into group swimming behaviors, establishing a simple &#8220;milling&#8221; pattern that accommodates new bots when they&#8217;re dropped in from any angle.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095530" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bluebot-behav.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095530" class="size-full wp-image-2095530" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bluebot-behav.jpg" alt="Images showing how &quot;bluebots&quot; swarm intelligently and find each other." width="1024" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095530" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Berlinger et al, Science Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>The robots can also work together on simple tasks, like searching for something. If the group is given the task of finding a red LED in the tank they&#8217;re in, they can each look independently, but when one of them finds it, it alters its own LED flashing to alert and summon the others.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to imagine uses for this tech. These robots could get closer to reefs and other natural features safely without alarming the sea life, monitoring their health or looking for specific objects their camera-eyes could detect. Or they could meander around underneath docks and ships inspecting hulls more efficiently than a single craft can. Perhaps they might even be useful in search and rescue.</p>
<p>The research also advances our understanding of how and why animals swarm together in the first place.</p>
<p>With this research, we cannot only build more advanced robot collectives, but also learn about collective intelligence in nature. Fish must follow even simpler behavior patterns when swimming in schools than our robots do. This simplicity is so beautiful yet hard to discover,&#8221; said Berlinger. &#8220;Other researchers have reached out to me already to use my Bluebots as fish surrogates for biological studies on fish swimming and schooling. The fact that they welcome Bluebot among their laboratory fish makes me very happy.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Most of the takes we received were bullish regarding Plaid's chances now that it's no longer being acquired.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Congratulations, you&#8217;re no longer selling your company for billions of dollars!</p>
<p>As strange as it sounds, that&#8217;s the leading perspective from venture capitalists concerning Plaid, now that its much-touted sale to Visa <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">has fallen apart</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/">$5.3 billion deal</a> would have seen banking API startup Plaid join consumer payments and credit giant Visa. But the American government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/doj-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visas-5-3-billion-acquisition-of-plaid/">took a dim view of the deal</a>, and according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-pro-rata-f84fa6ec-3db7-4274-aa3b-f71dbe1bd4f2.html">Axios reporting,</a> Plaid felt like it could be worth more money in time.</p>
<p>The TechCrunch team has collected views from venture capitalists, analysts and <a href="https://twitter.com/anshublog">Anshu Sharma</a>, CEO of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">another API-powered startup</a> and a former VC to get a better view on the perspectives in the market concerning the blockbuster breakup.</p>
<p>From the venture capital side of things, most takes we received were bullish regarding Plaid&#8217;s chances now that it&#8217;s no longer being taken over by Visa. <a href="https://twitter.com/amyecheetham?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Amy Cheetham</a>, for example, of <a href="https://twitter.com/costanoavc">Costanoa Ventures</a>, said that the result is &#8220;good for the company, ultimately.&#8221; She added that Plaid may now see better &#8220;talent acquisition,&#8221; faster product decisions and a better eventual valuation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is so much left for them to build in fintech infrastructure,&#8221; Cheetham said in an email, adding that she sees &#8220;Stripe-like scale potential&#8221; in Plaid. Stripe is reportedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/what-to-make-of-stripes-possible-100-billion-valuation/">raising capital at a valuation that could reach $100 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Cheetham is not alone in her bullish perspective. <a href="https://twitter.com/nicberardi?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Nico Berandi</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/ANIMOvc">Animo Ventures</a> wrote to TechCrunch to say that he &#8220;still wishes&#8221; that his firm had been &#8220;around back then to have invested&#8221; in Plaid, adding a smiley face at the end of his missive.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a move that could have wide ramifications across the tech landscape, Intel announced that <a href="http://vmware.com">VMware</a> CEO Pat Gelsinger would be replacing interim CEO Bob Swann at <a href="http://Intel.com">Intel</a> on February 15th. The question is why would he leave his job to run a struggling chip giant.</p>
<p>The bottom line is he has a long history with Intel, working with some of the biggest names in chip industry lore before he joined VMware in 2009. It has to be a thrill for him to go back to his roots and try to jump start the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was 18 years old when I joined Intel, fresh out of the Lincoln Technical Institute. Over the next 30 years of my tenure at Intel, I had the honor to be mentored at the feet of Grove, Noyce and Moore,&#8221; Gelsinger wrote in <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/note-from-pat-gelsinger-to-intel/">a blog post</a> announcing his new position.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Certainly Intel recognized that the history and that Gelsinger&#8217;s deep executive experience should help as the company attempts to compete in an increasingly aggressive chip industry landscape. &#8220;Pat is a proven technology leader with a distinguished track record of innovation, talent development, and a deep knowledge of Intel. He will continue a values-based cultural leadership approach with a hyper focus on operational execution,” Omar Ishrak, independent chairman of the Intel board said in a statement.</p>
<p>But Gelsinger is walking into a bit of a mess. As my colleague Danny Crichton wrote<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/semiconductors-in-2021/"> in his year-end review of the chip industry</a> last month, Intel is far behind its competitors, and it&#8217;s going to be tough to play catch-up:</p>
<blockquote><p>Intel has made numerous strategic blunders in the past two decades, most notably completely missing out on the smartphone revolution and also the custom silicon market that has come to prominence in recent years. It’s also just generally fallen behind in chip fabrication, an area it once dominated and is now behind Taiwan-based TSMC, Crichton wrote.</p></blockquote>

<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy agrees with this assertion, saying that Swan was dealt a bad hand, walking in to clean up a mess that has years long timelines. While Gelsinger faces similar issues, Moorhead thinks he can refocus the company. &#8220;I am not foreseeing any major strategic changes with Gelsinger, but I do expect him to focus on the company&#8217;s engineering culture and get it back to an execution culture&#8221; Moorhead told me.</p>
<p>The announcement comes against the backdrop of massive chip industry consolidation last year with over $100 billion changing hands in four deals with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/13/nvidia-confirms-40b-purchase-of-arm-bringing-together-two-chip-giants/">NVidia nabbing ARM </a>for $40 billion, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/amd-grabs-xilinx-for-35-billion-as-chip-industry-consolidation-continues/">$35 billion AMD-Xilink deal</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/analog-devices-to-acquire-rival-chipmaker-maxim-integrated-for-21-billion/">Analog snagging Maxim</a> for $21 billion and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/more-chip-industry-action-as-marvell-is-acquiring-inphi-for-10b/">Marvell grabbing Inphi</a> for a mere $10 billion, not to mention <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/intel-agrees-to-sell-its-nand-business-to-sk-hynix-for-9-billion/">Intel dumping its memory unit to SK Hynix for $9 billion</a>.</p>
<p>As for VMware, it has to find a new CEO now. As Moorhead says, the obvious choice would be current COO Sanjay Poonen, but for the time being, it will be CFO Zane Rowe serving as interim CEO, rather than Poonen. In fact, it appears that the company will be casting a wider net than internal options. The official announcement states, &#8220;VMware’s Board of Directors is initiating a global executive search process to name a permanent CEO&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research says it will be up to Michael Dell who to hand the reins to, but he believes Gelsinger was stuck at Dell and would not get a broader role, so he left.</p>
<p>&#8220;VMware has a deep bench, but it will be up to Michael Dell to get a CEO who can innovate on the software side and keep the unique DNA of VMware inside the Dell portfolio going strong, Dell needs the deeper profits of this business for its turnaround,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The stock market seems to like the move for Intel with the company stock up 7.26%, but not so much for VMware, whose stock was down close to the same amount at 7.72% as went to publication.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today shares of Affirm, a buy-now-pay-later unicorn, started trading above $90 per share, far above <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/wall-street-hugs-affirm-as-it-starts-life-as-a-public-company/">its $49 per-share IPO price</a>, a figure that was already miles above the company’s early expectations.</p>
<p>The pop comes after Affirm raised its pricing range earlier this week, to $41 to $44 per share, up from an initial range of $33 to $38 per share. To see the company double from its raised price implies strong demand for its shares, a thin float, or both.</p>
<p>Affirm’s explosive debut comes on the heels of similarly-strong results from DoorDash, C3.ai, and Airbnb. Those companies’ debuts were so strong that Roblox delayed its IPO, later swapping a traditional IPO for a direct listing to get around the pricing issue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IPO delays are bumming me out&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/ipo-delays-are-bumming-me-out/embed/#?secret=SnVbCF9tyr" data-secret="SnVbCF9tyr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today’s IPO shows that the same dynamics that were at play in those IPOs have persisted into 2021. More public debuts are expected in Q1, including Coinbase, another well-known unicorn. Other names like Robinhood, Bumble, and others are in the wings.</p>
<p>Affirm’s first-day performance will certainly raise eyebrows from regular critics of the traditional IPO process. But the company did raise more money than it perhaps anticipated, and is having a raucous first-day’s trading, so it’s hard to fret too much for the company. If its share price is still as high in a month as it is today, perhaps it was as underpriced as some will claim.</p>
<p><strong>Fintech</strong></p>
<p>Affirm’s pricing brings a green splash to a busy week for fintech giants. Yesterday, Visa’s $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid failed to go through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">due to regulatory concerns</a>. While the fallen deal could have a chilling effect on fintech startups, Plaid told TechCrunch that it saw 60% customer growth in 2020, bringing it to more than 4,000 clients. Plaid’s next step, per many in the VC and tech community, will be even bigger than its once-planned $5.3 billion dollar exit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The FTC has reached a settlement with Flo, a period and fertility tracking app with 100 million+ users, over allegations it shared users&#8217; health data with third-party app analytics and marketing services like Facebook despite promising to keep users&#8217; sensitive health data private.</p>
<p>Flo must obtain an independent review of its privacy practices and obtain app users’ consent before sharing their health information under the terms of the proposed settlement.</p>
<p>The action follows a 2019 reports in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636">Wall Street Journal</a> that conducted an analysis of a number of apps&#8217; data sharing activity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It found the fertility tracking app had informed Facebook of in-app activity &#8212; such as when a user was having their period or had informed it of an intention to get pregnant. It did not find any way for Flo users to prevent their health information from being sent to Facebook.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/developer-popular-womens-fertility-tracking-app-settles-ftc">announcement</a> of a proposed settlement today, the FTC said press coverage of Flo sharing users data with third-party app analytics and marketing firms including Facebook and Google had led to hundreds of complaints.</p>
<p>The app only stopped leaking users&#8217; health data following the negative press coverage, it added.</p>
<p>Under the FTC settlement terms, Flo is prohibited from misrepresenting the purposes<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> for which it (or entities to whom it discloses data) collect, maintain, use or disclose the data; how much consumers can control these data uses; its compliance with any privacy, security or compliance program; and how it collects, maintains, uses, discloses, deletes or protects users’ personal information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Flo must also notify affected users about the disclosure of their personal information and instruct any third party that received users’ health information to destroy that data.</span></p>
<p>The app maker has been contacted for comment.</p>
<p>No financial penalty is being levied but the FTC&#8217;s proposed settlement is noteworthy as it&#8217;s the first time the U.S. regulator has ordered notice of a privacy action.</p>
<p>“Apps that collect, use and share sensitive health information can provide valuable services but consumers need to be able to trust these apps. We are looking closely at whether developers of health apps are keeping their promises and handling sensitive health information responsibly,&#8221; said Andrew Smith, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.</p>
<p>While the settlement received unanimous backing from five commissioners, two &#8212; Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter &#8212; have issued a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1586018/20210112_final_joint_rcrks_statement_on_flo.pdf">joint dissent statement </a>in which they highlight the lack of a finding of a breach of a health breach notification rule that they argue should have applied in this case.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/RKSlaughterFTC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RKSlaughterFTC</a> and I also believe that Flo violated the <a href="https://twitter.com/FTC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FTC</a> Health Breach Notification Rule.</p>
<p>Congress directed the FTC to protect our sensitive health data through this rule, to complement HIPAA, but the agency has never brought an action under this rule. This should change.</p>
<p>&mdash; Rohit Chopra (@chopraftc) <a href="https://twitter.com/chopraftc/status/1349392413379461124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;In our view, the FTC should have charged Flo with violating the Health Breach Notification Rule. Under the rule, Flo was obligated to notify its users after it allegedly shared their health information with Facebook, Google and others without their authorization. Flo did not do so, making the company liable under the rule,&#8221; they write.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Health Breach Notification Rule was first issued more than a decade ago, but the explosion in connected health apps make its requirements more important than ever. While we would prefer to see substantive limits on firms’ ability to collect and monetize our personal information, the rule at least ensures that services like Flo need to come clean when they experience privacy or security breaches. Over time, this may induce firms to take greater care in collecting and monetizing our most sensitive information,&#8221; they add.</p>
<p>Flo is by no means the only period tracking app to have attracted attention for leaking user data in recent years.</p>
<p>A report last year by the Norwegian Consumer Council found fertility/period tracker apps Clue and MyDays unexpectedly sharing data with adtech giants Facebook and Google, for example.</p>

<p>That report also found similarly nontransparent data leaking going on across a range of apps, including dating, religious, make-up and kids apps &#8212; suggesting widespread breaches of regional data processing laws, which require that for consent to be valid users must be properly informed and given a genuine free choice. Although app makers have so far faced little enforcement for analytics/marketing-related data leaking in the region.</p>
<p>In the U.S. regulatory action around apps hinges on misleading claims &#8212; whether about privacy (in Flo&#8217;s case) or in relation to the purposes of data processing, as in a separate settlement the FTC put out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/ftc-settlement-with-ever-orders-data-and-ais-deleted-after-facial-recognition-pivot/">earlier this week</a> related to cloud storage app Ever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Researchers have created a machine learning system that they claim can determine a person&#8217;s political party, with reasonable accuracy, based only on their face. The study, from a group that also showed that sexual preference can seemingly be inferred this way, candidly addresses and carefully avoids the pitfalls of &#8220;modern phrenology,&#8221; leading to the uncomfortable conclusion that our appearance may express more personal information that we think.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared this week <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79310-1">in the Nature journal Scientific Reports</a>, was conducted by Stanford University&#8217;s Michal Kosinski. Kosinski made headlines in 2017 with work that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/ai-that-can-determine-a-persons-sexuality-from-photos-shows-the-dark-side-of-the-data-age/">found that a person&#8217;s sexual preference could be predicted from facial data</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AI that can determine a person&#8217;s sexuality from photos shows the dark side of the data age&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/ai-that-can-determine-a-persons-sexuality-from-photos-shows-the-dark-side-of-the-data-age/embed/#?secret=WfeYGzoXyu" data-secret="WfeYGzoXyu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The study drew criticism not so much for its methods but for the very idea that something that&#8217;s notionally non-physical could be detected this way. But Kosinski&#8217;s work, as he explained then and afterwards, was done specifically to challenge those assumptions and was as surprising and disturbing to him as it was to others. The idea was not to build a kind of AI gaydar — quite the opposite, in fact. As the team wrote at the time, it was necessary to publish in order to warn others that such a thing may be built by people whose interests went beyond the academic:</p>
<blockquote><p>We were really disturbed by these results and spent much time considering whether they should be made public at all. We did not want to enable the very risks that we are warning against. The ability to control when and to whom to reveal one’s sexual orientation is crucial not only for one’s well-being, but also for one’s safety.</p>
<p>We felt that there is an urgent need to make policymakers and LGBTQ communities aware of the risks that they are facing. We did not create a privacy-invading tool, but rather showed that basic and widely used methods pose serious privacy threats.</p></blockquote>
<p>Similar warnings may be sounded here, for while political affiliation at least in the U.S. (and at least at present) is not <em>as</em> sensitive or personal an element as sexual preference, it is still sensitive and personal. A week hardly passes without reading of some political or religious &#8220;dissident&#8221; or another being arrested or killed. If oppressive regimes could obtain what passes for probable cause by saying &#8220;the algorithm flagged you as a possible extremist,&#8221; instead of for example intercepting messages, it makes this sort of practice that much easier and more scalable.</p>
<p>The algorithm itself is not some hyper-advanced technology. Kosinski&#8217;s paper describes a fairly ordinary process of feeding a machine learning system images of more than a million faces, collected from dating sites in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., as well as American Facebook users. The people whose faces were used identified as politically conservative or liberal as part of the site&#8217;s questionnaire.</p>
<p>The algorithm was based on open-source facial recognition software, and after basic processing to crop to just the face (that way no background items creep in as factors), the faces are reduced to 2,048 scores representing various features — as with other face recognition algorithms these aren&#8217;t necessary intuitive thinks like &#8220;eyebrow color&#8221; and &#8220;nose type&#8221; but more computer-native concepts.</p>

<p>The system was given political affiliation data sourced from the people themselves, and with this it diligently began to study the differences between the facial stats of people identifying as conservatives and those identifying as liberal. Because it turns out, there are differences.</p>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s not as simple as &#8220;conservatives have bushier eyebrows&#8221; or &#8220;liberals frown more.&#8221; Nor does it come down to demographics, which would make things too easy and simple. After all, if political party identification correlates with both age and skin color, that makes for a simple prediction algorithm right there. But although the software mechanisms used by Kosinski are quite standard, he was careful to cover his bases in order that this study, like the last one, can&#8217;t be dismissed as pseudoscience.</p>
<p>The most obvious way of addressing this is by having the system make guesses as to the political party of people of the same age, gender, and ethnicity. The test involved being presented with two faces, one of each party, and guessing which was which. Obviously chance accuracy is 50 percent. Humans aren&#8217;t very good at this task, performing only slightly above chance, about 55 percent accurate.</p>
<p>The algorithm managed to reach as high as 71 percent accurate when predicting political party between two like individuals, and 73 percent when presented with two individuals of any age, ethnicity, or gender (but still guaranteed to be one conservative, one liberal).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095268" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/kosinski-chart1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095268" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2095268" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/kosinski-chart1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="671" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/kosinski-chart1.png 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/kosinski-chart1.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/kosinski-chart1.png?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/kosinski-chart1.png?resize=768,503 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/kosinski-chart1.png?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/kosinski-chart1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095268" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Michael Kosinski / Nature Scientific Reports</p></div></p>
<p>Getting three out of four may not seem like a triumph for modern AI, but considering people can barely do better than a coin flip, there seems to be something worth considering here. Kosinski has been careful to cover other bases as well; this doesn&#8217;t appear to be a statistical anomaly or exaggeration of an isolated result.</p>
<p>The idea that your political party may be written on your face is an unnerving one, for while one&#8217;s political leanings are far from the most private of info, it&#8217;s also something that is very reasonably thought of as being intangible. People may choose to express their political beliefs with a hat, pin, or t-shirt, but one generally considers one&#8217;s face to be nonpartisan.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering which facial features in particular are revealing, unfortunately the system is unable to report that. In a sort of para-study, Kosinski isolated a couple dozen facial features (facial hair, directness of gaze, various emotions) and tested whether those were good predictors of politics, but none led to more than a small increase in accuracy over chance or human expertise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Head orientation and emotional expression stood out: Liberals tended to face the camera more directly, were more likely to express surprise, and less likely to express disgust,&#8221; Kosinski wrote in author&#8217;s notes for the paper. But what they added left more than 10 percentage points of accuracy not accounted for: &#8220;That indicates that the facial recognition algorithm found many other features revealing political orientation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The knee-jerk defense of &#8220;this can&#8217;t be true &#8211; phrenology was snake oil&#8221; doesn&#8217;t hold much water here. It&#8217;s scary to think it&#8217;s true, but it doesn&#8217;t help us to deny what could be a very important truth, since it could be used against people very easily.</p>
<p>As with the sexual orientation research, the point here is not to create a perfect detector for this information, but to show that it can be done in order that people begin to consider the dangers that creates. If for example an oppressive theocratic regime wanted to crack down on either non-straight people or those with a certain political leaning, this sort of technology gives them a plausible technological method to do so &#8220;objectively.&#8221; And what&#8217;s more, it can be done with very little work or contact with the target, unlike digging through their social media history or analyzing their purchases (also very revealing).</p>
<p>We have already heard of China deploying facial recognition software to find members of the embattled Uyghur religious minority. And in our own country this sort of AI is trusted by authorities as well — it&#8217;s not hard to imagine police using the &#8220;latest technology&#8221; to, for instance, classify faces at a protest, saying &#8220;these 10 were determined by the system as being the most liberal,&#8221; or what have you.</p>
<p>The idea that a couple researchers using open-source software and a medium-sized database of faces (for a government, this is trivial to assemble in the unlikely possibility they do not have one already) could do so anywhere in the world, for any purpose, is chilling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot the messenger,&#8221; said Kosinski. &#8220;In my work, I am warning against widely used facial recognition algorithms. Worryingly, those AI physiognomists are now being used to judge people&#8217;s intimate traits &#8211; scholars, policymakers, and citizens should take notice.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The move to make the blanket ban and effectively shutter Airbnb&#8217;s in and around DC ahead of the Inauguration came after the company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/ahead-of-inauguration-airbnb-pledges-bans-for-anyone-involved-in-capitol-riot/">committed to review guest bookings</a> in an attempt to ensure that no one associated with last week&#8217;s riot at the Capitol used the service to return during the lead up to the Inauguration.</p>

<div class="post__entryContent ">
<p>&#8220;Today, in response to various local, state and federal officials asking people not to travel to Washington, D.C., we are announcing that Airbnb will cancel reservations in the Washington, D.C. metro area during the Inauguration week,&#8221; the company said in a statement. &#8220;Additionally, we will prevent any new reservations in the Washington, D.C. area from being booked during that time by blocking such reservations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guests whose reservations had been canceled are receiving a full refund, and the company said it would reimburse hosts for the money they would have earned from the canceled reservations. The company said that <a href="https://www.hoteltonight.com/">HotelTonight</a> reservations also will be canceled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Airbnb’s work continues to be informed by inputs from our local host community as well as Washington, D.C. officials, Metro Police and Members of Congress throughout this week. In particular, Mayor Bowser, Governor Hogan and Governor Northam have been clear that visitors should not travel to the D.C. Metro area for the Inauguration,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;Additionally, we are aware of reports emerging yesterday afternoon regarding armed militias and known hate groups that are attempting to travel and disrupt the Inauguration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Airbnb has also been assisting the law enforcement in their investigations into what happened at the Capitol last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we’ve learned through media or law enforcement sources the names of individuals confirmed to have been responsible for the violent criminal activity at the United States Capitol on January 6, we’ve investigated whether the named individuals have an account on Airbnb,&#8221; the company said<em>. &#8220;</em>Through this work, we have identified numerous individuals who are either associated with known hate groups or otherwise involved in the criminal activity at the Capitol Building, and they have been banned from Airbnb’s platform.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After launching in October, <a href="https://www.tradeswell.com">Tradeswell</a> is announcing today that it has raised $15.5 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Paul Palmieri previously led digital ad company Millennial Media (now owned by TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company Verizon Media), and he said the e-commerce market today is similar to the online ad market when he was leading Millennial — ready for more optimization and automation.</p>
<p>Tradeswell focuses on six components of e-commerce businesses — marketing, retail, inventory, logistics, forecasting, lifetime value and financials — with the key goal of allowing those businesses to improve their net margins, rather than simply driving more clicks or purchases. The platform can fully automate some processes, such as buying online ads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To illustrate what it can accomplish, Tradeswell pointed to the work it did with a personal care brand on Amazon Prime Day, with total sales doubling versus the previous Prime Day and profits increasing 67%.</p>
<p>The startup has now raised a total of $18.8 million. The Series A was led by SignalFire, which also led Tradeswell&#8217;s seed round, while Construct Capital, Allen &amp; Company and The Emerson Group also participated.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="MvMg2IsZAg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/tradeswell/">Millennial Media&#8217;s Paul Palmieri launches Tradeswell, a startup promising to fix e-commerce margins</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Millennial Media&#8217;s Paul Palmieri launches Tradeswell, a startup promising to fix e-commerce margins&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/tradeswell/embed/#?secret=MvMg2IsZAg" data-secret="MvMg2IsZAg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;With the explosion of ecommerce over the past year, Tradeswell is perfectly positioned to help brands manage the complexity of online sales across an ever-increasing number of platforms and marketplaces,&#8221; said SignalFire founder and CEO Chris Farmer in a statement. &#8220;Paul and his team bring together a unique blend of experience in data, marketing and logistics to address the challenges of today and a rapidly evolving market in the years ahead with a central command center to optimize profitable growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Palmieri said the new funding will allow Tradeswell to continue investing in the product, which will also mean building more integrations so that more types of data become &#8220;more liquid,&#8221; which in turn means that the platform can &#8220;make much more real-time decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>When<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/tradeswell/"> Tradeswell launched publicly last fall</a>, it already had 100 customers, and Palmieri told me that number has subsequently grown past 150. Nor does he expect the consumer shift in e-commerce to disappear once the pandemic ends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of it probably goes back to the way it was, some of it stays online,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I do think it’s important to point out there’s something in the middle — that something is this notion of high convenience, that is semi-brick-and-mortar with [elements of e-commerce], whether that&#8217;s mobile ordering or something like an Instacart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Naturally, he sees Tradeswell as the key platform to help businesses navigate that shift.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GoPro may have started out at the intersection of capability and affordability in the action cam space, but since then it has increasingly leaned towards use by professionals or deployment by businesses. The latest features, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2021/">announced at CES</a>, underline that priority, making the cameras simpler and more automated for rentals and hands-free operation.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got a Hero 7, 8, or 9 Black, or Max, you should be able to download the latest GoPro Labs firmware, which adds the following convenient features.</p>
<p>Motion and USB power triggers: Set the camera to start and stop recording either when power flows to it (in a dash cam situation, for instance) or when in motion (for a bike or ski helmet perhaps). Motion detection is also improved and now works in all video modes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The cameras can already perform various tasks upon scanning QR codes, but here&#8217;s a new one: you can use a QR code to tell a device to connect to a specific wi-fi network and start streaming. It&#8217;s faster than using the app for when you need a quick deployment.</p>
<p>An obvious one for tourism is the &#8220;one button mode,&#8221; which as you might expect limits the controls to starting and stopping video capture. Great both for the less tech-savvy on vacation who can&#8217;t handle more than one button&#8217;s worth of controls, and also for rental joints tired of their cameras coming back with weird custom settings after an overly tech-savvy customer tweaks them.</p>
<p>There are a few other improvements, which you can <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-gopro-labs-firmware-launches-unlocking-advanced-features-for-gopro-cameras-301207510.html">check out at the press release</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://drata.com/">Drata</a>, a startup that helps businesses get their SOC 2 compliance, today <a href="https://drata.com/blog/drata-funding-announcement">announced</a> that it has raised a $3.2 million seed round led by Cowboy Ventures and that it is coming out of stealth. Other investors include Leaders Fund, SV Angel and a group of angel investors.</p>
<p>Like similar services, Drata helps businesses automate a lot of the evidence collection as they prepare for a SOC 2 audit. The focus of the service is obviously on running tests against the SOC 2 framework to help businesses prepare for their audit (and to prepare the right materials for the auditor). To do so, it features integrations with a lot of <a href="https://drata.com/integrations?tab=all">standard online business tools</a> and cloud services to regularly pull in data. One nifty feature is that it also lets you step through all of the various sections of the SOC 2 criteria to check your current readiness for an audit.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, tools like Drata are meant to get you through an audit, but at the same time, the idea here is also to give you a better idea of your own security posture. For that, Drata offers continuous control monitoring, as well as tools to track if your employees have turned on all the right controls on their work computers, for example. Since companies have to regularly renew their certification, too, Drata can help them to continuously collect all of the data for their renewal, something that previously often involved boring &#8212; and quickly forgotten &#8212; manual tasks like taking screenshots of various settings every month or so.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Drata co-founder and CEO Adam Markowitz worked on the space shuttle engines after graduating from college and then launched his own startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/portfolium-raises-6-2-million-to-get-college-students-into-jobs-where-theyll-kick-butt/">Portfolium</a>, after that program ended. Portfolium, which helped students showcase their work in the form of &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; a portfolio, eventually sold to <a href="https://www.instructure.com/">Instructure</a> in 2019, where Markowitz stayed on until he launched Drata last June, together with a group of former Portfolium founders and engineers. Besides Markowitz, the co-founders include CTO <a href="https://t.sidekickopen70.com/s2t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8cVHTfW1K7Z1759hl3kW7_k2841CXdp3VPwQ-D1FW0ZcW2dykf-2yd9Jy101?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW4mKLS-3ZWVWBW3K2-zv1JxwY5W1Lyz993H3b41w3K6kSZ4902&amp;si=8000000003919017&amp;pi=b28426e8-8e88-49a3-fbde-6d5199629be8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://t.sidekickopen70.com/s2t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8cVHTfW1K7Z1759hl3kW7_k2841CXdp3VPwQ-D1FW0ZcW2dykf-2yd9Jy101?te%3DW3R5hFj4cm2zwW4mKLS-3ZWVWBW3K2-zv1JxwY5W1Lyz993H3b41w3K6kSZ4902%26si%3D8000000003919017%26pi%3Db28426e8-8e88-49a3-fbde-6d5199629be8&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610642043064000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVFsNTZQoIRDluQEDexu3CIAzPpg">Daniel Marashlian</a> and CRO Troy Markowitz. It was the team&#8217;s experience seeing companies go through the audit process, which has traditionally been a drawn-out and manual process, that led them to look at building their own solution.</p>
<p>The company already managed to sign up a number of customers ahead of its official launch.

As Markowitz told me, even though Drata already had customers who were using the service to prepare for their audits, the team wanted to remain in stealth mode until it had used its own tool to go through its own audit. With that out of the way, and Drata receiving its SOC 2 certification, it&#8217;s now ready to come out of stealth.</p>
<p>As the number of companies that need to go through these kinds of audits increases, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that we&#8217;re also seeing a growing number of companies that aim to automate much of this process. With that, unsurprisingly, the number of VC investments in this space also continues to increase. In recent months, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/secureframe-raises-4-5m-to-help-businesses-speed-up-their-compliance-audits/">Secureframe</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/strike-graph-raises-3-9m-to-help-automate-security-audits/">Strike Graph</a> announced their own funding rounds, for example.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://openbase.com/">Openbase</a> founder Lior Grossman started his company the way that many founders do &#8212; to solve a problem he was having. In this case, it was finding the right open source components to build his software. He decided to build something to solve the problem, and Openbase was born.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $3.65 million seed round led by Zeev Ventures with participation from Y Combinator and 20 individual tech industry investors. Openbase was a member of the YC 2020 cohort.</p>
<p>Grossman says that being part of YC helped him meet investors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/here-are-the-94-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-2/">especially on Demo Day</a> when hundreds of investors listened in. &#8220;I would say that being part of YC definitely gave us a higher profile, and exposed us to some investors that I didn&#8217;t know before. It definitely opened doors for us,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As developers build modern software, they often use open source components to help build the application, and Openbase helps them find the best one for their purposes. &#8220;Openbase basically helps developers choose from among millions of open source packages,&#8221; Grossman told me.</p>
<p>The database includes 1.5 million JavaScript packages today with support for additional languages including Python and Go in beta. The way it works is that users search for a package based on their requirements and get a set of results. From there, they can compare components and judge them based on user reviews and other detailed insights.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095820" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095820" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2095820" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Openbase-Web-Package-Page-Viewport.png?w=680" alt="Openbase data screen gives detailed insights on the chosen package including popularity and similar packages." width="680" height="398" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Openbase-Web-Package-Page-Viewport.png 2025w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Openbase-Web-Package-Page-Viewport.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Openbase-Web-Package-Page-Viewport.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Openbase-Web-Package-Page-Viewport.png?resize=768,449 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Openbase-Web-Package-Page-Viewport.png?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Openbase-Web-Package-Page-Viewport.png?resize=1536,899 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Openbase-Web-Package-Page-Viewport.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095820" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Openbase</p></div></p>
<p>Grossman found that his idea began resonating with developers shortly after he launched in 2019. In fact, he reports that he went from zero to half a million users in the first year without any marketing beyond word of mouth. That&#8217;s when he decided to apply to Y Combinator and got into the Summer 2020 class.</p>
<p>The database is free for developers and that has helped build the user base so quickly. Eventually he hopes to monetize by allowing certain companies to promote their packages on the system. He says that these will be clearly marked and that the plan is to have only one promoted package per category. What&#8217;s more, they will retain all their user reviews and other associated data, regardless of whether it&#8217;s being promoted or not.</p>
<p>Grossman started the company on his own, but has added 5 employees with plans to hire more people this year to keep growing the startup. As an immigrant founder, he is sensitive to diversity and sees building a diverse company as a key goal. &#8220;I built this company as an immigrant myself [&#8230;] and I want to build an inclusive culture with people from different backgrounds because I think that will produce the best environment to foster innovation,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>So far the company has been fully remote, but the plan is to open an office post-pandemic. He says he sees a highly flexible approach to work though with people spending some days in the office and some at home. &#8220;I think for our culture this hybrid approach will work. Whenever we expand further I obviously imagine having more offices and not only our office in San Francisco.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The United States has, over the past few decades, been extremely lenient on antitrust enforcement, rarely blocking deals, even with overseas competitors.

		<blockquote>
			Antitrust won’t kill acquisitions in general, but it could prevent the buyers with the highest reserve prices from entering the fray.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Many, many, many other deals of course get through the gauntlet of regulations, but even a few smoke signals is enough to start raising concerns. That new calculus is even before we start to look at the morass of reforms being proposed around antitrust in Washington, D.C. these days, nearly all of which — on a bipartisan basis — would create stricter controls for antitrust, particularly in critical technology industries and information services.</p>
<p>So, what’s the valuation prognosis for startups these days given that one of the most important exit options available is increasingly looking fraught?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.iziwork.com">Iziwork</a> has raised a $43 million funding round. Cathay Innovation and Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund are participating in this funding round. The company has been building a platform focused on improving temporary employment.</p>
<p>While it’s a relatively large funding round, the startup is quite young. It was founded in September 2018 and it has raised $68 million overall.</p>
<p>Iziwork manages a marketplace of temporary work. 2,000 companies are using the platform in France and Italy. 800,000 candidates have used the app to access job opportunities. You can consider it as a tech-enabled version of the good old employment agency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Candidates can onboard directly from the mobile app. You then get personalized recommendations based on your profile. 95% of assignments are filled in less than 4 hours. And of course, all your documents are managed from the app.</p>
<p>Iziwork tries to add some benefits to compensate the fact that temporary workers often jump from one company to another. For instance, you get a time savings account, you can request a down payment on your pay every week, etc.</p>
<p>The startup has realized that it can’t open offices in every big and intermediate city. That’s why third-party companies can join the Iziwork network. As a partner, you find new clients and new job opportunities. You can then leverage Iziwork’s app, service and pool of candidates.</p>
<p>This is an interesting strategy as it greatly increases supply on the Iziwork marketplace. Partners get a revenue sharing deal with Iziwork.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand to new countries and improve its tech product. There are still some growth opportunities in its existing markets as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com">Jobandtalent</a>, another company in this space, has attracted some headlines as it has raised $108 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/jobandtalent-tops-up-with-108m-for-its-workforce-as-a-service-platform/">last week</a>. Founded in 2009 and based in Madrid, it has generated €500 million in revenue last year.</p>
<p>But, let’s be honest, the temporary work market is huge. Adecco, Randstad and other legacy players still represent a bigger threat for this recent wave of temp staffing startups. Let&#8217;s see how it plays out in the coming years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last we heard from Luther.ai, the startup was participating in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/luther-ai-is-a-new-ai-tool-that-acts-like-google-for-personal-conversations/">TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield</a> in September. The company got a lot of attention from that appearance, which culminated in a $3.2 million seed round it announced today. While they were at it, the founders decided to change the company name to <a href="https://www.hu.man.ai/">Human AI</a>, which they believe better reflects their mission.</p>
<p>Differential VC led the round joined by Village Global VC, Good Friends VC, Beni VC and Keshif Ventures. David Magerman from Differential will join the startup&#8217;s Board.</p>
<p>The investors were attracted to Human AI&#8217;s personalized kind of artificial intelligence, and co-founder and CEO Suman Kanuganti says that the Battlefield appearance led directly to investor interest, which quickly resulted in a deal four weeks later.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think overall the messaging of what we delivered at TechCrunch Disrupt regarding an individual personal AI that is secured by blockchain to retain and recall [information] really set the stage for what the company is all about, both from a user standpoint as well as from an investor standpoint,&#8221; Kanuganti told me.</p>
<p>As for the name change, he reported that there was some confusion in the market that Luther was an AI assistant like Alexa or a chatbot, and the founders wanted the name to better reflect the personalized nature of the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are creating AI for the individual and there is so much emphasis on the authenticity and the voice and the thoughts of an individual, and how we also use blockchain to secure ownership of the data. So most of the principle lies in creating this AI for an individual human. So we thought, let&#8217;s call it Human AI,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>As Kanuganti <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/luther-ai-is-a-new-ai-tool-that-acts-like-google-for-personal-conversations/">described it in September,</a> the tool allows individuals to search for nuggets of information from past events using a variety of AI technologies:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s made possible through a convergence of neuroscience, NLP and blockchain to deliver seamless in-the-moment recall. GPT-3 is built on the memories of the public internet, while Luther is built on the memories of your private self.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The company is still in the process of refining the product and finding its audience, but reports that so far they have found interest from creative people such as writers, professionals such as therapists, high tech workers interested in AI, students looking to track school work and seniors looking for a way to track their memories for memoir purposes. All of these groups have the common theme of having to find nuggets of information from a ton of signals and that&#8217;s where Human AI&#8217;s strength lies.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s diverse founding team includes two women, CTO Sharon Zhang and designer Kristie Kaiser, along with Kanuganti, who is himself an immigrant. The founders want to continue building a diverse organization as they add employees. &#8220;I think in general we just want to attract a diverse kind of talent, especially because we are also Human AI and we believe that everyone should have the same opportunity,&#8221; Zhang told me.</p>
<p>The company currently has 7 full time employees and a dozen consultants, but with the new funding is looking to hire engineers and AI talent and a head of marketing to push the notion of consumer AI. While the company is remote today and has employees around the world, it will look to build a headquarters at some point post-COVID where some percentage of the employees can work in the same space together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin is set to launch one of its New Shepard rockets as early as tomorrow, January 14 at 9:45 AM CST (10:45 AM EST) for its first mission of 2021. This is a big one for the Jeff Bezos-founded space company, too – it includes upgrades to the crew capsule atop the rocket that are designed to improve the astronaut experience, a key preparatory step as the company approaches its first actual human spaceflight missions.</p>
<p>New Shepard has flown 13 times previously, and carried a number of different payloads to suborbital space before returning to Earth. The reusable launch vehicle aims to ultimately provide rides to space for people, too – and while there&#8217;s no stated timeline for this actually happening, tomorrow&#8217;s mission is a strong sign that it could be taking place sometime relatively soon.</p>
<p>Crew-focused upgrades flying on this New Shepard launch for the first time include acoustic and temperature regulation equipment, display panels that provide information to anyone who would be on board, and push-to-talk communications systems installed in each of the crew capsule&#8217;s six seats. One of those seats will have a life-size test article on board, a humanoid flight dummy named Mannequin Skywalker that Blue Origin uses to measure various aspects of the vehicle&#8217;s performance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;ll test astronaut safety alert systems that Blue Origin intends to include on the final flight system, and it&#8217;ll also carry a payload with a very different purpose – 50,000 postcards provided by school kids around the world to the Blue Origin non-profit Club for the Future.</p>
<p>The mission will be broadcast live by Blue Origin via its website and YouTube channel (embedded below) and you can expect the stream to begin around 30 minutes prior to launch time, so at around 10:15 AM EST (7:15 AM PST).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We could be looking at a 2021 IPO market that resembles last year's heated results.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">And we&#8217;re off to the races!</p>
<p>Last night, Affirm priced its IPO above its raised range <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112006165/en/Affirm-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering">at $49 per share</a>, a sign that the public markets remain hungry for new listings. Provided that Affirm today trades similarly to how it priced, we could be looking at a 2021 IPO market that resembles last year&#8217;s heated results.</p>

<hr />
<p>That&#8217;s good news for a host of companies looking to follow in the financial technology unicorn&#8217;s footsteps.</p>
<p>Poshmark prices tonight and trades tomorrow. With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/unpacking-qualtrics-brand-new-s-1-filing/">Qualtrics in the wings</a> along <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">with Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">Roblox set to direct list</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/bumble-reportedly-filed-confidentially-for-an-ipo/">Bumble said to file as well</a>, we&#8217;re heading into another busy IPO quarter. Affirm&#8217;s first-day trading results will therefore hold extra importance, even if its pricing augurs well for IPOs more generally.</p>

Pricing at $49 is a victory. Briefly, why, and then a thought about what&#8217;s next for the IPO market.</p>
<h2>Affirm</h2>
<p>What does Affirm sell? First, per <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465921002724/tm2026663-17_s1a.htm">its S-1 filings</a>, it charges merchants a fee to &#8220;convert a sale and power a payment.&#8221; That sounds like software revenues, albeit not in the recurring manner of a SaaS company.</p>
<p>Second, Affirm earns from &#8220;interest income [from] the simple interest loans that we purchase from our originating bank partners.&#8221; And, it offers virtual cards to consumers via its app, allowing it to generate interchange revenues.</p>
<p>We care about all of that as it&#8217;s important to realize that Affirm is <em>not </em>a software company in the context that we usually think about them, namely software as a service, or SaaS.</p>
<p>This matters when we consider how the market values Affirm; the more richly Affirm is valued in revenue-multiple terms by its new, $39 per-share IPO price, the more bullish we can presume the IPO market is.</p>
<p>What are Affirm&#8217;s gross margins? A great question, and one that is surprisingly hard to answer. If you read its final S-1 filing, you&#8217;ll find that all its chatter concerning &#8220;contribution profit&#8221; has been removed. This is a shame to some degree as contribution profit — and margin — were Affirm&#8217;s closest shared cognate to gross margin.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s estimated that there were some <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8326056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">50 billion connected devices</a> globally in 2020, and while that really says a lot about how far we&#8217;ve come in tech, for many it also speaks to a big issue: security vulnerabilities, with the devices themselves, plus all the components and services running on them, all potential targets for anything from malicious hackers to not-so-intentional data leaks.</p>
<p>Today, an Israeli startup Vdoo &#8212; which has been developing AI-based services to detect and fix those kinds of vulnerabilities in IoT devices &#8212; is announcing $25 million in funding, money that it plans to use to help it better address the wider issue as it applies to <em>all</em> connected objects. With its initial focus on large industrial deployments, medical systems, communications infrastructure and automotive, Vdoo also looking more deeply now at the wider network of devices that use communications chips, providing quick (as in minutes) assessments to identify and remediate or directly fix various issues: it cites zero-day vulnerabilities, CVEs, configuration and hardening issues, and standard incompliances among them.</p>
<p>The funding &#8212; an extension to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/vdoo-secures-32m-for-a-platform-that-detects-and-fixes-vulnerabilities-on-iot-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$32 million round</a> that Vdoo announced in April 2019 &#8212; is coming from two investors, Israel&#8217;s Qumra Capital and Verizon Ventures (the investing arm of Verizon, which &#8212; by way of its acquisition of Aol many years ago &#8212; also owns TechCrunch).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Verizon&#8217;s interest in Vdoo is strategic and speaks to the opportunity in the market. As CEO Netanel Davidi (who co-founded the company with Uri Alter and Asaf Karas) describes it, operators like Verizon are interested because of their role as a distributer and reseller of hardware as part of their wider services play, be it for broadband access, or a telematics service, or something for the connected home or connected office.</p>
<p>&#8220;T<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">hey sell connected devices to enterprises and home users that are not made by them, yet the carriers are responsible for the security,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so the solution is to bake that into devices&#8221; to make it work more seamlessly, he said. </span></p>
<p>Verizon is not the startup&#8217;s only strategic backer. Others in the first tranche of this round included another carrier, Japan&#8217;s NTT Docomo, MS&amp;AD Ventures (the venture arm of the global cyber insurance firm) and Dell Technology Capital, the VC arm of Dell.</p>
<p>The company has now raised around $70 million, and while it&#8217;s not disclosing valuation, Davidi confirmed that it has more than doubled this year.</p>
<p>(In April 2019, <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/224127-37/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PitchBook estimated</a> that it was just under $100 million, which would make it now at over $200 million if that figure is accurate.)</p>
<p>Davidi said that the decision to raise this money as an extension to the previous round rather than a new round was strategic: it gave the company the chance to raise funding more quickly, and to take more time to prepare for a bigger funding round in the near future.</p>
<p>And the reason for raising quickly was to address what was a quickly moving target: one of the by-products of the Covid-19 pandemic has been a dramatic shift to people working from home, buying new devices to enable that and in general using their communications networks much more heavily than before.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Connected device security typically focuses on monitoring activity on the hardware, how data is moving in and out of them. Vdoo&#8217;s approach has been to build a platform that monitors the behavior of the devices themselves, using AI to compare that behavior to identify when something is not working as it should. </span></p>
<p>“For any kind of vulnerability, using deep binary analysis capabilities, we try to understand the broader idea, to figure out how a similar vulnerability can emerge,” is how Davidi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/vdoo-secures-32m-for-a-platform-that-detects-and-fixes-vulnerabilities-on-iot-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">described</a> the process when we talked about the first part of this round back in 2019.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Vdoo generates specific “tailor-made on-device micro-agents” to continue the detection and repair process, which Davidi likens to a modern approach to some cancer care: preventive measures such as periodic monitoring checks, followed by a “tailored immunotherapy” based on prior analysis of DNA.</span></p>
<p>Vdoo is a play on the Hebrew word that sounds like “vee-doo” and means “making sure”, and points to the basic idea of how it approaches the verification around its device monitoring. It also feels somewhat like the next step in endpoint security, which was the focus of Davidi and Alter&#8217;s previous startup, Cyvera, which was eventually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/palo-alto-networks-buys-cyber-security-company-cyvera-for-200m/">acquired by Palo Alto Networks</a>.</p>
<p>The focus on devices, in some ways, is a significantly more complex approach given that it&#8217;s not just about the device, but the many components that go into them. As we have seen with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/03/kernel-panic-what-are-meltdown-and-spectre-the-bugs-affecting-nearly-every-computer-and-device/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meltdown and Spectre</a>, vulnerabilities might exist at the processor level.</p>
<p>And as Davidi pointed out to me this week, at times those issues aren&#8217;t even intentional but still mean data can leak out, and at worst that can be exploitable by bad actors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Backdoors are being built into many devices, and some are not even intentional,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It may be that the developer wanted to create a shortcut to make something else easier in the future. Some will see that as a back door, and some will not.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fractal-like nature of the issue what Vdoo is digging into with its widening approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Initially we wanted to serve the ecosystem of manufacturers, since they are the cause of the problem and the origin of the security issues,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We started there with Fortune 500 customers in areas like automotive and industrial and medical and telco and aviation. The idea was to make a platform that could serve and product security stakeholders. But then we saw that this was a big unserved market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, Vdoo quotes figures from research firm Markets and Markets that forecast that the global device security market will grow to $36.6 billion by 2025 from $12.5 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of connected IoT devices is rapidly growing, creating greater opportunities for security breaches,&#8221; said Boaz Dinte, Managing Partner of Qumra Capital, in a statement. &#8220;Vdoo&#8217;s unique device-centric, deep technology automated approach has already brought immediate value to vendors in a very short period of time. We believe the market opportunity is huge, and with newly infused growth capital, Vdoo is well-positioned to become the leading global player for securing connected devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>“With the expansion of 5G networks and mobile edge compute, there’s a need for an end-to-end, device-centric security approach to IoT,” added Verizon Ventures MD Tammy Mahn in a statement. &#8220;As the venture arm of a leading telco, Verizon Ventures is proud to invest in  Vdoo and its world-class team on their journey to solve this global need, while ushering in a new era of security by design in our increasingly connected world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The first commercial lunar landers are set to start making their trips to the Moon as early as this year, and now another one has a confirmed ride booked: Intuitive Machines is sending its second lander aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9, with a projected launch timeframe happening sometime around 2022 at the earliest. Intuitive Machines has already booked a first lander mission via SpaceX, which is also hosting payloads for other private companies seeking to make lunar landfall under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/nasa-reveals-the-payloads-for-the-first-commercial-moon-cargo-deliveries/">NASA&#8217;s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program</a>.</p>
<p>Intuitive Machines&#8217; Nova-C lander can carry up to 100 kg (around 222 lbs) of cargo to the Moon&#8217;s surface, and can communicate back to Earth for transmitting the results of its missions. It has both internal and surface mounting capacity, and will carry science experiments for a variety of customers to the lunar surface through NASA&#8217;s commercial partnership program, partly to support future NASA missions including its planned Artemis human Moon landings.</p>
<p>The first Intuitive Machines lunar lander mission, which will also use a Nova-C lander, is set to take place sometime in the fourth quarter of 2021 based on current timelines. It&#8217;ll include a lunar imaging suite, which will seek to &#8220;capture some of the first images of the Milky Way Galaxy Center from the surface of the Moon,&#8221; and the second mission will include delivering a polar resource mining drill and a mass spectrometer to the Moon&#8217;s South Pole on behalf of NASA, in addition to other payloads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m a grad student currently working on F-1 STEM OPT. The company I work for has indicated it will sponsor me for an H-1B visa this year. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I hear the random H-1B lottery will be replaced with a new system that selects H-1B candidates based on their salaries. How will this new process work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Positive in Palo Alto</strong></p>
<p>Dear Positive:</p>
<p>Thanks for your timely question! The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), finalized <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/08/2021-00183/modification-of-registration-requirement-for-petitioners-seeking-to-file-cap-subject-h-1b-petitions">a new rule</a> last week (Jan. 8), that replaces the random H-1B lottery with a pay-to-play system. There may be litigation that could change things before this year’s selection process, but interestingly, removing the randomness from the H-1B lottery is one point on which both Biden and Trump agree.</p>
<p>To find out more about all the changes that will impact this year’s H-1B process and how to prepare, register for our upcoming webinar on Jan. 20, on how to <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/1816063397370/WN_Wwy7TgrtQRyv7GkXeC-CgA">Get Ready for the H-1B FY2022 Lottery</a>. In the meantime, listen to my recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/046-get-ready-for-h-1b-fy2022-lottery/">H-1B podcast</a> in which I discuss what the 2021 lottery will look like, and download our <a href="https://witty-author-184.ck.page/321063598c">free H-1B guide</a>. Also, check out the podcast episode on <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-09-what-makes-a-strong-h-1b-petition/">What Makes a Strong H-1B Petition</a>.</p>
<p>Under this new wage-based H-1B allocation system, which is slated to go into effect on March 9, USCIS will select H-1B registrants based on the highest relative wages paid, taking into account the job, where it will be done and the job level (think of it like a career stage). This change is aimed at encouraging employers to offer higher salaries and higher-skilled positions to H-1B candidates to better protect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers and increase the likelihood that H-1B visas will be awarded to the best and the brightest individuals. In a nutshell, this is great news for Silicon Valley companies that have cash and need to remove risk.</p>
<p>While the new rule substantially increases predictability in the “lottery” process, it may make it more difficult for companies that are unfunded, pre-revenue early-stage startups to get H-1B visas for founders or employees, particularly since other forms of compensation, such as equity or stock options, are not considered wages. So the lesson here is to get some predictable revenue or runway prior to Q2 when you need to submit the I-129 petition so you can demonstrate the “ability to pay” at a higher wage level.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You know what’s great? Becoming a unicorn in two years. You know what’s even better? Exiting at unicorn status in two years.</p>
<p>This morning, Qualcomm announced that it was buying high-performance computing startup NUVIA for $1.4 billion, minus some coverage of working capital and debt.</p>
<p>The startup, which we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/15/three-of-apple-and-googles-former-star-chip-designers-launch-nuvia-with-53m-in-series-a-funding/">extensively profiled on its launch after raising $53 million in a Series A</a> in late 2019 and again a few months ago when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/nuvia-series-b/">it raised $240 million in its Series B from Mithril</a>, was the brainchild of a number of star Apple chip engineers who had worked on the computing giant’s A series of chips that powered the company’s iPhones and iPads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Much like how Apple’s new M series of chips for its laptop computers (so far) have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/apple-announces-the-m1-the-first-member-of-its-apple-silicon-family/">dazzled with an almost revolutionary mix of energy efficiency and performance</a>, NUVIA’s founders were hoping to use their experience in managing the power envelope while eking out high performance and bring that to the data center. Given the sheer scale of power required by data centers to function, which is only going up with the demand for AI applications in the cloud, the hope was that NUVIA could have its cake and eat it too: offering high performance while cutting power and saving costs for cloud computing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qualcomm-to-acquire-nuvia-301207370.html">According to Qualcomm’s press release</a>, NUVIA’s technology will be incorporated across the company’s line of chips, with its leadership centered around its 5G-focused Snapdragon chip. The company’s founders and employees are expected to join, and the deal must be approved by U.S. regulators.</p>
<p>NUVIA was one of the most compelling companies of the new crop of next-generation silicon startups, but it was also mired in a legal battle between one of its founders and famed former Apple engineer Gerald Williams III and his former employer. Apple filed a civil lawsuit against Williams in 2019 (California Superior Court of Santa Clara, 19-cv-352866), arguing that he attempted to recruit his former colleagues to join NUVIA in breach of his contractual obligations with Apple. Williams fought back through his own motions, and the two have been legal discovery ever since, with the latest updates happening just last month with Apple and Williams demanding each other hand over certain documents as the case has proceeded.</p>
<p>We don’t know how the timing of that lawsuit played into the company’s quick exit, or whether Qualcomm’s significantly deeper relationship with Apple as a supplier might help the parties reach a quicker settlement. We’ve reached out to a NUVIA spokesperson for comment.</p>
<p>While that lawsuit was a cloud over the company, the end result is a unicorn exit at $1.4 billion on just shy of $300 million of venture capital fundraised in roughly two years. Mithril is probably not terribly thrilled given the quick turnaround, but earlier investors like Capricorn Investment Group, Dell Technologies Capital (DTC), Mayfield, and WRVI Capital are probably doing a bit better on the multiples on invested capital front. And of course, the founders likely came out well ahead as well.</p>
