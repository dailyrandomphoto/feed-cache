										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With wildfires becoming an ever more devastating annual phenomenon, it is in the whole planet&#8217;s interest to spot them and respond as early as possible — and the best vantage point for that is space. OroraTech is a German startup building a constellation of small satellites to power a global wildfire warning system, and will be using <a href="https://ororatech.com/2021/06/01/ororatech-successfully-closes-e5-8m-series-a-to-launch-first-satellites-to-tackle-global-wildfire-and-climate-crisis/">a freshly raised €5.8M (~$7M) A round</a> to kick things off.</p>
<p>Wildfires destroy tens of millions of acres of forest every year, causing immense harm to people and the planet in countless ways. Once they&#8217;ve grown to a certain size, they&#8217;re near impossible to stop, so the earlier they can be located and worked against, the better.</p>
<p>But these fires can start just about anywhere in a dried out forest hundreds of miles wide, and literally every minute and hour counts — watch towers, helicopter flights, and other frequently used methods may not be fast or exact enough to effectively counteract this increasingly serious threat. Not to mention they&#8217;re expensive and often dangerous jobs for those who perform them.</p>
<p>OroraTech&#8217;s plan is to use a constellation of about 100 satellites equipped with custom infrared cameras to watch the entire globe (or at least the parts most likely to burst into flame) at once, reporting any fire bigger than ten meters across within half an hour.</p>

<p>To start out with, the Bavarian company has used data from over a dozen satellites already in space, in order to prove out the service on the ground. But with this funding round they are set to put their own bird in the air, a shoebox-sized satellite with a custom infrared sensor that will be <a href="https://spire.com/press-release/leading-wildfire-monitoring-provider-ororatech-partners-with-spire-to-launch-first-satellite-in-2021/">launched by Spire later this year.</a> Onboard machine learning processing of this imagery simplifies the downstream process.</p>
<p>14 more satellites are planned for launch by 2023, presumably once they&#8217;ve kicked the proverbial tires on the first one and come up with the inevitable improvements.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to cover even more regions in the future and to be able to give warning earlier, we aim to launch our own specialized satellite constellation into orbit,&#8221; said CEO and co-founder Thomas Grübler in a press release. &#8220;We are therefore delighted to have renowned investors on board to support us with capital and technological know-how in implementing our plans.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2160456" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg" alt="Mockup of an OroraTech Earth imaging satellite in space." width="1024" height="689" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg 1331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg?resize=768,517 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg?resize=680,458 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Those renowned investors consist of Findus Venture and Ananda Impact Ventures, which led the round, followed by APEX Ventures, BayernKapital, Clemens Kaiser, SpaceTec Capital and Ingo Baumann. The company was spun out of research done by the founders at TUM, which maintains an interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is absolutely remarkable what they have built up and achieved so far despite limited financial resources and we feel very proud that we are allowed to be part of this inspiring and ambitious NewSpace project,” APEX&#8217;s Wolfgang Neubert said, and indeed it&#8217;s impressive to have a leading space-based data service with little cash (it raised an undisclosed seed about a year ago) and no satellites.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the only company doing infrared imagery of the Earth&#8217;s surface; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/satellite-vus-5m-seed-round-will-fuel-the-launch-of-its-thermal-imaging-satellites/">SatelliteVu recently raised money</a> to launch its own, much smaller constellation, though it&#8217;s focused on monitoring cities and other high-interest areas, not the vast expanse of forests. And ConstellR is aimed (literally) at the farming world, monitoring fields for precision crop management.</p>
<p>With money in its pocket Orora can expand and start providing its improved detection services, though sadly, it likely won&#8217;t be upgrading before wildfire season hits the northern hemisphere this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Game of Thrones&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might be over, but HBO Max is still breaking new ground, and even breaking the internet – this past weekend, HBO Max </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/hbo-max-blacks-out-before-much-anticipated-mare-of-easttown-finale-1234766720/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blacked out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> right before the finale of &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mare of Easttown</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; likely due to traffic. But if you haven’t hopped aboard the HBO Max train yet, it might be time to try it out. Today, the streaming platform premieres an ad-supported subscription at $9.99 per month. Its existing service – which features no ads – costs $14.99 per month. Subscribers can save 15% on their subscription, no matter which version they choose, if they pre-pay for an entire year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advertisements aren’t the only drawback of the more affordable subscription option. The ad-supported tier offers a maximum quality of 1080p, which is still pretty good for most consumers, unless you&#8217;re watching “Friends: The Reunion” in your 4k home theater. But, lower-tier subscribers won’t be able to download content to view offline, nor will they have access to same-day film premieres of Warner Bros.’s newest theatrical releases. However, these films will become available to stream months after release. On the bright side, ads will not appear on original HBO programming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just four minutes of ad time per hour, the ad-supported tier “</span><a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max/new-hbo-max-ad-supported-tier-available-today"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launches with a commitment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to maintaining the lowest volume of commercials among popular streaming services. HBO Max follows in the footsteps of Hulu, which also offers a discounted subscription with ads for $5.99 per month, as opposed to $11.99 per month. But on Hulu, a half-hour show can contain </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hulu-premium-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost five minutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of unskippable ad time. Meanwhile, Netflix offers its most basic plan – which allows streaming on one screen at a time without HD – for $8.99 per month. Its standard plan is $13.99 a month. Now that HBO Max has a more competitively priced option, it might give these other platforms a run for their money. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kinds of ads can you expect to see on HBO Max? The company says that subscribers can expect “a greater personalization in the ads they see” over time, with “more innovation in formats to come.” This could resemble the ad experience on Hulu, which has experimented with viewer-friendly </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/hulu-launches-its-viewer-friendly-binge-watch-ads/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">binge-watch ads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>As of April 2021, HBO Max and HBO reached a combined <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/hbo-max-hbo-reaches-44-2-million-subscribers-4165569/">44.2 million subscribers</a>, and in Q1 of the year, added <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/22/zack-snyders-justice-league-did-little-to-boost-hbo-max-subscriptions.html">2.7 million domestic subscribers</a>. By comparison, Netflix reported an increase of 4 million subscribers in the same period, bringing them to about 207 million global subscribers. However, only 450,000 of those new subscribers come from the US and Canada.</p>
<p>On June 29, HBO Max will launch in 39 Latin American markets. Later in the year, the streaming service is expected to roll out in Europe. This will only further the platform&#8217;s rapid growth – in 2019, AT&amp;T, which owns HBO Max, set the modest goal to attain 50 million subscribers by 2025. Now, HBO Max expects it will reach between <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/att-expects-120-million-to-150-million-hbo-max-subs-by-end-of-2025.html">120 million and 150 million subscribers</a> by the same date.</p>
<p>The ad-supported subscription option for HBO Max is available now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Confluent became the latest company to announce its intent to take the IPO route, officially filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001699838/000119312521178773/d63025ds1.htm">its S-1 paperwork</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this week. The company, which has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/confluent">raised over $455 million</a> since it launched in 2014, was most recently valued at just over $4.5 billion when it raised $250 million last April.</p>
<p>What does Confluent do? It built a streaming data platform on top of the open-source Apache Kafka project. In addition to its open-source roots, Confluent has a free tier of its commercial cloud offering to complement its paid products, helping generate top-of-funnel inflows that it converts to sales.</p>
<p>Kafka itself emerged from a LinkedIn internal project in 2011. As we wrote at the time of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/confluent-raises-50m-to-continue-growing-commercial-arm-of-apache-kafka/">Confluent’s $50 million Series C in 2017</a>, the open-source project was designed to move massive amounts of data at the professional social network:</p>
<blockquote><p>At its core, Kafka is simply a messaging system, created originally at LinkedIn, that’s been designed from the ground up to move massive amounts of data smoothly around the enterprise from application to application, system to system or on-prem to cloud — and deal with extremely high message volume.</p></blockquote>
<p>Confluent CEO and co-founder Jay Kreps <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/confluent-raises-a-125m-series-d-funding-round/">wrote at the time of the funding</a> that events streaming is at the core of every business, reaching sales and other core business activities that occur in real time that go beyond storing data in a database after the fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;[D]atabases have long helped to store the current state of the world, but we think this is only half of the story. What is missing are the continually flowing stream of events that represents everything happening in a company, and that can act as the lifeblood of its operation,” he wrote.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Confluent comes in.</p>
<p>But enough about the technology. Is Confluent’s work with Kafka a good business? Let’s find out.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does an electric vehicle sound like when it goes from 0 to 60, when it signals a turn, when it’s powered down for the night? EV motors have fewer parts and are therefore incredibly silent, which presents safety concerns for drivers who recognize speed by sound and pedestrians who can’t hear an approaching vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, </span><a href="https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2019/06/new-evs-sold-in-eu-will-be-required-to-make-warning-noises-to-alert-pedestrians/#:~:text=Back%20issues-,New%20EVs%20sold%20in%20EU%20will%20be%20required,warning%20noises%20to%20alert%20pedestrians&amp;text=From%201%20July%202019%2C%20any,pedestrians%20that%20it%20is%20approaching."><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulators in Europe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/16/20869035/electric-car-ev-fake-noise-nhtsa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the U.S. began requiring EVs to have warning sounds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but they left it up to the car manufacturers to choose those sounds. Many have taken the new legislation as an opportunity to not only create a branded sound, but also to stir up some marketing hype by enlisting famous musicians to compose the noise of an electric engine. Hans Zimmer created the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/29/bmws-ev-concept-gets-blade-runner-style-sound/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blade Runner</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-esque sound concept for BMW’s i4 electric sedan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and, strangely, </span><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/article/17382/mercedes-amg-partners-with-linkin-park-to-produce-engine-sounds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linkin Park is creating EV sounds for BMW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sound designer Yuri Suzuki, a partner at design consultancy firm Pentagram, recently conducted a research project into the crucial role electric car sound has on a user’s safety, enjoyability, communication and brand recognition, out of which he developed a <a href="https://www.pentagram.com/news/electric-car-sound-design">range of car sounds</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Suzuki says that while some automakers have chosen beautiful and interesting car sound designs, chasing celebrity clout is not the way to go when designing the sound behind serious machines. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really have to design carefully based on the psychological effects on a human,” Suzuki told TechCrunch. “It’s all about the relation between the human being and the machine itself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuki says smart sound design can help ease the difference between human and car by providing a shared language. Based on surveys he conducted, Suzuki came up with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtdWVOf2YNI&amp;t=43s&amp;ab_channel=Dezeen">two new skeuomorphic electric engine sounds</a> as well as adaptive sounds that reflect the time of day and the location of the drive. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His engine sounds are reminiscent of internal combustion engine revs, providing both drivers and pedestrians with a recognizable indication of speed increasing and decreasing. The sounds are placed at different pitches: one quite low, like a spaceship taking off; the other a bit higher, like a hovercraft vertically ascending. Audi, Ford and Jaguar Land Rover have also chosen to make futuristic copies of gasoline engines for some of their new electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuki’s sound design also includes in-car sounds, like powering on, turn signals or horn honking, that use AI to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il15DQ-chsM&amp;t=29s&amp;ab_channel=Dezeen"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adapt to the time of day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the morning, there’s a higher pitch and a sunnier energy to the sounds, which get progressively lower in pitch as the day wears on. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make the sounds more customizable, Suzuki says he uses machine learning to help integrate the individual’s calendar so the sound can adapt to the type of activity the user is doing, from heading to work to running errands to going on a joyride. </span><a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2021/05/14/electric-car-sounds-yuri-suzuki-pentagram/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video game-like sounds are activated whenever the driver arrives at their destination</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of manufacturers allow the driver to choose the sounds their vehicle will make, but Suzuki doesn’t think that’s the best idea because people will likely choose what sounds coolest to them, not necessarily what is most useful. Not to mention what a strange cacophony of noises cities would sound like if everyone could choose their own sounds. It would be like when people started choosing their own cellphone ringtones, but on a larger, more anxiety-inducing scale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We suggest a pre-set sound that gradually changes as it shifts to your life and activity pattern,” he said. “Our AI can slowly adjust its sound to the driver’s behavior.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuki’s AI-based car sounds are designed so that they’re not repetitive. So if you’re on a long road trip, rather than constantly listening to the same sound, Suzuki’s sounds are capable of creating real-time generation of bespoke sounds, a task that’s nearly impossible for a human to do. He says the constantly progressing and shifting sounds use the same data as the original engine sound, but it can stretch for hours without repetition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pentagram hasn’t yet produced a commercial application for Suzuki’s sounds, as it is more interested in sharing its research with the EV and sound design communities, as well as finding the right automaker partner to develop this project further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are no strong sound guidelines yet, so that’s something we’re interested in,” said Suzuki. “The first step for us is sharing the kinds of things we can do with AI and sound design.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At today’s F8 developer conference, Facebook announced </span><a href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/blog/spark-ar-previews-multipeer-api-for-ar-video-calling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new capabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Spark AR, its flagship AR creation software. Since Spark AR was announced at F8 2017, more than 600,000 creators from 190 countries have published over 2 million AR effects on Facebook and Instagram, making it the largest mobile AR platform, according to Facebook. If you’ve ever posted a selfie on your Instagram story with an effect that gave you green hair, or let you control a dog’s facial expression by moving your own face, then </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/instagrams-ar-filters-are-getting-more-dynamic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’ve used Spark AR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, these AR effects will be available for video calling on Messenger, Instagram, and Portal with the introduction of a Multipeer API. Creators can develop effects that bring call participants together by using a shared AR effect. As an example, Spark AR shared a promo video of a birthday party held over a video call, in which an AR party hat appears on each of the participants’ heads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creators can also develop games for users to play during their video calls. This already exists on Facebook video calls – think of the game where you compete to see who can catch the most flying AR hamburgers in their mouth in a minute. But when the ability to make new, lightweight games opens to developers, we’ll see some new games to challenge our friends with on video calls. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These video call effects and multipeer AR games will be bolstered by Spark’s platform exclusive </span><a href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/blog/new-spark-ar-capabilities-arrive-for-instagram/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multi-class segmentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capability. This lets developers augment multiple segments of a user’s body (like hair or skin) at once within a single effect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook also discussed its ongoing ambition to build AR glasses. Chris Barbour, Director of Partnerships for Spark AR, said that this goal is still “years away” – but, Barbour did tease some potential features for the innovative, wearable tech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Imagine being able to teleport to a friend’s sofa to watch a show together, or being able to share a photo of something awesome you see on a hike,” Barbour said. Maybe this won’t sound so dystopian by the time the product launches, years down the road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last October, Spark AR launched the AR Partner Network, a program for the platform’s most advanced creators, and this year, Spark launched an AR curriculum through Facebook’s BluePrint Platform to help creators learn how to improve their AR effects. Applications for the Spark Partner Network will open again this summer. For now, creators and developers can apply to start building effects for video calling through the </span><a href="https://go.facebookinc.com/sparkAR-beta-video-calling.html?ref=ar_blog&amp;fbclid=IwAR1bBh1TxOFbrfQ0oB2FMrixARl9WiMnfTvb2KOQpEWGqLDzRMW45zT10Hk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spark AR Video Calling Beta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If you’re among the growing number of people interested in cryptocurrencies, you may be interested to know that nearly 7,000 people lost more than $80 million between October 2020 and March 2021 &#8212; a 1,000% increase from a year ago, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/blog_posts/Cryptocurrency%20buzz%20drives%20record%20investment%20scam%20losses/cryptocurrency_spotlight.pdf?utm_campaign=wp_the_cybersecurity_202&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_cybersecurity202">according to the Federal Trade Commission</a>.</p>
<p>The scams include fake currency exchanges and phony “investment” websites selling the currency. More recently, more than<a href="https://www.tenable.com/blog/elon-musk-snl-scammers-steal-over-10-million-in-bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin-crypto-fake-giveaways"> $10 million was stolen in various cryptocurrencies</a> in the days leading up to Elon Musk’s appearance on “Saturday Night Live.”</p>
<p>And here’s the rub: You have no way to protect your accounts from any theft. In the world of cryptocurrency, there are no guarantees. Unlike the traditional banking world, there is no equivalent to the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</a> to cover any losses on your account. If your assets are stolen, you’re out of luck.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			Nearly 7,000 people have lost more than $80 million between October 2020 and March 2021 &#8212; a 1,000% increase from a year ago, according to the Federal Trade Commission.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Enabling secure access to these cryptocurrency assets is absolutely critical to preventing theft &#8212; which,<a href="https://atlasvpn.com/blog/blockchain-hackers-stole-3-8-billion-in-122-attacks-throughout-2020"> as of the end of 2020, amounted to just over $10 million a day</a> &#8212; and/or lockout of one’s potential fortune.</p>
<p>But how can you ensure that people can always access their accounts? That depends on how the accounts are set up initially &#8212; which usually means that passwords or other knowledge-based authentication (KBA) is involved. Unfortunately, passwords simply aren’t suitable for securing high-value accounts because they can be easily compromised, either through phishing attacks or outright theft.</p>
<p>Plus, if you have a less-used cryptocurrency wallet, you might forget your initial password and might have trouble<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"> recovering</a> it &#8212; if there is even a mechanism to perform the recovery. KBA is also plagued with problems ranging from lack of recollection (what is my favorite hobby again?) to the wide availability of “personal” information on the web (for a few dollars, you can surely find my mother’s maiden name).</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency account takeovers happen<a href="https://atlasvpn.com/blog/blockchain-hackers-stole-3-8-billion-in-122-attacks-throughout-2020"> with increasing frequency</a>; it doesn’t help that there are few pre-established trust relationships between users and the exchange or wallet provider and that almost all transactions are finalized within minutes and not easily reversible.</p>
<p>Sadly, these takeovers make use of a very similar pattern that has been observed for years in the traditional banking world: An attacker will first try harvesting and then stuffing stolen credentials. If that doesn’t work &#8212; say a user has protected their account by requiring an SMS second factor &#8212; they will move on to popular techniques to overcome SMS, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM swapping</a> or a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber">$16 SMS relay service</a> that sends that SMS code to the attacker’s smartphone, which leads to a “successful” account takeover.</p>
<p>Even highly secure tokens or dedicated authenticator apps are vulnerable to replay attacks from a motivated hacker &#8212; and with personal fortunes at stake, there is no lack of motivation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the vast growth in the number of cryptocurrency exchange users coupled with this need for strong cybersecurity has resulted in terrible support experiences where users have to wait for weeks or even months to regain access to their own accounts &#8212; simply because it is so difficult for them to prove they are the rightful owner.</p>
<h2>Authentication best practices can help</h2>
<p>So how do we fix this situation? With standards-based user authentication that has been proven to be <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/">resistant to phishing</a> and account takeovers &#8212; and that is already embedded into billions of devices worldwide and available to just about <a href="https://caniuse.com/webauthn">any user on a modern browser</a>. The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) authentication protocols were developed by a <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/">who’s who of IT, payments and consumer services</a> and ensure that all cryptographic credentials are stored on a user’s device &#8212; thereby eliminating even the most advanced machine-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
<p>The crypto exchange Gemini was an early adopter of FIDO for both its smartphone app and for browser users, with a growing percentage of its users protecting their accounts with FIDO authentication by purchasing FIDO Certified security keys. There have been a number of other exchanges that have added FIDO authentication, such as <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/verify-my-account/security-keys-faq">Coinbase, which also supports FIDO keys</a>. Binance has FIDO for its web versions, but not on its smartphone apps yet. And <a href="https://help.stex.com/en/articles/3486981-security">STEX also has support for various FIDO devices and methods</a>. Finally, <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005198545-FIDO-U2F">Ledger hardware wallets support</a> FIDO directly in their devices.</p>
<p>Ideally, it would be better and more effective if there was broad cryptocurrency industry acceptance of FIDO’s approach to modern authentication and adoption of several related best practices, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standardize authentication flows and practices across crypto exchanges</strong>. Better user authentication should be a standard practice for <em>every</em> exchange, not a competitive differentiator. If all leading exchanges moved to industry best practices for account creation, login and recovery, it would help protect customers &#8212; and their collective crypto assets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Require users to enroll multiple authenticators to help with account recovery for each cryptocurrency exchange</strong>, whether that is two FIDO security keys or a FIDO security key and a biometric authenticator. Having multiple account recovery keys for each cryptocurrency exchange will help lessen support burdens and help users who lose a device. It will also offer users a choice of stronger authentication options.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eliminating less secure backup and recovery options, </strong>such as using SMS or other knowledge-based authentication factors, will also help improve overall security, particularly for account recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom line is that for the cryptocurrency market to reach its full potential, its exchanges need to collectively strike a balance between the anonymity and privacy that make crypto unique with the security of accounts and assets. Following the lead of crypto exchanges like Gemini and letting users lock down their accounts is a great step toward protecting users against phishing and account takeovers while maintaining privacy and convenience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp now has more than 2 billion users globally, and by comparison its efforts to cultivate more business usage have been quite modest: just over 175 million people message with WhatsApp Business accounts daily for things like customer support or to discuss products. Today, as part of its F8 event, Facebook is unveiling some updates to the WhatsApp API to expand that experience.</p>
<p>The news comes on the heels of Facebook unveiling the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-opens-its-messenger-api-for-instagram-to-all-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general availability of Messenger API for Instagram</a> earlier today, and forms part of a bigger series of announcements aimed at doing business more easily on the platform.</p>
<p>More generally, Facebook and its many apps are at their heart very consumer services &#8212; they are used by billions of people to keep in touch with each other, for diversion, and to stay informed about whatever matters to them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Facebook the business has been gradually building out a very extensive and lucrative commercial infrastructure around that engaged audience, one that started with advertising but has extended deeper into marketing, customer service, workplace productivity, and shopping.</p>
<p>The F8 conference, hatched originally as a hackathon, had grown into a very big event. This year&#8217;s installment is a significantly more toned down affair than in recent years &#8212; no big crowds (it&#8217;s all virtual), no big product and hardware announcements (it doesn&#8217;t appear that there are any&#8230; so far), and it feels more like a Zoom conference &#8212; and today&#8217;s news about business-oriented developer tools not only resets the event back around its original developer focus, but it also bolsters that commercial strategy.</p>
<p class="p1">With WhatsApp for Business it appears that one of the sticking points has been time &#8212; from setting up WhatsApp for Business in the first place to responding to different kinds of messages. This is what Facebook is now addressing.</p>
<p class="p1">First, it&#8217;s speeding up the time it takes to set up a WhatsApp business account to five minutes (versus what it described as weeks in the past).</p>
<p class="p1">Then, Facebook is making it easier to use the Business account once it is set up. For starters, businesses will be able to respond faster to inbound messages (which previously were &#8220;difficult to follow up with customers outside of a 24-hour window&#8221;), and they can now send out messages to those who have opted in, for example around stock availability.</p>
<p class="p1">Businesses using the tool for customer care, meanwhile, will be given the option to create up to 10 pre-written messages to speed up their responses, and they can also set up reply buttons to provide pre-populated, popular replies from customers.</p>
<p>In addition to the WhatsApp news, Facebook is also adding another tool to Messenger to expand its: Facebook Login Connect.</p>
<p>Essentially, if a business has integrated Facebook Login, it will allow users to log into their app or website using their Facebook credentials, and then carry on a conversation with the company over Messenger.</p>
<p>This is useful not just because it also means that a user can keep track of any conversations from one place, but it gives the company access to the tools that it has built to carry out conversations in Messenger already, whether those are chatbots or links through to other CRM databases. Facebook said that tests of the service indicate that 70% of users opt in to use the Login Connect tool, indicating that they&#8217;re willing to use their Facebook credentials in this way.</p>
<p>This is a closed beta now but will be more widely available in coming months, Facebook said.</p>
<p class="p4">Finally, Facebook is launching a new feature in its Business Suite &#8212; a platform that can be used by businesses to manage activity across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger &#8212; that will let developers build &#8220;Business Apps.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are not apps in the app store sense, but tools made by third parties (developers) to work alongside the Facebook-built Business Suite, further integrating Facebook tools into businesses&#8217; sites and apps, and also bringing more of a businesses&#8217; content &#8212; for example items from a catalog &#8212; into their Facebook Page, or Instagram account, and so on. The platform already has some 90 developers working on it and it integrates with e-commerce platforms like Bigcommerce, Facebook said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Archer Aviation hit back against allegations that it misappropriated trade secrets and infringed on patents from electric aircraft rival Wisk Aero, telling a court this week that it designed its Maker aircraft with a third-party eVTOL consultant prior to any former Wisk employees joining the company.</p>
<p>Archer said it worked with consultant FlightHouse Engineering at the end of 2019, when the consultancy firm modeled a 12-rotor fixed wing aircraft, with the front six rotors capable of tilting from a vertical to a horizontal position. This is the design that ultimately became the Maker. By the time the first Wisk employee arrived at Archer, this design had already been modeled, Archer says.</p>
<p>“Despite the breathless innuendo and baseless speculation to which Wisk devotes its entire complaint, Archer’s eVTOL aircraft design is not only the best eVTOL aircraft around, it is entirely Archer’s design,” the answer says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Wisk spokesperson told TechCrunch that Archer’s filing changes nothing about the case. It “contains no substantive response to the allegations Archer misappropriated more than 50 specific Wisk trade secrets, which were disclosed in a court filing last month and cover multiple components, systems, and designs for the aircraft,” the spokesperson said. “We believe Archer’s business is built on Wisk’s intellectual property as detailed in our filings, and we look forward to proceeding with our case.”</p>
<p>Wisk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/wisk-aero-sues-archer-aviation-for-alleged-patent-infringement-trade-secret-theft/">filed its lawsuit</a> with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in April, alleging that Archer perpetrated a “brazen theft” of confidential information and intellectual property. The suit came just two months after Archer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/">announced it would merge</a> with special purpose acquisition company Atlas Crest Investment Corp. in a deal valued at $3.8 billion.</p>
<p>In its filing Tuesday, Archer included counterclaims alleging “tortious interference and unfair competition.” Archer stated that Wisk engaged in a “media campaign” that was timed “to maximize harm to Archer after learning of Archer’s impending financial success.”</p>
<p>In a separate motion to dismiss, Archer also said that Wisk failed to identify any specific trade secrets that it allegedly misappropriated in the April complaint.</p>
<p>Wisk, born of a joint venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk Corp., did include a 72-page trade secret disclosure <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/wisk-aero-files-injunction-in-trade-secret-lawsuit-against-archer-aviation/">in a separate injunction</a> filed on May 19. That injunction could potentially bar Archer from using any of the purportedly stolen technology. An Archer spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company will file an opposition to that injunction on June 23, “which will address Wisk’s purported trade secret disclosure statement.”</p>
<p>A major part of Wisk’s suit are allegations that a former Wisk employee, Jing Xue, downloaded thousands of proprietary files from his work computer prior to joining Archer. However, Archer said in the motion to dismiss that Wisk does not allege that the former employee disclosed any such information to Archer. According to Archer, “such allegations do not suffice to show that Archer […] came into possession of the files or learned of the confidential information therein, much less that it did so knowingly, as is required to state a trade secret claim.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Why is Etsy willing to pay more than 23x Depop's 2020 revenues? It is buying Gen Z love.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The news this morning that e-commerce marketplace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/etsy-is-acquiring-social-selling-site-depop-for-1-625b-in-a-mostly-cash-deal/">Etsy will buy Depop</a>, a startup that provides a second-hand e-commerce marketplace, for more than $1.6 billion may not have made a large impact on the acquiring company&#8217;s share price thus far, but it provides a fascinating look into what brands may be willing to pay for access to the Gen Z market.</p>
<p>First, a few details: Per Etsy, the Depop deal is worth &#8220;$1.625 billion consisting primarily of cash, subject to certain adjustments for Depop&#8217;s working capital, transaction expenses, cash and indebtedness, and certain deferred and unvested equity for Depop management and employees.&#8221; So, $1.625 billion, plus or minus. We&#8217;ll use that number this morning.</p>
<p>Because Etsy is a public company and the transaction is material, it provided a good deal of information on the acquisition. The key facts that relate to the scale of Depop&#8217;s business are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2020 gross platform spend, revenue:</strong> <em>&#8220;Depop&#8217;s 2020 gross merchandise sales (GMS) and revenue were approximately $650 million and $70 million, respectively, each increasing over 100% year-over-year.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><strong>Historical gross platform spend trend:</strong> <em>&#8220;Depop&#8217;s GMS grew at a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 80% from 2017-2020.&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>At $70 million in 2020 revenue, Depop is being valued at a multiple of 23.2x of the previous year&#8217;s top line. That&#8217;s rich, but not impossibly high for a company that just had a huge pandemic year. (Though it is somewhat notable that Etsy is valuing Depop as if it was a high-growth SaaS business and not a consumer marketplace.)</p>
<p>The category of e-commerce performed well during the pandemic, implying that Depop&#8217;s non-pandemic growth rate would have been lower than what it ultimately recorded. How can we tell? The company&#8217;s historical GMS spend figure of &#8220;nearly 80%&#8221; from 2017 to 2020 is <em>inclusive</em> of the 100%+ GMS growth it recorded last year. We can infer, then, that in 2017, 2018 and 2019, GMS at Depop grew at a slower pace, namely one that is under the 80% mark.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The legendary Q&amp;A website for programmers (and probably one of the most copy-and-pasted sites on the Internet) <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> is being acquired. The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/software-developer-community-stack-overflow-sold-to-tech-giant-prosus-for-1-8-billion-11622648400">is reporting</a> that Prosus (the primary shareholder of Chinese gaming mega co/WeChat developer, Tencent) will acquire Stack Overflow for $1.8 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Prosus confirms the $1.8 billion number <a href="https://www.prosus.com/news/prosus-to-acquire-stack-overflow-for-us18-billion/">in a press release here.</a></p>
<p>While perhaps not a name everyone recognizes, Prosus — the international assets holding arm of South Africa&#8217;s Naspers — is something of a giant. In 2001, parent company Naspers bought a 46.5% stake in Tencent for $32 million dollars. Earlier this year they sold a <em>2% </em>stake of Tencent <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/08/investing/tencent-prosus-naspers-stock-sale-intl-hnk/index.html">for nearly $15<em> billion</em></a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stack Overflow co-founders Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky shared the following shortly after the news broke:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<blockquote><p>Today we’re pleased to announce that Stack Overflow is joining <a href="https://www.prosus.com/">Prosus</a>. Prosus is an investment and holding company, which means that the most important part of this announcement is that Stack Overflow will continue to operate independently, with the exact same team in place that has been operating it, according to the exact same plan and the exact same business practices. Don’t expect to see major changes or awkward “synergies”. The business of Stack Overflow will continue to focus on Reach and Relevance, and Stack Overflow for Teams. The entire company is staying in place: we just have different owners now.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In its antitrust trial with Epic Games, which has just adjourned, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/tim-cook-plays-innocent-in-epic-v-apples-culminating-testimony/">Apple</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/apple-s-app-store-had-78-profit-margin-in-2019-testimony-shows?sref=gni836kR">argued</a> it doesn&#8217;t evaluate its App Store profit and loss as a standalone business. But today, the company put out new figures that indicate it does have a good understanding of the money that flows through its app marketplace, at the very least. The company has now released an updated version of a study performed by the economists at the Analysis Group, which claims the App Store ecosystem facilitated $643 billion in billings and sales in 2020, up 24% from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/as-antitrust-investigation-looms-apple-says-its-app-store-facilitated-519b-in-commerce-in-2019/">$519 billion seen the year prior.</a> The new report focuses on the pandemic impacts to apps and the small business developers the App Store serves, among other things.</p>
<p>It also noted that about 90% of the billings and sales facilitated by the App Store actually took place outside its walls, meaning Apple took no commission on those purchases. This is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/as-antitrust-investigation-looms-apple-says-its-app-store-facilitated-519b-in-commerce-in-2019/">up from the 85% figure</a> reported last year, and is a figure Apple has been using in antitrust battles to paint a picture of an App Store that facilitates a lot commerce where it doesn&#8217;t take a commission.</p>
<p>The study then broke down how the different categories of App Store billings and sales were distributed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple takes a commission on the sales of digital goods and services, which were $86 billion in 2020, or 13% of the total. But another $511 billion came from the sale of physical goods and services through apps &#8212; think online shopping, food delivery, ride hailing, etc. &#8212; or 80% of the total. These aren&#8217;t commissioned. And $46 billion came from in-app advertising, or 7% of the total.</p>
<p>The larger point being made with some of these figures is that, while the dollar amount flowing through apps being commissioned is large, it&#8217;s much smaller than most of the business being conducted on the App Store.</p>
<p>The report also noted how much of that business originates from China, which accounted for 47% of total global billings and sales ($300B) versus the U.S.&#8217;s 27% ($175+B).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123653" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123653" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123653" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apple-app-store-ios-2021.jpg?w=680" alt="Apple app store iOS" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apple-app-store-ios-2021.jpg 1180w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apple-app-store-ios-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apple-app-store-ios-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apple-app-store-ios-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apple-app-store-ios-2021.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apple-app-store-ios-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123653" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The study additionally dove into how some App Store categories had been heavily impacted by the pandemic &#8212; particularly those apps that helped businesses and schools move online, those that offered ways to shop from your phone, or helped consumers stay entertained and healthy, among other things.</p>
<p>This led to an over 40% increase in billings and sales from apps offering digital goods and services, while sales in the travel and ride hailing sectors decreased by 30%. While the latter may gradually return to pre-pandemic levels, some of the acceleration driven by the pandemic in other categories &#8212; like online shopping and grocery delivery &#8212; could be here to stay.</p>
<p>To break it down further, general retail grew to $383 billion in 2020, up from $268 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/as-antitrust-investigation-looms-apple-says-its-app-store-facilitated-519b-in-commerce-in-2019/">last year</a>. Food delivery and pickup grew from $31 billion in 2019 to $36 billion in 2021. Grocery shopping jumped from $14 billion to $22 billion. But travel fell from $57 billion in 2019 to $38 billion in 2020, and ride hailing dropped from $40 billion to $26 billion. (None of these categories are commissioned.)</p>
<p>The study then continued with a deep dive into how the App Store aided small businesses.</p>
<p>Highlighting how smaller businesses benefit from a tech giant&#8217;s ecosystem is a tactic others have taken to, as well, in order shore up support for their own operations, which have similarly been accused of being monopolies in recent months.</p>
<p>Amazon, for example, raves about the small businesses benefitting from its marketplace<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/amazon-confirms-prime-day-will-run-june-21-22-an-earlier-than-usual-start/"> and its sales event Prime Day,</a> even as it stands accused of leveraging nonpublic data to compete with those same small business sellers. Facebook, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">meanwhile</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/ios-14-apple-privacy-update-impacts-small-business-ads">pushed the small business impact angle</a> when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">Apple&#8217;s new privacy protections</a> in iOS 14 allowed customers to opt out of being tracked &#8212; and therefore out of Facebook&#8217;s personalized ads empire.</p>
<p>In Apple&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s pointing to the fact that the number of small developers worldwide has grown by 40% since 2015. This group now makes up more than 90% of App Store developers. The study defines this group of &#8220;small&#8221; developers as those with fewer than 1 million downloads and less than $1 million in earnings across all their apps. It also excludes any developers that never saw more than 1,000 downloads in a year between 2015 and 2020, to ensure the data focuses on businesses, not hobbyists. (This is a slightly different definition than Apple uses for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">its Small Business Program</a>, we should note.)</p>
<p>Among this group, more than 1 in 5 saw at least an increase in downloads of at least 25% annually since their first full year on the App Store. And 1 in 4 who sold digital goods and services saw an earnings increase of at least 25% annually.</p>
<p>The study also connected being on the App Store with growing a business&#8217;s revenue, noting that only 23% of large developers (those with more than $1 million in earnings in 2020) had already earned more than $1 million back in 2015. 42% were active on the App Store in 2015 but hadn&#8217;t crossed the $1 million threshold, and another 35% were not even on the App Store &#8212; an indication their success has been far more recent.</p>
<p>The research additionally identified over 75 businesses in the U.S. and Europe, where iOS was essential to their business, that went public or were acquired since 2011. Their valuation totaled nearly $500 billion.</p>
<p>Finally, the study examined how apps transact outside their home market, as around 40% of all downloads of apps from small developers came from outside their home countries and nearly 80% were operating in multiple storefronts.</p>

<p>While the antitrust scrutiny may have pushed Apple into to commissioning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/as-antitrust-investigation-looms-apple-says-its-app-store-facilitated-519b-in-commerce-in-2019/">this type of App Store research last year,</a> it&#8217;s interesting to see the company is now updating the data on an annual basis to give the industry a deeper view into the App Store compared with the general developer revenue figure it used to trot out at various <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">events</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/28/app-store-developers-have-earned-120-billion-since-2008/">occasions</a>.</p>
<p>Like last year&#8217;s study, the updated research has been released in the days leading up to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/">Apple&#8217;s Worldwide Developer Conference</a>. It&#8217;s a time of the year when Apple aims to renew its bond with the developer community as it rolls out new software development kits (SDKs), application programming interfaces (API)s, software and other tools &#8212; enhancements it wants remid developers are made possible, in part, because of its App Store fees.</p>
<p>Today, Apple notes it has more than 250,000 APIs included in 40 SDKs. At <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-kicks-off-june-7/">WWDC 2021</a>, it will host hundreds of virtual <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/sessions/">sessions</a>, 1-on-1 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/labs/">developer labs</a>, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/">highlight App Store favorites</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Developers on the App Store prove every day that there is no more innovative, resilient or dynamic marketplace on earth than the app economy,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a statement about the research. &#8220;The apps we’ve relied on through the pandemic have been life-changing in so many ways — from groceries delivered to our homes, to teaching tools for parents and educators, to an imaginative and ever-expanding universe of games and entertainment. The result isn’t just incredible apps for users: it’s jobs, it’s opportunity, and it’s untold innovation that will power global economies for many years to come,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s still a bit of a legal maze, but more cities are <a href="https://civileats.com/2020/06/30/its-now-legal-for-home-chefs-in-california-to-sell-meals-will-more-cities-get-on-board/">coming around to the idea</a> of letting local home chefs bring in more income by selling homecooked meals to those nearby.</p>
<p><a href="https://shef.com">Shef</a> is a marketplace meant to help these home chefs connect with customers, handle orders, and get the food delivered — and they&#8217;ve just raised $20M to get it done.</p>
<p>The company is announcing its Series A round this morning, led by Andreessen Horowitz and backed by Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, M13, and a bevy of celebrities including Padma Lakshmi, Chef Aarón Sánchez, Katy Perry, Tiffany Haddish, Orlando Bloom, and NBA All-Star Andre Iguodala.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the round, Andreessen Horowitz GP (and former OpenTable CEO) Jeff Jordan will join Shef&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Because of varying local laws, Shef works a bit differently from market to market. In some places, for example, they&#8217;re able to tap local delivery networks to get meals the last mile; in others, chefs handle deliveries themselves.</p>
<p>Across all markets, though, the ordering process boils down to: pick a chef, order what you want a few days in advance (everything is done via pre-orders so chefs know exactly what they&#8217;ll need each day — it&#8217;s not an on-a-whim kind of thing), then heat it up upon arrival.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160326" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160326" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2160326" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png" alt="" width="1024" height="555" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png?resize=1536,833 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png?resize=2048,1111 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shef-page.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160326" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shef</p></div></p>
<p>But whether or not a service like this is even allowed to <em>exist</em> varies from place to place. Even in California where a relatively new statewide law allows home cooks to sell their goods, the final say (and the details of the implementation) <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/01/17/685626391/selling-food-from-your-kitchen-is-legal-in-california-but-theres-a-catch">comes down to each county</a>. In many places, &#8220;homecooking&#8221; still requires getting access to a commercial kitchen.</p>
<p>Shef co-founders Alvin Salehi and Joey Grassia don&#8217;t shy away from the legal challenges — in a chat earlier this week, they told me that they expect much of the funds they raised to go toward two things: figuring out how to get services like theirs legalized in more markets (they&#8217;ve hired Danielle Merida, former General Counsel for TaskRabbit, to help there), and to onboard chefs as those new markets come online.</p>
<p>The company says they currently have over 12,000 home chefs on their wait list, with that number ballooning as the pandemic shuttered restaurants around the country. Each chef they bring on to the platform goes through a 150-step onboarding process, including a food safety certification exam and food quality assessment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be able to expand the services to as many people as possible, because so many people need it,&#8221; Salehi tells me. &#8220;But it takes resources to be able to do that effectively, and most importantly, to do that safely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shef is currently live in the Bay Area, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Seattle, and New York, with plans to roll out in new markets&#8230; well, as soon as they can.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook said it&#8217;s preparing to launch a new application programming interface (API) designed specifically for access by the research community. The API was announced during Facebook&#8217;s F8 developer conference today, and is meant to address issues that arose from changes made to Facebook&#8217;s platform in 2018 following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. That event forced the company to re-evaluate the access developers had to its user data.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, Facebook says it has deprecated thousands of APIs to reduce the risk of future data misuse and breaches.</p>
<p>It also renewed its agreements with developers on the platform to ensure they were &#8220;committed to the same values as we are,&#8221; noted Facebook VP of platform partnerships, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, during the keynote address.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, Facebook admitted these changes had an impact on the academic research community, which had before been able to more broadly access Facebook data.</p>
<p>To address this, the company announced it&#8217;s soon launching a Researcher API, which will allow researchers to again analyze Facebook data with the goal of understanding the social network&#8217;s &#8220;influence on society,&#8221; Papamiltiadis noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to make sure we got this right, and we were intentional about developing the best products to support researchers, while keeping people&#8217;s data safe and secure,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Researcher API will offer real-time access to public Pages, Groups, Events and post-level U.S. data in a privacy-protected environment, the exec said. But further details were not offered, including, for example, how researchers would be vetted or whether there would be any fees associated with the data access.</p>
<p>The API will become available to the academic community later this year, Facebook said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seven days, 168 hours or 10,080 minutes — no matter how you count it, there’s just one week left until the global mobility tech community gathers on June 9 for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=1weektogo&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=1weektogo&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>. If you’re one of the brilliant minds focused on changing the future of transportation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=1weektogo&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=1weektogo&amp;display=true">grab your pass</a> and join your tribe of revolutionaries.</p>
<p>Whether you’re into AI, AVs, EVs, robotics (not everything’s an acronym around here) or hunting potential unicorns, you’ll gain insight from the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=1weektogo&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=1weektogo&amp;display=true"> leading voices in mobility</a>. We packed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=1weektogo&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=1weektogo&amp;display=true">the event agenda</a> with an exciting variety of interactive presentations, panel discussions and breakout sessions. Bring your questions and join the conversation.</p>
<p>Here’s a peek at just some of the topics and people you can enjoy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Supercharging Self-Driving Super Vision:</strong> Few startups were as prescient as Scale AI when it came to anticipating the need for massive sets of tagged data for use in AI. Co-founder and CEO Alex Wang also made a great bet on addressing the needs of lidar-sensing companies early on, which has made the company instrumental in deploying AV networks. We’ll hear about what it takes to make sense of sensor data in driverless cars and look at where the industry is headed.</p>
<p><strong>Innovating Future Mobility for Global Scale:</strong> Learn how the California Mobility Center’s (CMC) model of bringing its clients’ new technologies to market is new and innovative, going beyond a typical demonstration or pilot program, to the point of product launch and sustaining market viability. Hear from an expert panel about how the CMC’s programming is unique, innovative, and game-changing.</p>
<p><strong>Building an Electric Powerhouse:</strong> Rimac Automobili, today known for its electric hypercars and battery and powertrain development, began like so many storied startups do — in a garage. Mate Rimac has taken his company from tiny upstart to a 1,000-person company that has attracted Porsche as an investor and customer. And more is coming. We’ll talk to Mate about building a startup, his views on the EVs, and what is next for the company.</p>
<p>Don’t stress out about missing out — this is a no FOMO situation. Your pass includes live streaming and VOD access. That kind of flexibility lets you attend live and still get some work done at your desk. VOD lets you tap into any of the sessions you miss.</p>
<p>But don’t miss out on the 30 game-changing mobility startups showcasing their tech and talent in the expo area. Visit their virtual booths, ask for a demo, or strike up a collaboration. You’ll also get a chance to see them pitch during the Startup Pitch Feedback Session (listed in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/#878941bf-c22c-4ec4-ab2f-d8c0c15cb8ae">the agenda</a>). Those feedback sessions can help you hone your own pitch, so check it out and take notes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DevOps platform GitLab today announced that it has acquired <a href="https://unreview.io/">UnReview</a>, a machine learning-based tool that helps software teams recommend the best reviewers for when developers want to check in their latest code. GitLab, which is looking to bring more of these machine learning capabilities to its platform, will integrate UnReview&#8217;s capabilities into its own <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/code-review/">code review workflow</a>. The two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year we decided that the future of DevOps includes ML/AI, both within the DevOps lifecycle as well as the growth of adoption of ML/AI with our customers,&#8221; David DeSanto, GitLab&#8217;s senior director, Product Management &#8211; Dev &amp; Sec, told me. He noted that when GitLab recently surveyed its customers, 75% of the teams said they are already using AI/ML. The company started by adding a bot to the platform that can automatically label issues, which then led to the team meeting with UnReview and, finally, acquiring it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159839" style="width: 844px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159839" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2159839" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png" alt="" width="834" height="599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png 834w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png?resize=768,552 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png?resize=680,488 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Code-Reviwers-Selector.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2159839" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GitLab</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our primary focus for the second half of this year in bringing on UnReview is to help automate the selection of code reviewers. It&#8217;s a very interesting problem to solve, even we at GitLab occasionally end up picking the wrong reviewers based off of what people know,&#8221; DeSanto noted.</p>
<p>GitLab launched its original code review components last year. As Wayne Haber, GitLab&#8217;s director of Engineering, noted, that was still a very manual process. Even with the new system, teams still retain full control over which reviewers will be assigned to a merge request, but the tool will automatically &#8212; and transparently &#8212; rank potential reviewers based on who the system believes is best suited to this task.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am grateful for the opportunity to share my passion for data science and machine learning with <span class="il">GitLab</span> and its community,&#8221; said <span class="il">Alexander Chueshev, </span>UnReview&#8217;s founder (and now a senior full stack engineer at <span class="il">GitLab)</span>. &#8220;I look forward to enhancing the user experience by playing a role in integrating UnReview into the <span class="il">GitLab</span> platform and extending machine learning and artificial intelligence into additional DevOps stages in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>DeSanto noted that GitLab now has quite a bit of experience in acquiring companies and integrating them into its stack. &#8220;We&#8217;re always looking to acquire strong teams and strong concepts that can help accelerate our roadmap or strategy or help the platform in general,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And you can see it over the last couple of years of acquisitions. When we were looking at extending what we did in security, we acquired two leaders in the security space to help build that portfolio out. And that&#8217;s fully integrated today. [&#8230;] In the case of this, UnReview is doing something that we thought we may need to do in the future. They had already built it, they were able to show the value of it, and it became a good partnership between the two companies, which then led to this acquisition.&#8221;</p>
<p>One interesting wrinkle here is that GitLab offers both a hosted SaaS service and allows users to run their own on-premises systems as well. Running an ML service like UnReview on-premises isn&#8217;t necessarily something that most businesses are equipped to do, so at first, UnReview will be integrated with the SaaS service. The team is still looking at how to best bring it to its self-hosted user base, including a hybrid model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://iterative.ai/">Iterative</a>, an open-source startup that is building an enterprise AI platform to help companies operationalize their models, today announced that it has raised a $20 million Series A round led by <a href="https://www.468cap.com/">468 Capital</a> and Mesosphere co-founder Florian Leibert. Previous investors <a href="https://trueventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://trueventures.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622675286816000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZJFMaSx7Twdz3oGntzNwOf5GPeQ">True Ventures</a> and <a href="https://afore.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://afore.vc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622675286816000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFRkWkRZGGSlD3qdLGZRryM7uUVwQ">Afore Capital</a> also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $25 million.</p>
<p>The core idea behind Iterative is to provide data scientists and data engineers with a platform that closely resembles a modern GitOps-driven development stack.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5xM5az78Lrg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=6&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After spending time in academia, Iterative co-founder and CEO Dmitry Petrov joined Microsoft as a data scientist on the Bing team in 2013. He noted that the industry has changed quite a bit since then. While early on, the questions were about how to build machine learning models, today the problem is how to build predictable processes around machine learning, especially in large organizations with sizable teams. &#8220;How can we make the team productive not the person? This is a new challenge for the entire industry,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Big companies (like Microsoft) were able to build their own proprietary tooling and processes to build their AI operations, Petrov noted, but that&#8217;s not an option for smaller companies.</p>
<p>Currently, Iterative&#8217;s stack consists of a couple of different components that sit on top of tools like GitLab and GitHub. These include <a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a> for running experiments and data and model versioning, <a href="https://cml.dev/">CML</a>, the company&#8217;s CI/CD platform for machine learning, and the company&#8217;s newest product, <a href="https://studio.iterative.ai/">Studio</a>, its SaaS platform for enabling collaboration between teams. Instead of reinventing the wheel, Iterative essentially provides data scientists who already use GitHub or GitLab to collaborate on their source code with a tool like DVC Studio that extends this to help them collaborate on data and metrics, too.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">“DVC Studio enables machine learning developers to run hundreds of experiments with full transparency, giving other developers in the organization the ability to collaborate fully in the process,” said Dmitry Petrov, CEO and founder of Iterative. “The funding today will help us bring more innovative products and services into our ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Petrov stressed that he wants to build an ecosystem of tools, not a monolithic platform. When the company closed this current funding round about three months ago, Iterative had about 30 employees, many of which were previously active in the open-source community around its projects. Today, that number is already closer to 60.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data, ML and AI are becoming an essential part of the industry and IT infrastructure,” said Leibert, general partner at 468 Capital. “Companies with great open source adoption and bottom-up market strategy, like Iterative, are going to define the standards for AI tools and processes around building ML models.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">F8 Refresh, Facebook&#8217;s annual developer conference with a new twist &#8212; it&#8217;s more pared down than in years past, and virtual &#8212; is going to be kicking off later today, and ahead of that Facebook is unveiling some news: <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all businesses</a> can now use the Messenger API to interact with users on Instagram. The feature is opening first to all developers globally, with a phased approach for businesses:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Phase 1 will see Instagram accounts with follower counts of over 10,000 and under 100,000 connect to the API. It plans to expand that to accounts with followers numbering between 1,000 and 100,000 in July (phase 2), with remaining accounts coming online by Q3.</p>
<p>The feature was first announced as a closed beta in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/facebook-introduces-a-new-messenger-api-with-support-for-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October</a> with select businesses &#8212; 30 developers and 700 brands in all. Now, any brand or organization using Instagram to interact with customers can use it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The key point with this tool is that this integration represents a significant step forward in how companies can leverage the wider Facebook platform.</p>
<p>In the past, a brand that wanted to interact with customers either needed to do so directly through Instagram, or via Facebook&#8217;s unified business inbox, which are limited how they can be used, especially by companies that might be handling large volumes of traffic, or keen to be able to link up those customer interactions with wider customer service databases.</p>
<p>The Messenger API, by contrast, can be integrated into any third-party application that a company or brand might be using to manage communication, whether it&#8217;s a social media management platform like Hootsuite or Sprinklr, or a CRM application that can bring in other kinds of customer data, for example warranty information or loyalty card numbers.</p>
<p>Facebook noted that one of the key takeaways from the closed beta was that brands and companies wanted better ways of managing communications from one place; and another was that many of them are making more investments in software to better manage their communications and workflows. So extending the Messenger API to Instagram was a feature that was long needed in that regard.</p>
<p>The move to expand the Messenger API to Instagram makes sense in a couple of different ways. For starters, Facebook has been turning up the volume for some time on how it leverages Instagram&#8217;s commercial potential, starting with advertising but expanding into areas like conversation between brands or businesses and users, and most recently, enhanced shopping features. Facebook also notes that 90% of Instagram users today follow at least one business, so creating a better route for managing those conversations is a logical move.</p>
<p>At the same time, Facebook has been working on ways of better linking up its various apps and platforms &#8212; which include Facebook itself, Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram and Oculus, not just for users to interact across them but to help businesses leverage them in a more unified social strategy. Rolling out the Messenger API &#8212; created originally to help brands interact with bots and manage conversations on Messenger &#8212; to include support for Instagram fits into both of those bigger strategies.</p>
<p>And for those wondering why it&#8217;s being announced ahead of F8 Refresh? Perhaps it&#8217;s a hint of what is the social network&#8217;s bigger priorities for this year&#8217;s event: partnerships to enable more business to take place on the social networking giant&#8217;s platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’ve been hearing a lot about International Entrepreneur Parole lately. I’m wondering if both my co-founder, who is currently on an H-1B that we’re in the process of transferring to our startup, and an employee on STEM OPT, who we’re making a co-founder, would be eligible to apply. How does parole work and how long does it take? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Also, we are close to securing $200,000 in investments. Do we have to raise another $50,000 to sponsor someone for parole?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Looking for Answers in Los Altos</strong></p>
<p>Dear Looking,</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to me with your <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/entrepreneur-parole/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP) questions! What makes IEP so exciting is its flexibility: Up to three co-founders of a startup can self-petition for IEP, which means they don’t need an employer sponsor. Unlike an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B</a> or another work visa, this is great because the applicant can be the boss of the company. Moreover, if your startup has raised less than $250,000, your team can still qualify for IEP by submitting evidence of your startup’s potential for rapid growth and job creation. Take a listen to my podcast <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/073-international-entrepreneur-parole-is-back/">episode on IEP</a>, which goes over the process for applying and answers some of the most frequently asked questions that I receive.</p>
<p>If your co-founders pursue IEP, I highly recommend, as usual, that they work with an immigration attorney. It’s especially important here because the stakes are so high for your company and because this is a new program, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers have little experience reviewing IEP applications. Additionally, your startup’s fundraising falls short of $250,000 from U.S. investors, so you’ll need strong legal arguments about your qualifications.</p>
<p>How new is this program? Well, it already has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/dear-sophie-how-does-the-international-entrepreneur-parole-program-work/">a lot of history</a>. Even though IEP has been available since 2017, the previous administration had unsuccessfully tried to eliminate it. Only recently did the Department of Homeland Security withdraw the proposal to rescind the IEP program, which has been available since 2017, and the the Biden administration announced it would fully implement it.</p>
<p>A 2020 Congressional Research Report on “<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46570">Immigration Parole</a>” noted that USCIS had received 28 IEP applications from the time it began them through February 10, 2020. Of those, only one was approved, 22 were denied, three were withdrawn and two were pending.</p>
<p>We don’t know exactly how long USCIS will take to make a determination on IEP applications — and USCIS said in a recent stakeholder meeting that there is no processing time yet. My law firm is in the process of submitting several applications on behalf of clients and hope to have decisions soon. We’ll keep you posted!</p>

<h2>How parole works</h2>
<p>The secretary of Homeland Security and agencies within Homeland Security, including USCIS and Customs and Border Patrol, have the ability to grant parole, which allows entry to and a temporary stay in the United States. Parole has traditionally been granted for urgent humanitarian reasons, such as to persecuted refugees or those seeking medical treatment in the U.S., or to serve a public benefit, such as providing disaster assistance, cooperating with law enforcement or testifying at a trial.</p>
<p>Created by the Obama administration after Congress failed to create a startup visa, IEP allows entrepreneurs who provide a “significant public benefit” by creating jobs for American workers and expanding the U.S. economy to temporarily stay in the U.S. to grow their startup. If USCIS approves an IEP application, the entrepreneur will receive a parole document that is valid initially for 30 months.</p>
<p>Parole is not a non-immigrant (temporary) visa status, which means your co-founders cannot simply file to change their status from an H-1B or F-1 to IEP while living in the U.S. To be granted parole, your founders must leave the U.S. and reenter and get a stamp by a border officer to be “paroled” into the U.S.</p>
<p>If an entrepreneur is approved for IEP, then their spouse and dependent children (unmarried and under 21 years) are also eligible for parole during that same period. Once they arrive in the U.S., spouses are eligible to file for a work permit that would allow them to get a job or start their own business.</p>
<h2>IEP eligibility requirements</h2>
<p>To qualify for IEP, each of your co-founders will need to show that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your startup is a U.S. corporation that is less than five years old.</li>
<li>They have at least a 10% ownership stake in the startup.</li>
<li>They are central to and play an active role in the startup. I recommend that your co-founders have a C-suite title, such as chief executive officer, chief operations officer or chief technology officer, and/or a senior-level title, such as president.</li>
<li>Your startup has received at least $250,000 from qualified U.S. investors or at least $100,000 in grants or awards from federal, state or local governments.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your startup has only received $200,000, your co-founders will need to provide compelling evidence of your company’s potential for rapid growth and job creation, such as its users or customers, revenue, social impact, far reaching or national scope, or positive local or regional effects. Your attorney can support you with these legal arguments.</p>
<p>To extend IEP for another 30 months, your co-founders will need to show that:</p>
<ul>
<li>They continue to play a central and active role with the company.</li>
<li>They have at least a 5% ownership stake.</li>
</ul>
<p>And one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your startup has received at least $500,000 from qualified investments and/or qualified government grants or awards.</li>
<li>Your startup has created at least five full-time jobs with the startup entity during the initial parole period.</li>
<li>Your startup has at least $500,000 in annual revenue in the United States and averaged 20% in annual revenue growth during the initial parole period.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your startup entity partially meets funding, job creation or annual revenue criteria, your co-founders must provide compelling evidence that the startup entity continues to show substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation with the support of your attorney.</p>
<p>Although there is no wage requirement under the IEP program (like there is for H-1B visa), each of your co-founders will need to have a household income that is greater than 400% of the federal poverty line for their household size as defined by the <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines">Department of Health and Human Services</a>. For example, based on today’s requirements, a family of four would need to have a household income of more than $106,000.</p>
<p>My hope is that by the time your co-founders are ready to extend their IEP, there will already be new laws in place for a startup visa and green card pathway for startup founders. I was honored to work on this draft legislation with <a href="https://nvca.org/about-us/staff/jeff-farrah/">Jeff Farrah</a> of the National Venture Capital Association, and hopefully we’ll see some announcements soon!</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is going to be <a href="https://www.spacex.com/updates/axiom-announcement/index.html">providing more rides</a> to private astronauts to the International Space Station, on top of the previously announced mission set to take place as early as next January. All four of these flights will be for Axiom, a private commercial spaceflight and space station company, and they&#8217;re set to take place between early next year through 2023.</p>
<p>SpaceX&#8217;s Crew Dragon and Falcon 9 spacecraft make up the first commercial launch system certified for transporting humans to the ISS, and they&#8217;ve already delivered three groups of NASA astronauts to the orbital lab, including one demo crew for its final qualification test, and two operational crews to live and work on the station. In May, Axiom and NASA revealed the details of their AX-1 mission, the first all-private launch to the ISS, which will carry four passengers to the station on a Crew Dragon to live and work in space for a duration of eight days in total.</p>
<p>NASA and SpaceX will be providing training to all four of the Axiom crews set to make the trip to the station. And while neither SpaceX or Axiom has shared more details yet  on what the other three missions will entail, or when they&#8217;re set to take place, four missions in two years technically absorbs all the existing capacity NASA has allocated for private astronaut missions, which is set at 2 per year, for 2022 and 2023.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>One private astronaut flight to the ISS is already set for 2021: Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa booked a ride to the station aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket for early December. Maezawa booked through Space Adventures, which has already provided a handful of trips for deep-pocketed private astronauts over the course of the past couple of decades.</p>
<p>Axiom meanwhile envisions a somewhat less niche, and more continually active future for commercial orbital space stations. The company is already working on a commercial module to be added to the existing ISS, and has designs on building a fully private successor to the station in future. Booking four trips with multiple crew members in two years goes a long way towards showing there&#8217;s more than just very sporadic demand from eccentric rich people for this kind of offering.</p>
