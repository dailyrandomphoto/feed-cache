										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://givz.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Givz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has developed an API-powered platform that gives brands a way to convert discounts into donations, has raised $3 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eniac and Accomplice co-led the financing for the New York-based startup. Additional investors include Supernode Ventures, Claude Wasserstein of Fine Day, Phoenix Club and Dylan Whitman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Givz was founded in 2017 to make charitable giving more accessible and convenient for the masses. In March 2020, right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the company pivoted from B2C to B2B and used the technology rails it had built to create the e-commerce marketing platform that Givz is today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company aims to drive “full-price purchasing behavior” by giving consumers the ability to convert the money they would be saving if getting a discount, and donating it to their favorite charities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the funding, Givz had been working with more than 80 enterprise, mid-market and SMB retail and e-commerce clients such as H&amp;M, Tom Brady’s TB12, Seedlip and Terez, and accumulated more than 40,000 individual users. Since the shift last year, the company has helped drive more than $1 million to 1,100 charities, according to CEO and founder Andrew Forman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It just launched on Shopify, which Forman says will give the startup access to the 1.7 million retailers that use Shopify as their e-commerce platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Givz operates under the premise that “donation-driven marketing” consistently outperforms discounts and costs less, “making it an attractive addition&#8221; to corporate marketing.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are creating a new marketing category and generating the largest sustainable charitable giving platform in the process,” he told TechCrunch. “Think of us as the Venmo for charitable giving.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of a company using Givz can be found in Tervis, which offered customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For every $50 you spend, you’ll receive $15 to give to the charity of your choice.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They used Givz technology to allow consumers to choose the charity of their choice and make a turnkey disbursement to hundreds of charities,” Forman explained. “They saw a 20% lift in website conversion and a 17% increase in average order value as a result of this offer.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192368" style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192368" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192368 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Givz.jpg?w=570" alt="" width="570" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Givz.jpg 1144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Givz.jpg?resize=126,150 126w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Givz.jpg?resize=252,300 252w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Givz.jpg?resize=768,916 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Givz.jpg?resize=570,680 570w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Givz.jpg?resize=42,50 42w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192368" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Givz</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Givz has eight employees with plans to more than double that number over the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use the new capital toward that hiring, and to do some marketing of its own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also want to explore the full potential around the consumer behavior data we collect,” Forman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the short term, Givz is focused on “Shopify growth” with direct to consumer brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we have successful use cases and huge potential with enterprise retailers and financial institutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Forman told TechCrunch. “In the future, we have our sights set on restaurants, the gaming industry and global expansion. I believe that using personalized donations to incentivize consumer behavior has endless application across industries, verticals and continents.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eniac partner Vic Singh said that there’s been a trend of brands experimenting with different ways to target the socially conscious consumer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe Givz&#8217;s donation-driven marketing platform offers brands the best way to attract the socially conscious consumer while elevating their brand, moving more inventory and driving increased order value rather than simplistic traditional discounting,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accomplice’s TJ Mahony said that both he and Singh believed SMS would emerge as a new marketing category, which led to early investments in Attentive and Postscript, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We both saw a similar opportunity with Givz,” he wrote via e-mail. “Discounting is a well worn marketing muscle, but it&#8217;s detrimental to the brand, margins and customer expectations. We believe continuous impact marketing becomes the alternative to discounting and marketers will begin to build teams and budget around thoughtful and persistent giving strategies.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Deena Shakir is a partner at Lux Capital, where she looks to invest in technologies that are streamlining analog industries while also improving lives and livelihoods. Among the companies she has backed, for example, are <a href="https://www.shiru.com/">Shiru</a>, which is leveraging computational design to create enhanced proteins to help feed the world; and <a href="https://www.allstripes.com/">AllStripes</a>, which aggregates and analyzes medical records, then sells the de-identified data to pharma companies to help them develop medicines.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a surprise that Shakir is focused on empowering people. Shakir&#8217;s father is a psychiatrist and as she <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/lux-capitals-deena-shakir-sees-space-and-frontier-tech-going-mainstream-right-now/">once told us</a>, &#8220;for a hot minute, I thought I was going to be a doctor myself.&#8221; Instead, after attending Harvard, then Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service, she wound up working for the State Department during the Obama administration, then headed to Google. She would stay for the next seven years, spending the last of them with GV, Google’s venture unit. There, her work revolved in part around some of the alternative protein companies in GV&#8217;s portfolio. Then, in 2019, she was poached by Lux.</p>
<p>Indeed, while Shakir might have once imagined working with people on an individual basis, she has become an increasingly sought-after investor in startup teams, which is why we couldn&#8217;t be more excited that she&#8217;s able to join us this year for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>. Specifically, we&#8217;re thrilled that Shakir will be judging our Startup Battlefield competition, the centerpiece of Disrupt every year and oftentimes a life-changing event for the winning team &#8212; and often runners-up, too. Consider that past winners include Vurb, Dropbox, Mint and Yammer, while runner-up Cloudflare currently boasts a market cap of $26 billion.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s because we take the competition &#8212; and our record to date &#8212; so seriously that we&#8217;re exceedingly thankful to savvy investors like Shakir, who ask the right questions, and make the tough decisions when it comes time to decide which teams to move along.</p>
<p>Want to watch and judge from home? With our entirely virtual event this year, you&#8217;re more than welcome to join us from the comfort of your home or office (and let us know what you think of the startups within the many networking forums you&#8217;ll find).</p>
<p>To watch this year&#8217;s 20+ startups compete for $100,000 &#8212; and to interact with more than 100 hours of content and thousands of enthusiastic startup fans &#8212; make sure to book your pass to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">TC Disrupt, happening September 21-23</a> &#8212; all for less than $100.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine">granted full approval</a> to Pfizer-BioNTech&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine, making it the first vaccine to achieve that status. The mRNA-based vaccine has been available since late last year through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), and will continue to be offered under that designation for those aged 12 to 15 until that separate approval process goes through, but the U.S. drug regulator now recognizes the Pfizer vaccine as fully approved and certified for adults 16 and up.</p>
<p>Part of receiving the approval means that Pfizer and BioNTech can now officially market their vaccine in the U.S., and the FDA revealed it&#8217;ll be offered under the trade dress &#8216;Comirnarty,&#8217; which doesn&#8217;t strike me as particularly catchy but at least it&#8217;s less of a mouthful than &#8216;the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.&#8217; FDA approval also means that the vaccine has met all of the administration&#8217;s standards for safety and efficacy, including preclinical and clinical trial data, as well as information about tits manufacture, and data gathered from its use during the EUA period.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s hope that this new full authorization will encourage fence-sitters who have offered up &#8216;I&#8217;ll wait until it&#8217;s fully approved&#8217; as an excuse for not yet having gotten the vaccine despite its availability. At the very least, it&#8217;s going to be a lot harder for those hesitating to justify their unreasonable and irresponsible stance in the face of the ongoing pandemic.</p>
<p>Comirnarty got flagged for &#8216;Priority Review&#8217; by the FDA, which essentially means that the administration devoted its full attention to the process in order to expedite it. No word yet on a timeline for Moderna&#8217;s approval, but it&#8217;s also in the priority review queue.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be talking to BioNTech CEO and co-founder Uğur Şahin at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ursheetpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=ugursahinpost&amp;display=TRUE">TC Disrupt 2021</a> this year, so be sure to check out that virtual event coming up September 21-23.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve spent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/24/should-we-be-worried-about-insurtech-valuations/">quite a lot of time</a> of late wondering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/a-lot-of-cash-and-little-love-an-insurtech-story/?tpcc=ECTW2020">just what the heck</a> is up with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/what-happens-when-wall-street-falls-out-of-love-with-your-sector/">the valuations of insurtech startups that went public</a> in the last year. Keep in mind that we&#8217;re discussing neoinsurance providers like MetroMile and Hippo, not insurtech marketplaces <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/insurify-raises-23m-series-a-to-add-new-coverage-varietals-boost-its-marketing-efforts/">like Insurify</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/the-zebra-reaches-100m-run-rate-turns-profitable-as-insurtech-booms/">or Zebra</a>.</p>
<p>There was a stream of insurtech exits in 2020 and early 2021. After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/high-flying-ipos-for-lemonade-and-accolade-may-encourage-other-unicorns-to-go-public/">Lemonade&#8217;s firecracker IPO</a>, MetroMile and Hippo and Root also went public. Since those debuts, we&#8217;ve seen their valuations erode significantly.</p>

<hr />
<p>But Oscar Health got somewhat lost in our larger analysis of the space. An investor pointed out to The Exchange this weekend that we were a bit early in wondering just what investors were thinking when Oscar was going public &#8212; its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/oscar-healths-initial-ipo-price-is-so-high-it-makes-me-want-to-swear/">IPO price range felt incredibly high, and we said so</a>. Then, Oscar Health priced above that $32 to $34 per share interval, kicking off its life <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/oscar-health-prices-ipo-at-39-and-secures-a-9-5b-valuation/">worth $39 per share</a>.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s it&#8217;s worth $13.58 per share.</p>
<p>We could call it another data point in our larger analysis, but it&#8217;s a bit more than that as Oscar Health expands the list of insurance <em>types</em> that startups tackled, scaled, took public and then saw fall out of investor favor. The companies that we are examining cover a number of industries, from auto insurance (Root, MetroMile), to home and rental insurance (Hippo, Lemonade), and, thanks to Oscar Health, health insurance as well. All are taking a whacking by the market.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em> Happily, I think I&#8217;ve figured it out. More precisely, a CEO of a neoinsurance company in a different niche talked The Exchange through one particular hypothesis that makes rather good sense.</p>
<h2>Show me the <del>money</del> metrics</h2>
<p>Last week, I chatted with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnswigart/">Pie Insurance co-founder CEO John Swigart</a>. Pie sells SMB-focused insurance, with a focus on workers&#8217; comp coverage. In Swigart&#8217;s view, small businesses have historically been overcharged and underserved for insurance. With a bit of tech, his company can offer coverage to smaller companies than many traditional insurance providers found attractive, and at better price points to boot.</p>
<p>Pie raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/pie-insurance-raises-118m/">a $118 million Series C</a> in March, with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pie-insurance/company_financials">Crunchbase tallying $306 million</a> in external capital for the company thus far. We&#8217;ll talk more about Pie at a later date.</p>
<p>What matters for our needs this morning is what Swigart said when I asked him what in the flying fuck was going on with public insurtech share prices. Given that he is building a related company, I was hoping that he would be both up to speed and have a take. He did.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a>. I <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">also tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s show was good fun to put together. Here&#8217;s what we got to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global stocks are up to kick off the week. It&#8217;s a great way to start Monday, frankly.</li>
<li>Thinking broadly, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/china-roundup-bytedance-amazon/">latest regulatory news</a> from China regarding ByteDance is not super bullish for the nation&#8217;s tech industry. And what the <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/big-tech-thought-it-had-a-billion-users-in-the-bag-now-its">Indian government is doing to its own technology industry is not encouraging</a>. But all of that <em>and</em> tension between the two countries, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/tencent-in-talks-to-lead-funding-in-indias-pocket-fm/">not stopping deals</a>. You can&#8217;t stop deals!</li>
<li>Facebook <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/21/facebook-coronavirus-vaccine/">bowed to pressure</a>, and released a content report that it had previously shelved.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/indias-zetwerk-valued-at-1-33-billion-in-new-funding/">Zetwerk raised a $150 million Series E.</a> The Indian startup scene is trucking right along, perhaps acting a bit as-if its government wasn&#8217;t increasingly authoritarian.</li>
<li>Shelf.io raised a $52.5 million Series B in what we&#8217;re somewhat considering a classic Tiger-led deal.</li>
<li>And the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/virgin-orbit-to-go-public-via-3-2b-spac-deal/">SPAC boom is not over yet</a>, with yet another Virgin space company headed for the public markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Woo! And that&#8217;s the start to the week. Hugs from here, and we&#8217;ll chat you on Wednesday!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the sort of deal that we expect to see Tiger in -- an outsized investment compared to prior rounds into a high-growth company that has lots of market room. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Covering public companies can be a bit of a drag. They grow some modest amount each year, and their constituent analysts pester them with questions about gross margin expansion and sales rep efficiency. It can be a little dull. Then there are startups, which grow much more quickly &#8212; and are more fun to talk about.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the case with <a href="https://shelf.io/">Shelf.io</a>. The company announced an impressive set of metrics this morning, including that from July 2020 to July 2021, it grew its annual recurring revenue (ARR) 4x. Shelf also disclosed that it secured a $52.5 million Series B led by Tiger Global and Insight Partners.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s quick growth for a post-Series A startup. Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shelf-io">reckons</a> that the company raised $8.2 million before its Series B, while <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> pegs the number at $6.5 million. Regardless, the company was efficiently expanding from a limited capital base before its latest fundraising event.</p>
<p>What does the company&#8217;s software do? Shelf plugs into a company&#8217;s information systems, learns from the data, and then helps employees respond to queries without forcing them to execute searches or otherwise hunt for information.</p>
<p>The company is starting with customer service as its target vertical. According to Shelf CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sedarius-tekara-perrotta-14658235">Sedarius Perrotta</a>, Shelf can absorb information from, say, Salesforce, SharePoint, legacy knowledge management platforms, and Zendesk. Then, after training models and staff, the company&#8217;s software can begin to provide support staff with answers to customer questions as they talk to customers in real time.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s tech can also power responses to customer queries not aimed at a human agent and provide a searchable database of company knowledge to help workers more quickly solve customer issues.</p>
<p>Per Perrotta, Shelf is targeting the sales market next, with others to follow. How might Shelf fit into sales? According to the company, its software may be able to offer staff already-written proposals for similar-seeming deals and other related content. The gist is that at companies that have lots of workers doing similar tasks &#8212; clicking around in Salesforce, or answering support queries, say &#8212; Shelf can learn from the activity and get smarter in helping employees with their tasks. I presume that the software&#8217;s learning ability will improve over time, as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shelf, around 100 people today, hopes to double in size by the end of the year, and then double again next year.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where the new capital comes in. Hiring folks in the worlds of machine learning and data science is very expensive. And because the company wants to scale those hires quickly, it will need a large bank balance to lean on.</p>
<p>Quick ARR growth was not the only reason why Shelf was able to secure such an outsized Series B, at least when compared to how much capital it had raised before. Per Perrotta, Shelf has 130% net dollar retention and no churn to report, meaning its customers are both sticky and expand organically.</p>
<p>While Shelf is interesting today and has certainly found niches it can sell into in its current form, I am more curious about how far the company can take its machine learning system, called MerlinAI. If its tech can get sufficiently smart, its ability to prompt and help employees could reduce onboarding time and the overall cost of employee training. That would be a huge market.</p>
<p>This is the sort of deal that we expect to see Tiger in &#8212; an outsized investment compared to prior rounds into a high-growth company that has lots of market room. Whatever price Tiger just paid for the company&#8217;s stock, a few years of continued growth should de-risk the investment. By our read, Tiger is really just the market-leading bull on software market growth in the long term. Shelf fits into that thesis neatly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal will now allow users outside the U.S. to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency for the first time. The company announced today the launch of <a href="http://www.paypal.com/uk/crypto">a new service</a> that will allow customers in the U.K. to select between four types of cryptocurrencies &#8212; including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash &#8212; which can be purchased using a connected bank account or debit card.</p>
<p>The company first rolled out support for cryptocurrency in the U.S. last fall, in partnership with <a href="https://www.paxos.com/">Paxos Trust Company</a>. That service reached all U.S. customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/paypal-says-all-users-in-u-s-can-now-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies/">as of mid-November.</a> PayPal-owned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/venmo-adds-support-for-buying-holding-and-selling-cryptocurrencies/">Venmo also added support</a> for cryptocurrency last spring.</p>
<p>U.K. customers who want to purchase cryptocurrency can now do so via the PayPal website or mobile app, where they can choose from pre-determined purchase amounts or enter another amount of their own choosing. PayPal says users will be able to start buying as little as £1 of cryptocurrency, if they choose. There are, however, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees?locale.x=en_GB">transaction fees</a> and currency conversion fees when buying and selling <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees?locale.x=en_GB">cryptocurrency</a>, the company notes. These vary based on the amount of cryptocurrency being bought or sold.</p>
<p>The new service itself is very much like PayPal&#8217;s U.S. offering with one notable exception. PayPal told us it&#8217;s tailoring the transaction limits for its U.K. customers. At launch, the maximum amount for any single crypto purchase is £15,000. The maximum amount for purchases over a 12-month period is £35,000. In the U.S., the company had initially launched the service with a $20,000 weekly purchase limit. But it <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/paypal-increases-crypto-purchase-limits-to-100k">upped that to $100,000 in July</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/15/paypal-ups-weekly-crypto-purchase-limit-fivefold-to-100000-.html">dropped its annual purchase limit</a>.</p>
<p>The company also told TechCrunch the U.K. made sense as the first international expansion for its cryptocurrency service because it&#8217;s a fintech hub as well as PayPal&#8217;s second-largest market globally, where it has a sizable base of consumer customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that we&#8217;re going to be helping the cryptocurrency ecosystem develop further in the U.K. In the U.S, we knew there was high demand for this service. Yet we were surprised to see the level of customer engagement for PayPal’s in-app crypto service from day one,&#8221; a PayPal spokesperson said. &#8220;Since we’ve launched, we’ve seen incredible and sustained engagement from our users. Consumers who buy, hold and sell  cryptocurrency on our platform in the US log on at 2x their previous rate,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency will also be a key feature in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/paypals-new-super-app-is-ready-to-launch-will-also-include-messaging/">PayPal&#8217;s forthcoming &#8220;super app</a>,&#8221; which is due to roll out over the next several months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company would not comment on if or when it would expand its other cryptocurrency services to the U.K., including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/paypals-new-feature-allows-u-s-consumers-to-check-out-using-cryptocurrency/">its more recently launched &#8220;Checkout with Crypto,</a>&#8221; which allows customers to checkout using their cryptocurrency at millions of online businesses by first converting the crypto needed for the transaction into fiat currency. Instead, PayPal said it wanted to first learn and observe how its U.K. customers adopt the new offering to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency before rolling out more features and functionality.</p>
<p>Beyond its support for cryptocurrency in its own apps, PayPal&#8217;s venture capital arm has also made a number investments in crypto and the blockchain over the past months, including by participating in <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-06-17-TRM-Labs-Raises-14-Million-Series-A-Funding-Round">the $14 million Series A</a> for cryptocurrency risk management software TRM Labs; in <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-05-27-PayPal-Ventures-Invests-In-Talos-Series-A-Funding-Round">the $40 million Series A</a> for digital asset trading infrastructure company, Talos; and in <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-03-02-PayPal-Ventures-Invests-In-TaxBits-Series-A-Funding-Round">the $100 million Series A</a> for crypto tax software company TaxBit.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic has accelerated digital change and innovation across all aspects of our lives— including the digitization of money and greater consumer adoption of digital financial services,&#8221; Jose Fernandez da Ponte, Vice President and General Manager, Blockchain, Crypto and Digital Currencies at PayPal, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our global reach, digital payments expertise, and knowledge of consumer and businesses, combined with rigorous security and compliance controls provides us the unique opportunity, and the responsibility, to help people in the U.K. to explore cryptocurrency. We are committed to continue working closely with regulators in the U.K., and around the world, to offer our support—and meaningfully contribute to shaping the role digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Currently, PayPal offers support for cryptocurrency in the U.S., excluding Hawaii, and U.S. territories, in addition to the U.K., but says it&#8217;s exploring the potential for digital currencies through partnerships with licensed and regulated cryptocurrency platforms and with central banks elsewhere in the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more companies provide more API-first services, <a href="https://www.moesif.com/">Moesif</a> has developed a way for those companies to learn how their customers are utilizing them.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based startup is adding to its capital raise Monday with the announcement of a $12 million Series A round led by David Sacks and Arra Malekzadeh of Craft Ventures. Existing investor Merus Capital, which led Moesif’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/04/moesif-raises-3-5m-seed-round-to-provide-insight-into-api-usage/">$3.5 million seed round</a> in 2019, also participated in the round, bringing the company’s total raise to $15.5 million, Moesif co-founder and CEO Derric Gilling told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Gilling and Xing Wang founded Moesif in 2017 and went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/our-favorite-startups-from-alchemist-accelerator-batch-15/slide/2/">through the Alchemist Accelerator</a> in 2018.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SWbz51xtVS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/04/moesif-raises-3-5m-seed-round-to-provide-insight-into-api-usage/">Moesif raises $3.5M seed round to provide insight into API usage</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Moesif raises $3.5M seed round to provide insight into API usage&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/04/moesif-raises-3-5m-seed-round-to-provide-insight-into-api-usage/embed/#?secret=SWbz51xtVS" data-secret="SWbz51xtVS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Companies seeking data around API usage and workflow traditionally had to build that capability in-house on top of a tech like Snowflake, Gilling said. One of the problems with that was if someone wanted a report, the process was ad hoc, meaning they would file a ticket and wait until a team had time to run the report. In addition, companies find it difficult to accurately bill customers on usage or manage when someone exceeds the rate limits.</p>
<p>“We started to see people build on top of our platform and pull data on APIs, and they started asking us how to directly serve customers, like making them aware if they are hitting a rate limit,” Gilling added. “We started to build new functionality and a way to customize the look and feel of the platform.”</p>
<p>Moesif provides self-service analytics that can be accessed daily and features to scale analytics in a more cost-effective manner. Customers use it to monitor features to better understand when there are issues with the API, and there are additional capabilities to understand who is using the API, how often and who may be likely to stop using a product based on how they are using it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also now seeing its revenue grow over 20% month over month this year and adoption by more diverse use cases and larger companies. At the time of the seed round, the company was just getting started with analytics and user trials, Gilling said. Today, it boasts a customer list that includes UPS, Tomorrow.io, Symbl.ai and Deloitte.</p>
<p>The company has also gone from a team of two to nine employees, and Gilling expects to use the new funding to bolster that roster across engineering, sales, developer relations and customer success.</p>
<p>He is also focusing on being a thought leader in the space and is pushing go-to-market and building out a new set of features to monetize APIs and improve its dashboard to better differentiate Moesif from competitors, which he said focus more on server health versus customer usage.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Craft Ventures’ Malekzadeh is joining Moesif’s board. She was introduced to Gilling by another portfolio company and felt Moesif fit into Crafts’ thesis on SaaS companies.</p>
<p>Malekzadeh’s particular interest is in developer tools, and while in her previous position working at a startup developing APIs, she felt firsthand the pain point of not being able to know how those APIs were being used, how much customers should be billed and “was always bugging the product and engineering teams for reports.”</p>
<p>Moesif didn’t exist at the time she worked at the startup, and instead, her company had to build it own tools that turned out to be clunky, while at the same time recruiting top engineers that didn’t want to take up their time with building something that wasn’t the company’s core product.</p>
<p>“The two founders are highly technical, but they provided great content on their website that helped me learn about them,” Malekzadeh added. “One of the interesting things about them is that even though they are technical, they speak the same language as a business user, which makes them special as a developer-first company. Just the growth in their revenue was super impressive, and their customer references were glowing.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese-backed and Africa-focused fintech company OPay raised $400 million in new financing led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/softbank-bets-on-fintech-startup-opay-at-2-billion-valuation?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a> Monday, valuing the company at $2 billion.</p>
<p>The round, which marks the Fund&#8217;s first investment in an African startup, drew participation from existing investors like Sequoia Capital China, Redpoint China, Source Code Capital, and Softbank Ventures Asia. Other investors, including DragonBall Capital and 3W Capital, also took part in the new financing round.</p>
<p>This news comes three months after The Information <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/african-fintech-opay-reportedly-raising-400m-at-a-1-5b-valuation/">reported</a> that the company was in talks to raise &#8220;up to $400 million at a $1.5 billion valuation&#8221; from a group of Chinese investors. The new financing also comes two years after OPay announced two funding rounds in 2019 — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/opera-founded-starup-opay-raises-50m-for-mobile-finance-in-nigeria/">$50 million</a> in June and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/17/operas-africa-fintech-startup-opay-gains-120m-from-chinese-investors/">$120 million Series B</a> in November.</p>
<p>In an emailed statement, OPay CEO Yahui Zhou said OPay &#8220;wants to be the power that helps emerging markets reach a faster economic development.&#8221; The company, founded in 2018, had an exclusive presence in Nigeria before last year.</p>
<p>While the company started with providing customers with digital services in their everyday life from mobility and logistics to e-commerce and fintech at cheap rates, those super app plans have been largely underwhelming.</p>
<p>Right now, it&#8217;s the company&#8217;s mobile money and payment arm that thrives the most. By simply allowing unbanked and underbanked users in Nigeria to send and receive money and pay bills through a network of thousands of agents, OPay has grown at an exponential rate.</p>
<p>The company plays in an extremely competitive fintech market. Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation, and with a <a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/archives/sub-saharan-africa">large share of its people underbanked and unbanked</a>, fintech is the most promising digital sector in the country. The same can be said for the continent as a whole. Mobile money services have long catered to the needs of the underbanked. Per GSMA, Africa had more than 160 million active mobile money users generating over $495 billion in transaction value last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Parent company Opera reported that OPay’s monthly transactions grew 4.5x to over $2 billion in December last year. OPay also claims to process about 80% of bank transfers among mobile money operators in Nigeria and 20% of the country’s non-merchant point of sales transactions. Last year, the company also said it acquired an international money transfer license with a WorldRemit partnership also in the works.</p>
<p>Per Bloomberg, the company’s monthly transaction volumes exceed $3 billion at the moment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, OPay expanded to Egypt, and according to the company, that&#8217;s an entry point to the Middle East market.</p>
<p class="paywall">In a statement, Kentaro Matsui, a managing director at SoftBank Group Corp, said, “We believe our investment will help the company extend its offering to adjacent markets and replicate its successful business model in Egypt and other countries in the region.”</p>
<p>SoftBank joins a growing list of high-flying investors (Dragoneer, Sequoia, SVB Capital, among others) that have cut their first checks in African ventures this year. As the continent continues to show promise, fintech remains its poster child. This year up to half of the total investments raised have emerged from the sector; it contributed to more than 25% last year.</p>
<p>In addition, fintech has produced the most mega-rounds so far. TymeBank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/south-african-digital-bank-tymebank-lands-109m-from-uk-and-phillippines-investors/">raised $109 million</a> in February, Flutterwave <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">bagged a $170 million</a> round in March, while Chipper Cash <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/africa-has-another-unicorn-as-chipper-cash-raises-100m-series-c-led-by-svb-capital/">secured $100 million</a> in May.</p>
<p>OPay&#8217;s fundraise is the largest of the lot in terms of size and value, making it the second African fintech unicorn after Flutterwave and the third African unicorn after e-commerce giant Jumia. The three make up the five billion-dollar tech companies on the continent, which includes Interswitch and Fawry.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Revery.ai is developing a tool that leverages computer vision and artificial intelligence to create a better online dressing room experience.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Figuring out size and cut of clothes through a website can suck the fun out of shopping online, but <a href="https://revery.ai/">Revery.ai</a> is developing a tool that leverages computer vision and artificial intelligence to create a better online dressing room experience.</p>
<p>Under the tutelage of University of Illinois Center for Computer Science advisrr David Forsyth, a team consisting of Ph.D. students Kedan Li, Jeffrey Zhang and Min Jin Chong, is creating what they consider to be the first tool using existing catalog images to process at a scale of over a million garments weekly, something previous versions of virtual dressing rooms had difficulty doing, Li told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192326" style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192326" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192326 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery.ai-co-founders-Jeffrey-Zhang-Min-Jin-Chong-and-Kedan-Li-e1629491702515.jpg" alt="" width="912" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery.ai-co-founders-Jeffrey-Zhang-Min-Jin-Chong-and-Kedan-Li-e1629491702515.jpg 912w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery.ai-co-founders-Jeffrey-Zhang-Min-Jin-Chong-and-Kedan-Li-e1629491702515.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery.ai-co-founders-Jeffrey-Zhang-Min-Jin-Chong-and-Kedan-Li-e1629491702515.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery.ai-co-founders-Jeffrey-Zhang-Min-Jin-Chong-and-Kedan-Li-e1629491702515.jpg?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery.ai-co-founders-Jeffrey-Zhang-Min-Jin-Chong-and-Kedan-Li-e1629491702515.jpg?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Revery.ai-co-founders-Jeffrey-Zhang-Min-Jin-Chong-and-Kedan-Li-e1629491702515.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192326" class="wp-caption-text">Revery.ai co-founders Jeffrey Zhang, Min Jin Chong and Kedan Li. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Revery.ai</p></div></p>
<p>California-based Revery is part of Y Combinator’s summer 2021 cohort gearing up to complete the program later this month. YC has backed the company with $125,000. Li said the company already has a two-year runway, but wants to raise a $1.5 million seed round to help it grow faster and appear more mature to large retailers.</p>
<p>Before Revery, Li was working on another startup in the personalized email space, but was challenged in making it work due to free versions of already large legacy players. While looking around for areas where there would be less monopoly and more ability to monetize technology, he became interested in fashion. He worked with a different adviser to get a wardrobe collection going, but that idea fizzled out.</p>
<p>The team found its stride working with Forsyth and making several iterations on the technology in order to target business-to-business customers, who already had the images on their websites and the users, but wanted the computer vision aspect.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike its competitors that use 3D modeling or take an image and manually clean it up to superimpose on a model, Revery is using deep learning and computer vision so that the clothing drapes better and users can also <a href="https://revery.ai/revery-ai-v2/live-demo.html">customize their clothing model</a> to look more like them using skin tone, hair styles and poses. It is also fully automated, can work with millions of SKUs and be up and running with a customer in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>Its virtual dressing room product is now live on many fashion e-commerce platforms, including Zalora-Global Fashion Group, one of the largest fashion companies in Southeast Asia, Li said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192327" style="width: 664px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192327" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192327 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Landing-page-hero-gif.gif?w=654" alt="" width="654" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192327" class="wp-caption-text">Revery.ai landing page. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Revery.ai</p></div></p>
<p>“It’s amazing how good of results we are getting,” he added. “Customers are reporting strong conversion rates, something like three to five times, which they had never seen before. We released an A/B test for Zalora and saw a 380% increase. We are super excited to move forward and deploy our technology on all of their platforms.”</p>
<p>This technology comes at a time when online shopping jumped last year as a result of the pandemic. Just in the U.S., the e-commerce fashion industry made up <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/3481/fashion-e-commerce-in-the-united-states/">29.5% of fashion retail sales</a> in 2020, and the market’s value is <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/ecommerce-fashion-industry">expected to reach $100 billion this year</a>.</p>
<p>Revery is already in talks with over 40 retailers that are “putting this on their roadmap to win in the online race,” Li said.</p>
<p>Over the next year, the company is focusing on getting more adoption and going live with more clients. To differentiate itself from competitors continuing to come online, Li wants to invest body type capabilities, something retailers are asking for. This type of technology is challenging, he said, due to there not being much in the way of diversified body shape models available.</p>
<p>He expects the company will have to collect proprietary data itself so that Revery can offer the ability for users to create their own avatar so that they can see how the clothes look.</p>
<p>“We might actually be seeing the beginning of the tide and have the right product to serve the need,” he added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Adra is bringing AI into the dentist's day-to-day workflow so they can spend less time finding cavities and more time with patients.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like other areas of healthcare, the dental industry is steadily embracing technology. But while much of it is in the orthodontic realm, other startups, like <a href="https://www.adra.ai/">Adra</a>, are bringing artificial intelligence into a dentist&#8217;s day-to-day workflow, particularly in finding cavities, of what will be a $435.08 billion <a href="https://emag.medicalexpo.com/the-global-dental-services-market-expected-to-grow-to-435-billion-in-2021-report/">global dental services market</a> this year.</p>
<p>The Singapore-based company was founded in 2021, but was an idea that started last year. Co-founder Hamed Fesharaki has been a dentist for over a decade and owns two clinics in Singapore.</p>
<p>He said dentists learn to read X-rays in dental school, but it can take a few years to get good at it. Dentists also often have just minutes to read them as they hop between patients.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a result, dentists end up misdiagnosing cavities up to 40% of the time, co-founder Yasaman Nematbakhsh said. Her background is in imaging, where she developed an artificial intelligence machine identifying hard-to-see cancers, something Fesharaki thought could also be applied to dental medicine.</p>
<p>Providing the perspective of a more experienced dentist, Adra’s intent is to make every dentist “a super dentist,” Fesharaki told TechCrunch. Its software detects cavities and other dental problems on dental X-rays faster and 25% more accurately, so that clinics can use that time to better serve patients and increase revenue.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192318" style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192318" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192318 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cartoon_split_edited.jpg" alt="" width="912" height="668" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cartoon_split_edited.jpg 912w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cartoon_split_edited.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cartoon_split_edited.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cartoon_split_edited.jpg?resize=768,563 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cartoon_split_edited.jpg?resize=680,498 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cartoon_split_edited.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192318" class="wp-caption-text">Example of Adra&#8217;s software. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adra</p></div></p>
<p>“We are coming from the eye of an experienced dentist to help illustrate the problems by turning the X-rays into images to better understand what to look for,” he added. “Ultimately, the dentist has the final say, but we bring the experience element to help them compare and give them suggestions.”</p>
<p>By quickly pointing out the problem and the extent of it, dentists can decide in what way they want to treat it — for example, do a filling, a fluoride treatment or wait.</p>
<p>Along with third co-founder Shifeng Chen, the company is finishing up its time in Y Combinator’s summer cohort and has raised $250,000 so far. Fesharaki intends to do more formalized seed fundraising and wants to bring on more engineers to tackle user experience and add more features.</p>
<p>The company has a few clinics doing pilots and wants to attract more as it moves toward a U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance. Fesharaki expects it to take six to nine months to receive the clearance, and then Adra will be able to hit the market in late 2022 or early 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virgin Orbit is set to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisitions company (SPAC), the company has confirmed. The deal values the combined enterprise at $3.2 billion, and will provide Virgin Orbit with $483 million in cash at close, including a $100 million PIPE. The combined company will trade under the ticker VORB on the NASDAQ if and when the transaction concludes.</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/12/virgin-orbit-in-talks-with-spac-for-3-billion-deal-to-go-public.html">CNBC reported</a> that such a deal was in the works, and it&#8217;s been a popular exit option for private space startups in recent months. Rocket Lab&#8217;s SPAC merger was just approved, for instance, and it&#8217;ll begin trading on Wednesday, and Richard Branson&#8217;s other space company, Virgin Galactic, was the first big SPAC deal that ushered in the craze.</p>
<p>Virgin Galactic, which focuses on flying people to suborbital space, and Virgin Orbit, which transports small satellite payloads to low Earth orbit using similar technology, used to be a single company before the two split to provide more focus on their respective markets. Both Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit made significant progress this year, achieving milestone flights, including a first full crew space launch for Galactic, and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/virgin-orbit-successfully-launches-its-first-commercial-payloads-to-space/">first commercial satellite payload delivery mission for Orbit</a>.</p>

<p>Virgin Orbit launches its LauncherOne rocket from the wing of a customized 747 aircraft, which acts as a fully reusable first stage for the overall launch system. The company also has a subsidiary called VOX Space that its as a dedicated launch service provider to the national security launch market.</p>
<p>NextGen, the blank check company that Virgin Orbit is merging with to complete this transaction, is led by a former Goldman &amp; Sachs partner, and will provide up to $383 million in cash from its funds held in trust when the merger goes through.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City finally launched </span><a href="https://abc7ny.com/lime-bird-veo-scooters/10957197/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its long-awaited scooter pilot </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the Bronx this past week. Over 90 parking corrals specifically for e-scooters have been installed across the borough, but residents can also park in unobstructive locations on the sidewalk. </span><b>Bird</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>Lime</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Veo</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were the operators chosen for the pilot, each bringing their own sets of strengths. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird says it intends to focus on the mobility gap in the Bronx and will use its AI drop engine to ensure equitable deployment across all neighborhoods in the pilot zone. Veo is focused on safety and accessibility, bringing its Astro VS4, the first e-scooter with turn signals, to the mix, as well as its Cosmo, a seated e-scooter. Lime is also focusing on accessibility, with its Lime Able program, which offers an on-demand suite of adaptive vehicles. Lime also highlighted a safety quiz it will require new riders to take before hopping on a vehicle. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three companies have promised to partner with community organizations to hire locally as well as to offer discounted pricing for vulnerable groups.</span></p>
<h3>Big week for Bird</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only has Bird officially launched in NYC, but it was also awarded a 12-month permit to operate 1,500 scooters in San Francisco. Well, technically it’s </span><b>Scoot</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that got the permit, but Scoot is owned by Bird, and was kind of Bird’s backdoor way into the city. Last month, the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/the-station-bird-has-dramas-in-san-francisco-drone-delivery-startup-zipline-raises-250m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SFMTA asked Scoot to halt its operations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just as the fresh round of scooter permits were kicking off because the company was implementing its fleet manager program with unauthorized subcontractors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, after careful evaluation of Scoot’s application, SFMTA determined Scoot has qualified for a permit to operate. Scoot intends to have its vehicles back on the roads in the coming weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird also officially </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/shared-micromobility-company-bird-launches-a-consumer-electric-bike-for-2299/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched its consumer e-bike</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, dubbed the Bird Bike (which I think is also the name of their shared e-bike). Bird hasn’t had the easiest time with profitability, and really, not many scooter companies have, so this is a chance for Bird to diversify, get a piece of the $68 billion e-bike sales pie and create more brand awareness across marketplaces. The bike costs $2,229 and consumer sales will likely make up about 10% of Bird’s revenue going forward, per the company’s S-4 filing.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/bird-is-the-latest-operator-to-integrate-its-e-scooters-and-e-bikes-with-google-maps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird (and Scoot) are now integrated with </span><b>Google Maps</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/spins-electric-scooters-and-bikes-are-now-on-google-maps/"><b>Spin</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as of this week. More integrations like these, as we saw a couple weeks ago with Lime joining </span><b>Moovit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, demonstrate how shared micromobility is becoming more integrated with the way we think about moving around cities and planning our journeys. I heartily welcome such integrations. </span></p>
<p>Finally, Alex Wilhelm dug into new financial data released by Bird. The tl;dr: the quarterly data shows an improving economic model and a multiyear path to profitability. However, that path is fraught unless a number of scenarios all work out in concert and without a glitch, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/bird-shows-improving-scooter-economics-long-march-to-profitability/">Wilhelm reports</a>.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Imagine a future in which drivers don&#8217;t charge their electric vehicles but instead swap out the batteries at small, roadside pods. That&#8217;s the future <strong>Ample </strong>is imagining, and this week it announced a fresh $160 million funding round to scale its operations.</p>
<p>The internationally funded Series C was led by Moore Strategic Ventures with participation from PTT, a Thai state-owned oil and gas company, and Disruptive Innovation Fund. Existing investors Eneos, a Japanese petroleum and energy company, and Singapore’s public transit operator SMRT also participated. Ample’s total funding is now $230 million.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting idea but one that will require considerable buy-in from automakers to make it a reality &#8212; for example, by selling vehicles with either a standard battery or Ample&#8217;s battery system pre-built in. But according to Ample co-founders John de Souza and Khaled Hassounah, it wouldn&#8217;t be all that complicated for OEMs to separate the battery from the car.</p>
<p>“The marketing departments at the OEMs want to tell you that … ‘This is a super-duper battery that is very well integrated with the car; there’s no way you can separate it,’ ” Hassounah said. “The truth of the matter is they’re built completely separately and so true for almost — not almost, for every battery in the car, including a Tesla.</p>
<p>“Since we’ve built our system to be easy to interface with different vehicles, we’ve abstracted the battery component … from the vehicle,” he added.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got our attention this week …</strong></p>
<p><strong>AEye</strong>, the lidar startup, completed its reverse merger with special purpose acquisition company CF Finance Acquisition Corp. III. AEye is now a publicly traded company that trades on the Nasdaq exchange.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Canada Drives</strong>, an online car shopping and delivery platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/canada-drives-raises-79-4-million-to-expand-online-car-purchasing-and-delivery-platform/">announced $79.4 million ($100 million CAD) in Series B funding</a> that it will use to expand its service across Canada. The company is going to use its recent funding to keep enhancing the product, grow its inventory in existing and new markets and hire around 200 people over the next year, particularly in product development.</p>
<p><strong>DigiSure</strong>, a digital insurance company that caters to modern mobility form factors like peer-to-peer marketplaces, is officially coming out of stealth to announce a $13.1 million pre-Series A funding round. The startup will use the funds to hire more than 50 engineers, data scientists, business development, insurance and compliance specialists, as well as scale into new industry verticals and across into Europe.</p>
<p><strong>High Definition Vehicle Insurance Group</strong>, a commercial auto insurance company that is initially focused on trucking, raised $32.5 million in Series B funding round led by Weatherford Capital, with new investors Daimler Trucks North America and McVestCo, and continued participation from Munich Re Ventures, 8VC, Autotech Ventures and Qualcomm Ventures LLC.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>RepairSmith</strong>, a mobile auto repair service that sends a mechanic right to the driver’s home, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/repairsmith-raises-42m-series-b-to-bring-auto-repair-to-customers-doorsteps/">raised $42 million in fresh funding</a> with the aim of expanding to all major metros by the end of 2022. The company is looking to disrupt auto servicing and repair, a massive industry that hasn&#8217;t seen much change in the past 40 years.</p>
<p><strong>REE Automotive</strong> was awarded $17 million from the UK government as part of a $57 million investment, coordinated through the Advanced Propulsion Centre. The investment, the company said, is in line with the UK government&#8217;s ambition to accelerate the shift to zero-emission vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Swvl</strong>, a Dubai-based transit and mobility company, will be expanding into Europe and Latin America after it acquired a controlling interest in <strong>Shotl</strong>. Shotl, which is in 22 cities across 10 countries, matches passengers with shuttles and vans heading in that same direction. The company partners with governments and municipalities to provide mobility solutions for populations that are underserved by traditional mass transit options. While Swvl declined to share the financials of the transaction, a spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company&#8217;s &#8220;footprint is being doubled by this acquisition.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Xos Inc.</strong>, a manufacturer of electric Class 5 to Class 8 commercial vehicles completed its business combination with NextGen Acquisition Corporation. As a reuslt, Xos made its public debut on the Nasdaq exchange.</p>

<h3>Advanced Driver Assistance Systems</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary">Regarding <strong>Tesla</strong> investigations, when it rains it pours. First, the <strong>National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">opened a preliminary investigation</a> into Tesla’s Autopilot advanced driver assistance system, citing 11 incidents in which vehicles crashed into parked first responder vehicles while the system was engaged.</p>
<p>The Tesla vehicles involved in the collisions were confirmed to have either have had engaged Autopilot or a feature called Traffic Aware Cruise Control, according to <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOA-PE21020-1893.PDF">investigation documents</a> posted on the agency&#8217;s website. Most of the incidents took place after dark and occurred despite “scene control measures,” such as emergency vehicle lights, road cones and an illuminated arrow board signaling drivers to change lanes.</p>
<p>A few days later, <strong>Senators</strong> Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) asked the new chair of the <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong> to investigate Tesla’s statements about the autonomous capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/two-senators-urge-the-ftc-to-investigate-tesla-over-full-self-driving-statements/">The senators expressed particular concern over Tesla misleading customers</a> into thinking their vehicles are capable of fully autonomous driving.</p>
<p>“Tesla’s marketing has repeatedly overstated the capabilities of its vehicles, and these statements increasingly pose a threat to motorists and other users of the road,” they said. “Accordingly, we urge you to open an investigation into potentially deceptive and unfair practices in Tesla’s advertising and marketing of its driving automation systems and take appropriate enforcement action to ensure the safety of all drivers on the road.”</p>
<h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Waymo</strong>, Alphabet’s self-driving arm, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/waymo-via-is-scaling-up-autonomous-trucking-operations-in-texas-arizona-california/">seriously scaling up</a> its autonomous trucking operations across Texas, Arizona and California. The company said it was building a dedicated trucking hub in Dallas and partnering with Ryder for fleet management services.</p>
<p>The Dallas hub will be a central launch point for testing not only the Waymo Driver, but also its transfer hub model, which is a mix of automated and manual trucking that optimizes transfer hubs near highways to ensure the Waymo Driver is sticking to main thoroughfares and human drivers are handling first and last mile deliveries.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Canoo </strong>is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/ev-startup-canoo-is-gearing-up-for-production-in-oklahoma-factory/">expecting</a> 25,000 units out of its manufacturing partner VDL Nedcar&#8217;s facility by 2023, CEO Tony Aquila said during the company&#8217;s quarterly earnings call.</p>
<p>Year over year, Canoo upped its workforce from 230 to 656 total employees, 70% of which are hardware and software engineers. The startup’s operating expenses have increased from $19.8 million to $104.3 million YOY, with the majority of that increase coming from R&amp;D.</p>
<p><strong>Ford, Stellantis, Toyota and Volkswagen </strong>are among the carmakers this week that have announced production cuts in response to the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/covid-fuelled-semiconductor-crunch-chips-away-carmakers-2021-08-19/">ongoing global shortage</a> of semiconductors. It&#8217;s been a grim week.</p>
<p>A brief run-down: Toyota said it anticipated a production drop of anywhere from 60,000-90,000 vehicles across North America in August. Then Ford joined the chorus, saying it would temporarily close its F-150 factory in Kansas City. Volkswagen <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/vw-says-might-have-cut-production-further-due-chip-shortage-2021-08-19/">told Reuters</a> it couldn&#8217;t &#8220;rule out further changes to production&#8221; in light of the chip shortage. And finally, Stellantis is halting production at one of its factories in France.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla </strong>unveiled what it&#8217;s calling the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/top-five-highlights-of-elon-musks-tesla-ai-day/">&#8220;D1&#8221; computer chip</a> to power its advanced AI training supercomputer, Dojo, at its AI Day on Thursday. According to Tesla director Ganesh Venkataramanan, the D1 has GPU-level compute with CPU connectivity and twice the I/O bandwidth of “the state of the art networking switch chips that are out there today and are supposed to be the gold standards.”</p>
<p>Venkataramanan also revealed a “training tile” that integrates multiple chips to get higher bandwidth and an incredible computing power of 9 petaflops per tile and 36 terabytes per second of bandwidth. Together, the training tiles compose the Dojo supercomputer.</p>
<p>But there was more, of course. CEO Elon Musk also unveiled that the company is developing a humanoid robot, with a prototype expected in 2022. The bot is being proposed as a non-automotive robotic use case for the company’s work on neural networks and its Dojo advanced supercomputer.</p>
<p>Reality check: Tesla is not the first automaker, or company, to dip its toe into humanoid robot development.  <a href="https://asimo.honda.com/">Honda’s Asimo robot</a> has been around for decades, <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/30609642.html">Toyota</a> and <a href="https://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/R2/">GM</a> have their own robots and Hyundai recently acquired robotics company Boston Dynamic.</p>
<p>The full rundown of Tesla&#8217;s AI Day can be found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/top-five-highlights-of-elon-musks-tesla-ai-day/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>General Motors</strong> and <strong>AT&amp;T</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/general-motors-and-att-will-offer-5g-connectivity-in-certain-vehicles-from-model-year-2024/">will be rolling out 5G connectivity</a> in select Chevy, Cadillac and GMC vehicles from model year 2024, in a boost that the two companies say will bring more reliable software updates, faster navigation and downloads and better coverage on roadways.</p>
<p>5G technology has generated a lot of hype for its promises to boost speed and reduce latency across a range of industries, a next-gen tech that everyone thought would change the world far sooner than now. That hasn’t happened (yet), in part because network rollout was much slower than people anticipated. So this announcement can be taken as a clear signal that, at the very least, AT&amp;T thinks its 5G network will be mature enough to handle “millions” of connected vehicles by 2024.</p>
<h3>Ride-hailing</h3>
<p><strong>RubiRides</strong>, a new ride-hailing company focuses on transporting kids, launched in the Washington D.C. metro area. The ride-hailing service is designed for children ages 7 and older. But the service also offers ride services for seniors and people with special needs. The company was founded by Noreen Butler, who was inspired to start the company after searching for transportation to support the busy schedules of her children.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An Indian startup that operates a business-to-business marketplace for manufacturing items is the latest to attain the coveted unicorn status in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based <a href="https://www.zetwerk.com/">Zetwerk</a> said on Monday it has raised $150 million in a Series E financing round led by New York based D1 Capital Partners. New investors Avenir and IIFL also participated in the round, along with existing investors Greenoaks Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners.</p>
<p>The new investment values Zetwerk at $1.33 billion, twice of $600 million-$700 million it was valued at in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/zetwerk-raises-120-million-to-scale-its-b2b-marketplace-for-manufacturing-parts/">its Series D round in February this year</a>. The round also included several high-profile angel investors including Kunal Shah of CRED and Ritesh Aggarwal of OYO.</p>
<p>The four-year-old startup runs a business-to-business marketplace for manufacturing items that connects OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and EPC (engineering procurement construction) customers with manufacturing small-businesses and enterprises.</p>
<p>All the products it sells today &#8212; ranging from parts of crane, doors, and chassis of machines &#8212; are custom-made.</p>
<p>“Nobody has a stock of such inventories. You get the order, you find manufacturers and workshops that make them,” explained Amrit Acharya, co-founder and chief executive of Zetwerk, in an interview with TechCrunch earlier this year.</p>
<p>The startup, which in recent years has expanded to Southeast Asia and North America, said its revenue grew approximately three times in 2020-21 to $128 million to $48.52 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“In a short period of time, we believe Zetwerk has become a leader in delivering fast and cost-effective manufacturing solutions to companies globally and accelerating the pace of digital transformation of a very traditional industry,” said Jeremy Goldstein of D1 Capital Partners, in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to broaden its technology stack and expand to more international markets.</p>
<p>“Zetwerk is helping enterprises navigate the shift to digital manufacturing amidst rapidly changing global supply chains,” said Acharya. “Over the last year, more than 100 western companies have moved their supply chains to India via Zetwerk, across industrial and consumer products.”</p>
<p>Zetwerk is the 25th Indian startup to become a unicorn this year, up from 11 last year, as high-profile global investors aggressively double down on promising firms in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tencent is in advanced stages of talks to lead an investment round in Gurgaon-headquartered Pocket FM, the latest in the Chinese giant’s push to broaden its consumer internet portfolio in the Indian market.</p>
<p>The Chinese firm, which is already an investor in Pocket FM, is in talks to lead a ~20-25 million round in Pocket FM, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. The proposed term values the three-year-old startup between $75 million to $100 million, two people said. Existing investors Times Internet’s Brand Capital and Lightspeed are also participating in the round.</p>
<p>The round hasn&#8217;t closed, so the terms may change. Tencent and Pocket FM declined to comment.</p>
<p><a href="https://pocketfm.com">Pocket FM</a> operates an eponymous app that offers users podcasts and audiobooks in English and several Indian languages. On its website, the service says its catalog is over 10,000 hours. The startup works with several creators to produce audiobooks.</p>
<p>The app is available in a freemium model. It has a paid subscription as well as an ad-supported free version.</p>
<p>The investment talks come at a time when a range of Indian startups are beginning to launch in &#8212; or expand to &#8212; audio category. Indian social network ShareChat, for instance, launched a Clubhouse-like feature earlier this year.</p>
<p>Pocket FM will be Tencent’s latest bet in India’s consumer internet space. The Chinese giant is also a major investor in music streaming service Gaana and on-demand video streaming player MX Player.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tencent slowed its the pace of investments in India last year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/to-avoid-hostile-takeovers-amid-covid-19-india-mandates-approvals-on-chinese-investments/">New Delhi amended a rule</a> to require Chinese companies to take its approval before backing Indian firms. It has become more active in recent quarters, investing through debt instead of equity with a convertible note.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lagos and Toronto-based mobility startup <a href="https://plentywaka.com/">Plentywaka</a> has raised a $1.2 million seed round to scale its operations on the back of leaving the Techstars Toronto accelerator program last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canadian-based VC firm The Xchange led the round, SOSV and Shock Ventures participated, while Techstars Toronto made a follow-on investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian firms Argentil Capital Partners and ODBA &amp; Co Ventures took part in the seed round, alongside some angel investors from Canada, other parts of Africa, and the U.S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, when TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/nigerias-plentywaka-gets-backing-from-techstars-plans-expansion-to-canada/">covered</a> Plentywaka, CEO Onyeka Akumah said the two-year-old company eyed both regional and global expansion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There hasn&#8217;t been much development on the latter except that the company set up its headquarters in Canada. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for the former, it&#8217;s in the form of an acquisition. The company says it has fully acquired Ghanaian mobility startup Stabus but</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> declined to comment on the acquisition price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plentywaka is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a bus-booking platform but, per its website, has over 900 vehicles ranging from cars to vans to buses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company provides intrastate travel (via its Dailywaka offering) and interstate travel (via its Travelwaka offering) for its users via a mobile application</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since going live in September 2019,  Plentywaka says it has acquired over 80,000 users while completing up to half a million rides.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stabus, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, commenced operations in Ghana a month after Plentywaka&#8217;s launch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its co-founder and CEO, Isidore Kpotufe, shared that the startup has since moved over 100,000 people within the country&#8217;s capital city Accra using different vehicles</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192483" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192483" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2192483" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210823_000925.jpg?w=680" alt="Plentywaka" width="680" height="409" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210823_000925.jpg 967w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210823_000925.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210823_000925.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210823_000925.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210823_000925.jpg?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210823_000925.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192483" class="wp-caption-text">The Plentywaka and Stabus executives</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akumah tells TechCrunch that before talks on an acquisition started, he and Kpotufe kept in touch </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">frequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a personal and business level since they launched their respective companies two years ago</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in April this year, Isidore, intrigued by the pace at which Plentywaka was scaling, asked Akumah if his company had plans to scale to Ghana. The Plentywaka CEO answered in the affirmative, revealing a timeline edging towards the end of the year. That meant competition, but the duo thought the better outcome for both companies was to merge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Isidore is someone I&#8217;ve known for going to two years now. And I&#8217;ve seen what he has done with Stabus and I understand exactly how they operate. So it was an easy yes for us to do this,&#8221; Akumah said to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The complexities of what structure to use came up; run with the Stabus brand or change it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they settled for the latter, renaming the acquired 12,000-user strong business to Plentywaka Ghana</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of Stabus&#8217; (now Plentywaka Ghana) customers include multinationals like MTN and GB Foods. Meanwhile, Kpotufe becomes Country Manager of the new business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Plentywaka’s acquisition of Stabus is a firm statement about our commitment to grow and build the largest shared mobility startup in Africa, one country at a time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isidore is a brilliant entrepreneur and we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about having him and his team execute our plans for the Ghanaian market,” Akumah said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, the company caters to travelers across 21 cities. Travelers in Accra will begin to use the service when Plentywaka Ghana goes live on September 16. And the next plan after Accra is to replicate the expansion in six other African countries within 24 months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Akumah also mentioned that Plentywaka is raising its Series A to ramp up these expansion efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incredibly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> excited by our investment in Plentywaka. Techstars is a huge believer in the future of Africa and a proud supporter of African entrepreneurs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onyeka is a two-time Techstars founder which deepens this relationship further,&#8221; managing director of Techstars Sunil Sharma said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the seed round, managing partner at lead investor The Xchange, Todd Finch said, “The Xchange is on a mission to fuel purpose-driven founders with the capital and resources they need to realize the world-changing potential of their ideas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given Onyeka’s proven track record, his team&#8217;s undeniable thirst for making an impact, and Plentywaka’s impressive growth, we knew this was an opportunity we wanted to invest in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/dollar-worlds-currency">substantial portion of the world’s trade is done in United States dollars</a>, creating problems for businesses in countries with <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollar-shortage.asp">a dollar shortage</a>. Blockchain startup XREX was launched to help cross-border businesses in emerging markets perform faster transactions with products like a payment escrow service and crypto-fiat exchange platform.</p>
<p>The Taipei-headquartered company announced today it has raised $17 million in pre-Series A funding led by CDIB Capital Group. The oversubscribed round also included participation from SBI Investment (a subsidiary of SBI Holdings), Global Founders Capital, ThreeD Capital, E.Sun Venture Capital, Systex Corporation, MetaPlanet Holdings, AppWorks, BlackMarble, New Economy Ventures and Seraph Group. XREX’s last funding was a $7 million seed round in 2019.</p>
<p>Part of the new round will be use to apply for financial licenses in Singapore, Hong Kong and South Africa, and partner with banks and financial institutions, like payment gateways.</p>
<p>“We specifically wanted to build a regulatory-friendly cap table,” XREX co-founder and chief executive officer Wayne Huang told TechCrunch. “It’s really hard for a startup like us to raise from banks and public companies, but as you can see, this round we deliberately to do that and we were successful.”</p>
<p>Huang <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/proofpoint-inc-acquire-armorize-technologies-inc">sold his previous startup</a>, anti-malware SaaS developer Armorize Technologies, to Proofpoint in 2013. Armorize analyzed source code to find vulnerabilities, and many of its clients were developers in Bangalore and Chennai, so Huang spent a lot of time traveling there.</p>
<p>“We ran into all sorts of cross-border money transfer issues. It seemed almost unstoppable,” Huang said. “Growing up in the U.S. and then in Taiwan, we were not exposed to those issues. So that planted a seed, and then when Satoshi [Nakamoto] published the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">bitcoin white paper</a>, of course that was a big thing for all cybersecurity experts.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He began thinking of how blockchain can support financial inclusion in emerging markets like India. The idea came to fruition Huang teamed up with XREX co-founder Winston Hsiao, the founder of BTCEx-TW, one of Taiwan’s first bitcoin exchanges. Hsiao grew up in India and founded Verico International, exporting Taiwan-manufactured semiconductors and electronics to other countries, so he was also familiar with cross-border trade issues.</p>

<p>XREX Crypto Services give merchants, especially those in countries with low U.S. dollar liquidity, tools to conduct trade in digital fiat currencies. “They have to get quick access to the U.S. dollar and be able to pay it out quick enough for them to secure important commodities that they want to import, and that’s the problem we want to solve,” said Huang.</p>
<p>To use the platform, merchants and their customers sign up for XREX’s wallet, which includes a commercial escrow service called Bitcheck. Huang said it is similar to having a standby letter of credit from a commercial bank, because buyers can use it to guarantee they will be able to make payments. Bitcheck uses digital currencies like USDT and USDC, stablecoins that are pegged to the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Merchants pay stablecoin to suppliers and XREX escrows the funds until the supplier provides proof of shipment, at which point it moves the payment to them. XREX’s crypto-fiat exchange allows users to convert USDT and USDC to U.S. dollars, which they can also withdraw and deposit through the platform.</p>
<p>Part of XREX’s funding will be used to expand its fiat currency platform, though Huang said it doesn’t plan to add too many cryptocurrencies “because we’re not built for crypto traders, we’re built for businesses and brand really matters to them. Brand and compliance, so whatever the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency says is a good stablecoin is what they’re going to use.”</p>
<p>Some of XREX’s partners include compliance and anti-money laundering providers like CipherTrace, Sum&amp;Substance and TRISA. Part of XREX’s funding will be used to expand its security and compliance features, including Public Profiles, which are mandatory for customers, and user Reputation Index to increase transparency.</p>
<p>In a statement about the funding, CDIB Capital Innovation Fund head Ryan Kuo said, “CDIB was an early investor in XREX. After witnessing the company’s fast revenue growth and their commitment to compliance, we were determined to double our investment and lead this strategic round.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eG81KiDs5Dg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Twitter seems on an aggressive path to putting pedal to the metal. From its earliest days as a failwhale generator and a ransacker of third party successes, the company under Jack Dorsey’s stewardship has become an acquirer of tools to support the creators it hosts. Twitter Spaces, its Clubhouse clone, has steadily improved its UI with integration of relevant tweets at the top of a space and Twitter graph awareness of listeners. When I most recently joined a Kara Swisher spacecast, my icon appeared at the top of the window right after the host and invited speakers. But next to me on the listener list was Dan Farber, my Salesforce colleague and frequent Gillmor Gang member over the years.</p>
<p>What I think is going on is a personalization based on my Twitter social graph. A subtle touch, but much more interesting to me than some sort of global Twitter ranking that factors in celebrities and other signals not as relevant as what the feature reflects, an algorithm of, to borrow a phrase, influencer rank. Not influence at a social level, but guided by my own internal algorithm, that if I was looking for friends in a space of over a thousand people, Dan is now a simple direct message away when I click on his icon.</p>
<p>There are other tweaks in Spaces, but the most important one may turn out to be integration of Spaces metadata in the new Twitter API v2. In effect, this capability could be harnessed by third party developers to create their own algorithms around Space dynamics and listener uptake by host, speakers, topics, and scheduled events. Other contiguous projects include a pilot to wire up your Twitter profile to your Revue newsletter. Clicking on the link takes you to a page detailing recent newsletters and links to joining as a subscriber. Twitter, which bought Revue to compete with Substack, is extending clever integration points like Revue’s RSS-enabled drag and drop support for feeds you can mine for citations as you build your newsletter.</p>
<p>A few weeks or months ago, I wouldn’t have paid much attention to the growing conversation around crypto. That would include Jack Dorsey’s moves in his companies Square and Twitter to promote the possibilities of the blockchain and growing attention from Congress and regulatory agencies. Eye opening was the impact on the bipartisan Infrastructure bill, where an anti-crypto tax-related amendment threatened to slow down Senate adoption before failing. But Twitter’s success at consolidating various assets around the growth of the subscription and social audio sectors makes me think at least twice about other things being connected. On this Gillmor Gang episode, Keith Teare and the Gang rehash the same ground about the viability of crypto. But it’s hard to argue that, whether or not anyone can answer the question of what problem crypto solves, it may factor into a surprising variety of solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello friends, and welcome back to Week in Review!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m back from a very fun and rehabilitative couple weeks away from my phone, my Twitter account and the news cycle. That said, I actually really missed writing this newsletter, and while Greg did a fantastic job while I was out, I won’t be handing over the reins again anytime soon. Plenty happened this week and I struggled to zero in on a single topic to address, but I finally chose to focus on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-goes-toe-to-toe-with-nasa-in-federal-court-over-award-to-spacex/">Bezos&#8217;s Blue Origin suing NASA</a>.</p>

<h2>The big thing</h2>
<p class="p1">I was going to write about OnlyFans for the newsletter this week and their fairly shocking move to ban sexually explicit content from their site in a bid to stay friendly with payment processors, but alas I couldn’t help myself and wrote an article for ole TechCrunch dot com instead. Here’s a link if you’re curious.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BNyqhygIbd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-porn-ban-is-cryptos-opportunity-of-a-lifetime/">OnlyFans’ porn ban is crypto’s opportunity of a lifetime</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OnlyFans’ porn ban is crypto’s opportunity of a lifetime&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-porn-ban-is-cryptos-opportunity-of-a-lifetime/embed/#?secret=BNyqhygIbd" data-secret="BNyqhygIbd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p1">Now, I should also note that while I was on vacation I missed all of the conversation surrounding Apple’s incredibly controversial child sexual abuse material detection software that really seems to compromise the perceived integrity of personal devices. I’m not alone in finding this to be a pretty worrisome development despite Apple’s intention of staving off a worse alternative. Hopefully, one of these weeks I’ll have the time to talk with some of the folks in the decentralized computing space about how our monolithic reliance on a couple tech companies operating with precious little consumer input is very bad. In the meantime, I will point you to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">some reporting from TechCrunch’s own Zack Whittaker</a> on the topic which you should peruse because I’m sure it will be a topic I revisit here in the future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1"><strong>Now then!</strong> Onto the topic at hand.</p>
<p class="p1">Federal government agencies don’t generally inspire much adoration. While great things have been accomplished at the behest of ample federal funding and the tireless work of civil servants, most agencies are treated as bureaucratic bloat and aren’t generally seen as anything worth passionately defending. Among the public and technologists in particular, NASA occupies a bit more of a sacred space. The American space agency<span class="Apple-converted-space"> has generally been a source of bipartisan enthusiasm, as has its goal to return astronauts to the lunar surface by 2024.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Which brings us to some news this week. While so much digital ink was spilled on Jeff Bezos&#8217;s little jaunt to the edge of space, cowboy hat, champagne and all, there’s been less fanfare around his space startup’s lawsuit against NASA, which we&#8217;ve now learned will delay the development of a new lunar lander by months, potentially throwing NASA&#8217;s goal to return astronauts to the moon&#8217;s surface on schedule into doubt.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin goes toe-to-toe with NASA in federal court over award to SpaceX&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-goes-toe-to-toe-with-nasa-in-federal-court-over-award-to-spacex/embed/#?secret=F4ouwnRYGy" data-secret="F4ouwnRYGy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Bezos&#8217;s upstart Blue Origin is protesting the fact that they were not awarded a government contract while Elon Musk&#8217;s SpaceX earned a $2.89 billion contract to build a lunar lander. This contract wasn&#8217;t just recently awarded either, SpaceX won it back in April and Blue Origin had already filed a complaint with the Government Accountability Office. This happened before Bezos penned an open letter promising a $2 billion discount for NASA which had seen budget cuts at the hands of Congress dash its hoped to award multiple contracts. None of these maneuverings proved convincing enough for the folks at NASA, pushing Bezos&#8217;s space startup to sue the agency.</p>
<p class="p1">This little feud has caused long-minded Twitter users to dig up this little gem from a Bezos 2019 speech — as transcribed by Gizmodo &#8212; highlighting Bezos&#8217;s own distaste for how bureaucracy and greed have hampered NASA&#8217;s ability to reach for the stars:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><i>&#8220;To the degree that big NASA programs become seen as jobs programs and that they have to be distributed to the right states where the right Senators live, and so on. That is going to change the objective. Now your objective is not to, you know, whatever it is, to get a man to the moon or a woman to the moon, but instead to get a woman to the moon while preserving X number of jobs in my district. That is a complexifier, and not a healthy one…[…]</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Today, there would be, you know, three protests, and the losers would sue the federal government because they didn’t win. It’s interesting, but the thing that slows things down is procurement. It’s become the bigger bottleneck than the technology, which I know for a fact for all the well meaning people at NASA is frustrating.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Blue Origin spokesperson called the suit, an “attempt to remedy the flaws in the acquisition process found in NASA’s Human Landing System.&#8221; But the lawsuit really seems to highlight how dire this deal is to the ability of Blue Origin to lock down top talent. Whether the startup can handle the reputational risk of suing NASA and delaying America&#8217;s return to the moon seems to be a question very much worth asking.</p>

<h2>Other things</h2>
<p><em>Here are the TechCrunch news stories that especially caught my eye this week:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/"><b>OnlyFans bans &#8220;sexually explicit content&#8221;</b></a><br />
A lot of people had pretty visceral reactions to OnlyFans killing off what seems to be a pretty big chunk of its business, outlawing &#8220;sexually explicit content&#8221; on the platform. It seems the decision was reached as a result of banking and payment partners leaning on the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/musk-the-tesla-bot-is-coming/"><b>Musk &#8220;unveils&#8221; the &#8220;Tesla Bot&#8221;</b></a><br />
I truly struggle to even call this news, but I&#8217;d be remiss not to highlight how Elon Musk had a guy dress up in a spandex outfit and walk around doing the robot and spawned hundreds of news stories about his new &#8220;Tesla Bot.&#8221; While there certainly could be a product opportunity here for Tesla at some point, I would bet all of the dogecoin in the world that his prototype &#8220;coming next year&#8221; either never arrives or falls hilariously short of expectations.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/facebook-finally-made-a-good-virtual-reality-app/"><b>Facebook drops a VR meeting simulator</b></a><br />
This week, Facebook released one of its better virtual reality apps, a workplace app designed to help people host meetings inside virtual reality. To be clear, no one really asked for this, but the company made a full court PR press for the app which will help headset owners simulate the pristine experience of sitting in a conference room.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/taliban-social-media-facebook-youtube-twitter/">Social platforms wrestle with Taliban presence on platforms</a><br />
</b>Following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, social media platforms are being pushed to clarify their policies around accounts operated by identified Taliban members. It&#8217;s put some of the platforms in a hairy situation.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/facebook-widely-viewed-content-reports/"><b>Facebook releases content transparency report</b></a><br />
This week, Facebook released its first ever content transparency report, highlighting what data on the site had the most reach over a given time period, in this case a three-month period. Compared to lists highlighting which posts get the most engagement on the platform, lists generally populated mostly by right wing influencers and news sources, the list of posts with the most reach seems to be pretty benign.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/"><b>Safety regulators open inquiry into Tesla Autopilot</b></a><br />
While Musk talks about building a branded humanoid robot, U.S. safety regulators are concerned with why Tesla vehicles on Autopilot are crashing into so many parked emergency response vehicles.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Investors and politicians embracing a vision of an all-electric car future believe that path will significantly reduce global carbon dioxide emissions. That’s far from clear.</p>
<p>A growing body of research points to the likelihood that widespread replacement of conventional cars with EVs would likely have a relatively small impact on global emissions. And it’s even possible that the outcome would <i>increase</i> emissions.</p>
<p>The issue is not primarily about the emissions resulting from producing electricity. Instead, it’s what we know and don’t know about what happens before an EV is delivered to a customer, namely, the “embodied” emissions arising from the labyrinthine supply chains to obtain and process all the materials needed to fabricate batteries.</p>
<p>All products entail embodied emissions that are ‘hidden’ upstream in production processes, whether it’s a hamburger, a house, a smartphone, or a battery. To see the implications at the macro level, credit France’s High Climate Council for a <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/frances-imported-emissions-are-70-higher-than-domestic-co2-output-report-finds/">study</a> issued last year. The analysis found that France’s claim of achieving a national decline in carbon dioxide emissions was illusory. Emissions had in fact increased and were some 70% higher than reported once the embodied emissions inherent in the country’s imports were counted.</p>
<p>Embodied emissions can be devilishly difficult to accurately quantify, and nowhere are there more complexities and uncertainties than with EVs. While an EV self-evidently emits nothing while driving, about 80% of its total lifetime emissions arise from the combination of the embodied energy in fabricating the battery and then in &#8216;fabricating&#8217; electricity to power the vehicle. The remaining comes from manufacturing the non-fuel parts of the car. That ratio is inverted for a conventional car where about 80% of lifecycle emissions come directly from fuel burned while driving, and the rest comes from the embodied energy to make the car and fabricate gasoline.</p>
<p>Virtually every feature of the fuel-cycle for conventional cars is well-understood and narrowly bounded, significantly monitored if not tightly regulated, and largely assumption-free. That’s not the case for EVs.</p>
<p>For example, one <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/23/6345">review</a> of fifty academic studies found estimates for embodied emissions to fabricate a <i>single</i> EV battery ranged from a low of about eight tons to as high as 20 tons of CO2. Another recent technical <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11027-019-09869-2.pdf">analysis</a> put the range at about four to 14 tons. The high end of those ranges is nearly as much CO2 as is produced by the lifetime of fuel burned by an efficient conventional car. Again, that’s before the EV is delivered to a customer and driven its first mile.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The uncertainties come from inherent—and likely unresolvable—variabilities in both the quantity and type of energy used in the battery fuel cycle with factors that depend on geography and process choices, many often proprietary. <a href="https://kundoc.com/pdf-the-environmental-impact-of-li-ion-batteries-and-the-role-of-key-parameters-a-re.html">Analyses</a> of the embodied energy <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261917305433">show</a> a range from two to six <i>barrels</i> of oil (in energy-equivalent terms) is <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/2/48">used</a> to fabricate a battery that can store the energy-equivalent of one <i>gallon</i> of gasoline. Thus, any calculation of embodied emissions for an EV battery is an <i>estimate</i> based on myriad <i>assumptions. </i>The fact is, no one can measure today’s or predict tomorrow’s EV carbon dioxide &#8216;mileage.&#8217;</p>
<p>As more dollars flood into government programs and climate-tech funds — 2021 is on track to blow past <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-new-era-for-climate-focused-venture-capital">record</a> 2020 climate-tech investments, with three firms alone, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/blackrock-raises-4-8-billion-to-invest-in-renewable-power?sref=lHqvUqWg">BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/general-atlantic-launches-climate-venture-eyes-4b-fund">General Atlantic</a> and TPG, <i>each</i> announcing new $4 to $5 billion cleantech funds — we’re overdue for paying serious attention to embodied emissions of EVs and other presumed technological panaceas for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. As we will see shortly, the attention may not reveal the expected outcomes.</p>
<h2><b>Data (on) mining</b></h2>
<p>The goal for any vehicle is to have the fuel system take as small a share of total weight as possible, leaving room for passengers or cargo. Lithium batteries, as revolutionary and Nobel-prize worthy as they are, still constitute a distant second place in the metric of merit for powering untethered machines: energy density.</p>
<p>The inherent energy density of lithium-class chemicals (i.e., not a battery cell, but the raw chemical) can be theoretically as high as about 700 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg). While that’s roughly five-fold greater than the energetics of lead-acid battery chemistry, it’s still a small fraction of the 12,000 Wh/kg available in petroleum.</p>
<p>To achieve the same driving range as 60 pounds of gasoline, an EV battery weighs about 1,000 pounds. Not much of that gap is closed by the lower weight of an electric versus gasoline motor because the former is typically only about 200 pounds lighter than the latter.</p>
<p>Manufacturers offset some of a battery’s weight penalty by lightening the rest of the EV using more aluminum or carbon-fiber instead of steel. Unfortunately, those materials are respectively 300% and 600% more energy intensive per pound to produce than steel. Using a half ton of aluminum, common in many EVs, <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/development-transportation/2017-08-31/aluminum-production-leaves-a-big-carbon-footprint-so-alcoa-is-adapting-with-sustainable-products">adds</a> six tons of CO2 to the non-battery embodied emissions (a factor most analyses <a href="https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/Global-LCA-passenger-cars-jul2021_0.pdf">ignore</a>.) But it’s with all the other elements, the ones needed to fabricate the battery itself, where the emissions accounting gets messy.</p>

<p>There are many combinations of elements possible for lithium battery chemistries. Choices are dictated by compromises to meet a battery’s mix of performance metrics: safety, density, charge rate, lifespan, etc. Depending on the specific formulation chosen, the embodied energy associated with the key battery chemicals themselves can <a href="https://atoc.colorado.edu/~whan/ATOC4800_5000/Spring_2019/Materials/Paula.pdf">vary</a> by as much as 600%.</p>
<p>Consider the key elements in the widely used nickel-cobalt formulation. A typical 1,000-pound EV battery contains about 30 pounds of lithium, 60 pounds of cobalt, 130 pounds of nickel, 190 pounds of graphite, and 90 pounds of copper.<b> </b>(The balance of the weight is with steel, aluminum, and plastic.)</p>
<p>Uncertainties in the embodied energy begin with the ore grade, or share of rock that contains each target mineral. Ore grades can range from a few percent to as little as 0.1 percent depending on the mineral, the mine, and over time. Using today’s <a href="https://www.manhattan-institute.org/mines-minerals-and-green-energy-reality-check">averages</a>, the quantity of ore mined—necessarily using energy-intensive heavy equipment—for one <i>single</i> EV battery is about: 10 <i>tons</i> of lithium brines to get to the 30 pounds of lithium; 30 tons of ore to get 60 pounds of cobalt; 5 tons for the 130 pounds of nickel; 6 tons for the 90 pounds of copper; and about one ton of ore for the 190 pounds of graphite.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192450" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192450" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2192450" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1167635790.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1167635790.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1167635790.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1167635790.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1167635790.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1167635790.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1167635790.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1167635790.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1167635790.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192450" class="wp-caption-text">Aerial view of trucks loading brine from the evaporation pools of the new state-owned lithium extraction complex, in the southern zone of the Uyuni Salt Flat, Bolivia, on July 10, 2019.

<p>Then, one must add to that tonnage the “over-burden,” the amount of earth that’s first removed in order to access the mineral-bearing ore. That quantity also varies widely, depending on ore type and geology, typically from about three to seven tons excavated to access one ton of ore. Putting all the factors together, fabricating a <i>single</i> half-ton EV battery can entail digging up and moving a total of about 250 tons of earth. After that, an aggregate total of roughly 50 tons of ore are transported and processed to separate out the targeted minerals.</p>
<p>Embodied energy is also impacted by a mine’s location, something that is in theory knowable today but is a guessing-game regarding the future. Remote mining sites typically involve more trucking and depend on more off-grid electricity, the latter commonly supplied by diesel generators. As it stands today, the mineral sector alone accounts for nearly <a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1528681/">40%</a> of global industrial energy use. And over one-half of the world’s batteries or the key battery chemicals are produced in Asia with its coal-dominated electric grids. Despite hopes for more factories in Europe and North America, every forecast sees <a href="https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/global-lithium-ion-cell-manufacturing-capacity-to-quadruple-to-1.3-twh-by-2030/">Asia</a> utterly dominating that supply chain for a long time.</p>
<h2><b>The wide variability of power grids and batteries</b></h2>
<p>Most analyses of EV emissions don’t ignore the embodied carbon debt in batteries. But that factor is typically, and simplistically, assigned a single value in order to calculate the variabilities arising from using EVs on different electric grids.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://theicct.org/publications/EV-battery-manufacturing-emissions">analysis </a>from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) is usefully illustrative. The ICCT, using a fixed carbon debt for a battery, focused on how the EV carbon footprint varies depending on where it’s driven in Europe. The calculations showed that, compared to a fuel-efficient conventional car, an EV’s lifecycle emissions can range from as much as 60% lower when driven in Norway or France, to about 25% lower when driven in the U.K., to tiny emissions reduction if driven in Germany. (Germany’s grid has roughly the same average carbon emissions per kilowatt-hour as does America’s.)</p>
<p>Their analysis used <i>average</i> grid emissions data that don’t necessarily represent emissions that occur when plugged in. But the specific time, not the average, determines the <i>actual</i> source of electricity used for &#8216;fueling.&#8217; No such ambiguities attend to the location and time of gasoline use; it’s always the same anytime and anywhere on the planet. While the EV time factor has minimal variability in Norway and France where most electricity comes around the clock from hydro and nuclear respectively, it can vary wildly elsewhere from, say, 100% solar to 100% coal depending on the time of day, month and location.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192451" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192451" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2192451" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg 5363w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192451" class="wp-caption-text">The lignite-fired power station of Boxberg in Germany.

<p>Another recent ICCT <a href="https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/Global-LCA-passenger-cars-jul2021_0.pdf">analysis</a> also used annualized grid averages and calculated that, compared to an average car, lifecycle emissions reductions range from about 25% for EVs in India to 70% in Europe. But, as with the similar exercise for intra-European comparisons, a single, fixed carbon debt for battery fabrication was <i>assumed</i>, and a low value at that.</p>
<p>There is good reason to consider the implications of the range of embodied battery emissions, rather than a single, low average value, because the IEA (amongst others) reports that <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions">most</a> mineral production today entails processes at the higher end of emissions “intensity.” Adjusting the ICCT outcomes for that reality lowers the calculated lifecycle EV emissions savings to about 40% (instead of 60%) driving in Norway, to little or no reduction in the U.K. or the Netherlands, and about a 20% <i>increase</i> for EVs driven in Germany.</p>
<p>That’s not the end of the real-world uncertainties. The ICCT, again typical of many similar <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11027-019-09869-2.pdf">analyses</a>, made calculations based on batteries 30% to 60% smaller than the size required to replicate the 300-mile range needed for widespread replacement of conventional cars. The larger batteries are common on high-end EVs today. Doubling the size of the battery leads to a straightforward doubling of its carbon debt which, in turn, dramatically erodes or eliminates lifecycle emissions savings in many, maybe most places.</p>
<p>Similarly problematic, one finds forecasts of future emissions savings often <a href="https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/Global-LCA-passenger-cars-jul2021_0.pdf">explicitly</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11027-019-09869-2.pdf">assume</a> that the future battery supply chain will be <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/2/48">located</a> in the country where the EVs operate. One widely cited <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/2/48">analysis</a> assumed aluminum demand for U.S. EVs would be met by domestic smelters and powered mainly from hydro dams. While that may be theoretically possible, it doesn’t reflect reality. The United States, for example, produces just <a href="https://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/">6%</a> of global aluminum. If one assumes instead the industrial processes are located in Asia, the calculated lifecycle emissions are <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11027-019-09869-2.pdf">150%</a> higher.</p>
<p>For EV carbon accounting, the problem is that there are no reporting mechanisms or standards even remotely equivalent to the transparency with which petroleum is obtained, refined, and consumed. The challenges in having accurate data are not lost on the <a href="https://www.ivl.se/download/18.14d7b12e16e3c5c36271070/1574923989017/C444.pdf">researchers</a>, even if those concerns don’t percolate up into executive summaries and media claims. In the technical literature one often finds cautionary statements <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/ab5e1e%23fnref-ercab5e1ebib8">such</a> as a “greater understanding of the energy required to manufacture Li-ion battery cells is crucial for properly assessing the environmental implications of a rapidly increasing use of Li-ion batteries.” Or in another recent research <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/2/48">paper</a>: “Unfortunately, industry data for the rest of the battery materials remain meager to nonexistent, forcing LCA [lifecycle analysis] researchers to resort to engineering calculations or approximations to fill the data gaps.”</p>
<p>Those “data gaps” become chasms when it comes to expanding the world’s mineral supply chain to support the production of tens of millions of more EVs.</p>
<h2><b>Turning up the volume</b></h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important wildcard is the expected rise in energy costs associated with obtaining the necessary quantities of “energy transition minerals,” (ETMs) as the International Energy Agency (IEA) terms them.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the agency issued a major <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions">report</a> on the challenges of supplying ETMs to build batteries as well as solar and wind machines. The report reinforces what <a href="https://www.manhattan-institute.org/mines-minerals-and-green-energy-reality-check">others</a> have earlier pointed out. Compared to conventional cars, EVs require using, overall, about 500% more critical minerals per vehicle. Thus, the IEA concludes that current plans for EVs, along with plans for wind and solar, will require a 300% to 4,000% increase in global mine output for the necessary suite of key minerals.</p>
<p>The fact that an EV uses, for example, about 300 to 400% more copper than a conventional car has yet to impact global supply chain because EVs still account for less than 1% of the total global auto fleet. Producing EVs at scale, along with plans for grid batteries as well as for wind and solar machines, will push the “clean energy” sector up to consuming over half of all global copper (from today’s 20% level). For nickel and cobalt, to note two other relevant minerals, “transition” aspirations will <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions">push</a> clean energy use of those two metals to 60% and 70%, respectively of global demand, up from a negligible share today.</p>

<p>To illustrate the ultimate scale of demand that EV mandates alone will place on mining, consider that a world with 500 million electric cars—which would still constitute under half of all vehicles—would require mining a quantity of energy minerals sufficient to build batteries for about 3 trillion smartphones. That’s equal to over 2,000 <i>years</i> of mining and production for the latter. For the record, that many EVs would eliminate only about 15% of world oil use.</p>
<p>Set aside the environmental, economic, and geopolitical implications of such a staggering expansion of global mining. The <a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/207371500386458722/the-growing-role-of-minerals-and-metals-for-a-low-carbon-future">World Bank</a> cautions about “a new suite of challenges for the sustainable development of minerals and resources.” Such an increase in mining has direct relevance for predictions about the future carbon intensity for minerals because acquiring raw materials already accounts for nearly <a href="https://www.ivl.se/download/18.14d7b12e16e3c5c36271070/1574923989017/C444.pdf">one half</a> of the life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions for EVs.</p>
<p>As the IEA report also observes, ETMs not only have a “high emissions intensity,” but trends show that the energy-use-per-pound mined has been rising because of long-standing declines in ore grades. If mineral demands accelerate, miners will necessarily chase ever lower grade ores, and increasingly in more remote locations. The IEA sees, for example, a 300% to 600% <i>increase</i> in emissions to produce each pound of lithium and nickel respectively.</p>

<p>Trends with copper are illustrative of the challenge. From 1930 to 1970, advances in the post-mining chemical processes led to a 30% drop in energy use to produce a ton of copper even though ore grades slowly declined. But those were one-time gains as optimized processes approached physics limits. Thus, during the four decades after 1970, as ore grade continued to decline, energy use per ton of copper <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/9/4/44/pdf">increased</a>, and returned to the same level as in 1930. That will be the pattern for the near future as ore grades continue to decline for other minerals.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the IEA, like others, uses <i>today’s</i> putative <i>average </i>supply-chain<i> </i>emissions intensity to assert that EVs in the future will reduce emissions. But the data in the IEA’s own report point to rising embodied emissions for ETMs. Add to this the implications of far more solar and wind construction, which the IEA notes require 500% to 700% more minerals compared to building a natural gas power plant, and we’ll see even more pressure on the mining supply chain — which, in the commodity world, points to a dramatic rise in prices.</p>
<p>If the EV share of vehicles rises from today’s less than 1% and begins to approach a 10% share, the resource experts at <a href="https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/can-metals-supply-keep-up-with-electric-vehicle-demand/">Wood Mackenzie</a> see untenable material demands: “Unless battery technology can be developed, tested, commercialised, manufactured and integrated into EVs and their supply chains faster than ever before, it will be impossible for many EV targets and ICE (internal combustion engine) bans to be achieved – posing issues for current EV adoption rate projections.”</p>
<p>There’s no evidence of capabilities to accelerate industry-class chemical development and manufacturing, or mining, in the short time-periods common in policy aspirations. Nearly three decades passed after the discovery of lithium battery chemistry before the first Tesla sedan.</p>
<h2><b>Chasing carbon efficiencies in the battery supply chains</b></h2>
<p>There are, of course, ways to ameliorate some of the factors that are dragging the world toward a future with increasing EV supply-chain emissions: better battery chemistry (reducing materials needed per kilowatt-hour of stored energy), more efficient chemical processes, electrifying mining equipment, and recycling. All of these are often offered as “inevitable” or “necessary” solutions. But none can have a significant impact in the time frames contemplated for rapid EV expansion.</p>
<p>Even though popular news stories frequently claim some “breakthrough,” there are no commercially viable alternative battery chemistries that significantly change the order-of-magnitude of the physical materials needed per electric-vehicle-mile. In most cases, changing chemistry formulations merely shifts burdens.</p>
<p>For example, reducing the use of cobalt is generally achieved by increasing nickel content. As for chemistries that eliminate the use of energetic atoms of, say, carbon or nickel, using instead, for example, more prosaic and low-energy-intensity elements like iron (e.g., the lithium-iron-phosphate battery), such formulations have lower energy density. The latter means a bigger, heavier battery is needed to maintain vehicle range. Still, it is reasonable to imagine the eventual discovery of a foundationally superior classes of battery chemistries. But once validated, it then takes many years to safely scale-up industrial chemical systems. Batteries put into cars today, and for the near future, will necessarily use technologies available now and not theoretically available someday.</p>

<p>Then there’s the prospect for improving the efficiency of the various chemical processes used in the mineral refining and conversion processes. Improvements there are inevitable, in no small part because that’s what engineers always do, and in the digital era they will more often find success. But there are no known “step function” changes on the horizon in the well-trod field of physical chemistry where <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575569/">processes</a> already operate near physics limits. Put differently, lithium batteries are now well past the early stages where one sees rapid improvements in process (and cost) efficiencies and have entered the stage of incremental gains.</p>
<p>As for electrifying mining trucks and equipment, Caterpillar, Deere and Case (and others) all have such projects, and even a few production machines for sale. Promising designs are on the horizon for a few specific applications, but batteries are not up to the 24&#215;7 performance demands to power heavy equipment in most uses. Moreover, the turnover rate in mining and industrial equipment is measured in decades. Mines will use a lot of oil-fired equipment for a very long time.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s recycling, commonly proposed to mitigate new demands. Even if all batteries were entirely recycled, it couldn’t come close to meeting the enormous increase in demand that will arise from the proposed (or mandated) growth path for EVs. In any case, there are unresolved technical challenges regarding the efficacy and economics of recycling critical minerals from complex machines, especially batteries. While one might imagine someday having automated recycling capabilities, nothing like that exists now. And given the variety of present and future battery designs, there’s no clear path to such capabilities in the timeframes policymakers and EV proponents have in mind.</p>

<h2><b>Legal chaos and EV emissions credits</b></h2>
<p>The unavoidable fact is that there are so many assumptions, guesses, and ambiguities that any claims of EV emissions reductions will be subject to manipulation if not fraud. Much of the necessary data may never be collectable in any normal regulatory fashion given the technical uncertainties, the variety and opacity of geographic factors, as well as the proprietary nature of many of the processes. Even so, the Securities and Exchange Commission is apparently <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-weighs-making-companies-liable-for-climate-disclosures-11627495862">considering</a> such disclosure requirements. The uncertainties in the EV ecosystem could lead to legal havoc if <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-green-disclosure-rules-give-fund-investors-clarityand-confusion-11624626770?mod=article_relatedinline">European</a> and U.S. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-green-disclosure-rules-give-fund-investors-clarityand-confusion-11624626770?mod=article_relatedinline">regulators</a> enshrine “green disclosures” in legally binding ways, or <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/socially-responsible-investing-11624288038">enforce</a> “responsible” ESG metrics regarding carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p>For policymakers eager to reduce automotive oil use, engineers have already invented an easier and more certain way to achieve that goal while awaiting revolutions in battery chemistry and mining. Commercially viable combustion engines already <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a35646974/nissan-50-percent-thermal-efficiency/">exist</a> that can cut fuel use by as much as 50%. Capturing just half that potential by providing incentives for consumers to purchase more efficient engines would be cheaper, faster—and transparently verifiable—than adding 300 million EVs to the world’s roads.</p>
