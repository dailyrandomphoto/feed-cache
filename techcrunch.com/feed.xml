										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Claroty, an industrial <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> company that helps customers protect and manage their Internet of Things (IoT) and operational technology (OT) assets, has raised $140 million in its latest, and potentially last round of funding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>With the new round of Series D funding, co-led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bessemer-venture-partners/">Bessemer Venture</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/40-north-ventures/">40 North</a>, the company has now amassed a total of $235 million. Additional strategic investors include LG and I Squared Capital&#8217;s ISQ Global InfraTech Fund, with all previous investors — Team8, Rockwell Automation, Siemens, and Schneider Electric — also participating.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Founded in 2015, the late-stage startup focuses on the industrial side of cybersecurity. Its customers include General Motors, Coca-Cola EuroPacific Partners, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pfizer/">Pfizer</a>, with Claroty helping the pharmaceutical firm to secure its COVID-19 vaccine supply chain. Claroty tells TechCrunch it has seen “significant” customer growth over the past 18 months, largely fueled by the pandemic, with 110% year-over-year net new logo growth and 100% customer retention.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It will use the newly raised funds to meet this rapidly accelerating global demand for The Claroty Platform, an end-to-end solution that provides visibility into industrial networks and combines secure remote access with continuous monitoring for threats and vulnerabilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission is to drive visibility, continuity, and resiliency in the industrial economy by delivering the most comprehensive solutions that secure all connected devices within the four walls of an industrial site, including all operational technology (OT), Internet of Things (IoT), and industrial IoT (IIoT) assets,&#8221; said Claroty CEO Yaniv Vardi.</p>
<p>To meet this growing demand, the startup is planning to expand into new regions and verticals, including transportation government-owned industries, as well as increase its global headcount. The company, which is based in New York, currently has around 240 employees.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Claroty hasn’t yet made any acquisitions, though CEO Yaniv Vardi tells TechCrunch that this could be part of the startup’s roadmap going forward.</p>
<p>“We’re waiting for the right opportunity at the right time, but it’s definitely part of the plan as part of the financial runway we just secured,&#8221; he said, adding that this latest funding round will likely be the company’s last before it explores a potential IPO.</p>
<p>“We are thinking that this is a pre-IPO funding round,” he said. “The end goal here is to be the market leader for industrial cybersecurity. One of the mascots can be going public with an IPO, but there are different options too, such as SPAC.”</p>
<p>The funding round comes amid a sharp increase in cyber targeting organizations that underpin the world&#8217;s critical infrastructure and supply chains. According to a recent survey carried out by Claroty, the majority (53%) of US industrial enterprises have seen an increase in cybersecurity threats since the start of 2020. The survey of 1,110 IT and OT security professionals also found that over half believed their organization is now more of a target for cybercriminals, with 67% having seen cybercriminals use new tactics amid the pandemic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The number of attacks, and impact of these attacks, is increasing significantly, especially in verticals like food, automotive, and critical infrastructure. Vardi said. “That creates a lot of risk assessments public companies had to do, and these risks needed to be addressed with a security solution on the industrial side.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies like Stripe and Twilio have put APIs front and center as an effective way to integrate complex functionality that may not be core to your own technology stack but a necessary part of your wider business. Today, a company that has taken that model to create an effective way to integrate email, calendars and other tools into other apps using APIs is announcing a big round of funding to expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nylas.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nylas</a>, which describes itself as a communications API platform &#8212; enabling more automation particularly in business apps by integrating productivity tools through a few lines of code &#8212; has raised $120 million in funding, money that it will be using to continue expanding the kinds of APIs that it offers, with a focus in particular not just on productivity apps, but AI and related tools to bring in more automation into workflows.</p>
<p>Nylas is not disclosing its valuation, but this is a very significant step up for the company comes at a time when it is seeing strong traction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is more than double what Nylas had raised up to now ($55 million since being founded in 2015), and when it last raised &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/22/nylas-scores-16m-series-b-to-expand-email-api-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$16 million Series B</a> in 2018 &#8212; it said it had &#8220;thousands of developers&#8221; among its users. Now, that number has ballooned to 40,000, with Nylas processing some 1.2 billion API requests each day, working out to 20 terabytes of data, daily. It also said that revenue growth tripled in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>The Series C is bringing a number of interesting names to Nylas&#8217;s cap table. New investor Tiger Global Management is leading the round, with previous backers Citi Ventures, Slack Fund, 8VC and Round13 Capital also participating. Other new backers in this round include Owl Rock Capital, a division of Blue Owl (which itself is a division of insurance giant State Farm); Stripe co-founders Patrick Collison and John Collison; Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski; and Tony Fadell.</p>
<p>As with other companies in the so-called API economy, the gap and opportunity that Nylas has identified is that there are a lot of productivity tools that largely exist in their own silos &#8212; meaning when a person wants to use them when working in an application, they have to open a separate application to do so. At the same time, building new, say, tools, or building a bridge to integrate an existing application, can be time-consuming and complex.</p>
<p>Nylas first identified this issue with email. An integration to make it easier to use email and the data housed in it &#8212; which works with emails from major providers like Microsoft and Google, as well as other services built with the IMAP protocol &#8212; in other apps picked up a lot of followers, leading the company to expand into other areas that today include scheduling and calendaring, a neural API to build in tools like sentiment analysis or productivity or workflow automation; and security integrations to streamline the Google OAuth security review process (used for example in an app geared at developers).</p>
<p>“The fundamental shift towards digital communications and connectivity has resulted in companies across all industries increasingly leaning on developers to solve critical business challenges and build unique and engaging products and experiences. As a result, APIs have become core to modern software development and digital transformation,” Gleb Polyakov, co-founder and CEO of Nylas, said in statement.</p>
<p>“Through our suite of powerful APIs, we’re arming developers with the tools and applications needed to meet customer and market needs faster, create competitive differentiation through powerful and customized user experiences, and generate operational ROI through more productive and intelligently automated processes and development cycles. We’re thrilled to continue advancing our mission to make the world more productive and are honored to have the backing of distinguished investors and entrepreneurs.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the rise of Nylas and the function it fulfills is part of a bigger shift we&#8217;ve seen in businesses overall: as organizations become more digitized and use more cloud-based apps to get work done, developers have emerged as key mechanics to help that machine run. A bigger emphasis on APIs to integrate services together is part of their much-used toolkit, one of the defining reasons for investors backing Nylas today.</p>
<p>“Companies are rapidly adopting APIs as a way to automate productivity and find new and innovative ways to support modern work and collaboration,” said John Curtius, a partner at Tiger, in a statement. “This trend has become critical to creating frictionless and meaningful data-driven communications that power digital transformation. We believe Nylas is uniquely positioned to lead the future of the API economy.” Curtius is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Valencia-based startup <a href="https://internxt.com">Internxt</a> has been quietly working on an ambitious plan to make decentralized cloud storage massively accessible to anyone with an Internet connection.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just bagged $1M in seed funding led by Angels Capital, a European VC fund owned by Juan Roig (aka Spain&#8217;s richest grocer and second wealthiest billionaire), and Miami-based The Venture City. It had previously raised around half a million dollars via a token sale to help fund early development.</p>
<p>The seed funds will be put towards its next phase of growth &#8212; its month-to-month growth rate is 30% and it tells us it&#8217;s confident it can at least sustain that &#8212; including planning a big boost to headcount so it can accelerate product development.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Spanish startup <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has spent most of its short life to date developing a decentralized infrastructure that it argues is both inherently more secure and more private than mainstream cloud-based apps (such as those offered by tech giants like Google).</span></p>
<p>This is because files are not only encrypted in a way that means it cannot access your data but information is also stored in a highly decentralized way, split into tiny shards which are then distributed across multiple storage locations, with users of the network contributing storage space (and being recompensed for providing that capacity with &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; crypto).</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a distributed architecture, we&#8217;ve got servers all over the world,&#8221; explains founder and CEO Fran Villalba Segarra. &#8220;We leverage and use the space provided by professionals and individuals. So they connect to our infrastructure and start hosting data shards and we pay them for the data they host &#8212; which is also more affordable because we are not going through the traditional route of just renting out a data center and paying them for a fixed amount of space.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like the Airbnb model or Uber model. We&#8217;ve kind of democratized storage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Internxt clocked up three years of R&amp;D, beginning in 2017, before launching its first cloud-based apps: Drive (file storage), a year ago &#8212; and now Photos (a Google Photos rival).</p>
<p>So far it&#8217;s attracting around a million active users without paying any attention to marketing, per Villalba Segarra.</p>
<p>Internxt Mail is the next product in its pipeline &#8212; to compete with Gmail and also ProtonMail, a pro-privacy alternative to Google&#8217;s freemium webmail client (and for more on why it believes it can offer an edge there read on).</p>
<p>Internxt Send (file transfer) is another product billed as coming soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re working on a G-Suite alternative to make sure we&#8217;re at the level of Google when it comes to competing with them,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>The issue Internxt&#8217;s architecture is designed to solve is that files which are stored in just one place are vulnerable to being accessed by others. Whether that&#8217;s the storage provider itself (who may, like Google, have a privacy-hostile business model based on mining users&#8217; data); or hackers/third parties who manage to break the provider&#8217;s security &#8212; and can thus grab and/or otherwise interfere with your files.</p>
<p>Security risks when networks are compromised can include ransomeware attacks &#8212; which have been on an uptick in recent years &#8212; whereby attackers that have penetrated a network and gained access to stored files then hold the information to ransom by walling off the rightful owner&#8217;s access (typically by applying their own layer of encryption and demanding payment to unlock the data).</p>
<p>The core conviction driving Internxt&#8217;s decentralization push is that files sitting whole on a server or hard drive are sitting ducks.</p>
<p>Its answer to that problem is an alternative file storage infrastructure that combines zero access encryption and decentralization &#8212; meaning files are sharded, distributed and mirrored across multiple storage locations, making them highly resilient against storage failures or indeed hack attacks and snooping.</p>
<p>The approach ameliorates cloud service provider-based privacy concerns because Internxt itself cannot access user data.</p>
<p>To make money its business model is simple, tiered subscriptions: With (currently) one plan covering all its existing and planned services &#8212; based on how much data you need. (It is also freemium, with the first 10GB being free.)</p>
<p>Internxt is by no means the first to see key user value in rethinking core Internet architecture.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/23/maidsafe/">Scotland&#8217;s MaidSafe</a> has been trying to build an alternative decentralized Internet for well over a decade at this point &#8212; only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/12/after-a-decade-of-rd-maidsafes-decentralized-network-opens-for-alpha-testing/">starting alpha testing its alt network</a> (aka, the <a href="https://twitter.com/safenetworktech">Safe Network</a>) back in 2016, after ten years of testing. Its long term mission to reinvent the Internet continues.</p>
<p>Another (slightly less veteran) competitor in the decentralized cloud storage space is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/storj-brings-low-cost-decentralized-cloud-storage-to-the-enterprise/">Storj</a>, which is targeting enterprise users. There&#8217;s also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/filecoins-ico-opens-today-for-accredited-investors-after-raising-52m-from-advisers/">Filecoin</a> and <a href="https://sia.tech">Sia</a> &#8212; both also part of the newer wave of blockchain startups that sprung up after Bitcoin sparked entrepreneurial interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain/decentralization.</p>
<p>How, then, is what Internxt&#8217;s doing different to these rival decentralized storage plays &#8212; all of which have been at this complex coal face for longer?</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re the only European based startup that&#8217;s doing this [except for MaidSafe, although it&#8217;s UK not EU based],&#8221; says Villalba Segarra, arguing that the European Union&#8217;s legal regime around data protection and privacy lends it an advantage vs U.S. competitors. &#8220;All the others, Storj, plus Sia, Filecoin&#8230; they&#8217;re all US-based companies as far as I&#8217;m aware.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other major differentiating factor he highlights is usability &#8212; arguing that the aforementioned competitors have been &#8220;built by developers for developers&#8221;. Whereas he says Internxt&#8217;s goal is be the equivalent of &#8216;Coinbase for decentralized storage&#8217;; aka, it wants to make a very complex technology highly accessible to non-technical Internet users.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge technology but in the blockchain space we see this all the time &#8212; where there&#8217;s huge potential but it&#8217;s very hard to use,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;That&#8217;s essentially what Coinbase is also trying to do &#8212; bringing blockchain to users, making it easier to use, easier to invest in cryptocurrency etc. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to do at Internxt as well, bringing blockchain for cloud storage to the people. Making it easy to use with a very easy to use interface and so forth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only service in the distributed cloud space that&#8217;s actually usable &#8212; that&#8217;s kind of our main differentiating factor from Storj and all these other companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of infrastructure it&#8217;s actually pretty similar to that of Sia or Storj,&#8221; he goes on &#8212; further likening Internxt&#8217;s &#8216;zero access&#8217; encryption to Proton Drive&#8217;s architecture (aka, the file storage product from the makers of end-to-end encrypted email service ProtonMail) &#8212; which also relies on client side encryption to give users a robust technical guarantee that the service provider can&#8217;t snoop on your stuff. (So you don&#8217;t have to just trust the company not to violate your privacy.)</p>
<p>But while it&#8217;s also touting zero access encryption (it seems to be using off-the-shelf AES-256 encryption; it says it uses &#8220;military grade&#8221;, client-side, open source encryption that&#8217;s been audited by Spain&#8217;s S2 Grupo, a major local cybersecurity firm), Internxt takes the further step of decentralizing the encrypted bits of data too. And that means it can tout added security benefits, per Villalba Segarra.</p>
<p>&#8220;On top of that what we do is we fragment data and then distribute it around the world. So essentially what servers host are encrypted data shards &#8212; which is much more secure because if a hacker was ever to access one of these servers what they would find is encrypted data shards which are essentially useless. Not even we can access that data.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that adds a huge layer of security against hackers or third party [access] in terms of data. And then on top of that we build very nice interfaces with which the user is very used to using &#8212; pretty much similar to those of Google&#8230; and that also makes us very different from Storj and Sia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Storage space for Internxt users&#8217; files is provided by users who are incentivized to offer up their unused capacity to host data shards with micropayments of crypto for doing so. This means capacity could be coming from an individual user connecting to Internxt with just their laptop &#8212; or a datacenter company with large amounts of unused storage capacity. (And Villalba Segarra notes that it has a number of data center companies, such as OVH, are connected to its network.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have any direct contracts [for storage provision]&#8230; Anyone can connect to our network &#8212; so datacenters with available storage space, if they want to make some money on that they can connect to our network. We don&#8217;t pay them as much as we would pay them if we went to them through the traditional route,&#8221; he says, likening this portion of the approach to how Airbnb has both hosts and guests (or Uber needs drivers and riders).</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the platform that connects both parties but we don&#8217;t host any data ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Internxt uses a reputation system to manage storage providers &#8212; to ensure network uptime and quality of service &#8212; and also applies blockchain &#8216;proof of work&#8217; challenges to node operators to make sure they&#8217;re actually storing the data they claim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of the decentralized nature of our architecture we really need to make sure that it hits a certain level of reliability,&#8221; he says. &#8220;So for that we use blockchain technology&#8230; When you&#8217;re storing data in your own data center it&#8217;s easier in terms of making sure it&#8217;s reliable but when you&#8217;re storing it in a decentralized architecture it brings a lot of benefits &#8212; such as more privacy or it&#8217;s also more affordable &#8212; but the downside is you need to make sure that for example they&#8217;re actually storing data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Payments to storage capacity providers are also made via blockchain tech &#8212; which Villalba Segarra says is the only way to scale and automate so many micropayments to ~10,000 node operators all over the world.</p>
<p>Discussing the issue of energy costs &#8212; given that &#8216;proof of work&#8217; blockchain-based technologies are facing increased scrutiny over the energy consumption involved in carrying out the calculations &#8212; he suggests that Internxt&#8217;s decentralized architecture can be more energy efficient than traditional data centers because data shards are more likely to be located nearer to the requesting user &#8212; shrinking the energy required to retrieve packets vs always having to do so from a few centralized global locations.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve seen in terms of energy consumption is that we&#8217;re actually much more energy efficient than a traditional cloud storage service. Why? Think about it, we mirror files and we store them all over the world&#8230; It&#8217;s actually impossible to access a file from Dropbox that is sent out from [a specific location]. Essentially when you access Dropbox or Google Drive and you download a file they&#8217;re going to be sending it out from their data center in Texas or wherever. So there&#8217;s a huge data transfer energy consumption there &#8212; and people don&#8217;t think about it,&#8221; he argues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data center energy consumption is already 2%* of the whole world&#8217;s energy consumption if I&#8217;m not mistaken. So being able to use latency and being able to send your files from [somewhere near the user] &#8212; which is also going to be faster, which is all factored into our reputation system &#8212; so our algorithms are going to be sending you the files that are closer to you so that we save a lot of energy from that. So if you multiple that by millions of users and millions of terabytes that actually saves a lot of energy consumption and also costs for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>What about latency from the user&#8217;s point of view? Is there a noticeable lag when they try to upload or retrieve and access files stored on Internxt vs &#8212; for example &#8212; Google Drive?</p>
<p>Villalba Segarra says being able to store file fragments closer to the user also helps compensate for any lag. But he also confirms there is a bit of a speed difference vs mainstream cloud storage services.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of upload and download speed we&#8217;re pretty close to Google Drive and Dropbox,&#8221; he suggests. &#8220;Again these companies have been around for over ten years and their services are very well optimized and they&#8217;ve got a traditional cloud architecture which is also relatively simpler, easier to build and they&#8217;ve got thousands of [employees] so their services are obviously much better than our service in terms of speed and all that. But we&#8217;re getting really close to them and we&#8217;re working really fast towards bringing our speed [to that level] and also as many features as possible to our architecture and to our services.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Essentially how we see it is we&#8217;re at the level of Proton Drive or Tresorit in terms of usability,&#8221; he adds on the latency point. &#8220;And we&#8217;re getting really close to Google Drive. But an average user shouldn&#8217;t really see much of a difference and, as I said, we&#8217;re literally working as hard as possible to make our services as useable as those of Google. But we&#8217;re ages ahead of Storj, Sia, MaidSafe and so forth &#8212; that&#8217;s for sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Internxt is doing all this complex networking with a team of just 20 people currently. But with the new seed funding tucked in its back pocket the plan now is to ramp up hiring over the next few months &#8212; so that it can accelerate product development, sustain its growth and keep pushing its competitive edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the time we do a Series A we should be around 100 people at Internxt,&#8221; says Villalba Segarra. &#8220;We are already preparing our Series A. We just closed our seed round but because of how fast we&#8217;re growing we are already being reached out to by a few other lead VC funds from the US and London.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a pretty big Series A. Potentially the biggest in Spain&#8230; We plan on growing until the Series A at at least a 30% month-to-month rate which is what we&#8217;ve been growing up until now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also tells TechCrunch that the intention for the Series A is to do the funding at a $50M valuation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were planning on doing it a year from now because we literally just closed our [seed] round but because of how many VCs are reaching out to us we may actually do it by the end of this year,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;But timeframe isn&#8217;t an issue for us. What matters most is being able to reach that minimum valuation.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>*Per the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks">IEA</a>, data centres and data transmission networks each accounted for around 1% of global electricity use in 2019</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lot of information can be gleaned about a surface area just by taking the ground temperature data. If a crop field is under stress, for example, the ground temperature will be elevated long before there’s any actual indication of the stress on the plant itself, Hydrosat CEO and co-founder Pieter Fossel explained to TechCrunch. Now, with a new $5 million injection in seed funding, he hopes to launch Hydrosat’s first surface temperature analytics product for customers.</p>
<p>The seed round was led by Cultivation Capital’s newly launched Geospatial Technologies Fund with participation by Freeflow Ventures, the Yield Lab, Expon Capital, Techstars, Industrious Ventures, Synovia Capital, and the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>The geospatial data analytics startup, which started at the end of 2017, plans to gather surface temperature data using satellites equipped with thermal infrared sensors. Beyond agricultural data, surface temperature can also provide information about wildfire risk, water stress and drought – all important variables if you believe, as Fossel does, that climate change is already starting to exert forces on the planet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While ground temperature data is collected by legacy institutions like NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), it’s not gathered at a very high frequency – sometimes a specific location’s ground temperature is only read every 16 days or so – or at a high resolution. Hydrosat hopes to fill in those existing data gaps. The company also collects data on other bands, using a multispectral infrared camera, but its primary value proposition is in its thermal data.</p>
<p>The first satellite will head to low-Earth orbit with Loft Orbital on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in the second half of 2022. That mission is named after Hydrosat’s former CEO, Jakob van Zyl, who passed away from heart attack about a year ago. Although the launches add a certain flair, Fossel stressed that the company is “a content company and a data company first.”</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re also developing some applications that sit on top of that [surface temperature] product that are geared towards crop yield forecasting, drought detection, and irrigation management,” he said. “Because these are all fundamentally driven by water stress and all of those applications are fundamentally enabled by our core product, which is land surface temperature data.”</p>
<p>Hydrosat’s first customers have been governments, in the form of a contract with the ESA and three SBIR contracts with the U.S. Air Force and Department of Defense. But through the raise, the company can start to deliver its product to commercial customers, who may include agribusinesses, insurance companies, and even other companies that want to do analytics on top of its collection of ground surface data.</p>
<p>“[Hydrosat] will probably start in agriculture, which is our core focus, but it could branch out across industries, because temperature is a signal of a whole host of activities beyond our focus, which is environment, water, stress, food,” he explained. “Temperature is also a signal of economic activity. There&#8217;s a lot of cool use cases for temperature, from kind of a defense and security standpoint, as well.”</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Hydrosat has plans to launch a 16-satellite constellation to enable global monitoring. But that’s only the medium-term focus, Fossel said. The company’s long-term plans could include launching additional satellites, adding additional bands to deepen its data offerings, or building out its analytics layer. “Beyond that, it&#8217;s really about providing the underlying data that enables some of these applications in drought, food security, water stress, wildfire, and defense and security,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all heard the phrase, “Every company is a fintech.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But these days, that’s becoming more and more true as an increasing number of companies that are not even in the financial services space seek to add a fintech component to their offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of startups poised to benefit from this shift are those offering banking as a service. One such startup, </span><a href="http://www.unit.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has raised $51 million in a Series B round to further its goal of making it possible for companies and fintechs alike to build banking products “in minutes.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley-based Accel led the round for Unit, bringing the company’s total raised since its 2019 inception to nearly $70 million. Existing backers Better Tomorrow Ventures, Aleph, Flourish Ventures and TLV Partners also participated in the latest financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Unit raises $18.6M to offer banking features as a service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/unit-raises-18-6m-to-offer-banking-features-as-a-service/embed/#?secret=y06C8jjEBj" data-secret="y06C8jjEBj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders Itai Damti and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doron Somech are no strangers to growing companies. The pair previously co-founded &#8212; and bootstrapped &#8212; Leverate, a Tel Aviv-based B2B trading tech provider. Unit has dual headquarters in Tel Aviv and New York City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damti and Somech founded Unit in late 2019 and spent the first year stealthily building out the platform with the mission of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">empowering companies to embed financial services into their product, accelerating their time to market. Unit officially launched its platform in late 2020, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">over the last three months,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">it has seen deposit volume grow by more than 300% and new end users by</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">600% (albeit from a small base).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its platform, Unit touts, companies in a variety of industries &#8212; such as freelance or creator economy and personal financial management, for example &#8212; can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build financial products directly into their software. This gives them the ability to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> build and launch next-gen bank accounts, cards, payment and lending products. Customers include Wethos, Lance, Benepass, Moves and Tribevest, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our mission is to expand financial access for all and we do it by empowering the next generation of fintech builders,” Damti said. Only about 20% of its customers are what might be considered true fintechs, he said. The remaining 80% are companies that are not but rather want to embed banking as a service into their offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unit, Damti claims, takes what was once “a very expensive and complex process of 18 months” that includes finding and managing a bank relationship, building a compliance team and building a tech stack “that gets you to a competitive banking offering, and turns it into one API and one dashboard that helps companies launch accounts cards, payments and lending within five weeks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with the funding, Unit is also announcing today a new offering, Unit Go, which it says allows </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies to create live bank accounts and issue physical and virtual cards in minutes. Founders</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and developers can try it out by creating a free account, building in Unit’s live</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">environment and testing their products using real funds. Unit Go is currently in beta and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will be available to the public in the fall of 2021.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to grow its headcount of 26 and fast-track its Unit Go offering. It also wants to expand its platform into additional financial products, software development kits (SDKs) and integrations. (It’s already </span><a href="https://blog.unit.co/unit-integrates-with-plaid-exchange-to-enable-client-open-finance-connectivity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">integrated with Plaid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Unit is not the only startup in the burgeoning banking-as-a-service (BaaS) space. It competes with the likes of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/railsbank-growth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Railbank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/treasury-prime-series-b/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treasury Prime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/stripe-announces-embedded-business-banking-service-stripe-treasury/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Damti believes there are a few things that help differentiate Unit in the increasingly crowded space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, according to Damti, Unit intentionally </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“put compliance at the front and center of what we do.” As evidence of that, earlier this year, it </span><a href="https://finledger.com/2021/01/20/former-bank-regulator-joined-unit-to-operationalize-embed-compliance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tapped Amanda Swoverland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to serve as its chief compliance officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, Damti emphasizes that Unit is not a matchmaker or marketplace along the lines of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fin-vc-leads-33m-series-a-for-synctera-which-wants-to-pair-fintechs-with-banks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synctera</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are acting as a company that connects banks to the tech ecosystem and banks are critical vendors and partners to us, but we see them as a built-in element within Unit, because we believe that the most excellent experience in this ecosystem can only come from software companies,” Damti told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, he notes, Unit is technically distinct in that it is actually building a ledger, which Damti describes as “the most critical and sensitive part of the ecosystem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By owning the ledger and not delegating, he said, Unit is “able to offer a radically better experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As far as the transaction environment, the cleanliness of the data that we provide and the fees that our customers are able to control and tweak, owning that ledger piece is super critical for the experience,” Damti said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel partner </span><a href="https://www.accel.com/people/amit-kumar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amit Kumar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes that in recent years, the landscape has shifted from hundreds of fintech startups “trying to beat incumbents with slightly better products” to thousands of tech companies trying to launch fintech businesses in their verticals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Unit&#8217;s strong emphasis on managing compliance addresses the risk typically associated with offering banking services and allows customers to bring these products to market much faster than previously possible,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. “Unit is building the platform to power the next generation of fintech.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online job listings were one of the first things to catch on in the first generation of the internet. But that has, ironically, also meant that some of the most-used digital recruitment services around today are also some of the least evolved in terms of tapping into all of the developments that tech has to offer, leaving the door open for some disruption. Today, one of the startups doing just that is announcing a big round of funding to double down on its growth so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://beamery.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beamery</a>, which has built what it describes as a &#8220;talent operating system&#8221; &#8212; a way to manage sourcing, hiring and retaining of people, plus analyzing the bigger talent picture for an organization, a &#8220;talent graph&#8221; as Beamery calls it, in an all-in-one, end-to-end service &#8212; has raised $138 million, money that it plans to use to continue building out more technology, as well as growing its business, which has been expanding quickly and saw <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/beamery-announces-most-successful-q4-in-company-history-with-337-year-over-year-growth-appoints-philipp-becker-as-chief-financial-officer-301233132.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">337% revenue growth</a> year over year in Q4.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.otpp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board</a> (Ontario Teachers’), a prolific tech investor, is leading the round by way of its Teachers’ Innovation Platform (TIP). Other participants in this Series C includes several strategic backers who are also using Beamery: <a href="https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/about/company-index">Accenture Ventures,</a> <a href="https://eqtventures.com/">EQT Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.indexventures.com/">Index Ventures</a>, <a href="https://m12.vc">M12</a> (Microsoft&#8217;s venture arm) and <a href="https://ventures.workday.com">Workday Ventures</a> (the venture arm of the HR software giant).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Abakar Saidov, co-founder and CEO at London-based Beamery, told TechCrunch in an interview that it is not disclosing valuation, but sources in the know say it&#8217;s in the region of $800 million.</p>
<p>The round is coming on the heels of a very strong year for the company.</p>
<p>The &#8220;normal&#8221; way of doing things in the working world was massively upended with the rise of Covid-19 in early 2020, and within that, recruitment was among one of the most impacted areas. Not only were people applying and interviewing for jobs completely remotely, but in many cases they were getting hired, onboarded and engaged into new jobs without a single face-to-face interaction with a recruiter, manager or colleague.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s before you consider the new set of constraints that HR teams were under in many places: variously, we saw hiring freezes, furloughs, layoffs and budget cuts (often more than one of these per business), and yet work still needed to get done.</p>
<p>All that really paved the way for platforms like Beamery&#8217;s &#8212; designed not only to be remote-friendly software-as-a-service running in the cloud, but to handle the whole recruiting and talent management process from a single place &#8212; to pick up new customers and prove its role as an updated, more user-friendly approach to the task of sourcing and placing talent.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Traditional HR is very admin-heavy, and when you add in payroll and benefits, the systems that exist are very siloed,&#8221; said Saidov in the interview. &#8220;The innovation for us has been to move out of that construct and into something that is human, and has a human touch. From a data perspective, we&#8217;re creating the underlying system of record for all of the people touching a business. So when you build on top of that, everything looks like a consumer application.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the last 12 months, the company said that customers &#8212; which are in the area of large enterprises and include Covid vaccine maker AstraZeneca, Autodesk, Nasdaq, several major tech giants, and strategic investor Workday &#8212; filled 1 million roles through its platform, a figure that includes not just sourcing and placing candidates from outside of an organization&#8217;s walls, but also filling roles internally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The work that Beamery is doing is definitely helping the business not just pull its weight &#8212; its last round was a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/20/beamery-closes-28m-series-b-to-stoke-support-for-its-talent-crm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much more modest $28 million</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which was raised way back in 2018 &#8212; but grow and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/beamery-announces-platform-to-help-hr-recruit-and-retain-talent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invest in new services</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p>
<p>The company said it had a year-on-year increase of 462% in jobs posted across its customer base. A year before that (which would have extended into pre-pandemic 2019), the number of candidates pipelined increased by a mere 46%, pointing to acceleration.</p>
<p>Beamery today already offers a pretty wide range different services.</p>
<p>They include tools to source candidates. This can be done organically by creating your own job boards to be found by anyone curious enough to look, and by leveraging other job boards on other platforms like LinkedIn, the Microsoft-owned professional networking platform that counts &#8220;Talent Solutions&#8221; &#8212; ie recruitment &#8212; as one of its primary business lines. (Recall Microsoft is one of Beamery&#8217;s backers.) It also provides tools to create and manage online recruitment events.</p>
<p>Beamery also offers tools to help people get the word out about a role, with a service akin to programmatic advertising (similar to ZipRecruiter) to populate other job boards, or run more targeted executive recruitment searches. It also provides a way for HR teams to create internal recruitment processes, and also run surveys with existing teams to get a better picture of the state of play.</p>
<p>And it has some analytics tools in place to measure how well recruitment drives, retention and other metrics are evolving to help plan what to do in the future.</p>
<p>The big question for me now is how and if Beamery will bring more into that universe. There have been some interesting startups emerging in the wider world of talent IT (if we could call it that) that could be interesting complements to what Beamery already has, or provide a roadmap for what it might try to build itself.</p>
<p>It includes much more extensive work on internal job boards (such as what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gloat-raises-57m-to-reinvent-the-internal-job-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gloat</a> has built); digging much deeper into building accurate pictures of who is at the company and what they do (see: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/charthop-raises-35m-for-its-internal-org-chart-and-people-analytics-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChartHop</a>); or the many services that are building ways of sourcing and connecting with contractors, which are a huge, and growing, part of the talent equation for companies (see: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/turing-nabs-32m-more-for-an-ai-based-platform-to-source-and-manage-engineers-remotely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing</a>,  <a href="http://remote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote</a>, <a href="http://letsdeel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deel</a>, <a href="http://papayaglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Papaya Global</a>, <a href="http://lattice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lattice</a>, <a href="http://factorialhr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Factorial</a>, and many others).</p>
<p>Beamery already includes contractors alongside full- and part-time roles that can be filled using its platform, but when it comes to managing those contractors, that&#8217;s something that Beamery does not do itself, so that could be one area where it might grow, too.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;The key reason enterprises work with us it to consolidate a bunch of workflows,&#8221; Saidov said. &#8220;HR hates having different systems and everything becomes easier when things interoperate well.&#8221; Employing contractors typically involves three elements: sourcing, management and scheduling, so Beamery will likely approach how it grows in that area by determining which piece might be &#8220;super core&#8221; the centralization of more data, he added.</p>
<p class="p1">Another two likely areas he hinted are on Beamery&#8217;s roadmap are assessments &#8212; that is, providing tools to recruiters who want to measure the skills of applicants for jobs (another startup-heavy area today) &#8212; and tools to help recruiters do their jobs better, whether that involves more native communications tools in video and messaging, as well as Gong-like coaching to help them measure and improve screening and interviewing.</p>
<p>It might also consider developing a version for smaller businesses to use.</p>
<p>Questions investors are happy to see considered, it seems, as they invest in what looks like a winner in the bigger race. TIP&#8217;s other investments have included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/complyadvantage-nabs-50m-for-an-ai-platform-and-database-to-detect-and-stop-financial-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComplyAdvantage</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/fortnite-maker-epic-completes-1b-funding-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/ai-chipmaker-graphcore-raises-222m-at-a-2-77b-valuation-and-puts-an-ipo-in-its-sights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graphcore</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/kry-closes-312m-series-d-after-use-of-its-telehealth-tools-surged-100-yoy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KRY</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/spacex-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpaceX</a>, a long run in a wide field.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Leading companies worldwide are prioritising recruitment and retention. They are turning to Beamery for a best-in-class talent solution that can be seamlessly integrated with their business,&#8221; said Maggie Fanari, MD for TIP in Emea. “Beamery’s best-in-class approach is already recognized by top-tier companies. I’m excited by the company’s vision of to use technology to support long-term talent growth and build better businesses. Beamery is the first company to bring predictive marketing and data science into recruitment. They are a truly innovative company, building a vision that can shape the future of work – the company fits all the criteria we look for in a TIP investment and more.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/gilliband-law-data-agency/">revived a bill</a> that would establish a new U.S. federal agency to shield Americans from the invasive practices of tech companies operating in their own backyard.</p>
<p>Last year, Gillibrand (D-NY) <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3300/text">introduced the Data Protection Act</a>, a legislative proposal that would create an independent agency designed to address modern concerns around privacy and tech that existing government regulators have proven ill-equipped to handle.</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. needs a new approach to privacy and data protection and it’s Congress’ duty to step forward and seek answers that will give Americans meaningful protection from private companies that value profits over people,&#8221; Sen. Gillibrand said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The revamped bill, which retains its core promise of a new &#8220;Data Protection Agency,&#8221; is co-sponsored by Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown and returns to the new Democratic Senate with a few modifications.</p>
<p>In the spirit of all of the tech antitrust regulation chatter going on right now, the 2021 version of the bill would also empower the Data Protection Agency to review any major tech merger involving a data aggregator or other deals that would see the user data of 50,000 people change hands.</p>
<p>Other additions to the bill would establish an office of civil rights to &#8220;advance data justice&#8221; and allow the agency to evaluate and penalize high-risk data practices, like the use of algorithms, biometric data and harvesting data from children and other vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>Gillibrand calls the notion of updating regulation to address modern tech concerns &#8220;critical&#8221; — and she&#8217;s not alone. Democrats and Republicans seldom find common ground in 2021, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/technology/big-tech-antitrust-bills.html">a raft of new bipartisan antitrust bills</a> show that Congress has at last grasped how important it is to rein in tech&#8217;s most powerful companies lest they lose the opportunity altogether.</p>
<p>The Data Protection Act lacks the bipartisan sponsorship enjoyed by the set of new House tech bills, but with interest in taking on big tech at an all-time high, it could attract more support. Of all of the bills targeting the tech industry in the works right now, this one isn&#8217;t likely to go anywhere without more bipartisan interest, but that doesn&#8217;t mean its ideas aren&#8217;t worth considering.</p>
<p>Like some other proposals wending their way through Congress, this bill recognizes that the FTC has failed to meaningfully punish big tech companies for their bad behavior. In Gillibrand&#8217;s vision, the Data Protection Agency could rise to modern regulatory challenges where the FTC has failed. In other proposals, the FTC would be bolstered with new enforcement powers or infused with cash that could help the agency&#8217;s bite match its bark.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that modernizing the tools that federal agencies have at hand won&#8217;t be sufficient. Cutting back more than a decade of overgrowth from tech&#8217;s data giants won&#8217;t be easy, particularly because the stockpile of Americans&#8217; data that made those companies so wealthy is already out in the wild.</p>
<p>A new agency dedicated to wresting control of that data from powerful tech companies could bridge the gap between Europe&#8217;s own robust data protections and the absence of federal regulation we&#8217;ve seen in the U.S. But until something does, Silicon Valley&#8217;s data hoarders will eagerly fill the power vacuum themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While much of the eVTOL industry has its sights set on urban air taxis or cargo transportation, entrepreneur Matthew Pearson had another idea: electric flying race cars. So in 2019, he founded two companies, Alauda Aeronautics to manufacture the aircraft and Airspeeder, an international series to race them. Now, Airspeeder says it has completed the first test flights of the debut electric flying race car and is poised to host the inaugural race of its EXA series this year.</p>
<p>That flying race car, the electric Alauda Mk3, had its test flights in south Australia. They were observed by Australia’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority, who certified the aircraft. Pearson’s vision – and what you can see by watching some of Airspeeder’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq6JDIL12Xg&amp;ab_channel=Airspeeder">cinematic trailers</a> – is a race somewhat reminiscent of Star Wars’ iconic podracing, without a human or creature in the pilot seat.</p>
<p>The first three races, which are set to take place in 2021, will all feature remotely piloted aircraft. The company is planning for a crewed showcase as early as 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The unpiloted Mk3, which can reach top speeds of 124 miles per hour (200 km/h), weighs just 286 pounds (130 kg). It can accelerate from 0 to 62 mph in 2.8 seconds, the company said, likening it to the Tesla Model S or the Porsche Taycan. In fidelity to Formula One and NASCAR, the Mk3 has a removable battery for quick replacement during pitstops. In-house pitstop crews have been able to replace the battery, which was designed by Alauda, in just under 20 seconds. The Mk3 is able to fly 10 to 15 minutes on a single battery pack, so during a 45-minute race, pilots on the ground will remotely navigate the aircraft to land for a pitstop about three times.</p>
<p>Mk3 is equipped with a combination of LiDAR, radar and machine vision that Pearson said creates a collision avoidance system. The company did not specify to TechCrunch the number of sensors that are on each craft and declined to provide further details on the system, citing proprietary information. The challenge of designing a safety system for a flying race car, however, is allowing enough flexibility so that the aircraft can get as close together as possible, without actually hitting each other. This is a problem for the pilots who will be competing against each other, but also Airspeeder’s system.</p>
<p>Pearson explained it like this: “The vehicles are talking to each other, they know where the others are and they&#8217;re all solving the collision avoidance problem in the same way using the same algorithm. So they know they can predict each other&#8217;s behavior. There&#8217;s that as the kind of framework for collision avoidance, but inside that, we want to give the pilots as much freedom and as much control as possible. So dialing up where the barrier is between pilot and machine is going to be a really interesting thing.”</p>

<p>While it’s tempting to draw comparisons to major eVTOL companies that are developing air taxi services, Pearson said the economics and path to commercialization for electric flying race cars is different. “The commercialization model is a lot more rapid,” he said. “We can be racing before anyone can be in commercial operations.”</p>
<p>One reason why they can be so agile is because its certification pathway is very different from that required by air taxis designed to shuttle people. Those startups can spend many hundreds of millions of dollars – up to $1 billion, by some estimates – on the design, certification, and manufacture of a single aircraft model. The Mk3 is flying under an experimental certification with Australia’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority that means that while it must meet certain safety and airworthiness standards, the regulatory burden is far less than for a passenger aircraft.</p>
<p>“The important thing about our program is to keep the vehicles in constant development cycles. So instead of trying to build one vehicle, and then certify it over 10 years, we&#8217;re trying to build new aircraft every year,” he explained. “It’s not how aviation really functions normally. And certainly, if you want to get into passenger applications, that&#8217;s not how you do it.”</p>
<p>Airspeeder had its first funding round in April 2020 for an unspecified amount, which was led by Australian investors Saltwater Capital and Jelix Ventures. Pearson said he’d also provide capital, and they’ve managed to attract partnerships from logistics company BHL and luxury watch maker IWC Schaffhausen. The company declined to provide further specifics on how it’s managed to fund a small-scale aeronautics manufacturing operation from the ground up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there has been a wave of innovation in food tech worldwide, it&#8217;s still in early days for Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are only a handful of African food-tech startups, and a year and a half&#8217;s worth of global pandemic has added a couple to that list</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://kune.africa/">Kune</a> is one of the most recent food-tech startups, and today, the six-month-old Kenyan-based company is announcing that it has closed a $1 million pre-seed round to launch its on-demand food service in August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African venture capital firm <a href="https://www.launchafrica.vc/">Launch Africa Ventures</a> led the pre-seed round. Other investors that took part include Century Oak Capital GmbH and Consonance, with a contribution from ecosystem management firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-pariti-is-connecting-founders-with-capital-resources-and-talent-in-emerging-markets/">Pariti</a>. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by CEO Robin Reecht in December 2020, Kune delivers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">freshly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made, ready-to-eat meals at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arguably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affordable prices. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Reetch first came to Kenya from France in November 2020, it wasn&#8217;t easy to get affordable ready-to-eat meals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After three days of coming into Kenya, I asked where I can get great food at a cheap price, and everybody tell me it&#8217;s impossible,&#8221; he told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;It&#8217;s impossible because either you go to the street and you eat street food, which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cheap but with not-so-good quality, or you order on Uber Eats, Glovo or Jumia, where you get quality but you have to pay at least $10.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reetch noticed a gap in the market and sought to fill it. The next month, he decided to start Kune. The goal? To provide affordable, convenient and tasty meals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took a week to develop a pilot, and with a ready waitlist of 50 customers in a particular office space, his plans were in motion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Kune sold more than 500 meals ($4 average) and tripled its customer base from 50 to 150. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers were particularly excited about the product and Kune raised $50,000 from them to continue operations, Reetch said. After that, however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the orders became too large for the small team that they couldn&#8217;t keep up; at one point, it received 50 orders per day. Thus, instead of advancing with a momentum that could break down, the team took a hiatus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We had started to mess up the order because, you know, it&#8217;s complicated to get food right when you&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a small kitchen setting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So I said okay, that there is no point doing that, and the demand is so high and better to do things right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next months </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were spent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> restructuring the company, making hires and building a factory to produce 5,000 meals per day</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then, when</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company was ready to raise, Reetch said he saw the same enthusiasm from customers and investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In two months, Kune closed this round, one of the largest in East Africa, and is one of the few non-fintechs to have raised a seven-figure pre-seed round on the continent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a fast-growing and crowded restaurant and food delivery marketplace in Kenya, Kune wants to offer a new way for busy people in Nairobi to access meals by finding a balance between Kibanda pricing (usually referred to as the typical local roadside food shop) and on-demand food delivery prices from global companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kune applies a hybrid model, combining both cloud and dark kitchen concepts. Kune meals </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are cooked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and packaged in its factory and delivered </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to online, retail and corporate customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hybrid model speaks to why Launch Africa cut a check for Kune. And according to the director of the firm, Baljinder Sharma</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;leveraging the cloud kitchen model and owning the entire supply chain provides a massive growth and scaling opportunity for Kune Africa.&#8221; He added: &#8220;We are looking forward to seeing the business take off and grow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kune plans to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launch in August after its new factory </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is completed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per details on its site, the company is promising customers that delivery will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on an average of 30 minutes daily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve this, Kune ensures that it owns the entire supply chain, from cooking to packaging to delivery with its own drivers and motorbikes. &#8220;Our strategy is to internalize all production and human resources capacities,&#8221; he stated. That&#8217;s where Kune will put most of the funds </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to use going forward. In addition to the factory, which costs about 10% of the total investment, Kune will be looking to build a huge team. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reetch tells me that judging by how operations-heavy Kune is, the team size will reach 100 come December</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2167241" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-154.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="276" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-154.png 1346w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-154.png?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-154.png?resize=300,122 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-154.png?resize=768,312 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-154.png?resize=680,276 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-154.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once launched, the company will build its own fleet of 100 electric motorcycles by early 2022. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are plans to hire 100 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">female drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Kune showcases three different meals daily: two continental dishes and one foreign meal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the coming months and quarters, Kune&#8217;s offerings will cut across microwavable meals, weight reduction meals and retail meals to target European and U.S. clients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the latter, Reetch is enthusiastic about exporting the African food culture to Western countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As someone who travels a lot, the CEO thinks Kenya, unlike other countries, doesn&#8217;t have a strong food culture. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He references food media like TV shows where various meals and cuisines and tutorings on how to cook food are showcased</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Reetch wants Kune to be the go-to for such programs in Kenya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Kenya, we don&#8217;t have any culinary show. So we are going to take that position as the culinary major of Kenya, and how do you create this? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By creating amazing content, which we plan to do by creating videos and writing articles on how to cook or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">maybe</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> food business in general</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When WeWork appeared, other entrepreneurs looked at the model and thought that if you could apple co-working to property, then why not apply co-living. Thus, in the US, <a href="https://www.common.com/">Common</a> appeared, as did Hmlet in Asia. Imn the EU, <a href="https://www.habyt.com/">Habyt</a> launched, but has already gobbled-up its competitors Quarters, Goliving, and Erasmo’s Room.</p>
<p>It’s now closed a series B round of €20M / $24M, and merged with another competitor, Homefully, founded by Sebastian Wuerz in 2016. The round was backed by HV Capital (formerly Holtzbrink Ventures), Vorwerk Ventures, P101 and Picus Capital.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 by Luca Bovone, Habyt will now have over 5,000 units across 15 cities and 6 countries. The merged companies will offer fully furnished and serviced living units, coupled with a tech-enabled user-experience and a focus on community, aimed at young professionals between 20 and 35 years old who move jobs and cities fairly frequently.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Luca Bovone, Founder and CEO of Habyt, said: “We have been on an incredible journey in the past year and a half. In spite of less than perfect market conditions we have been able to grow a lot via a very successful M&amp;A strategy that brought us into the position of leaders of our sector in Europe and that still has a lot of potential. This 20M series B round really opens our doors to keep building Habyt both via organic growth and via more M&amp;As. We are now looking at strategic targets in Europe, specifically in France and Italy, and also in other continents, especially in Asia.”</p>
<p>Sebastian Wuerz, Founder of homefully, said: “The coliving market is going through a consolidation phase and Habyt has really seized this opportunity quickly and effectively and is on the best track to become the leader of the sector at a global scale. Joining forces is a crucial step in this direction and I am very excited for the team to be part of this journey.”</p>
<p>Felix Kluehr, Partner at HV said: &#8220;We are happy to see that Habyt has emerged as the leading player in the European co-living market and HV is excited to support the team in their ambitious plan to build the leading European coliving company”.</p>
<p>Over an interview, Bovone told me: “It&#8217;s like a member&#8217;s club. We have a subscription model, where people pay a monthly fee, which is your rent, and then you can, of course, apply for a room somewhere else and know that we have a fairly decent scale across Europe and eventually, also in southern Europe. You are able to move from one place to the other. Our motto is live anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that the pandemic had meant that people were ditching co-working spaces and “They would prefer to spend 50 to 100 euro more per month on getting better housing where they can work comfortably from home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are already seeing within our customer base, they want to stay six months in Berlin, three months in Madrid, then move back to Berlin and so on. The traditional housing market just doesn&#8217;t allow that to happen. You have contracts with utilities and so on, which you can never break and it&#8217;s just an outdated product offering, and we&#8217;re trying to tackle that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There have been plenty of pop-ups over the years, but tomorrow Google’s first store opens in NYC&#8217;s Chelsea neighborhood. The brick and mortar model finds the company joining peers like Apple, Microsoft, Samsung and even Amazon, all of whom have a retail presence in Manhattan, including several just around the corner from Google’s new digs.</p>
<p>The new space, which opens tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. local time, fills 5,000 square feet of selling space in Google’s big, pricey West Side real estate investment. The retail location was previously occupied by a Post Office and Starbucks, which vacated the premises once their leases expired under their new corporate landlord.</p>

<p>The store’s layout is designed to be experiential, highlighting the company’s growing hardware portfolio along with select third-party partners. Essentially it’s a way for the company to get Pixel phones, Home offerings, Stadia, WearOS and the newest addition to the hardware portfolio, Fitbit devices, in front of tourists and locals.</p>
<p>“We really used the pop-ups over the last several years to get a better sense of what are customer expectations for what we can uniquely deliver at Google,” VP Jason Rosenthal said during a press preview week. We’ve taken learnings from our 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 pop-ups and really fed that learning into what we’re opening[…] in Chelsea.”</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-klCvtE_eE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Due to pandemic restrictions, the preview was virtual. And while it’s open to the public this week, the company will be maintaining the standard safety precautions, as the city deals with (knock on wood) the tail end of the pandemic.</p>
<p>And while COVID-19 almost certainly slowed the planned opening, Google promises that things will be in full force starting tomorrow. This follows several weeks of piloting, wherein the store’s 50 or so staffers were put through their paces, while the company put the finishing touches on the experience. Prior to this, Google built a full-size store mockup in a hangar space in Mountain View to test out ideas.</p>

<p>In addition to product screens and dioramas lining the 17-foot windows, the company filled the store with “sandboxes” &#8212; effectively scenarios like a living room, not dissimilar to what you might find in a large furniture store &#8212; albeit better lit. There’s also a gaming area for playing Stadia and a soundproof spot for testing out various Home/Nest products.</p>
<p>Like Apple’s Store, customers can bring in for repair broken devices like Pixels. The company says it’s growing the number of devices that can be repaired on-site, while certain issues, like a broken screen, should be able to be fixed same day.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2167283,2167282,2167281,2167280,2167279,2167278,2167277,2167276,2167275,2167274,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"]</p>
<p>It seems likely that the store is a pilot in and of itself, with further plans to open additional locations in the U.S. and, perhaps, international markets where the company sells hardware. For now, however, Google won’t discuss the subject beyond tomorrow’s opening in Chelsea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the insurance industry adjusts to life in the 21st century (heh), an AI startup that has built computer vision tools to enable remote damage appraisals is announcing a significant round of growth funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://tractable.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tractable</a>, which works with automotive insurance companies to let users take and submit photos of damaged cars that are then &#8220;read&#8221; to make appraisals, has raised $60 million, a Series D that values Tractable at $1 billion, the company said.</p>
<p>Tractable says it works with more than 20 of the top 100 auto insurers in the world, and it has seen sales grow 600% in the last 24 months, which CEO Alex Dalyac told me translates as &#8220;well into eight figures of annual revenue.&#8221; He also told me that &#8220;we would have grown even faster if it weren&#8217;t for COVID.&#8221; People staying at home meant far fewer people on the roads, and fewer accidents.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its business today is based mostly around car accident recovery &#8212; where users can take pictures using ordinary smartphone cameras, uploading pictures via a mobile web site (not typically an app).</p>
<p>But Tractable&#8217;s plan is to use some of the funding to expand deeper into areas adjacent to that: natural disaster recovery (specifically for appraising property damage), and used car appraisals. It will also use the investment to continue building out its technology, specifically to help build out better, AI-based techniques of processing and parsing pictures that are taken on smartphones &#8212; by their nature small in size.</p>
<p>Insight Partners and Georgian Partners co-led the round and it brings the total raised by the company to $115 million.</p>
<p>Dalyac, a deep learning researcher by training who co-founded the company with Razvan Ranca and Adrien Cohen, said that the &#8220;opportunity&#8221; (if you could call an accident that) Tractable has identified and built to fix is that it&#8217;s generally time-consuming and stressful to deal with an insurance company when you are also coping with a problem with your car.</p>
<p>And while a new generation of &#8220;insurtech&#8221; startups have emerged in recent years that are bringing more modern processes into the equation, typically the incumbent major insurance companies &#8212; the ones that Tractable targets &#8212; have lacked the technology to improve that process.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unlike the tension between fintech-fuelled neobanks and the incumbent banks, which are now scrambling to invest in more technology to catch up with the times.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="X9UNZRgBf1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/">Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/embed/#?secret=X9UNZRgBf1" data-secret="X9UNZRgBf1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Getting into an accident can be anything from a hassle to trauma,&#8221; Dalyac said. &#8220;It can be devastating, and then the process for recovery is pretty damn slow. You&#8217;re dealing with so many touch points with your insurance, so many people that need to come and check things out again. It&#8217;s hard to keep track and know when things will truly be back to normal. Our belief is that that whole process can be 10 times faster, thanks to the breakthroughs in image classification.&#8221;</p>
<p>That process currently also extends not just to taking pictures for claims, but also to help figure out when a car is beyond repair, in which case which parts can be recycled and reused elsewhere, also using Tractable&#8217;s computer vision technology. Dalyac noted that this was a popular enough service in the last year that the company helped recycle as many cars &#8220;as Tesla sold in 2019.&#8221;</p>
<p>Customers that have integrated with Tractable to date include Geico in the U.S., as well as a large swathe of insurers in Japan, specifically Tokio Marine Nichido, Mitsui Sumitomo, Aioi Nissay Dowa and Sompo. Covéa, the largest auto insurer in France, is also a customer, as is Admiral Seguros, the Spanish entity of U.K.&#8217;s Admiral Group, as well as Ageas, a top U.K. insurer.</p>
<p>Japan is the company&#8217;s biggest market today Dalyac said &#8212; the reason being that it has an aging population, but one that is also very strong on mobile usage: combining those two, &#8220;automation is more than a value add; it’s a must have,&#8221; Dalyac said. He also added that he thinks the U.S. will overtake Japan as Tractable&#8217;s biggest market soon.</p>
<p>The new directions into property and other car applications will also open the door to a wider set of use cases beyond working with insurance providers over time. It will also bring Tractable potentially into new competitive environments. There are other companies that have also identified this opportunity.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/hover-secures-60m-for-a-3d-imaging-platform-used-to-assess-and-fix-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hover</a>, which has built a way to create 3D imagery of homes using ordinary smartphone cameras, is also eyeing ways of selling its tech (originally developed to help make estimates on home repairs) to insurance companies.</p>
<p>For now, however, it sounds like the opportunity is a big enough one that the race is more to meet demand than it is to beat competitors to do so.</p>

<p>“Tractable’s accelerating growth at scale is a testament to the power and differentiation of their applied machine learning system, which continues to improve as more businesses adopt it,&#8221; said Lonne Jaffe, MD at Insight Partners and Tractable board member, in a statement. &#8220;We’re excited to double down on our partnership with Tractable as they work to help the world recover faster from accidents and disasters that affect hundreds of millions of lives.”</p>
<p>Emily Walsh, partner at Georgian Partners added: “Tractable’s industry-leading computer vision capabilities are continuing to fuel incredible customer ROI and growth for the firm. We&#8217;re excited to continue to partner with Tractable as they apply their artificial intelligence capabilities to new, multi-billion dollar market opportunities in the used vehicle and natural disaster recovery industries.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon admits it has a fake review problem, but does its best to spread the blame around in <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/how-amazon-works/creating-a-trustworthy-reviews-experience">a new post</a> detailing the issue. After numerous reports for years that the online retail giant is overrun with knock-off products and faked or farmed reviews, the company aims to look as if it is finally putting its foot down, but no new efforts or rules are discussed — rather, it is others that need to step up <em>their</em> work to keep Amazon safe.</p>
<p>Amazon reviews have become notoriously unreliable as indicators of quality as the store has given itself over willingly to counterfeits, AliExpress resellers and promotion of the company&#8217;s internal brands (developed with the benefit of seller data). <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/06/amazon-reviews-thousands-are-fake-heres-how-to-spot-them.html">Multiple</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-fake-review-problem">reports</a> have found organized efforts to spam the store with meaningless five-star reviews in exchange for free products or cash. I have myself received such offers, or sellers promising payment for raising a star rating.</p>
<p>After the requisite preliminary palaver about being &#8220;obsessed with delighting customers&#8221; and all that, Amazon explains that it, like all big tech giants, uses automated systems to vet reviews before they go up. The company has always been cagey about the actual numbers, but in this post it drops a whopper: &#8220;In 2020, we stopped more than 200 million suspected fake reviews before they were ever seen by a customer.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bezos &#8216;can&#8217;t guarantee&#8217; no anti-competitive activity as Congress catches him flat-footed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/bezos-cant-guarantee-no-anti-competitive-activity-as-congress-catches-him-flat-footed/embed/#?secret=gWDUWYTNjF" data-secret="gWDUWYTNjF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>200 million is a lot no matter how you look at it, but it&#8217;s really a lot when you consider that Amazon <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/06/amazon-reviews-thousands-are-fake-heres-how-to-spot-them.html">told CNBC that same year</a> that it &#8220;analyze[s] over 10 million review submissions weekly,&#8221; which adds up to somewhere north of 520 million submissions yearly. These two Amazon-provided numbers suggest that a third of all reviews submitted, at a minimum, are rejected as fake.</p>
<p>Hard numbers on Amazon&#8217;s total reviews are hard to come by. <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-fake-review-problem">Speaking to BuzzFeed</a>, Amazon listing analysis site ReviewMeta&#8217;s Tommy Noonan estimated that in 2020 Amazon hosted around 250 million reviews (of which, incidentally, he calculated about 9% were &#8220;unnatural&#8221;). But if over 500 million were submitted in 2020 and about 200 million of those were fake, that indicates a far larger total. I&#8217;ve asked Amazon for more precise information on this, and will update the post if I hear back, but the company is not communicative about these numbers in general.</p>
<p>Groups organizing on social media numbering in the tens of thousands have been repeatedly pointed out as major contributors to the fake review ecosystem. Amazon writes that in the first quarter of 2020, it reported 300 such groups to the platforms hosting them, and the same period in 2021 it reported over 1,000. Takedown times have increased, but it&#8217;s hard to take this increase as anything other than a thriving business model — certainly not something in the process of being stamped out.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook takes down 16,000 groups trading fake reviews after another poke by UK&#8217;s CMA&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/facebook-takes-down-16000-groups-trading-fake-reviews-after-another-poke-by-uks-cma/embed/#?secret=xscALVQfXS" data-secret="xscALVQfXS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;It is imperative for social media companies to invest adequately in proactive controls to detect and enforce fake reviews ahead of our reporting the issue to them,&#8221; Amazon declares. Indeed social media companies are being pressed from multiple directions to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/big-tech-companies-cannot-be-trusted-to-self-regulate-we-need-congress-to-act/">take more responsibility</a> for what users do on their platforms, but they make the same noises Amazon does: &#8220;we&#8217;re doing what we can,&#8221; (and, it is left unsaid, clearly it&#8217;s not enough).</p>
<p>&#8220;We need coordinated assistance from consumer protection regulators around the world,&#8221; Amazon writes. But the company <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/amazon-wages-lobbying-war-kill-100025138.html">lobbied forcefully and successfully against the INFORM act</a>, which would have helped identify sellers with bad intent and add transparency to online marketplaces (strangely, Amazon has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/amazon-u-s-sellers-will-have-to-display-their-name-and-address-starting-sept-1-2020/">taken some of the actions it objects to independently</a>). And that line is suspiciously absent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/ring-police-warrants-neighbors/">when it is Amazon that consumers need to be protected against</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is also critical that we hold bad actors—and the service providers that provide them with fake reviews—accountable for their activity,&#8221; the post continues. But while lawsuits and partnerships with law enforcement are part of that, once again the call to &#8220;work together&#8221; rings hollow when Amazon itself is where the activity occurs and the company is in complete control of that ecosystem. Though it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/">banned some major players from the store</a>, innumerable others flout the rules with impunity.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the post does Amazon detail any new steps it will take to deter these bad actors or crack down on the pervasive gaming of the system for which it sets the rules. It will &#8220;continue to enhance&#8221; its detection tools, &#8220;streamline processes&#8221; for partnerships, and &#8220;work hard&#8221; at keeping scammers accountable. In other words, it will keep doing exactly what it has been doing this whole time — which is what put it in this position in the first place.</p>

<p>Thanks to a twist of fate, two large cups of coffee and help from editor Annie Saunders, the Extra Crunch team is taking over today&#8217;s edition of Daily Crunch.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll hand it back as soon as Henry Pickavet returns or Alex Wilhelm is back from vacation, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve been handed the mic: We&#8217;re trying to identify the most effective growth marketers who are helping startups build their businesses. With that in mind, Managing Editor Eric Eldon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/to-win-post-pandemic-startups-need-remote-first-growth-teams">interviewed growth leader Susan Su</a>, currently head of portfolio strategy at Sound Ventures, about the need for founders to develop a growth-centered mentality as the economy reopens.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don’t need to memorize all the right buttons to push in an ads dashboard, but they need to be familiar and comfortable with the core work of gap-finding,&#8221; says Su.</p>
<p>&#8220;Founders will fail if they adopt a mentality that someone else can or should do it for them. The founder’s job is to supply ambition and opinions, and then magnetize high-quality talent to come and pull the levers and bring their creative vision to life.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t rank with top personal health brands like Procter &amp; Gamble, Peloton or Fitbit, but perhaps it doesn&#8217;t need to. Cupertino&#8217;s health-related products and services are broad enough to touch each of these companies — and many others — in some way.</p>
<p>In <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/apple-health/">an interview with Apple VP of Technology Kevin Lynch</a></strong>, Darrell Etherington tracked the evolution of the company&#8217;s user-guided approach to developing hardware, software and data management policies around personal health.</p>
<p>“It actually started from Apple Watch, where we were capturing heart rate data for calorimetry activity, and [Activity] ring closure, and we needed a place to put the heart rate data,&#8221; says Lynch. &#8220;So we created the Health app as a place to store the data.”</p>
<p>Sarah Perez reported on <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">today&#8217;s launch of Spotify Greenroom, a live audio app</a></strong> based on the code of Locker Room. In March, Spotify purchased Betty Labs, which developed Locker Room.</p>
<p>Best known for music streaming, Spotify has been branching out into a more robust media company in recent years. Greenroom will allow users to host and join audio chat rooms, &#8220;and optionally turn those conversations into podcasts,&#8221; says Sarah.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason why advertising units are called &#8220;impressions.&#8221; CPG companies are eager to literally place their messages in our faces.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/facebook-will-begin-beaming-advertisements-into-virtual-reality/">Facebook today announced its plans to start testing ads on its Oculus platform</a></strong> in a limited rollout. A company blog post indicates that “for now, this is a test with a few apps.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/bonds-200-million-led-investment-values-software-testing-platform-browserstack-at-4-billion/">Software testing platform BrowserStack</a></strong> announced today that it has raised $200 million in a Series B round. The round, which values the company at $4 billion, was led by BOND, with Insight Partners and Accel participating.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/denmarks-templafy-raises-60m-for-its-b2b-saas-platform-that-does-business-document-creation/"><strong>PandaDoc competitor Templafy</strong></a> has raised a Series D worth $60 million. Since launch, the business document creation platform based in Denmark has raised $125 million, including a $25 million Series C 14 months ago.</p>
<p>After securing a $100 million Series E round led by Accel partners, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/bringg-nabs-100m-at-a-1b-valuation-for-a-last-mile-delivery-platform-for-retailers/">last-mile delivery platform Bringg is now valued at $1 billion</a></strong>, the company confirms. CEO Guy Bloch told TechCrunch the funds will be used to continue fueling growth, expanding operations and acquiring new customers. “Companies need our urgent help to do a job,&#8221; says Bloch.</p>
<h2>Edtech investors are flocking to SaaS guidance counselors</h2>
<p>The prevailing post-pandemic edtech narrative, which predicted higher ed would be DOA as soon as everyone got their vaccine and took off for a gap year, might not be quite true.</p>
<p>Natasha Mascarenhas explores a new crop of edtech SaaS startups that function like guidance counselors, helping students with everything from study-abroad opportunities to swiping right on a captivating college (really!).</p>
<p>&#8220;Startups that help students navigate institutional bureaucracy so they can get more value out of their educational experience may become a growing focus for investors as consumer demand for virtual personalized learning increases,&#8221; she writes.</p>

(May the odds be ever in your favor!) Among the more interesting new tools is a machine-learning-powered feature that alerts admins to potentially unhealthy conversations taking place in their group. Another lets the admin slow the pace of a heated conversation by limiting how often group members can post. As the adage goes, if you can’t say anything nice, say it slower.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/google-updates-its-kids-online-safety-curriculum-with-lessons-on-gaming-video-and-more/"><strong>Google updates online safety curriculum for kids</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Perhaps we can teach the next generation to just be nice on the internet instead of using machine learning to prevent them from rapidly disseminating vaccine disinformation? Google updated and expanded its digital safety and citizenship curriculum, Be Internet Awesome, which has lessons for parents and educators about online gaming, cyberbullying and online empathy.

At the moment, Waymo One, a commercial ride-hailing service, operates in the Phoenix, Arizona area, and Waymo announced plans earlier this month to enter a “test run” of its trucking and cargo transportation service with J.B. Hunt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E3 2021 kicked off with news about E3 2022. Kind of a funny way to start a show, as Mayor Eric Garcetti told the crowd, &#8220;we look forward to seeing you in-person, here in the City of Angels, in 2022.&#8221; Also a bit funny when the mayor’s video game show announcement has less confetti and Minions than his state-reopening speech, but that’s something for another post.</p>
<p>It’s understandable, of course, that E3’s organizers led with that news. The 2021 show was, like so many other things over the past year-and-a-half, a historic anomaly. After opting to skip the 2020 show altogether (understandably), it went ahead with the first &#8212; and for the time being, last &#8212; all virtual event.</p>
<p>The virtual event always seems like a good idea, in theory. In practice, results vary wildly depending on a number of factors, not the least of which is content. Many shows have an uphill battle when it comes to moving all online. CES, I think, was a struggle, due in part to the size of the show, but also the content. As ubiquitous as consumer electronics are, I don’t see wide swaths of the internet champing at the bit to watch a presentation from anyone but, say, Apple and maybe Samsung.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7ESqLTKvwK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/e3-2021-catch-up/">E3 2021 catch up</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;E3 2021 catch up&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/e3-2021-catch-up/embed/#?secret=7ESqLTKvwK" data-secret="7ESqLTKvwK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>E3 doesn’t have that problem. The show already had a leg up, having moved away from industry-only to something more hybrid years ago. Unlike other shows I attend regularly, people in downtown LA actually get a bit of a buzz when E3 comes to town. Everyone’s a gamer and most are excited about some piece of upcoming news. Uber and Lyft drivers love to tell you about it that week.</p>
<p>It follows that the show’s online presence is immense. The days leading up to the event, E3-related content was trending all over the place &#8212; people watch trailers, argue about the trailers, stream about the trailers and argue about other people’s streams about the trailers on their own streams. It’s a recipe for success around a virtual event &#8212; especially coming after a year when, even before the latest Xbox and PlayStation were released, the industry was already setting records amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Of the big three, Microsoft won, hands down. Sorry, Sony, you can’t win if you don’t play. Nintendo was solid, but not spectacular. But more on that in a moment.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1YnVzOA2wNs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=444&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>I talked a fair bit about the Xbox press conference <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/e3-2021-catch-up/">in the last one of these</a>. But the long and short of it is Microsoft won on two flanks: sheer volume and Game Pass titles. That last bit feels about as close to a silver bullet as we’re going to see in this generation of consoles. Likely Sony is going to have its own virtual event in the near future &#8212; but it’s going to be a tough act to follow.</p>
<p>In all, Microsoft showed off 30 games (and a fridge), a whopping 27 of which will be available on Game Pass, if there were any doubt as to how all-in the company is on its subscription service. And, of course, there’s the fact that this was billed as a Microsoft/Bethesda event, which shows you how important that massive acquisition is to the future of Xbox.</p>
<p>As for Nintendo, let’s be honest. Anything that didn’t include the long-rumored Switch Pro was going to be a disappointment. The original Switch is four years old and due for a big upgrade, beyond the Switch Lite and a refresh with added battery. It’s time for that HD screen &#8212; the thing would sell like hotcakes next holiday.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQz_ECTGGyA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Thing is, the Switch had a spectacular 2020. Even with an initial supply chain shortage (something all three current consoles are guilty of), it did gangbusters during the pandemic, due in no small part to the arrival of a long-awaited new Animal Crossing game. A low-pressure, social title between fuzzy animals was precisely what the world needed last year, and Nintendo was happy to deliver.</p>
<p>There’s also a good chance that Nintendo is dealing with continued supply chain issues around the new components. So while it seems likely the Pro is on the way (see: the new Guardians of the Galaxy game), we’ll likely have to wait until next year.</p>

<p>We’ll also have to wait until next year for Breath of the Wild 2, but at least the sequel to the much-loved Zelda game had the decency to show up this year. And, of course, we’ve got a bunch of great-looking titles coming for the system. Some highlights.</p>

<p data-c="paragraph">Lincoln Motor will launch its first all-electric vehicle in 2022 followed by three other EVs as part of the luxury brand&#8217;s goal to electrify its entire portfolio by the end of the decade.</p>
<p data-c="paragraph">The first EV will come to market just in time for Lincoln&#8217;s 100th birthday celebration — and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/lincoln-reportedly-plans-to-electrify-entire-lineup-by-2022/">nearly four years</a> since initial reports emerged that the brand was aiming to electrify its lineup. Like GM&#8217;s luxury brand Cadillac, Lincoln doesn&#8217;t have an all-electric vehicle in its lineup. But Lincoln is keen to catch up and has set a lofty target for half of its global sales to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2025. These new vehicles fall under Ford&#8217;s commitment to invest $30 billion into electric vehicles through 2025.</p>
<p data-c="paragraph">The announcement by Lincoln follows a string of EV-related news from Ford and its competitors. On Wednesday, rival GM said it planned to invest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/">$35 billion in EVs and autonomous vehicles</a> — an $8 billion increase from its financial commitment made back in November 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p data-c="paragraph">The Lincoln EV was originally going to be built on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/rivian-is-building-lincoln-an-all-electric-vehicle/">Rivian&#8217;s skateboard platform</a>. However, those plans were scrapped in April 2020. The companies said at the time that they still plan to co-develop a vehicle in the future. A<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Lincoln spokesperson confirmed those co-development plans were still intact, but did not reveal any more information. </span></p>
<p data-c="paragraph"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For now, Lincoln&#8217;s electric vehicles will be based on a </span>new, dedicated EV architecture developed by Ford. The automaker announced in May during its <a href="https://shareholder.ford.com/investors/delivering-ford/default.aspx">Capital Markets Day</a> for investors that it was developing two flexible platforms, one for smaller SUVs and sedans and another for larger pickups. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This is a different architecture used in the current Ford Mustang Mach-E and upcoming Ford F-150 Lightning.</span></p>
<p data-c="paragraph">The new flexible platform, which allows for rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive vehicles, is expected to underpin EV versions of the Lincoln Aviator and Ford Explorer.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ford cancels Lincoln electric vehicle program with Rivian&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/ford-cancels-lincoln-electric-vehicle-program-with-rivian/embed/#?secret=sMdkQJu1g3" data-secret="sMdkQJu1g3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<div class="_1z604">
<p data-c="paragraph">According to Lincoln, the automaker&#8217;s first fully electric car will join the likes of plug-in hybrid SUVs Aviator and Corsair. Lincoln has not yet revealed what model the new EV will take, but it hinted the design might be similar to the Lincoln Zephyr Reflection concept sedan revealed at Auto Shanghai this year, made specifically for the Chinese market. Lincoln&#8217;s electric car will be available for sale in both the United States and China.</p>
</div>
<p>Lincoln also shared information on the interior of its new EV, attempting to make it a minimalistic and expansive space with a panoramic roof vista to create a more airy feel, one that befits a &#8220;sanctuary,&#8221; as the automaker is referring to its vehicle. Perhaps most notable is the upcoming EVs will have a digital platform built off the Android operating system, which will allow the company to offer third-party apps and services and update the software remotely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automakers’ interest in robotics is not a new phenomenon, of course: Robots and automation have long played a role in manufacturing and are both clearly central to their push into AVs. But recently, many companies are going even deeper into the field, with plans to be involved in the wide spectrum of categories that robotics touch.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021?promo=leftrail&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>, we spoke to a trio of experts at three major automakers. Max Bajracharya of Toyota Research Institute, Mario Santillo of Ford and Ernestine Fu of Hyundai Motor Group joined us to discuss their companies’ unique approaches to robotics.</p>
<h2>Why are automakers so interested in robotics?</h2>
<p>Let’s get the simple question out of the way first, shall we? Moving beyond existing investments in manufacturing and autonomous vehicles, why do so many carmakers seem so bullish about companies like Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bajracharya:</strong> I think all automakers are recognizing that there won’t be the automotive business in the future as it is today. A lot of automakers, Toyota included, are looking for what’s next. Automakers are very well positioned to leverage what they already know about robotics and manufacturing to take on the robotics market. <strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><em>(Timestamp: 1:01)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<h2>The role of concept vehicles</h2>
<p>Concept cars are nothing new in the industry, but even still, Hyundai’s recently announced Ultimate Mobility Vehicle (UMV) was pretty wild, with large, extending legs that help it walk off-road.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://twitter.com/HarryStebbings?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Harry Stebbings,</a> the well-known podcaster behind &#8220;20 minute VC,&#8221; announced today that he raised a duo of funds for <a href="https://www.thetwentyminutevc.com/">20VC</a>, the venture capital fund he launched off of his show’s success. The pair of funds &#8212; one for early stage and one for growth stage &#8212; total $140 million in assets under management, plucked from LPs including MIT, early Spotify investor Shakil Khan and RIT Capital partners.</p>
<p>The total is a 15X increase from Stebbings&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/from-twenty-minute-vc-to-20vc-harry-stebbings-launched-a-micro-vc-off-the-back-of-his-popular-podcast/">inaugural $8.3 million fund</a>, launched less than a year ago.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;From Twenty Minute VC to 20VC, Harry Stebbings launches a micro VC off the back of his popular podcast&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/from-twenty-minute-vc-to-20vc-harry-stebbings-launched-a-micro-vc-off-the-back-of-his-popular-podcast/embed/#?secret=IE1C02W1Bf" data-secret="IE1C02W1Bf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Stebbings said that his early-stage fund, 20VC Early, will invest checks between $250,000 to $750,000, while his growth-stage fund, 20VC Explorer, will invest in Series B onwards, with checks between $1 million to $5 million.</p>
<p>The 20VC portfolio already includes a few reported unicorns, including audio app Clubhouse and virtual event organizer Hopin. But maybe more notable is what his assumed success &#8212; as a 24-year-old who has won a spot in competitive deals and raised a massive venture capital fund &#8212; means for the way that tech is evolving.</p>
<p>First, media experience, and the ability to spout useful content in a noisy world, is being increasingly valued as an asset in the modernizing world of VC. This week, Andreessen Horowitz launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/andreessen-horowitz-goes-into-publishing-with-future/">Future</a>, a full-fledged media operation that will cover trends in startups and tech. Stebbings’ podcast, which has more than 200,000 subscribers and 80 million downloads to date, has cultivated an audience by interviewing tech’s elite, from Twitter co-founder Biz Stone to Slack founder Stewart Butterfield and a16z’s Angela Strange. Those connections getting leveraged into dollars is a proof point of this growing idea, and sometimes meme, that Twitter followers can help anyone start a rolling fund.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my second point, which is that Stebbings raising such a massive tranche of capital could quiet some of the worry around emerging fund managers being unable to, well, 15X their initial micro-funds. In other words: You might be able to get a few of your buddies in venture to throw some checks in, but how do you get a full endowment to sign on board? Based on recent conversations I’ve had with emerging fund managers, it’s hard to get institutions, the ones with real check-writing power, on board for new funds because they only have so much capital allocated toward venture. It&#8217;s even harder for diverse, underrepresented founders. Whether or not Stebbings is a one-off is unclear, but we do at least know that venture backers are viewing his Rolodex as a key competitive advantage and asset in the wild world of investing.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, media is venture and venture is media. Stebbings sits at the intersection of that trend, and with $140 million more, it will be interesting to see what he does next, and if returns come along for the ride.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vianai Systems, an AI startup founded by Vishal Sikka, former chief executive of Indian IT services giant Infosys, said on Wednesday it has raised $140 million in a round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>The two-year-old startup said a number of industry luminaries also participated in the new round, which brings its total to-date raise to at least $190 million. The startup raised $50 million in its seed financing round, but there’s no word on the size of its Series A round.</p>
<p>Details about what exactly the Palo Alto-headquartered startup does is unclear. In a press statement, Dr. Vishal Sikka said the startup is building a “better AI platform, one that puts human judgment at the center of systems that bring vast AI capabilities to amplify human potential.” Sikka, 54, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/five-reasons-why-ceo-vishal-sikka-had-to-leave-infosys/articleshow/60114080.cms">resigned</a> from the top role at Infosys in 2017 after months of acrimony between the board and a cohort of founders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“<a href="http://vian.ai">Vianai</a> helps its customers amplify the transformation potential within their organizations using a variety of advanced AI and ML tools with a distinct approach in how it thoughtfully brings together humans with technology. This human-centered approach differentiates Vianai from other platform and product companies and enables its customers to fulfill AI’s true promise,” the startup said.</p>

<p>The startup claims it has already amassed as its customers many of the world’s largest and most respected businesses, including insurance giant Munich Re.</p>
<p>Its investors include Jim Davidson (co-founder of Silver Lake), Henry Kravis and George Roberts (co-founders of KKR), and Jerry Yang (founding partner of AME and co-founder of Yahoo). Dr. Fei-Fei Li (co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI) has joined Vianai Systems’ advisory board.</p>
<p>“With the AI revolution underway, we believe Vianai’s human-centered AI platform and products provide global enterprises with operational and customer intelligence to make better business decisions,” said Deep Nishar, senior managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “We are pleased to partner with Dr. Sikka and the Vianai team to support their ambition to fulfill AI’s promise to drive fundamental digital transformations.”</p>
