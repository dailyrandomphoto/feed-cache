										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jerome Guillen, a critical executive at Tesla who was working on the development and eventual production of the Tesla Semi has left the company, the automaker said Monday in a <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-031976/">filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.</p>
<p>Guillen had a decade-long career at Tesla and held numerous roles, including his most recent position as head of heavy duty trucking. He started as the acting VP of vehicle engineering in 2012 before becoming program director of the Model S. He was later appointed president of automotive before becoming president of heavy duty trucking in March 2021.</p>
<p>The Tesla Semi, a battery electric semi-truck, is still in development. Earlier this month, the company announced that the first Tesla Semi Megacharger would be installed at Frito-Lay’s Modesto, California delivery center. The Megacharger charging stations will be capable of serving up to 100 Tesla Semi trucks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/30/tesla-semi-production-line-new-nevada-building-electric-trucks-per-week/">reported</a> earlier this year that Tesla is building a new production line for its Semi model near its Nevada Gigafactory location, with the aim of producing five semi-trucks per week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the US Food and Drug Administration granted approval to a keenly-watched Alzheimer’s drug, aducanumab, developed by the drugmaker Biogen. The decision to approve the drug, which was once abandoned as a failure, has been the subject of debate within the scientific and regulatory community for months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aducanumab, which will be marketed as Aduhelm, is the first novel Alzheimer’s treatment to be approved since 2003, the FDA noted in a press release. Aducanumab is also the first novel treatment designed to address </span><a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of several</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposed underlying causes of Alzheimer’s: the buildup of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain that disrupt the communication of neurons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critically, the drug received a conditional form of FDA approval called the ‘<a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-health-care-professionals-drugs/accelerated-approval-program">Accelerated Approval Program.’</a> The accelerated approval pathway is designed to provide early access to drugs for serious conditions if they address markers of disease – even when the FDA has misgivings about the overall results of clinical trials. Because of this, Biogen will still have to conduct a post-approval confirmatory trial of aducanumab. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the drug does not work as intended, we can take steps to remove it from the market. But hopefully, we will see further evidence of benefit in the clinical trial and as greater numbers of people receive Aduhelm,” the FDA statement </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fdas-decision-approve-new-treatment-alzheimers-disease"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reads. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch has contacted Biogen for comment on the upcoming confirmatory trial, and will update this story with Biogen’s response. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of the accelerated approval pathway is clearly intended to address lingering controversies that have plagued aducanumab in the months leading up to the FDA’s ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early-stage trials, there were promising signs that aducanumab might slow cognitive decline, a major Alzheimer’s symptom. In a 2016 </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19323"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in the journal </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 125 patients with mild or moderate Alzheimer’s who received monthly infusions of the drug saw levels of plaques decrease, as did symptoms of cognitive decline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decline of the plaques in the brain were </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(19)30480-6/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“robust and unquestionable”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as one </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lancet Neurology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper puts it, but the clinical findings were more modest – it wasn’t clear exactly how much people’s cognitive ability benefitted from the treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These early trials eventually led the FDA to allow the drug to skip phase 2 clinical trials, which are designed to identify dosages of the drug, and proceed directly to phase 3 clinical trials. This move was </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/05/30/if-the-fda-approves-biogens-alzheimers-treatment-i-wont-prescribe-it/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by some physicians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those phase 3 clinical trials, called </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02477800"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ENGAGE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02484547"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EMERGE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have become the center of tension. Both trials tested monthly intravenous injections of the drug on about 1600 patients with early Alzheimer’s. In 2019, both trials were </span><a href="https://www.alzforum.org/news/research-news/biogeneisai-halt-phase-3-aducanumab-trials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">halted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because the drug didn’t appear to be slowing cognitive decline, the primary endpoint of the trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional data analyzed in late 2019 from the EMERGE trial suggested that the drug was linked with a </span><a href="https://investors.biogen.com/static-files/5a31a1e3-4fbb-4165-921a-f0ccb1d64b65"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23 percent less</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cognitive decline, compared to a placebo. There were side effects: namely swelling and inflammation of the brain. This was seen in about</span><a href="https://investors.biogen.com/static-files/8e58afa4-ba37-4250-9a78-2ecfb63b1dcb#page=17"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 40 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Phase 3 trial participants, though most were symptomatic and most of those with symptoms (headache, nausea, visual disturbances) resolved after 4-16 weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, even the new data wasn’t enough to convince an independent FDA advisory committee, who, in November 2020 </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/health/aducanumab-alzheimers-drug-fda-panel.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">did not endorse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approval of the drug. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, The FDA, </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fdas-decision-approve-new-treatment-alzheimers-disease"><span style="font-weight: 400;">argued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the drug’s effects on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">beta-amyloid plaques</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were strong enough to suggest that benefit outweighed the risk. Critically, the FDA did not comment on the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">strength of clinical outcomes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – in short, the agency </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/761178s000lbl.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is basing this approval</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the drug’s ability to address beta-amyloid plaques, not how well each patient cognitive function responds to the drug. The followup study will need to address that outcome directly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, about </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fdas-decision-approve-new-treatment-alzheimers-disease"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 million people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have Alzheimer’s in the US, and patient organizations have rallied in response to this drug. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/alzassociation/status/1401922061816287236?s=10"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alzheimer’s Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has hailed the drug as a “victory for people living with Alzheimer’s.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the FDA’s decision on Monday, it was clear that, should aducanumab be approved, it would soon become a “blockbuster drug.” The financial picture around the drug seems to support that idea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trading of Biogen shares were initially halted, but have since</span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=biogen+shares&amp;oq=biogen+shares&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57l2j69i59j0i271l2j69i60l3.1179j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> jumped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 40 percent today, following the announcement. Shares of Eisai Co. Ltd, a Japanese company working with Biogen </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=eisai+shares&amp;oq=eisai+shares&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i67j35i39j0i20i131i263i433j0i67j46i175i199i433j69i60l2.1317j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jumped over 46 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the first three hours following the FDA’s approval. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, Biogen was banking on this approval as a long-term strategy. In an April 2021, </span><a href="https://investors.biogen.com/static-files/a957e5ba-325f-4a37-bfc8-43cecfc64620"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earnings presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company estimated that there were 600 sites ready to launch the treatment post-approval. Biogen has also submitted marketing authorization applications for aducanumab in Brazil, Canada, Switzerland and Australia. On June 7, the company announced that a year’s supply of the drug would </span><a href="https://investors.biogen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/biogen-and-eisai-launch-multiple-initiatives-help-patients"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost $56,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the wider world of Alzheimer’s drugs, it’s possible other companies may see this approval as proof-of-concept for other drugs targeting beta amyloid plaques. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/537036a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">editorial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that accompanied the 2016 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper on aducanumab, Eric Reiman, executive director of Banner Alzheimer’s Institute, argued that scientific confirmation that beta-amyloid-targeted treatment slows cognitive decline would be a “game changer.&#8221; The aducanumab trials have been likened to a test of this idea. Speaking to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Financial Times, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howard Filit, founding executive director of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/972b44c8-76dc-4f13-9195-f93d467e646c?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">aducanumab “the first rigorous test of the beta-amyloid hypothesis.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that sense, conditional approval may indicate that the FDA is sympathetic to this form of Alzheimer’s treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s </span><a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/analysis/alzheimers-biogen-eli-lilly-amyloid-targeting-therapy-fda-approval/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at least one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more beta-amyloid targeted drug from a major drugmaker (Eli Lilly) clinical trials. We may see some more of them emerge soon, provided that Biogen’s confirmatory study of aducanumab doesn&#8217;t prompt the FDA to withdraw approval. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today is releasing a new version of its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store Review Guidelines</a>, its lengthy document which dictates the rules which apps must abide by in order to be published to its App Store. Among the more notable changes rolling out today are several sections that will see Apple taking a harder stance on App Store fraud, scams and developer misconduct, including a new process that aims to empower other developers to hold bad actors accountable.</p>
<p>One of the key updates on this front involves a change to Apple&#8217;s Developer Code of Conduct (Section 5.6 and 5.6.1-5.6.4 of the Review Guidelines).</p>
<p>This section has been significantly expanded to include guidance stating that repeated manipulative or misleading behavior or other fraudulent conduct will lead to the developer&#8217;s removal from the Apple Developer Program. This is something Apple has done for repeated violations, it claims, but wanted to now ensure was clearly spelled out in the guidelines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an entirely new third paragraph in this section, Apple says that if a developer engages in activities or actions that are not in accordance with the developer code of conduct, they will have their Apple Developer account terminated.</p>
<p>It also details what, specifically, must be done to restore the account, which includes providing Apple with a written statement detailing the improvements they&#8217;ve made, which will have to be approved by Apple. If Apple is able to confirm the changes has been made, it may then restore the developer&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>Apple explained in a press briefing that this change was meant to prevent a sort of catch and release scenario where a developer gets caught by Apple, but then later reverts their changes to continue their bad behavior.</p>
<p>As part of this update, Apple added a new section about developer identity (5.6.2). This is meant to ensure the contact information for developers provided to Apple and customers is accurate and functional, and that the developer isn&#8217;t impersonating other, legitimate developers on the App Store. This was a particular issue in a high-profile incident of App Store fraud which involved a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/30/trezor-scam-bitcoin-1-million/">crypto wallet app that scammed</a> a user out of his life savings (~$600,000) in Bitcoin. The scam victim had been deceived because the app was using the same name and icon as a different company that made a hardware crypto device, and because the scan app was rated 5 stars. (Illegitimately, that is).</p>
<p>Related to this, Apple clarified the language around App Store discovery fraud (5.6.3) to more specifically call out any type of manipulations of App Store charts, search, reviews and referrals. The former would mean to crack down on the clearly booming industry of fake App Store ratings and reviews, which can send scam app up higher in charts and search.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the referral crackdown would address consumers being shown incorrect pricing outside the App Store in an effort to boost installs.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are hundreds of these. And then, there&#39;s hundreds of *real* ones too: <br /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />&quot;SCAM. What shady business. Downloaded this app on concept. It doesn’t even work. There is no free version AT ALL. You are tricked into downloading and then asked to pay $7.99 per FREAKING WEEK. Wow.&quot;</p>
<p>&mdash; Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011094070841348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Another section (5.6.4) addresses issues that come up after an app is published, including negative customer reports and concerns and excessive refund rates, for example. If Apple notices this behavior, it will investigate the app for violations, it says.</p>
<p>Of course, the question here is: will Apple actually notice the potential scammers? In recent months, a growing number of developers believe Apple is allowing far too many scammers to fall through the cracks of App Review.</p>
<p>One particular thorn in Apple&#8217;s side <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/">has been</a> Fleksy keyboard app founder Kosta Eleftheriou, who is not only suing Apple for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">revenue he&#8217;s personally lost to scammers</a>, but also formed a sort of one-man bunco squad to expose some of the more egregious scams to date. This has included the above-mentioned crypto scam; a kids game that actually <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/15/app-store-scam-is-a-kids-game-with-a-hidden-online-casino/">contained a hidden online casino</a>; and a VPN app <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/another-ios-vpn-app-scam-is-uncovered_id131487">scamming users out of $5 million</a> per year, among many others.</p>
<p>The rampant fraud taking place on the App Store was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/apple-downplays-complaints-about-app-store-scams-in-antitrust-hearing/">brought up during Apple&#8217;s antitrust hearing</a>, when Georgia’s Senator Jon Ossoff asked Apple’s Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer why Apple was not able to locate scams, given they&#8217;re &#8220;trivially easy&#8221; to identify.</p>
<p>Apple downplayed the concerns then, and continues to do so through <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/app-store-stopped-over-1-5-billion-in-suspect-transactions-in-2020/">press releases like this one which noted</a> how the App Store stopped over $1.5 billion in fraudulent transactions in 2020.</p>
<p>But a new update to these Guidelines seems to be an admission that Apple may need a little help on this front. It says developers can now directly report possible violations they find in other developers&#8217; apps. Through a new form that standardizes this sort of complaint, developers can point to guideline violations and any other trust and safety issues they discover. Often, developers notice the scammers whose apps are impacting their own business and revenue, so they&#8217;ll likely turn to this form now as a first step in getting the scammer dealt with.</p>
<p>Another change will allow developers to appeal a rejection if they think there was unfair treatment of any kind, including political bias. Previously, Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21406112/apple-app-store-appeals-process-live-guidelines-challenge-antitrust-fortnite">had allowed developers</a> to appeal App Store decisions and suggest changes to guidelines.</p>
<p>Apple told us it has 500 app reviewers covering 81 languages who see new scenarios daily that have to be accounted for in updated guidelines and policies. Apple says it takes what it learns from these individual issues it encounters to invest in its systems, algorithms and training so it can prevent similar issues in the future. The company believes the new Code of Conduct rules, in particular, will give it the tools needed to better crack down on App Store fraud.</p>
<p>The rules about scams are only a handful of the many changes rolling out with today&#8217;s updated App Store Review Guidelines.</p>
<p>There are a few others, however, also worth highlighting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple clarified rules around &#8220;hookup&#8221; apps to ensure developers understand porn and prostitution are not allowed on the App Store &#8212; often an issue with the fly-by-night hookup apps, which bait and switch users.</li>
<li>Creator content apps are instructed that they must follow rules for user-generated content, when applicable, meaning they must have content blocking, reporting and robust moderation.</li>
<li>Apple added the ability for licensed pharmacies and licensed cannabis dispensaries to facilitate purchasing provided they&#8217;re legal and geogated.</li>
<li>Apps that report criminal activity require the developers to work with local law enforcement. (Citizen is a recent example of an app gone awry <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447446/citizen-app-internal-slack-palisades-fire-arson-bounty-manhunt-los-angeles">when users hunted down the wrong person</a>. That level of carelessness may be coming to an end now.)</li>
<li>Bait-and-switch marketing and ads about app pricing isn&#8217;t allowed.</li>
<li>Cellular carrier apps can now include other kinds of subscription apps besides music and video services.</li>
<li>Apple clarifies that developers can communicate on email with anyone, but says they can&#8217;t target customers acquired through the App Store with messages about how to make purchases outside of the App Store.</li>
<li>Apple has enough drinking game apps. Stop sending them in.</li>
<li>Apps that offer account creation also have to offer account deletion.</li>
<li>Other clarity was added around in-app purchases for gift cards, app metadata, bug fix submissions, and more. But these were not major changes.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today&#8217;s WWDC keynote from Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-the-wwdc-2021-keynote/">covered a huge range of updates</a>. From <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-macos-12-monterey/">a new macOS</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/watchos-8-brings-new-mindfulness-features-and-respiratory-tracking/">a refreshed watchOS</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-ios-15-with-new-features-for-facetime-and-better-notifications/">a new iOS</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-wwdc-2021-privacy-security/">better privacy controls</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-facetime-updates-at-wwdc-2021/">FaceTime updates</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-icloud-with-privacy-focused-features/">even iCloud+</a>, there was something for everyone in the laundry list of new code.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s keynote was essentially what happens when the big tech companies get huge; they have so many projects that they can&#8217;t just detail a few items. They have to run down their entire parade of platforms, dropping packets of news concerning each.</p>
<p>But despite the obvious indication that Apple has been hard at work on the critical software side of its business, especially its services-side (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-icloud-with-privacy-focused-features/">more here</a>), Wall Street gave a firm, emphatic shrug.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-event-fails-to-save-the-companys-stock-from-broader-market-sell-off/">is standard</a> but always slightly confusing.</p>
<p>Investors care about future cash flows, at least in theory. Those future cash flows come from anticipated revenues, which are born from product updates, driving growth in sales of services, software, and hardware. Which, apart from the hardware portion of the equation, is precisely what Apple detailed today.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And lo, Wall Street looked upon the drivers of its future earnings estimates, and did sayeth &#8220;<em>lol, who really cares.&#8221;</em></span></strong></p>
<p>Shares of Apple were down a fraction for most of the day, picking up as time passed not thanks to the company&#8217;s news dump, but because the Nasdaq largely rose as trading raced to a close.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the Apple chart, <a href="http://ycharts.com">via YCharts</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2162612 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AAPL_chart-3.png" alt="" width="850" height="503" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AAPL_chart-3.png 850w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AAPL_chart-3.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AAPL_chart-3.png?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AAPL_chart-3.png?resize=768,454 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AAPL_chart-3.png?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AAPL_chart-3.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the Nasdaq:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2162610" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/^IXIC_chart.png" alt="" width="850" height="523" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/^IXIC_chart.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/^IXIC_chart.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/^IXIC_chart.png?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/^IXIC_chart.png?resize=768,473 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/^IXIC_chart.png?resize=680,419 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/^IXIC_chart.png?resize=1536,945 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/^IXIC_chart.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>Presuming that you are not a ChartMaster<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, those might not mean much to you. Don&#8217;t worry. The charts say very little all-around so you are missing little. Apple was down a bit, and the Nasdaq up a bit. Then the Nasdaq went up more, and Apple&#8217;s stock generally followed. Which is good to be clear, but somewhat immaterial.</p>
<p>So after yet another major Apple event that will help determine the health and popularity of every Apple platform &#8212; key drivers of lucrative hardware sales! &#8212; the markets are betting that all their prior work estimating the True and Correct value of Apple was dead-on and that there is no need for any sort of up-or-down change.</p>
<p>That, or Apple is so big now that investors are simply betting it will grow in keeping with GDP. Which would be a funny diss. Regardless, more from the Apple event <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-the-wwdc-2021-keynote/">here</a> in case you are behind.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic forced companies around the world to adjust to a &#8220;new normal,&#8221; which caused many leaders to pivot their business strategies and adopt new technologies to continue operations. In a time of chaos and change, there is no senior leader that can navigate this sort of change better than a CTO.</p>
<p>Not only do CTOs understand the ever-changing tech landscape, they also provide invaluable insights to help organizations go beyond traditional IT conversations and leverage technology to successfully scale businesses.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Boards are facing pressure to be strategic and thoughtful on how to evolve in the rapidly iterating world of technology, and a CTO is uniquely positioned to address specific challenges.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>There are now more reasons than ever to consider adding a CTO to your board. As a CTO myself, I know how important and impactful it can be to have technical-minded leaders on a company’s board of directors. At a time when companies are accelerating their digital transformation, it’s critical to have diverse technical perspectives and people from varying backgrounds, as transformations are a mix of people, process and technology.</p>
<p>Drawing on my experience on Lightbend’s board of directors, here are five hidden benefits of making space at the table for a CTO.</p>
<h2>A unique mind (and skill) set</h2>
<p>Currently, most boards of directors are composed of former CEOs, CFOs and investors. While such executives bring vast experience, they have very specific expertise, and that frequently does not include technical proficiency. In order for a company to be successful, your board needs to have people with different backgrounds and expertise.</p>
<p>Inviting different perspectives forces companies out of the groupthink mentality and find new, creative solutions to their problems. Diverse perspectives aren&#8217;t just about the title –– racial ethnicity and gender diversity are clearly a play here as well.</p>
<h2>Deep understanding of tech</h2>
<p>For a product-led company, having a CTO who has been close to product development and innovation can bring deep insights and understanding to the boardroom. Boards are facing pressure to be strategic and thoughtful on how to evolve in the rapidly iterating world of technology, and a CTO is uniquely positioned to address specific challenges.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Craig Federighi started things off with details <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-ios-15-with-new-features-for-facetime-and-better-notifications/">on the latest major update to iOS</a>, noting that this release focuses on four points: staying connected, finding focus, using intelligence, and exploring the world. iOS 15 will roll into public beta in July, with a full release &#8220;this fall.&#8221;</p>
<h3>FaceTime updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spatial audio: </strong>When using a compatible audio setup, spatial audio will make it seem more like your friends voices are coming from their on-screen position.</li>
<li><strong>Voice isolation: </strong>Better (and toggle-able) voice isolation for when you&#8217;re FaceTiming from a loud environment.</li>
<li><strong>Portrait mode: </strong>The portrait mode from the camera app is coming to FaceTime — in other words, pretty background blurring.</li>
<li><strong>FaceTime links: </strong>You&#8217;ll now be able to generate shareable FaceTime links to let others (including desktop and Android users via the browser!) join FaceTime calls.</li>
<li><strong>SharePlay: </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-introduces-shareplay-for-co-watching-streaming-and-screen-sharing-over-facetime/">Shared audio/video streams</a> to allow you to listen to music, watch video (select video partners initially, including Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, and TikTok), and control apps in sync with friends. You can pushed the shared videos to your AppleTV, keeping it all synced up between devices and households.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&#8220;Focus&#8221; mode<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2162283" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-focus.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-focus.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-focus.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-focus.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-focus.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-focus.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-focus.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-focus.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-notifications-focus.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></h3>
<ul>
<li>You&#8217;ll be able to shift your phone into different, customizable modes — like &#8220;work,&#8221; where only your work related apps will show up, or &#8220;personal&#8221; which could tuck all those work apps and widgets to the background. Vacation mode, activate!</li>
<li><strong>Notifications batching:</strong> You can now tell iOS to batch less important notifications together, delivering them all at a specific time (like after you&#8217;ve woken up, rather than letting them trickle in throughout the night.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Live Text</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2162299" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-12.22.31-PM.jpg" alt="WWDC 2021 - Photos - Live Text" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-12.22.31-PM.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-12.22.31-PM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-12.22.31-PM.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-12.22.31-PM.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-12.22.31-PM.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-12.22.31-PM.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-12.22.31-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-12.22.31-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>

<h3>Apple Wallet</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2162316" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ID-driver.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ID-driver.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ID-driver.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ID-driver.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ID-driver.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ID-driver.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ID-driver.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ID-driver.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ID-driver.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Apple is incorporating home, office, and hotel keys into Apple Wallet, allowing you to unlock compatible doors in those places with your phone. You&#8217;ll be able to check into select hotels, for example, and have your room key show up on your phone as soon as your room is ready.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also working with the TSA (in select states, at first) to put an encrypted copy of your state driver&#8217;s license (!) in Wallet that will be accepted at security screenings.</p>

<p>Maps is getting a details-focused overhaul, with the addition of 3D elevation maps, 3D rendered landmarks, crosswalks, bike lanes, etc.</p>
<p>Apple Maps is also taking some cues from Google Maps, including a mode that has you use the camera to scan nearby buildings to more precisely orient the phone and help you figure out which direction you&#8217;re supposed to go at the beginning of a walk.</p>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/watchos-8-brings-new-mindfulness-features-and-respiratory-tracking/">watchOS will now be able to help track your respiratory rate</a> (how many breaths you take per minute), and note how you might breathe differently throughout the day (like when you&#8217;re sleeping). They&#8217;re also adding new workout modes to the activity tracking engine, including Tai Chi and Pilates.</li>
<li>A new &#8220;Portraits&#8221; watchface will use your portrait-mode photos to create a neat, layered-looking clock layout</li>

<p>Apple says it&#8217;s opening up Siri to third party manufacturers and their devices, allowing Siri to live on things like ecobee thermostats beginning later this year.</p>
<h2>macOS</h2>

<ul>
<li>The next major release of macOS <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-macos-12-monterey/">will be called <strong>macOS Monterey</strong></a></li>
<li>All of the aforementioned SharePlay stuff — which allows you to watch video and listen to music in sync with friends over FaceTime — is coming to macOS.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/macos-12-monterey-upgrades-continuity-with-universal-control/">Universal control</a>&#8221; will let you use one keyboard/mouse setup to control multiple macs and iPads, automatically recognizing when a new compatible device is placed nearby. Put an iPad next to your Macbook, and bam — it automatically extends, turning the two devices into one big canvas.</li>
<li>Macs are getting AirPlay, allowing you to send AirPlay content to your Mac&#8217;s display like you might an AppleTV.</li>
<li>The &#8220;Shortcuts&#8221; automation system from iOS<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-is-bringing-shortcuts-to-the-mac-and-starts-transition-from-automator/"> is coming to macOS</a>, allowing you to quickly drag-and-drop together scripts to do the things you find yourself doing often. (If you&#8217;re already using macOS&#8217; automator system, it&#8217;ll still be supported for now.)</li>
<li>Safari is getting a UI overhaul; tabs are being made smaller, and they&#8217;re introducing a &#8220;tab groups&#8221; system to keep things organized. Tab groups will automatically sync between iCloud devices.</li>
<li>Public beta in July, full release &#8220;this fall.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dev stuff</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2162545" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-xcode-cloud-4.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></p>
<p>Though its called the Worldwide Developer Conference, Apple tends to keep the keynote focused largely on the consumer-facing stuff and save the most technical bits for the week&#8217;s many breakout sessions. They did touch on a few developer highlights, though, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>New APIs to hook into things like SharePlay, Focus, etc.</li>
<li>iOS is getting a built-in 3D object scanning system that developers can tie into their apps, allowing them to integrate 3D scanning-style functionality without having to reinvent that wheel.</li>
<li>Devs will now be able to build multiple App Store product pages for the same app — with different icons, screenshots, etc — to see which one resonates best.</li>
<li>TestFlight — the service for privately distributing pre-release/beta apps on Apple&#8217;s phone/tablet/watch operating systems — is coming to macOS.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today announced a number of coming changes and improvements to the App Store that will help developers better target their apps to users, get their apps discovered by more people, and even highlight what sort of events are taking place inside their apps to entice new users to download the app and encourage existing users to return.</p>
<p>The company said its App Store today sees 600 million weekly users across 175 countries, and has paid out over $230 billion to developers since the App Store launched, highlighting the business opportunity for app developers.</p>
<p>However, as the App Store has grown, it&#8217;s become harder for app developers to market their apps to new users or get their apps found. The new features aim to address that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2162568" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162568" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2162568" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.41.07-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.41.07-PM.jpg 2720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.41.07-PM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.41.07-PM.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.41.07-PM.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.41.07-PM.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.41.07-PM.jpg?resize=1536,862 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.41.07-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1149 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.41.07-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162568" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>One change involves the app&#8217;s product page. Starting this year, app developers will be able to create multiple custom product pages to showcase different features of their app for different users. For instance, they&#8217;ll be able to try out things like different screenshots, videos, and even different app icons to A/B test what users like the most.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll also be able to advertise the dynamic things that are taking place inside their apps on an ongoing basis. Apple explained that apps and games are constantly rolling out new content and limited time events like film premieres on streaming services, events like Pokémon Go fests, or Nike fitness challenges. But these events were often only discoverable by those who already had the app installed and then opted in to push notifications.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162563" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162563" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2162563" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.42.38-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="373" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.42.38-PM.jpg 2714w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.42.38-PM.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.42.38-PM.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.42.38-PM.jpg?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.42.38-PM.jpg?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.42.38-PM.jpg?resize=1536,843 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.42.38-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1124 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2.42.38-PM.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162563" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Apple will now allow developers to better advertise these events, with the launch in-app events &#8220;front and center on the App Store.&#8221; The events can be showcased on the app&#8217;s product page. Users can learn more about the events, sign up to be notified, or quickly join the event, if it&#8217;s happening now. They can also discover events with personalized recommendations and through App Store search.</p>
<p>App Store editors will curate the best events and the new App Store widget will feature upcoming events right on users&#8217; homescreens, too.</p>
<p>Apple says the feature will be open to all developers, including those who already run events and those who are just getting started.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During the WWDC conference today, Apple unveiled the new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-macos-12-monterey/">macOS 12 Monterey</a>. A major feature in the macOS update is Universal Control, which builds upon the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/23/apple-os-x-yosemite-beta/">Continuity features</a> first introduced in OS X Yosemite. For years, it&#8217;s been possible to open a news article on your iPhone and keep reading it on your MacBook, or to copy and paste a link from your iPad to your iMac. But Universal Control takes these features further.</p>
<p>With Universal Control, you can use a single mouse and keyboard to navigate across multiple Apple devices at once. This functionality works across more than two devices – in the demo video, the feature is used to seamlessly move across an iPad, MacBook, and iMac. Users can drag and drop files across multiple devices at once, making it possible, for example, to use a multi-screen setup while editing video on Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s possible in Universal Control isn&#8217;t necessarily new – this has been made possible before through third party apps. Plus, in 2019, Apple debuted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/28/apples-sidecar-just-really-gets-me-you-know/">Sidecar</a>, which allowed users to connect their iPad as a second monitor for their MacBook or iMac. But, Universal Control improves upon Sidecar – and maybe renders it obsolete – by allowing users to link any Apple devices together, even if it&#8217;s not an iPad. Though this update may not be ground-breaking, it&#8217;s a useful upgrade to existing features.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple didn&#8217;t announce that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts?sref=gni836kR">rumored</a> combined Apple TV device that would combine the set-top box with a HomePod speaker during its WWDC keynote, but it did announce a few features that will improve the Apple TV experience &#8212; including one that involves a HomePod Mini. Starting this fall, Apple said you&#8217;ll be able to select the HomePod Mini as the speaker for your Apple TV 4K. It also introduced a handful of software updates for Apple TV users, including a new way to see shows everyone in the family will like, and support for co-watching shows through FaceTime.</p>
<p>The co-watching feature is actually a part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-facetime-updates-at-wwdc-2021/">larger FaceTime update</a>, which will let users stream music, TV, and screen share through their FaceTime calls. The Apple TV app is one of those that&#8217;s supported through this new system,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-introduces-shareplay-for-co-watching-streaming-and-screen-sharing-over-facetime/"> called SharePlay</a>. It will now include a new &#8220;Shared with You&#8221; row that highlights the shows and movies your friends are sharing, as well.</p>
<p>Another feature called &#8220;For All of You&#8221; will display a collection of shows and movies based on everyone&#8217;s interests within Apple TV&#8217;s interface. This is ideal you&#8217;re planning to watch something as a family &#8212; like for movie night, for example. And you can fine tune the suggestions based on who&#8217;s watching.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A new Apple TV widget is also being made available, which now includes iPad support.</p>
<p>And the new support for HomePod Mini will help deliver &#8220;rich, balanced sound&#8221; and &#8220;crystal clear dialog,&#8221; when you&#8217;re watching Apple TV with the Mii set up as your speakers, Apple said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has announced the next major version of macOS at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/wwdc-2021/">WWDC 2021</a> —&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-macos-12-monterey/">macOS Monterey</a>. Among other features, Apple is going to release Shortcuts on macOS. It’s going to look and work a lot like Shortcuts on iOS and iPadOS.</p>
<p>“The Mac has a long history of automation with command line, shell scripts, Apple scripts and Automator. And on iOS, we&#39;ve made automation even easier with Shortcuts,” SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said. “And this year we&#39;re bringing Shortcuts to the Mac.”</p>
<p>In the new Shortcuts app, you can see a gallery of popular shortcuts. It’s going to be interesting to see what exactly you can trigger with shortcuts, but you can expect to be able to launch apps, create GIFs, send a message, create an email, launch a website, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After that, you can trigger your shortcuts in the right column of the Finder, in the menubar and in Spotlight. You can also trigger them with Siri.</p>
<p>With this announcement, Apple is also setting the stage for the end of Automator. “This is just the start of a multi-year transition Automator will continue to be supported, and you can import Automator workflows into beginning one with shortcuts,” Federighi said.</p>
<p>If you read between the lines, it sounds like Apple doesn’t plan to add new features to Automator. Shortcuts is the future of automation on macOS, iOS and iPadOS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple kicked off its global annual developer conference, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/WWDC-2021/">WWDC</a>, with a ton of new features and technologies. TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/WWDC-2021/">all the coverage here</a> from the keynote. As with previous years, Apple has dropped a number of new security and privacy features.</p>
<h3>New privacy dashboard keeps tabs on app tracking requests</h3>
<p>Apple is bringing a new privacy dashboard to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-ios-15-with-new-features-for-facetime-and-better-notifications/">iOS 15</a> to make it easier to see which apps are collecting your data and when. It&#8217;s a continuation of Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">App Tracking Transparency feature</a> that it rolled out earlier this year to block apps from siphoning off and selling your data to advertisers and data brokers. In iOS 15, you will be able to see which apps you have given permission to access your data — such as your location, microphone, contacts, and photos — and how often it&#8217;s accessed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162495" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162495" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2162495" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="728" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg 2203w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg?resize=768,559 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg?resize=680,495 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg?resize=1536,1118 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg?resize=2048,1490 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/privacy-dashboard.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162495" class="wp-caption-text">(Image: TechCrunch / screenshot)</p></div></p>
<h3>Mail will block invisible email trackers</h3>
<p>Emails are not as private as you might think. Most marketing emails contain hidden pixel-sized images that know when you&#8217;ve opened an email. These trackers also collect information about you, including your IP address, which can be used to infer your location. Some browser extensions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/these-6-browser-extensions-will-immediately-improve-your-privacy-online/">already block</a> these invisible email trackers. But Apple said it&#8217;s bringing privacy features to the Mail app, which will make it more difficult for emails — and ad trackers — from knowing what emails you&#8217;ve opened.</p>
<h3>Siri will process speech on the device</h3>
<p>Siri, Apple&#8217;s voice assistant, requires the internet to work, but will soon work offline. Apple said Siri will soon process speech on the device so that audio never leaves the device. Apple said this will help prevent unwanted audio recording, but will also help make Siri respond to requests faster.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple also has a few new security and privacy features baked into its new iCloud+ premium service, including private relay, which encrypts your Safari internet traffic. As part of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-icloud-with-privacy-focused-features/">new premium iCloud+ service</a>, Apple is also rolling out private relay browsing, which encrypts your Safari traffic and routes it so that it&#8217;s more difficult to track which websites you visit. TechCrunch&#8217;s Romain Dillet has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-icloud-with-privacy-focused-features/">more</a>.</li>
<li>There are plenty of authenticator apps, like Authy and Duo, which let you generate stronger two-factor codes for your online accounts than codes sent by text message. iOS 15 also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-built-in-password-authenticator/">bakes in</a> its own authenticator for the first time.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The past year has seen some of the most dramatic updates to Macs in recent memory. At last year’s WWDC, Apple announced its long-awaited move from Intel chip’s to its own first party silicon. By the end of the year, the company launched the first three M1 Macs, along with Big Sur, one of the biggest updates to macOS.</p>
<p>At this morning’s kickoff to WWDC, the company unveiled macOS 12 &#8212; named, you guessed it, Monterey. Universal Control is the top line new feature here, which further bridges the gap between desktop and tablet. Sticking the iPad next to a Mac, you can move the cursor between devices using the same trackpad and keyboard. The feature works on up to three devices at once.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2162507" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-shortcuts-automator.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AirPlay to Mac also let&#8217;s you cast content directly to your big desktop screen &#8212; that&#8217;s nice for weirdos like me who don&#8217;t have a TV. Shortcuts are also now available on macOS, allowing for simpler automation that the existing Automator. Users will be able to import Automator workflows directly to the desktop version of the popular mobile app. It will be a multi-year transition, but rip Automator &#8212; you will be missed (kind of). Shortcuts will be coming to Siri, Spotlight, the menu bar and Finder to start.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2162516" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-macOS-safari-url.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Safari is getting some updates, of course. The biggest piece of news on the browser front is the arrival of Tab Groups &#8212; which is more or less as it sounds. Users can group tabs into bundles, which can be shared with other users. That&#8217;s a lot of content and will probably require a rethink of many users workflows. But at least the tab bar itself is getting cleaner and more streamlined.</p>
<p>Also new are desktop extensions that can now be with iOS and iPadOS. Desktops also now support Spatial Audio on the AirPods Pro, LaunchPad now features a games folder to get that content all in one place and Memojis can be displayed on the login screen.</p>
<p>Some nice additions, but as expect, Monterey doesn&#8217;t represent as big an update as Big Sur. There are some nice new features here, but it seems likely that much of the big news is happening under the hood, as the company continues to refine the Apple Silicon experience across its new systems.</p>
<p>Public beta will go live next month. Monterey will be available for all users this fall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You weren’t expecting to make it through this year’s WWDC without some big watchOS news, were you? Apple’s wearable isn’t quite doing iPhone numbers, but Watch has been massively successful for the company, utterly dominating the smartwatch market.</p>
<p>Surprising absolutely no one, the company is taking a more focused approach to mindfulness. Apple&#8217;s not ready to kill Calm or Headspace just yet, but the popular breathe feature is getting a much needed upgrade with new animations reminding users to reflect and be more mindful.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2162465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-watchos-watch-face-photo-wrist.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Also new is respiratory tracking, which thus far had been more of a background feature. It&#8217;s being surfaced in the watchOS experience, for tracking over time and more notifications.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be a watchOS update without some new faces, of course. Here the company is adding a portrait mode to faces to offer more depth for shots as the lock screen. The Watch Photos app is getting a new layout, as well, along with the share images from the watch to first-party apps like Mail and Messages.</p>
<p>Fitness+ is getting a bunch of new content, as well, including artist musical spotlights for workouts including Alicia Keys, Lady Gaga and Keith Urban. Tai chi and pilates are also being added to the list of workouts tracked by the wearable.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least for many, watchOS is also getting GIF support. Public beta will go live next month. watchOS 8 will be available for all users this fall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is rolling out some updates to iCloud under the name iCloud+. The company is announcing those features at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/wwdc-2021/">its developer conference</a>. Existing paid iCloud users are going to get those iCloud+ features for the same monthly subscription price.</p>
<p>In Safari, Apple is going to launch a new privacy feature called Private Relay. It sounds a bit like the new DNS feature that Apple has been developing with Cloudflare. Originally named <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cloudflare-and-apple-design-a-new-privacy-friendly-internet-protocol/">Oblivious DNS-over-HTTPS</a>, Private Relay could be a better name for something quite simple — a combination of DNS-over-HTTPS with proxy servers.</p>
<p>When Private Relay is turned on, nobody can track your browsing history — not your internet service provider, anyone standing in the middle of your request between your device and the server you’re requesting information from. We’ll have to wait a bit to learn more about how it works exactly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wy0M0eyAvo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cloudflare-and-apple-design-a-new-privacy-friendly-internet-protocol/">Cloudflare and Apple design a new privacy-friendly internet protocol</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cloudflare and Apple design a new privacy-friendly internet protocol&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cloudflare-and-apple-design-a-new-privacy-friendly-internet-protocol/embed/#?secret=wy0M0eyAvo" data-secret="wy0M0eyAvo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The second iCloud+ feature is ‘Hide my email’. It lets you generate random email addresses when you sign up to a newsletter or when you create an account on a website. If you’ve used ‘Sign in with Apple’, you know that Apple offers you the option to use fake iCloud email addresses. This works similarly, but for any app.</p>
<p>Finally, Apple is overhauling HomeKit Secure Video. With the name iCloud+, Apple is separating free iCloud users from paid iCloud users. Basically, you used to pay for more storage. Now, you pay for more storage <em>and</em> more features. Subscriptions start at $0.99 per month for 50GB (and iCloud+ features).</p>

<p>More generally, Apple is adding two much needed to iCloud accounts. Now, you can add a friend for account recovery. This way, you can request access to your data to your friend. But that doesn’t mean that your friend can access your iCloud data — it’s just a way to recover your account.</p>
<p>The last much-needed update is a legacy feature. You’ll soon be able to add one or several legacy contacts. Data can be passed along when you pass away. And this is a much needed feature as many photo libraries become inaccessible when someone close to you passes away.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today introduced the next version iPadOS, with more widgets and a better multitasking system. The announcement was by Apple SVP Craig Federighi at Apple&#8217;s annual developer&#8217;s conference, WWDC 21. The features announced today are welcomed updates, but fall short of the major rework the iPad sorely deserves. The new iPad features come in addition to the bevy of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-refines-ios-15-notifications-with-focus-summary-features/">features and updates found in iOS 15</a>, which were also announced today.</p>
<p>&#8220;With iPadOS, we [want to] build distinct capabilities making it possible for the iPad to become whatever you need it to be,&#8221; said Apple SVP Craig Federighi in a prerecorded video.</p>
<p>iPadOS 15 retains the overall look and feel of the current iPad operating system. The updates in the new OS are mostly centered around multitasking. The iPad&#8217;s widget support gets a big update with iPadOS 15. The widgets are larger, more immersive and dynamic. And, iOS&#8217;s App Library is finally available on the iPad, where it tweaks the overall user experience. The feature, added to the iPhone in 2020, presents the user with an organized view of the apps on the iPad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2162378 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-ipadOS-15-multitasking-shelf.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px" />Also added to iPadOS 15 is a new multitasking system. Called Split View, a drop-down menu at the top of the screen unlocks several multitasking, multiwindow options. The system seems much smoother than the current multiscreen option on iPad OS, which is clunky and hidden. With Split View a feature called Shelf makes it easy to switch between different screens and screen grouping.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2162384" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.45.45-PM.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.45.45-PM.jpg 1528w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.45.45-PM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.45.45-PM.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.45.45-PM.jpg?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.45.45-PM.jpg?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Apple-WWDC-2021-2021-06-07-at-1.45.45-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />These new multitasking features will help our users be more productive, and do even more on their iPad,&#8221; said Federighi. &#8220;And what&#8217;s really cool is we now have a new set of keyboard shortcuts that let you do all of this without lifting a finger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple updated the note taking system in iPad OS to better take advantage of the iPad&#8217;s large screen. One new feature, called Quick Notes, allows users to float a note-taking window anywhere over another app. That way, a user can take notes without having to switch between apps. This feature is separate from Split View, showing Apple is slowly (and finally) embracing a desktop experience.</p>
<p>In addition, iPadOS 15 sports a new version of Swift Playgrounds that allows users to learn, build and submit iPad and iPhone apps to the App Store. This represents a large step forward in Apple&#8217;s app development world. Now, a user can learn Swift and submit apps without the need of a Mac.</p>
<p>These features come just weeks after Apple started selling its more powerful iPad, yet with many tech pundits calling on Apple to update the iPad&#8217;s operating system to better match the potential of the new hardware; iPadOS 15 is the evolution of the iPad, not the revolution many want.</p>

Captive audience!). So today during WWDC it was great to see Apple finally giving its own native weather app some love with a significant update.</p>
<p>Possibly its biggest since long ago <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/22/why-apple-dropped-yahoo-for-its-weather-app-in-ios-8/#:~:text=But%20the%20Weather%20Channel%20wasn,the%20future%2C%20directly%20to%20Apple." target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropping Yahoo for Weather Channel as its key data provider</a>?</p>
<p>The company has completely refreshed the interface with an animated layout that reflects what state the weather happens to be in at the moment and place you are searching, similar to what Apple displayed in its last update but significant more dynamic, with more wind, rain, sun and smog (sorry). There are now thousands of variations that Apple says more accurately represent sun position, clouds and rain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

Graphics now include wind, UV index and barometric pressure. Alongside this you now get full-screen weather maps, high resolution images that animate the progress of rain and clouds, air quality, and temperature &#8212; sort of like your own personal weather assistant.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2162387" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-weather-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Some of this has been a long time coming but also unsurprising, and not just because of how perennially popular weather apps are.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/apple-acquires-dark-sky-android-version-shutting-down-in-july/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 2020</a>, it emerged that Apple made a key acquisition of a weather app startup, Dark Sky, easily one of the best weather apps on iOS and Android before Apple shut it down.</p>
<p>Again, given how surprisingly neglected weather apps tend to be, especially considering how passively popular they are, it was possibly always a low bar that was going to be bettered by someone. But Dark Sky, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/27/dark-sky-is-ready-to-be-the-default-weather-app-on-your-iphones-homescreen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began as a Kickstarter of all things</a>, really did the effort justice.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why it too so long for Apple to make it rain on its weather app after that acquisition, but it&#8217;s good that it finally has.</p>
<p>Of course Apple&#8217;s still not magical enough to bring you guaranteed sunshine for that camping weekend you have coming up, but the update will mean that the data nerds among us might have a lot more fun figuring out what will happen next, and hopefully get a more accurate picture of the details that will help you decide whether you absolutely have to make room for wellies in the car or not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.br.iq/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briq</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which has developed a fintech platform used by the construction industry, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has raised $30 million in a Series B funding round led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing is among the largest Series B fundraises by a construction software startup, according to the company, and brings Briq’s total raised to $43 million since its January 2018 inception. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Eniac Ventures and Blackhorn Ventures also participated in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briq CEO and co-founder Bassem Hamdy is a former executive at construction tech giant Procore (which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/investors-help-procore-build-a-decacorn-valuation-in-public-debut/">went public</a> and has a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> market cap of $10.4 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and Canadian software giant CMiC. Wall Street veteran Ron Goldshmidt is co-founder and COO.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briq describes its offering as a financial planning and workflow automation platform that “drastically reduces” the time to run critical financial processes, while increasing the accuracy of forecasts and financial plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briq has developed a toolbox of proprietary technology that it says allows it to extract and manipulate financial data without the use of APIs. It also has developed construction-specific data models that allows it to build out projections and create models of how much a project might cost, and how much could conceivably be made. Currently, Briq manages or forecasts about $30 billion in construction volume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Briq has two main offerings: Briq&#8217;s Corporate Performance Management (CPM) platform, which models financial outcomes at the project and corporate level, and</span> <a href="https://www.constructiondive.com/news/briq-launches-first-payment-rewards-card-for-construction/598403/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BriqCash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a construction-specific banking platform for managing invoices and payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Briq aims to allow contractors “to go from plan to pay” in one platform with the goal of solving the age-old problem of construction projects (very often) going over budget. Its longer-term, ambitious mission is to “manage 80% of the money workflows in construction within 10 years.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Construction tech startups are poised to shake up a $1.3-trillion-dollar industry&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/construction-tech-startups-are-poised-to-shake-up-a-1-3-trillion-dollar-industry/embed/#?secret=BsQWP5ATtI" data-secret="BsQWP5ATtI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s strategy, so far, seems to be working.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From January 2020 to today, ARR has climbed by 200%, according to Hamdy. Briq currently has about 100 employees, compared to 35 a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briq has 150 customers, and serves general and specialty contractors from $10 million to $1 billion in revenue. They include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cafco Construction Management, WestCor Companies and Choate Construction and Harper Construction. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is currently focused on contractors in North America but does have long-term plans to address larger international markets, Hamdy told TechCrunch.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some context</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamdy came up with the idea for Santa Barbara, California-based Briq after realizing the vast amount of inefficiencies on the financial side of the construction industry. His goal was to do for construction financials what Procore did to document management, and PlanGrid to construction drawing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He started Briq with his own cash, amassed through secondary sales as Procore climbed the ranks of startups to become a construction industry unicorn.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2161794" style="width: 515px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161794" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2161794" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="505" height="303" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg 2374w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?resize=680,407 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?resize=1536,920 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?resize=2048,1227 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bassem-Headshot.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2161794" class="wp-caption-text">Briq CEO and co-founder Bassem Hamdy. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Briq</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wanted to figure out how to bring the best of fintech into a construction industry that really guesses every month what the financial outcomes are for projects,” Hamdy told me at the time of the company’s last raise &#8212; a $10 million Series A led by Blackhorn Ventures announced in May of 2020. “Getting a handle on financial outcomes is really hard. The vast majority of the time, the forecasted cost to completion is plain wrong. By a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, according to </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Capital%20Projects%20and%20Infrastructure/Our%20Insights/The%20next%20normal%20in%20construction/The-next-normal-in-construction.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">McKinsey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an astounding 80% of projects run over budget, resulting in significant waste and profit loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So at the end of a project, contractors often find themselves having doled out more money and resources than originally planned. This can lead to negative cash flow and profit loss. Briq’s platform aims to help contractors identify outliers, and which projects are more at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Briq has proven to be “extremely valuable” to contractors, Hamdy said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In an industry where margins are so thin, we have given contractors the ability to truly understand where they stand on cash, profit and labor,” he added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Among many updates coming to iOS 15, Apple Maps will receive a number of upgrades that will bring more detailed maps, improvements for transit riders, AR experiences and other changes to the platform. The improvements build on the new map Apple began rolling out two years ago, which had focused on offering richer details, and &#8212; in response to user feedback and complaints &#8212; more accurate navigation.</p>
<p>Since then, Apple Maps has steadily improved.</p>
<p>The new map experience has since launched in the U.S., U.K., Ireland and Canada and will now make its way to Spain and Portugal, starting today. It will then arrive in Italy and Australia later this year, Apple announced during its keynote address during its Worldwide Developer Conference on Monday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2162335" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162335" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2162335" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?w=680" alt="maps driving" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wwdc-2021-maps-driving-.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162335" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, Apple said iOS 15 Maps will include new details for commercial districts, marinas, buildings and more. Plus, Apple has added things like elevation, new road colors and labels, as well as hundreds of custom designed landmarks &#8212; for example, for places like the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
<p>Apple also built a new nighttime mode for Maps with a &#8220;moonlit glow,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>For drivers, Apple added new road details to the map, so it can help drivers as they move throughout a city to better see and understand important things like turn lanes, medians, bus and taxi lanes and other things. The changes are competitive with some of the updates Google has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/google-maps-adds-street-level-details-in-select-cities-more-colorful-imagery-worldwide/">making to its own Google Maps platform</a>, which brought street-level details in select cities. These allowed people &#8212; including those navigating on foot, in a wheelchair, on a bike or on a scooter, for example &#8212; to better see things like sidewalks and intersections.</p>
<p>Apple is now catching up, saying it, too, will show features like crosswalks and bike lanes.</p>
<p>It will also render things like overlapping complex interchanges in 3D space, making it easier to see upcoming traffic conditions or what lane to take. These features will come to CarPlay later in the year.</p>

<p>For transit riders, meanwhile, Maps has made improvements to help users find nearby stations.</p>
<p>Users can now pin their favorite lines to the top, and even keep track on their Apple Watch so they don&#8217;t have to pull out their phone. The updated Maps app will automatically follow your transit route and notify you when it&#8217;s time to disembark, making the app more competitive to third-party apps often favored by transit takers, like Citymapper, for instance.</p>

<p>When you exit your station, you can also now hold up your iPhone to scan the buildings in the area and Maps will generate an accurate position, offering direction in augmented reality. This is similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-maps-gets-improved-live-view-ar-directions/">the Live View AR directions Google announced</a> last year.</p>
<p>This feature is launching in select cities in 2021 with more to come in the year ahead, Apple said.</p>
