										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been an eventful fall for <a href="https://www.getperigee.com/">Perigee</a> CEO and founder Mollie Breen. The former NSA employee participated in the TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield in September, and she just closed her first seed round on Thanksgiving, giving her a $1.5 million runway to begin building the company.</p>
<p>Outsiders Fund led the round with participation from Westport, Contour Venture Partners, BBG Ventures, Innospark Ventures and a couple of individual investors.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/perigee" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="perigee">Perigee <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wants to secure areas of the company like HVAC systems or elevators that may interact with the company&#8217;s network, but which often fall outside of the typical network security monitoring purview. Breen says the company&#8217;s value proposition is about bridging the gap between network security and operations security. She said this has been a security blind spot for companies, often caught between these two teams. Perigee provides a set of analytics that gives the security team visibility into this vulnerable area.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Breen explained when we spoke in September <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/perigee-infrastructure-security-solution-from-former-nsa-employee-moves-into-public-beta/">around her Battlefield turn</a>, the solution learns normal behavior from the operations systems as it interacts with the network, collecting data like what systems and individuals normally access it. It can then determine when something seems off and cut off an anomalous act, which may be indicative of hacker activity, before it reaches the network.</p>
<p>She says that as a female founder getting funding, she is acutely aware how rare that is, and part of the reason she wanted to publicize this funding round was to show other women who are thinking about starting a company that it&#8217;s possible, even if it remains difficult.</p>
<p>She plans to grow the company to about six people in the next 12 months, and Breen says that she thinks deeply about how to build a diverse organization. She says that starts with her investors, and includes considering diversity in terms of gender, race and age. She believes that it&#8217;s crucial to start with the earliest employees, and she actively recruits diverse candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;I write a lot of cold emails, particularly around hiring and that&#8217;s partly because with job listings it&#8217;s all inbound and you can&#8217;t necessarily guarantee that that is going to be diverse. And so by writing cold emails and really following up with those people and having those conversations, I have found a way of actually making sure that I&#8217;m talking to people from different perspectives,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As she looks ahead to 2021, she&#8217;s thinking about the best approach to office versus remote and she says it will probably be mostly remote with some in-person. &#8220;I&#8217;m really balancing at this point in time, how do we really make the connections, and make them strong and genuine with a lot of trust and do that with balancing some elements of remote, knowing that is where the industry is going and if you&#8217;re going to be a company and in a post-2020 world, you probably need to adopt to some element of remote working,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Royalties aside, songwriters are often unsung heroes of music making. Sure, some &#8212; like Carole King and Jimmy Webb &#8212; become well-known in their own right, but more often than not, names are relegated to the liner notes.</p>
<p>A new feature in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="spotify">Spotify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> seeks to correct that &#8212; or at least offers listeners a way to take deeper dives into the catalogues of the people behind their favorite songs. Songwriter Hub is a new offering that aggregates information about some of the industry’s biggest and most prolific songwriters. Some are big names in their own right. Others not so much.</p>
<p>Accessible via the Browse tab, the Hub features songwriter playlists, podcasts and devoted songwriter pages. That last bit includes the likes of Gregg Wattenberg, Ant Clemons, Noonie Bao, Sia, Bebe Rexha, Irving Berlin, Ashley Gorley, Meghan Trainor, Fraser T Smith, Missy Elliott, Teddy Geiger, Ben Billions and Justin Tranter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Having a hub for songwriters is extremely important because people need to know who these people are who are helping create the soundtrack to our lives,” Ariana Grande/Cardi B/Meek Mill writer Nija says in a press release tied to the news. “Songwriters deserve to be praised for their contributions just as much as artists &amp; producers. A lot of times we get the short end of the stick, so I’m glad that there’s a place where people can see who’s writing their favorite songs.”</p>
<p>The feature arrives today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adobe is launching <a href="https://blog.adobespark.com/2020/12/17/introducing-thousands-of-design-assets-for-every-mood">an update</a> to its <a href="https://spark.adobe.com/">Spark social media design tool</a> today that will bring more than 10,000 new design assets to the service. This update, which follows the launch of animations in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/adobe-spark-adds-support-for-animations-to-its-social-media-graphics-tool/">Spark in September</a>, also brings a small UI change with it to accommodate this new feature, but for the most part, you can think of design assets as an extension to what a lot of users were already doing with icons in Spark.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088336" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088336" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2088336" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AR_asset1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2088336" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;For our users, who are everyday entrepreneurs and marketers, they want to create professional-looking content &#8212; and they certainly don&#8217;t have design experience,&#8221; Adobe Spark product manager Justin Church told me. &#8220;The rollout of these tens of thousands of new design assets that we&#8217;re coming up with will really empower them to create standout social posts and things like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> stories that are more original and creative than they&#8217;ve ever been able to so far.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Church noted, a lot of users opt for working with Spark&#8217;s templates to get started, but there&#8217;s also a large set of users who start from scratch and they will especially benefit from the ability to quickly pull in frames, illustrations, brushes and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088299" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/adobe_spark_design_assets.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088299" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2088299" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/adobe_spark_design_assets.gif" alt="" width="800" height="800" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2088299" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p>
<p>Adobe has a large in-house content design team that designed some of its own assets and curated others from outside resources. Those assets were all tagged, to make them discoverable, which now makes it easy to find them in Spark&#8217;s search feature. As of now, these results are not personalized yet &#8212; or set to match with what&#8217;s already in your current design &#8212; but the team is exploring how to use AI to help users find the right assets for their specific designs.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, given the broad range of users, Adobe opted for a very broad range of assets (and styles) with which to start. The plan is to expand this set of assets over time, of course, and the team will look closely at which categories are popular, but the company also plans to release new assets in time for specific holidays and around special events.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The new capital means that Oscar has raised what would be the equivalent of $1 million a day for the entirety of 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company&#8217;s last funding round, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/oscars-health-insurance-platform-nabs-another-225-million/">a $225 million haul</a>, came just a few short months ago in June.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p dir="ltr">Given the list of investors in the round, which was led by Tiger Global Management and includes Dragoneer, Baillie Gifford, Coatue, Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, Lakestar and Reinvent; it&#8217;s likely going to be one of the last times the company taps private markets before an eventual public offering.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Since 2017, Oscar has seen annualized membership growth of more than 70%,” said Mario Schlosser, co-founder and chief executive of Oscar, in a statement. “As we continue to rapidly scale our business, this capital will help us deliver on our commitment to bring accessible and affordable care to even more Oscar members across the country.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Heading into the new year, the company said it will be available in 18 states and 286 counties across its Individual and Family Plans, Medicare Advantage and Small group products. As of September 30, 2020, Oscar had approximately 420,000 members across 15 states, the company said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oscar was one of the first insurers to offer virtual care services (launching the practice as early as 2014). Now nearly half of all Oscar member visits to a primary care practitioner are made with an Oscar-recommended doctor. Roughly 38% of the company&#8217;s subscribing members who have one or more medical visits use the company&#8217;s virtual care services, Oscar said.</p>

<p>The SEC also said that the well-funded unicorn &#8220;falsely claimed in a website FAQ between October 2018 and June 2019 that its execution quality matched or beat that of its competitors,&#8221; when it reality it was executing customer trades at &#8220;inferior trade prices that in aggregate deprived customers of $34.1 million even after taking into account the savings from not paying a commission.&#8221;</p>

<p>TechCrunch has covered Robinhood&#8217;s payment for order flow incomes in recent quarters, as the company has scaled both its userbase and trading volumes, generating growing revenue from how its customer orders are executed.</p>
<p>In Q2 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/robinhoods-q2-revenue-appears-to-soar/">for example</a>, Robinhood&#8217;s revenues from payment for order flow sources doubled to around $180 million from a Q1 2020 result of around $90 million. Of course, those numbers come several years after the quarters noted in the settlement announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong><em> It&#8217;s worth noting that the SEC news comes less than a day after the Massachusetts Securities Division filed a complaint against Robinhood, alleging that it &#8220;engaged in acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations by aggressively marketing itself to Mass investors without regard for the best interests of its customers and failing to maintain the infrastructure and procedures necessary to meet the demands of its rapidly growing customer base.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>The state is seeking censure of Robinhood, improvement to its governance, along with monetary restitution and other financial penalties. The Massachusetts complaint can be read <a href="https://www.sec.state.ma.us/sct/current/sctrobinhood/MSD-Robinhood-Financial-LLC-Complaint-E-2020-0047.pdf">here</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Impacts</h2>
<p>Robinhood has had an explosive, if occasionally rocky year. The company has had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/robinhood-etrade-down-stocks-soar/">bouts of downtime</a> during key market moments, had to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/amidst-robinhoods-planned-service-changes-a-tension-between-growth-and-safety/">reform its options-trading service after the suicide of a user</a>, and has seen growth from its incomes from order flow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/">slow</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lC0wETHX1a"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/robinhoods-q2-revenue-appears-to-soar/">Robinhood&#8217;s Q2 soars</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Robinhood&#8217;s Q2 soars&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/robinhoods-q2-revenue-appears-to-soar/embed/#?secret=lC0wETHX1a" data-secret="lC0wETHX1a" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But despite those matters, the company&#8217;s 2020 trajectory has been little short of impressive. Its rapid revenue helped the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/how-robinhood-and-chime-raised-2b-in-the-last-year/">raise hundreds of millions of dollars this year</a> at expanding valuations, and made Robinhood a 2021 IPO candidate.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine that today&#8217;s news will fuly derail Robinhood&#8217;s growth; if the charges had dealt with a historical period more close to the current day, perhaps the impact would be larger. Robinhood&#8217;s competitors &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/social-stock-trading-services-public-raises-65m-series-c/">Public.com raised $65 million the other day</a> &#8212; could capitalize on the news.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canoo, </span>the Los Angeles-based electric vehicle startup that will make its debut later this month on the Nasdaq as a publicly traded company, revealed Thursday an <span style="font-weight: 400;">all-electric multi-purpose delivery vehicle. </span></p>
<p>The electric delivery vehicle, which includes a high roof height, storage lockers and a software as a service platform to manage fleets, is targeted at<span style="font-weight: 400;"> both small businesses and large last-mile delivery companies such as package delivery fleets, retailers, major corporations and logistics companies.</span></p>
<p>This latest vehicle — its second to debut since 2019 — aims to showcase <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/canoo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="canoo">Canoo&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> flexibility and its intent to produce products for consumers and business-to-business applications. All of Canoo&#8217;s vehicles share that same underlying architecture; it&#8217;s the cabins, or top hats, that differ.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other variations of the multi-purpose delivery vehicle will follow, and Canoo plans to announce a service network at a later date.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088546" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Canoo_MPDV_Exterior_13.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088546" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2088546 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Canoo_MPDV_Exterior_13.jpg" alt="Canoo delivery vehicle" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Canoo_MPDV_Exterior_13.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Canoo_MPDV_Exterior_13.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Canoo_MPDV_Exterior_13.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Canoo_MPDV_Exterior_13.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Canoo_MPDV_Exterior_13.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Canoo_MPDV_Exterior_13.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Canoo_MPDV_Exterior_13.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2088546" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canoo</p></div></p>
<p>Canoo started as Evelozcity in 2017, founded by former Faraday Future executives <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/stefan-krause" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="person" data-entity="stefan-krause">Stefan Krause </a> and Ulrich Kranz. The company rebranded as Canoo in spring 2019 and debuted its first vehicle several months later. It was this first vehicle, as well as Canoo&#8217;s plan to offer it only as a subscription, that captured the attention of investors, companies and the media.</p>
<p>The first vehicle, which looks more like a microbus than a traditional electric SUV, is the “skateboard” architecture that houses the batteries and the electric drivetrain in a chassis underneath the vehicle’s cabin. That architecture caught Hyundai’s interest earlier this year. The Korean automaker announced in February plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/hyundai-taps-ev-startup-canoo-to-develop-electric-vehicles/">jointly develop an electric vehicle platform</a> with Canoo, based on the startup’s proprietary skateboard design. The platform will be used for future Hyundai and Kia electric vehicles as well as the automaker group’s so-called “purpose-built vehicles.” The PBV, which Hyundai showcased at CES 2020, is a pod-like vehicle that the company says can be used for various functions in transit, such as a restaurant or clinic.</p>
<p>This new delivery vehicle <span style="font-weight: 400;">will be offered initially in two sizes. Canoo said more variants will follow and that major corporations — or presumably whatever company is willing to put up the money — will have the option to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-develop a custom vehicle with Canoo to meet their specific requirements.</span></p>
<p>The electric delivery vehicle will start at about $33,000. Future customers will have to wait though. Canoo said <span style="font-weight: 400;">availability will begin in 2022, with scaled production and launch planned for 2023. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers can pre-order the multi-purpose delivery vehicle for a refundable deposit of $100 per vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following its U.S. commercial debut, Canoo said it plans to launch the multi-purpose delivery vehicle in other markets such as Canada, Mexico and Europe.</span></p>
<p>The delivery vehicle was designed <span style="font-weight: 400;">with the ergonomics of the driver in mind and with attention to detail to help them be happier and more productive at work, according to Canoo Executive Chairman Tony Aquila, who added that the vehicle is affordable and offers greater cargo capacity than the current electric delivery offerings in its class. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We aim to lower the total cost of ownership and increase return on investment for everyone from local small business owners to large fleets,&#8221; Aquila said in a statement. </span></p>
<p>Indeed, Canoo is promising returns to companies that order one of its delivery vehicles, claiming that customers can<span style="font-weight: 400;"> achieve between $50,000 to $80,000 improvement on return on capital over six to seven years, depending on the use case, as compared to other top selling delivery vehicles.</span></p>
<p>Canoo also pushes the flexibility of its delivery vehicle, noting that it can be built with different workstations, will be offered in several different battery pack sizes that range between <span style="font-weight: 400;">40 and 80 kilowatt-hours, </span>and have <span style="font-weight: 400;">a bi-directional onboard charger, which can be used to power equipment and tools. </span></p>
<p>Canoo also touted the tech in the vehicle, notably an advanced driver assistance system, over-the-air software updates and a <span style="font-weight: 400;">software-as-a-service platform to help fleets manage assets, route plan, run diagnostics and support drivers. </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Stripe recently made headlines with its entrance into the banking world with Stripe Treasury. The news follows Google’s banking and payments announcement along with IPO bound companies such as Airbnb, DoorDash and Affirm all mentioning “financial services” in S-1 filings &#8212; a clear signal of how the sector will continue to stay red hot for the coming years.</p>
<p>What do all of these companies have in common? The subtle, almost unnoticeable, embedding of financial services. There has been an influx of new <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aax-b20d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aax-b20d">fintechs <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> democratizing how to embed financial services across the spectrum, from investing, insurance, lending to banking. While many of these companies are in their nascent stages, they are achieving increasingly high valuations. Why?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The ability to be at the right place at the right time, supporting consumers and merchants alike, where they want, how they want it and when they want it — cannot be understated.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Because today, customers yearn for greater personalization and less friction while brands are looking for ways to improve monetization seamlessly. The ability to be at the right place at the right time, supporting consumers and merchants alike, where they want, how they want it and when they want it — cannot be understated.</p>
<p>At the heart of embedded finance is the benefit of enabling any brand or merchant to rapidly, and at low cost, integrate innovative financial services into new propositions and customer experiences. To avoid developing noncore product additions in-house, companies will look to “building blocks” (or <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/api-755a" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="api-755a">APIs) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to take advantage of the big opportunity to extend customer lifetime value and address a wider variety of needs in one place.</p>
<p>This holds true for startups, digitally native brands and established brands, online and offline. For fledgling fintech startups or brands that want to provide financial services to their customers, working with APIs are often a no-brainer given the costs associated with building integrations in-house.</p>
<p>But imagine if you are a global airline company and the benefit of not having to staff a know-your-customer compliance or fraud detection team. Or for lenders who can minimize risk and increase speed by not having to request a pay stub or personal information verification?</p>
<p>The end goal is to earn and build customer loyalty while generating new revenue streams. Historically, established brands have been served by banks with co-branded and &#8220;affinity&#8221; programs or partnerships. But this &#8220;offline&#8221; model is usually white-label or very &#8220;human-in-the-loop&#8221; with limited and inflexible capabilities. However, APIs can change this — a great example is Starbucks Rewards, heralded as a successful case of data, rewards and loyalty. No longer are brands just reselling leads, businesses can now directly participate in the product and distribution to improve margins.</p>
<p>Today, embedded finance is being used in a variety of ways: In the product (e.g., Tesla’s insurance offering), in distribution channels (e.g., a startup selling insurance during car purchases), and in the technology layer (or building blocks) to improve the overall functionality (e.g., a lender leveraging a data API for instant underwriting).</p>
<p>We typically separate building blocks into two buckets: providers (&#8220;plug and play&#8221; applications) and enablers (those that help financial services to be offered).</p>

<p>There are many new entrants and it’s not one size fits all. Some have data advantages, some distribution while some enable new greenfield opportunities via delivery of the customer experience. While these &#8220;digital wrappers&#8221; around financial services infrastructure seem to be working, the question remains &#8212; who will become a market leader? Do enablers eventually become providers?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new startup called <a href="https://www.gawq.com/">Gawq</a> wants to tackle the problem of fake news and the &#8220;echo chamber&#8221; problem created by social media, where our view of the world is shaped by manipulative algorithms and personalized feeds. Through Gawq&#8217;s newly launched mobile news app, it aims to present news from a range of sources, while allowing users to filter between news, opinion, paid content, and more, as well as compare sources, check facts, and even review the publication&#8217;s content for accuracy.</p>
<p>The idea for Gawq comes from Joshua Dziabiak, co-founder and now board member at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/the-zebra-reaches-100m-run-rate-turns-profitable-as-insurtech-booms/">now profitable insurance tech startup The Zebra</a>. Dziabiak stepped down from his day-to-day role this March, and founded Gawq shortly after.</p>
<p>&#8220;It started as a passion project and then it transformed into a business,&#8221; Dziabiak explains. &#8220;I wanted to do something that had a larger social impact. And this idea &#8212; this problem &#8212; has surfaced and been magnified in really big ways over the past year, especially,&#8221; he says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When news is served up through social media channels, people are presented with their own version of reality, as the algorithms begin to filter out the news that doesn&#8217;t engage them and show them more of what does. Over time, this system led some publishers to pursue clicks and outrage with over-the-top, sensational headlines, but it also spawned a network of publications that would slant and bias the news in ways that better connected them with an either right- or left-leaning audience.</p>
<p>As a result, the media environment overall began to center itself around eyeballs and not necessarily news quality, Dziabiak says. While there is still quality journalism being created, it can sometimes be hard to find among all the noise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe journalists and content creators need a new measure for success. One that is based on the core ethics of journalism, and not the number of clicks or shares,&#8221; Dziabiak notes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088148" style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088148" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2088148" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Headlines.png?w=336" alt="" width="336" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Headlines.png 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Headlines.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Headlines.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Headlines.png?resize=336,680 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Headlines.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088148" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gawq</p></div></p>
<p>The Gawq name is meant to be a reminder of how today&#8217;s headlines often scream for our attention. But it misses the mark for an app about news accuracy. At its core, Gawq is a news aggregator where you are not meant to &#8220;gawk&#8221; at headlines, but actually read and consider the news with a more critical eye.</p>
<p>At launch, the app organizes over 150 different top media sources of all types and sizes, including those that lean one way or the other. The publishers cover topics like U.S. and world news, politics, sports, business, tech, entertainment, science, lifestyle news, and more.</p>
<p>Gawq also organizes the day&#8217;s news without using any sort of algorithms or personalization engines, but instead by topic. As you read, you click to compare coverage of the story with other sources to get a better idea of how different outlets are writing about the same topic. With a clever red and blue slider bar at the top of the screen, you can drag your finger over to the red side to see the coverage from right-leaning sources, or you can drag it to the blue side to see the more left-leaning coverage.</p>
<p>The company says it uses data from three different nonprofits who audit media &#8212; <a href="https://allsides.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://allsides.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608230325669000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHrDhcWMqJ3xWYIXv3q-60ykFgs9g">AllSides</a>, <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608230325669000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHler-diWLauaCEqdyKX8yODQQR6Q">Media Bias Fact Check</a>, and <a href="https://adfontesmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://adfontesmedia.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608230325669000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqKv2YDOhK6IBKiGWtmLBv9w3QkA">Ad Fontes Media</a> &#8212;  to determine if sources are &#8220;right&#8221; or &#8220;left.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088147" style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088147" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2088147" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Compare-Coverage.png?w=336" alt="" width="336" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Compare-Coverage.png 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Compare-Coverage.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Compare-Coverage.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Compare-Coverage.png?resize=336,680 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Compare-Coverage.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088147" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gawq</p></div></p>
<p>Just below the slider bar are the related fact checks to the topic at hand, for easy reference.</p>
<p>While Gawq will allow users to toggle some news sources on or off within the app&#8217;s settings, it uses language that deters you from doing so by reminding you that it works best when you maintain a &#8220;diverse set of media.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, Gawq introduces a &#8220;smart labels&#8221; feature to automatically identify and tag non-news &#8212; like op-ed&#8217;s, sponsored content, or even celeb gossip, if you hate that sort of thing. You can toggle these on or off, too, if you want to hide anything that&#8217;s not hard news.</p>
<p>Another nice feature &#8212; for the news consumer at least, if not the publisher &#8212; is that Gawq loads articles by default into a &#8220;reader mode&#8221; that strips the ads and distractions that tend to fill the pages on news websites these days. You can still click to view the article on the website, if you prefer.</p>
<p>While much of the above is related to how the news is presented to the reader, Gawq&#8217;s bigger bet is that it can create a Wikipedia-like community of news reviewers who will rate stories for adherence to journalistic practices. This is a more ambitious and perhaps overly optimistic endeavour.</p>
<p>On every article, users can click a review button that walks them through a short quiz where they&#8217;re asked to rate the story&#8217;s balance, the details provided, and whether the headline was clickbait. Users then add a comment and submit their report. This review process was built off the core ethics of journalism as defined by the <a href="https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608230325669000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGlxDyynAQ9_qVAQu5E945wjkOzlw">Society of Professional Journalists,</a> Dziabiak says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088146" style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088146" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2088146" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Add-Review.png?w=336" alt="" width="336" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Add-Review.png 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Add-Review.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Add-Review.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Add-Review.png?resize=336,680 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Add-Review.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088146" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gawq</p></div></p>
<p>Likely, only a minority of Gawq users would rate the stories. But over time and with scale, the reviews could help give outlets an accurate rating on news accuracy and their tendencies towards sensationalism, in the eyes of news consumers. That data may have external value, but for now, Gawq&#8217;s business model is &#8220;TBD,&#8221; Dziabiak admits.</p>
<p>The problem Gawq aims to tackle is a difficult one. And arguably, those who need to widen their worldview will be least likely to download a new app to do so. They&#8217;re often passive news consumers who have sat back ingesting news (and often, outrage and lies) from ever-personalized social media feeds. They then click on one favorite news TV channel for everything else. But there is a growing number of people who want a more neutral media landscape, and Gawq can help them find it with how it positions news as right, left or centered when comparing sources.</p>
<p>The startup is currently self-funded and has a small team of engineers, mostly working on a contract basis. Gawq has not ruled out future investment, however.</p>
<p>The app is a <a href="https://www.gawq.com/download">free download</a> on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gawq-unbreaking-news/id1514212857">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gawq">Android</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart and TikTok announced this morning they will be partnering on the first pilot test of a new shoppable product experience on TikTok&#8217;s social video app. Walmart, as you may recall, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/tiktok-deal/">had planned to invest in TikTok</a> when the app was being threatened with a ban from the U.S. market unless it sold its U.S. operations to an American company, per a Trump administration executive order &#8212;  a ban that&#8217;s now<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/second-federal-judge-rules-against-trump-administrations-tiktok-ban/"> on pause after multiple legal challenges</a>. Walmart&#8217;s interest in TikTok, however, has not waned. The retailer, though seemingly an odd fit for a social network, had seen the potential to attract a younger online consumer through video and, in particular, live streamed video.</p>
<p>This is what the new test on TikTok will involve, as well.</p>
<p>During a Walmart live stream, TikTok users will be able to shop from Walmart&#8217;s fashion items without having to leave the TikTok app, in a pilot of TikTok&#8217;s new &#8220;shoppable product.&#8221; The fashion items themselves will be featured in content from ten TikTok creators, led by host <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@justmaiko">Michael Le, </a>whose TikTok dances have earned him 43+ million fans. Other creators will be more up-and-coming stars, like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@devanondeck">Devan Anderson</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tayhage">Taylor Hage</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@muslimthicc">Zahra Hashimee</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All will be participating in a special event hosted on TikTok called the &#8220;Holiday Shop-Along Spectacular,&#8221; which will take place on Friday, Dec. 18 at 8 PM ET on Walmart&#8217;s TikTok profile.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088386" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088386" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2088386" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088386" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walmart</p></div></p>
<p>During this special, the creators will show off their favorite Walmart fashion finds in their own unique ways. For some, that will mean giving fans a peek inside their closet. Others may do a living room runway or even a fashionable &#8220;dance off,&#8221; Walmart says.</p>
<p>There are two ways TikTok users can shop for the fashion items featured.</p>
<p>As products are shown on screen, pins will pop-up which users can tap to add the item to their cart. They&#8217;re then directed to a mobile checkout experience. Alternately, customers can choose to tap on a shopping cart pin at the end of the event to look through all the items featured and select what they’d like to purchase.</p>
<p>And for anyone who misses the event, they&#8217;ll still be able to shop the items from Walmart&#8217;s TikTok profile when the Shop-Along event is over.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re constantly looking for ways to innovate the shopping experience for our customers,&#8221; said Walmart&#8217;s U.S. Chief Marketing Officer, William White, in an announcement. &#8220;We’re moving faster than ever to find new and improved ways to better serve our customers and meet them where they are. We created this event for, about, and by our community, reflecting the lives, passions and styles of a diverse set of creators so everyone watching will feel represented, no matter who they are or how they outfit their closet,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Walmart said the idea to partner on mobile shopping didn&#8217;t emerge as a result of the recent deal talks, as it&#8217;s been an active brand on the platform for over a year. (In fact, it&#8217;s even tasked its employees with making TikTok videos, <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/a-true-influencer-program-inside-walmarts-growing-army-of-employee-tiktokers/">a recent report from ModernRetail detailed</a>.)</p>
<p>The retailer also told TechCrunch there&#8217;s not a revenue share with TikTok on the sales it makes through the app, nor any fees, as this is considered a joint test.</p>

<p>This is not TikTok&#8217;s first foray into shoppable video.</p>
<p>The company has been exploring this space for some time, including with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/tiktoks-new-hashtag-challenge-plus-lets-video-viewers-shop-for-products-in-the-app/">last year&#8217;s launch of the Hashtag Challenge Plus</a> which added a shoppable component to a hashtag, directing video viewers to shop a site from within TikTok. This year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/levis-partnered-with-tiktok-on-social-commerce-and-doubled-its-product-views/">brands like Levi&#8217;s leveraged</a> TikTok&#8217;s &#8220;Shop Now&#8221; buttons that allowed consumers to make purchases through links posted on TikTok. And in a significant deal just this fall, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">TikTok formally partnered with Shopify on social commerce</a> by allowing Shopify merchants to create, run and optimize their TikTok marketing campaigns directly from the Shopify dashboard.</p>
<p>Live-streamed shopping is also a fast-growing and lucrative market, as younger users are turning to influencers and online video to both be entertained and to shop.</p>
<p>All the major tech companies have invested in this space as well, to varying degrees, including not only Facebook (in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/instagram-launches-shopping-in-reels-its-tiktok-rival/">an aggressive push</a> across <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/facebook-shop-instagram-live-shopping/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/instagram-launches-shopping-in-reels-its-tiktok-rival/">Instagram</a>), but also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/googles-latest-rd-project-is-shoploop-a-mobile-video-shopping-platform/">Google through its R&amp;D arm</a>, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/08/amazon-live-is-the-retailers-latest-effort-to-take-on-qvc-with-live-streamed-video/">through its QVC-like Amazon Live</a>, Alibaba <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/alibaba-aliexpress-influencer-recruitment/">through AliExpress</a>, JD.com, Pinduoduo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/wechat-livestreaming-china-economy/">WeChat</a>, and even TikTok’s Chinese sister app, Douyin.</p>
<p>The trend is also fueling startups, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/bambuser-live-video-shopping/">Bambuser</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/popshop-live-gets-3-million-to-bring-live-streaming-to-shopping/">Popshop Live</a>, which have raised new rounds in 2020 for their own live-streamed shopping products.</p>
<p>For TikTok, however, is more of a natural evolution of its product where influencers are already showing off their favorite items, their fashion and style.</p>
<p>&#8220;At TikTok, we&#8217;re constantly exploring new ways to inspire creativity, bring joy and add value for our community,&#8221; said Blake Chandlee, Vice President, Global Business Solutions at TikTok. &#8220;Creators and brands have found a creative outlet to connect with audiences through TikTok Live, and we&#8217;re excited to further innovate on this interactive experience to enable our community to discover and engage with the brands they love,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brands have had an incredible impact on the community throughout this year, and we&#8217;re thrilled to see Walmart embrace the creativity of TikTok and this first-of-a-kind experience to meaningfully engage with their community,&#8221; Chandlee said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The idea sounds almost too simple. Create a version of Linkedin that&#8217;s specifically for the healthcare industry, where professionals can find out not just who has what credentials, but also learn about the research those professionals are conducting and the specialties they have.</p>
<p>In the middle of a global pandemic, when industry insiders are all trying to find out who is an expert in particular fields of medicine that are most impacted by a novel virus spreading like wildfire around the world, that simple idea becomes a necessity.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the situation that <a href="https://h1insights.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">H1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup which just raised $58 million in new financing, found themselves in as the pandemic hit American shores earlier this year.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/h1-insights-is-giving-the-healthcare-industry-the-ultimate-professional-database/"> only graduated from Y Combinator in January</a>, and now, less than a year later is closing on over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/y-combinator-graduate-h1-closes-on-12-9-million-for-its-professional-healthcare-database/">$70 million in total financing</a>.</p>

<p>Doubling down on its previous investment in the company is <a href="https://www.menlovc.com/">Menlo Ventures</a>, which along with the growth stage investment firm, <a href="https://www.ivp.com/">IVP</a>, co-led the new financing for the company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their rationale for investing can be attributed to H1&#8217;s explosive growth. The company now has 250 employees after launching from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> just 12 months ago. Already a player in the US, H1 is looking to expand to Europe and Asia in 2021 and counts 13 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies as its clients. As of its last tally, the company already had profiles on over 9 million healthcare professionals worldwide.</p>
<p>According to one person with knowledge of the company&#8217;s fundraising history, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/menlo-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="menlo-ventures">Menlo Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was so pleased with the company&#8217;s performance that it offered tens of millions of dollars in pre-emptive financing.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have created a platform for the healthcare ecosystem to connect in the same way Linkedin connected professional workers in the early 2000’s. There hasn’t been a global platform like H1 before that has connected industry to the right doctors the way H1 does,” said H1 co-founder and CEO Ariel Katz. “This next round of funding, with our excellent investment group, including Menlo who has been a great partner for us, will help us continue to become the largest healthcare professional platform and ultimately create a healthier future.”</span></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/menlo-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="menlo-ventures">Menlo Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> certainly thinks so.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we started working with H1, we could already see early evidence of product-market fit, including both early &#8216;beachhead&#8217; pharma deals and good logo velocity in smaller biotechs. Feedback from customers was stellar, both in terms of product value and commitment to customer success by the H1 team,&#8221; wrote Menlo Ventures partner Greg Yap and JP Sanday in a blog post. &#8220;One of our diligence intros even turned into a multi-million dollar customer and investor. But H1 was clearly still at an early stage of maturity for supporting large demanding enterprise customers. Now, at the Series B, H1 has ramped up execution, winning 13 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies as customers and meeting top-tier venture metrics in gross retention, net retention, and sales efficiency.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> is launching a new product today called <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Pages</a>. It competes directly with <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>, two cloud hosting companies that let you build and deploy sites using JAMstack frameworks. Popular JAMstack frameworks include Gatsby, Jekyll, Hugo, Vue.js, Next.js, etc.</p>
<p>If that announcement sounds familiar, that’s because reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane">Jane Manchun Wong</a>, leaked <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1335198021131194370">details</a> about the upcoming product by looking into Cloudflare’s code. I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cloudflare-is-testing-a-netlify-competitor-to-host-JAMstack-sites/">covered the leak</a> a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>“You saw Jane’s tweet and she sort of spilled the beans a little early, which I thought was kinda awesome,” <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cloudflare" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cloudflare">Cloudflare <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jqbiwi8C6d"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cloudflare-is-testing-a-netlify-competitor-to-host-jamstack-sites/">Cloudflare is testing a Netlify competitor to host Jamstack sites</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cloudflare is testing a Netlify competitor to host Jamstack sites&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cloudflare-is-testing-a-netlify-competitor-to-host-jamstack-sites/embed/#?secret=jqbiwi8C6d" data-secret="jqbiwi8C6d" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But now, Cloudflare Pages is live for real. It integrates seamlessly with a Git repository and existing JAMstack frameworks. When you push a new version of your site to your Git repository, Cloudflare automatically starts building and deploying your site on its network.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with JAMstack, it’s a popular way of developing and deploying websites at scale. It lets you take advantage of global edge networks with a focus on performance.</p>
<p>A JAMstack framework lets you decouple the frontend from the backend of your website. Every time you change something to your site, the entire frontend is prebuilt. Your pages are transformed into optimized static pages that can be hosted and cached on a global edge network. This way, pages are served in a few milliseconds across the world.</p>
<p>JAMstack websites don’t have to be 100% static. You can use APIs from popular API-based services, such as Stripe. Payment modules are loaded directly from Stripe’s server when the page is rendered in your web browser. You can also build your own microservices that are loaded on demand and that can scale easily.</p>
<p>Coming back to Cloudflare Pages, it integrates with GitHub and GitLab repositories if you’re hosting your source code on those platforms. Once you your site is configured, you can preview each commit from Cloudflare’s interface — each commit gets its own unique URL and there’s a preview environment.</p>
<p>You can collaborate with other Cloudflare users by inviting them to your Pages project. When your site looks good in the preview branch, you can push it to the production branch.</p>
<p>Cloudflare started working on Pages when people who don’t consider themselves as devops wanted to use Cloudflare. “People on the creative side told us, ‘hey are you interested in building a website builder?’” Prince said. He identified Wix and Squarespace as website builders.</p>
<p>At the same time, Cloudflare noticed that JAMstack was getting quite popular. “A lot of Netlify and Vercel customers actually put Cloudflare in front of their Netlify or Vercel sites,” he added. That doesn’t really make sense when it comes to cost and performance as you’re stacking multiple CDNs.</p>
<p>As Cloudflare already has a huge network of servers around the world, it doesn’t cost them that much money to host JAMstack websites on its edge network — it&#8217;s cheaper than caching content hosted by Netlify. That’s why there’s a generous free tier with unlimited bandwidth and unlimited requests.</p>
<p>“We timed the release intentionally to be this time of the year. We really wanted to give a gift back to the developer community,” Prince said.</p>
<p>The company expects to get a lot of attention with today’s release. It’s going to add a thousand people to the service per day up until January. After that, it’ll open the service to everyone.</p>
<p>Cloudflare thinks you’ll choose Pages for JAMstack projects because of the free tier and its robust infrastructure. But the company also expects users to try out other Cloudflare services down the road.</p>
<p>For instance, if you want to go beyond static websites, Cloudflare offers a serverless platform called <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Workers</a>. You can deploy some code on Workers and use it in your Pages site. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, you can go beyond stateless functions as well.</p>
<p>Similarly, as you start using Pages, you might be interesting Cloudflare’s advanced security features and other Cloudflare products. The company has always been betting on the long tail of developers to find its next customers, and Pages is another example of that strategy.</p>

<p>Launch startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/astra-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="astra-3">Astra <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> had a monumental week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/launch-startup-astras-rocket-reaches-space-for-the-first-time/">achieving their first spaceflight with a rocket test on Tuesday</a>. Astra CEO Chris Kemp joined Relativity CEO Tim Ellis, and VOX Space President Mandy Vaughn at our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/">TC Sessions: Space</a> event on Wednesday, and with Relativity&#8217;s huge $500 million round earlier this year, and Virgin Orbit&#8217;s milestone test flight in May, it was a big year for all involved.</p>
<p>A significant portion of our discussion focused on the very different approaches that each of these launch companies is taking to solving what boils down to the same problem – improving cost and availability of launch. Kemp first described Astra&#8217;s approach, which boils down to rigorous and continuous process and cost optimization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Where we focus our software effort is in understanding where to make engineering optimizations,&#8221; Kemp said. &#8220;So by having an Astra operating system that is making it visible to all of our engineers, where your costs are, because you have a long lead time on this part, because there&#8217;s a lot of labor to assemble this part. [&#8230;] We&#8217;re not throwing any specific technology solution at a problem, we&#8217;re trying to basically triage the trade-offs that you&#8217;re making between the performance of the rocket – you can always use a higher-cost material, and you can potentially also use a higher cost manufacturing process, like 3D printing, but it isn&#8217;t always the right approach.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kemp added that Astra is essentially technology-agnostic when it comes to their production stack, and flexible in terms of how to configure that based on available resources and end goal parameters.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to optimize the overall economics of the business without regard to what technology you&#8217;re going to use,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So we pick the right technology to optimize the business based on the capital we have, and the production rate and the launch rate that we&#8217;re trying to target.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellis, meanwhile, talked about <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kcura" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kcura">Relativity&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> use of 3D printing, and how it differs significantly from its use in the production stack of other existing rocket manufacturers.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re doing at Relativity is completely different than then what almost everyone else is doing with using 3d printing for bits and pieces of a rocket,&#8221; he said.&#8221; From Apollo and launching rockets to the Moon, how we fundamentally build and develop, and the tool sets we use to make rockets and aerospace products is more or less the same as what it was 60 years ago – you walk into a factory, and it&#8217;s full of giant, expensive, fixed tooling, very complicated supply chains building products one at a time by hand with hundreds of thousands, to even millions of parts, depending on whether it&#8217;s a rocket or commercial aircraft.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088506" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088506" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2088506" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rocket-trio.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="639" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rocket-trio.jpg 1072w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rocket-trio.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rocket-trio.jpg?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rocket-trio.jpg?resize=768,479 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rocket-trio.jpg?resize=680,424 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rocket-trio.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088506" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Virgin Orbit, Astra, Relativity Space</p></div></p>
<p>By contrast, Ellis pointed out that it&#8217;s creating rockets with less than 1,000 total components by viewing 3D printing from a top-down angle, and using it for the vast majority of the production process, rather than for select components.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;re able to actually build each rocket and from raw material and fly it in 60 days, once our factories operational, and then 60 days later, we&#8217;ll do a better version and 60 days later, a better version than that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So the compounding rate of progress that&#8217;s possible with an all-in 3d printing approach, I believe, is equivalent to going from on-premise servers to cloud, or from gas internal combustion engines to electric – it&#8217;s really actually an entirely different tech stack and value chain, it&#8217;s not just the rocket itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vaughn pointed out that while all the companies have different approaches, they all seek to change the accessibility and cost of getting payloads to orbit. She then pointed out that Virgin Orbit has identified launch location flexibility as one of the key levers to speed that change in the right direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just about getting mass to orbit. It&#8217;s about how do we change what is that cost point to do, and how do we change the accessibility to do so,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Also, really unique from our perspective is, what is that just kind of inherent mobility to do – so how can we actually just fly the launch pad around, and really change the CONOPS [concept of operations] of what it takes to establish an infrastructure and leverage that infrastructure to have access to space.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virgin Orbit&#8217;s LauncherOne is carried by a modified 747 passenger airplane, which takes off from and lands at a traditional runway. That not only means the rocket itself requires less fuel, and therefore less mass, to deliver its cargo to orbit, but also introduces a lot of launch site flexibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;By changing the discussion in terms of what is a launch, and what is the end game, it&#8217;s not just about mass to orbit, it&#8217;s about all of these other elements of how can we react quickly, how can we design and produce something quickly, as well as deploy that capability, maybe in a unique way from an unexpected location, and then get the on-space effects delivered uniquely and quickly,&#8221; Vaughn said.</p>
<p>All three panelists agreed that the market will likely support many providers when it comes to small launch vehicles, and their existing sold inventory queues reflects that. We also heard later in the day from Amazon SVP Dave Limp, who pointed out that they alone will require multiple launch providers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/amazons-project-kuiper-will-seek-multiple-launch-providers-to-carry-its-satellites-to-space/">contracted for multiple missions to get Amazon&#8217;s Project Kuiper constellation in place on orbit</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Corporate spend management startup <a href="https://t.co/robCWKydUu?amp=1">Ramp</a> has raised $30 million more in a new round, it announced today. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/ramp-is-a-corporate-card-focused-on-helping-you-spend-less/">covered Ramp&#8217;s launch earlier this year</a>, when it also detailed that it had raised around $23 million up to that point.</p>
<p>The startup raised its latest round in August of 2020, with conversations about the deal kicking off in June. The new capital is <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ramp-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ramp-3">Ramp&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> second priced raise after its August, 2019 seed round worth $8 million and the first after its February, 2020-era $15 million raise. D1 and Coatue were new investors in this new investment, which included some prior backers.</p>
<p>Ramp CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/eglyman">Eric Glyman</a> called the new equity something akin to a Series A3, noting that it had effectively reused docs from a preceding round, albeit with a new price attached. Venture history purists could argue that Ramp&#8217;s new raise was the company&#8217;s Series B &#8212; the second priced round after its seed &#8212; or that it is really a Series C, as the startup&#8217;s seed round was as big as a 2000s-era A and was also a priced event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Ramp did not need the funds. Per Glyman, the startup still had part of its original seed round in the bank when it raised the latest check. That implies that the company had more than $45 million in cash as of August, 2020.</p>
<p>Asked why he raised the capital if it was not needed, the CEO told TechCrunch that its new investors had &#8220;pretty unbelievable&#8221; investment track records. And Glyman added that the round was attractively priced, limiting dilution. The exec also said that having the new funds helped Ramp hire more aggressively with confidence.</p>
<p>But while the round is interesting to a degree, more intriguing is the space in which Ramp competes. So let&#8217;s talk about the power of software, and when the startup and its competitors might start charging more for their deployed code.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Ramp competes for market share in corporate spend management, an active vertical with a number of venture-backed players. That actor density has generated a level of competition that has rewritten the ground rules for getting credit and charge cards into the hands of companies. The table stakes are higher than ever in the niche.</p>
<p>Why? Because issuing credit and debit cards to consumers and corporations has largely been commoditized, causing startups hunting for slices of spend via interchange to build increasingly powerful software suites around their original products; if you can&#8217;t entice new customers with fancy cards, how about lots of digital tooling built around spend itself, to help your company manage and limit cash outflows?</p>
<p>The examples of this trend are myriad: <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/brex" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="brex">Brex <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> built out a cash management solution, for example, and <a href="https://www.brex.com/solution/spend-management/">expense management</a> tools. Ramp itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/corp-card-startup-ramp-launches-expense-management-software/">launched expense management software of its own this year</a>, and Divvy <a href="https://getdivvy.com/expenses/">has a similar service</a> along with other card-related software tools.</p>

<p>Venture capitalists have poured $55 million into Ramp, by our count, north of $400 million into Brex, not counting debt raised by the unicorn, and more than $250 million into <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/divvy-7ad9" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="divvy-7ad9">Divvy <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. So, the game of building increasingly robust software stacks atop corporate cards is one to watch, as the scale of venture bets made on the key players in the space is titanic.</p>
<p>Ramp is dropping new code with its funding news, underscoring the point. The company recently added <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ramp-vendor-management">vendor management tooling</a>, and is now adding reimbursing capabilities so that employees can be paid back for expenses not made on the startup&#8217;s cards.</p>
<p>Which of the three has the best software stack? They each think that they do, we reckon.</p>
<p>The result of the efforts by Ramp and its competitors to build out software around their card offerings has been rapid customer growth. Divvy, reached this week concerning its own metrics, told TechCrunch that it has seen its customer number expand 120% in 2020 and total spend on its platform rise 100% this year. Brex declined to share growth metrics.</p>
<p>Ramp announced its own growth figures as part of its news passel, including that it reached $100 million in spend on its platform in the first 18 months following its incorporation (a somewhat non-GAAP time frame, we admit), and that a quarter of the total spend that it has supported for corporations was recorded in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>There appears to be plenty of market for the startups to grow into, just as there is plenty of capital available for them to tap.</p>
<p>To close, a question: When will corporate spend management startups flip the switch, and start to charge for their software suite? Currently the trio make money largely from interchange, collecting a tiny piece of transactions that they power with their cards. This scales well, and keeps friction of signing up new customers low; after all, who doesn&#8217;t want a free set of financial tooling?</p>
<p>But, eventually, they will charge for their software. SaaS revenue is simply too highly valued to <em>not</em> go after. At some point. Perhaps that day will mark the end of the corporate spend <del>land</del> logo grab, and the start of the software niche&#8217;s maturation. At which point I expect new competitors to sprout up and <a href="https://media0.giphy.com/media/hWR9s5HqrbP3y/giphy.gif">the cycle to repeat</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup with a new type of spacecraft propulsion system could make the interplanetary travel seen in Star Trek a reality. <a href="http://magdrivespace.com">Magdrive</a> has just closed a £1.4M seed round led by Founders Fund, an early investor in SpaceX, backed by Luminous Ventures, 7percent Ventures, and Entrepreneur First.</p>
<p>Magdrive is developing a next generation of spacecraft propulsion for small satellites. The startup says its engine’s thrust and efficiency are a &#8220;generational leap&#8221; ahead of any other electrical thrusters, opening up the space industry to completely new types of missions that were not possible before, without resorting to much larger, expensive and heavier chemical thrusters. It says its engine would make fast and affordable interplanetary space travel possible, as well as operations in Very Low Earth orbit. The engine would also make orbital manufacturing far more possible than previously.</p>
<p>Existing electrical solutions are very efficient but have very low thrust. Chemical thrusters have high thrust but lack efficiency and are hazardous and expensive to handle. Magdrive says its engine can deliver both high thrust and high efficiency in one system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2088476" style="width: 407px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088476" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Magdrive-prototype-render.png" alt="Magdrive prototype render" width="397" height="377" class="size-full wp-image-2088476" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Magdrive-prototype-render.png 397w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Magdrive-prototype-render.png?resize=150,142 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Magdrive-prototype-render.png?resize=300,285 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Magdrive-prototype-render.png?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088476" class="wp-caption-text">Magdrive prototype render</p></div></p>
<p>If it works, the Magdrive engine could make spacecraft go faster for longer. This could open up the industry to new space missions, such as a satellite (or X-wing fighter?) that can make multiple, fast maneuvers, without worrying about conserving fuel. In order to do this right now, satellites require a chemical thruster, which requires a significant payload in fuel for launch. A 200kg satellite would require 50kg of hydrazine fuel, which would cost £1,350,000 in launch mass alone.</p>
<p>Co-founder (and Star Trek fan) Dr Thomas Clayson did a PhD in plasma physics, working on advanced electromagnetic fields. He realized this could be a cornerstone for developing a plasma thruster that could achieve the accelerations required for interplanetary space travel. After meeting Mark Stokes, a mechanical engineer at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/imperial-college-london" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="imperial-college-london">Imperial College London <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with similar dreams of space travel, they decided to build a small scale thruster for satellites.</p>
<p>But Magdrive is not alone. Other companies are developing so-called &#8216;Hall Effect Thrusters&#8217;, which is a technology that has existed since the 1960’s. Much of the development is towards miniaturization and mass reduction, but thrust and efficiency remain the same. These companies include <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/busek" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="busek">Busek, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Exotrail, Apollo Fusion, Enpusion, Nanoavionics. Meanwhile, large international companies with huge technology portfolios are working on improving chemical propulsion and making it non-toxic to handle, such as Aerojet Rocketdyne and Moog ISP.</p>
<p>They plan to scale up our technology to power larger manned spacecraft (once in orbit) to long-distance destinations such as the Moon and Mars. Our system would present a much more affordable than a chemical or nuclear solution, due to the huge reduction in fuel costs, and because it is reusable.</p>
<p>Andrew J Scott, Founding Partner, 7percent Ventures: “At 7percent we seek founding teams with &#8216;moonshot&#8217; ambitions. With Magdrive this is not just a metaphor: their revolutionary plasma thruster will soon be powering satellites, but in the future could take us to deep space. While the UK&#8217;s expertise in constructing satellites is world-renowned, there has been far less focus on propulsion. In fact, Great Britain is the only country to have successfully developed and then, in the 1970&#8217;s abandoned, an indigenous satellite launch capability, which undoubtedly curbed the UK&#8217;s space sector. So we&#8217;re excited to be backing Magdrive, one of a new generation of British space startups, which has the vision and ambition to become a world-beating company in this burgeoning sector.”</p>
<p>The satellite industry is worth $5 Billion in 2020, predicted to grow to USD$30Billion by 2030, due to the rise in mega-constellations. Some 5,000 satellites are due to be launched in the next two years and 75% of all the companies launching these satellites have already flown something in space.</p>
<p>Magdrive is at the European Space Agency Business Incubation Centre in Harwell, Oxford.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a major upswing in virtual learning &#8212; where some schools have gone (and stayed) remote, and others have incorporated significantly stronger online components, in order to help communities maintain more social distancing. That has in turn led to a surge in the usage of tools to help home learners do their work better, and today, one of them is announcing a growth round that speaks to the opportunity in that market.</p>
<p><a href="https://brainly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brainly</a>, a startup from Poland that has built a popular network for students and their parents to engage with each other for advice and help with homework questions, has raised $80 million, a series D that it will be using both to continue building out the tools that it offers to students as well as to hone in on expansion in some key emerging markets such as Indonesia and Brazil. The news comes on the heels of dramatic growth for the company, which has seen its user base grow from 150 million users in 2019 to 350 million today.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by previous backer Learn Capital, with past investors <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/prosus-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="prosus-ventures">Prosus Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/runa-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="runa-capital">Runa Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> MantaRay, and General Catalyst Partners also participating. The company has now raised some $150 million and while it&#8217;s not disclosing valuation, CEO and co-founder Michał Borkowski confirmed it is &#8220;definitely&#8221; an upround for the company. For more context, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/brainly-a-crowdsourced-homework-helper-for-students-raises-30m-to-expand-in-the-us/">Pitchbook estimates</a> that the company was valued at $180 million in its last round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/brainly-a-crowdsourced-homework-helper-for-students-raises-30m-to-expand-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Series C of $30 million in 2019</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That C round was raised specifically to help <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/brainly-com" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="brainly-com">Brainly <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> grow in the U.S. It currently has some 30 million users in that market, and it happens to be the only one in which Brainly is monetising users. Everywhere else, Brainly is currently free to use. (In the U.S. there are also some formidable competitors, like Chegg, which has <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamBlacker25/status/1339546254922158081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strong traction</a> in the market of helping students with homework, with some 74% of Chegg&#8217;s user spend concentrated in that one single country.)</p>
<p>“Brainly has become one of the world’s largest learning communities, achieving significant organic growth in over 35 countries,” said Vinit Sukhija, Partner at Learn Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2088466" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="471" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png 6500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=768,532 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=1536,1063 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=2048,1418 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, Brainly was finding an audience with students &#8212; primarily those aged 13-19, said Borkowski &#8212; who were turning to the service to connect with people who could help them with homework when they found themselves at an impasse with, say, a math problem or getting to grips with the sequence of events that led to the revolutions of 1848. The platform is open-ended and is a little like a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/quora" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="quora">Quora <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for homework, in that people can find and answer questions they are interested in, as well as ask questions themselves.</p>
<p>That platform, however, took on a whole new dimension of importance with the shift to virtual learning, Borkowski said.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;In the western world, online education wasn’t a big investment area [pre-Covid] and that has changed a lot, with huge adoption by students, parents and teachers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But that big transition, switching from offline to online, has left kids struggling because teachers have so much more to do, so they can&#8217;t engage in the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>So with &#8220;homework&#8221; becoming &#8220;all work&#8221;, that has effectively led to needing more help than ever with home studies. And while many parents have tried to get more involved to make up the difference, &#8220;having parents as teachers has been hard,&#8221; he added. They may have been taught differently from how their kids are learning, or they don&#8217;t remember or know answers.</p>
<p>One thing that Brainly started to see, he said, was that with the pandemic more parents started using the app alongside students, either to work out answers together or to get the help themselves before helping their kids, with a number of these being from parents of kids younger than 13. He said that 15-20% of all new registrations currently are coming from parents.</p>
<p>Brainly up to now has been mainly focused on how to build out more tools for the students &#8212; and now parents &#8212; that use it, and has so far been about organic growth for those communities.</p>
<p>However, there is clearly scope to expand that to more educational stakeholders to better organise what kind of questions are answered and how. Borkowski said that the company has indeed been approached by educators, those building curriculums and others so that answers might tie in better with the kinds of questions that they are most likely to ask of students, although for now the company &#8220;wants to keep the focus on students and parents getting stuck.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of future products, Brainly is looking at ways of bringing in more tutoring, video and AI into the mix. The AI aspect is very interesting and will in fact tie in to wider curriculum coverage based on more localised needs.</p>
<p>For example, if you ask for help with a particular kind of quadratic equation technique, you can then be served lots of same practice questions to help better learn and apply what you&#8217;ve just been learning, and you might even then get suggested related topics that will appear alongside that in a wider mathematics examination. And, you might be offered the chance to meet with a tutor for further help.</p>
<p>Tutoring, he said, is something that Brainly has already been quietly piloting and has run some 150,000 sessions to date. Having such a large user base, Borkowski said, helps the startup run services at scale while still effectively keeping them in test mode.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;It will be about looking at what students are studying and how to map that to the curriculum in the country, and what we can do to help with that.&#8221; Borkowski said. &#8220;But it will require a heavy lift and and machine learning to pinpoint students&#8221; for it to work properly, which is one reason it has yet to roll it out more comprehensively, he added.</p>
<p>Tutoring and more personalization are not the only areas where Brainly is actively testing out new services.</p>
<p>The company is also creating more space for adding in video to demonstrate different techniques (which I suspect is especially good for something like mathematics, but equally helpful for, say, an art technique). This is presumably <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/25/brainly-bask/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in part based on a 2018 acquisition the startup made to bring on more video tools</a>, which underscores in some ways how deliberate Brainly&#8217;s expansion strategy has been.</p>
<p>There are &#8220;thousands per week&#8221; being added already, but as with tutoring &#8220;that, for us, is a testing stage,&#8221; added Borkowski. There should be more coming in Q1 about new products, he said.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">In the eight years since Aceable&#8217;s launch, the company has grown from a driver&#8217;s ed test prep service to an online training tool for drivers and real estate agents.</p>
<p>Only four years ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/23/drivers-ed-app-aceable-raises-4-million-for-national-expansion/">Aceable was raising $4 million in financing</a>, from investors including Floodgate Capital and Silverton Partners.</p>

<p>Now, with another $50 million in the bank and over $100 million in total capital raised, Aceable is looking to grow the number of certifications it offers &#8212; with a special focus on professional development.</p>
<p>The company said that it would look to grow both organically and inorganically (which is an inelegant way of saying that it&#8217;s likely to go shopping for potential acquisitions).</p>
<p>Re-skilling and up-skilling are set to become buzzwords again as Americans who were laid off because of the inadequate support small businesses received from Congress in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak begin looking for new work.</p>
<p>EdTech has seen a huge boost during the pandemic, with millions of Americans turning to online classes to learn new skills or trades or hone existing skillsets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Changing or growing your career can create new opportunities to reach your life goals. Our vision is to make it accessible to anyone to gain a skill and a certification capable of setting you on the path of a well-paid career that you love,&#8221; said <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/blake-garrett" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="blake-garrett">Blake Garrett, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Aceable&#8217;s founder and chief executive. &#8220;We see <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hggc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hggc">HGGC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as a strategic, long-term financial partner that embraces and accelerates our vision to create unparalleled education experiences that make it accessible for people to change their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other startups have also landed tens of millions of dollars to capture this newfound interest in reskilling or upskilling. In June, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/degreed-lands-new-cash-for-upskilling-in-a-down-market/">Degreed raised $32 million for its own spin on the edtech market</a>. But there&#8217;s still some question over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/reskilling-upskilling-future-of-edtech/">who benefits from these new platforms</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AAUyKZ1gtB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/reskilling-upskilling-future-of-edtech/">Who really benefits from reskilling?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Who really benefits from reskilling?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/reskilling-upskilling-future-of-edtech/embed/#?secret=AAUyKZ1gtB" data-secret="AAUyKZ1gtB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that Aceable could exist along a continuum with some of these other platforms, or serve communities that aren&#8217;t addressed by the current options on the market.</p>
<p>As the company notes, one in four working professionals takes license and certification training a year &#8212; and these classes are often the gatekeeper to greater financial success.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are big believers in Aceable&#8217;s mission and their long track record of success in developing mobile-first education technology,&#8221; said John Block, Partner at HGGC. &#8220;Our investment reinforces our confidence in the team and will allow Aceable to grow to the next level while helping people achieve the life they want through continuing education.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aceable now counts more than 2,200 hours of educational content on its platform, which have been used to train 13 million students across 36 states. The company was first spun up from the<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Capital Factory accelerator program and has raised its cash from investors including Sageview Capital, Silverton Partners, Floodgate Fund, Next Coast Venture Partners, Wildcat VC, Nextgen Partners and now HGGC.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://photoroom.com">PhotoRoom</a> is launching its app on Android today. The company has been working on a utility photography app that lets you remove the background from a photo, swaps it for another background and tweaks your photo.</p>
<p>And it’s been working well on iOS already as the company attended Y Combinator, doubled its annual recurring revenue to $2 million and raised a $1.2 million seed round.</p>
<p>In particular, influencers and people reselling clothes and fashion items have been relying on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/photoroom" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="photoroom">PhotoRoom <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. They use their phone as their main creativity platform. Like other professional photography apps, the startup relies on subscriptions to generate revenue ($9.49 per month or $46.99 per year).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>PhotoRoom relies on machine learning to identify objects and separate them from the rest of the photo. This way, you can manipulate a specific part of your photo.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088173" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088173" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png" alt="" width="1024" height="619" class="size-full wp-image-2088173" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png 1420w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png?resize=768,464 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png?resize=680,411 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088173" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PhotoRoom</p></div></p>
<p>When the startup raised its seed round after Y Combinator, it chose to raise from Nicolas Wittenborn’s Adjacent fund, Liquid2 Ventures as well as two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>A group of business angels focused on machine learning, such as Yann LeCun (Chief AI Scientist at Facebook), Zehan Wang (Head of Twitter Machine Learning Cortex, co-founder of Magic Poney), Nicolas Pinto (Perceptio founder), etc.</li>
<li>And another group of business angels focused on mobile subscriptions, such as Holger Seim (Blinkist), Jacob Eiting (RevenueCat), John Bonten (advisor for Calm and Spotify) and Eric Setton (Tango).</li>
</ul>
<p>With this funding round, the company plans to grow the team from 3 to 8 persons and work on its deep learning algorithm. If you want to learn more about PhotoRoom, feel free to read my take on the product:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://betterdairy.co.uk/">Better Dairy</a>, a U.K. startup developing animal-free dairy that was founded out of Entrepreneur First (EF), has picked up £1.6 million in seed funding. The London-based company is currently in the R&amp;D stages of developing products that are &#8220;molecularly identical&#8221; to traditional dairy without using animals as part of the production process.</p>
<p>This seed round was led by Happiness Capital, alongside a number of other investors in the space. They include CPT Capital, Stray Dog Capital and Veg Capital, in addition to various unnamed angel investors. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/better-dairy" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="better-dairy">Better Dairy <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says it will use the funds to accelerate its R&amp;D efforts with the aim of commercialising its first products by early 2022.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 by Jevan Nagarajah (CEO) and Dr. Christopher Reynolds (CTO), both alumni of Imperial College London but who paired up during EF’s company builder program, Better Dairy is using advancements in technology to address the hugely unsustainable dairy market. Nagarajah has plenty of tech company experience, including stints at Rocket Internet, SumUp, and Ritua, as well as founding early ‘dark kitchen’ startup ShareDining. Meanwhile, Reynolds holds a PhD and a number of post-doctorates across bioinformatics and synthetic biology, and has a degree in natural sciences spanning chemistry and biochemistry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nagarajah says animal-based dairy farming is “hugely unsustainable,” noting that it emits the equivalent of over 1.7 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere each year and it takes 650 litres of water to produce just 1 litre of milk. “Dairy products themselves contain several unwanted pollutants such as growth hormones and antibiotics by virtue of the process of milking mothering cows and are thus not the most suitable for human consumption,” he adds.</p>
<p>However, although plant based alternatives are gaining popularity, Nagarajah argues that they are not a complete solution, often lacking in flavour, texture and nutritional profile. And while they might be able to capture market share, he doesn’t believe plant based alternatives to dairy will be successful in “radically” disrupting the existing $700 billion dairy industry and supply chain. That’s where Better Dairy comes in.</p>
<p>“We are instead using yeast fermentation and biology to produce products that are molecularly identical to traditional dairy,” he explains. “We follow a process very similar to beer brewing but the end result in our case is large vats of dairy instead of beer. This production process, while seemingly futuristic, is actually already being used to produce several enzymes for food production, for example rennet, as well as to produce numerous medical products such as insulin, so we are just building on this”.</p>
<p>Better Dairy is still early on in its R&amp;D process, but has already managed to produce its first dairy samples in the lab. The first challenge was to manipulate yeast to produce initial dairy proof of concepts. “Following this, we believe we have identified a clear path to get us to commercially viable products,” says Nagarajah. “While some of our milestones are box ticking exercises, for example the scaling up of our manufacturing capabilities, the major challenges we need to overcome revolve around the optimisation of our end to end production process”.</p>
<p>That’s because, explains the Better Dairy co-founder, dairy is a relatively low cost good. To realistically disrupt the existing dairy market, the startup will need to achieve a certain level of efficiency otherwise it risks succeeding in producing better dairy but will still fail overall due to prohibitively high pricing.</p>
<p>“We are initially focused on dairy proteins with the view of extending our range to fats over time,” says Nagarajah. “The main dairy proteins whey and casein have many structural and nutritional benefits and are used as ingredients across thousands of food products. They are crucial in providing the texture of dairy products like cheese but are also used heavily in soups and ready meals, baked goods and pastries, chocolates and sweets and also pasta and bread. They even find their way into products like beef burgers and chicken nuggets to bolster protein content and add texture.</p>
<p>“While our intention was initially to enable a wave of better dairy products, our ambitions have grown to target the disruption of the entire dairy supply chain across dairy and non-dairy categories. Our vision is to create a world where humans are vegan without even realising it”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gocardless.com/">GoCardless</a>, the London fintech that aims to become the one-stop shop globally for businesses that want to let customers pay via recurring bank payments, has raised $95 million in Series F funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/12/14/gocardless-secures-billion-dollar-valuation-raising-95m/">According to The Telegraph newspaper</a>, this gives the company much coveted unicorn status. However, I understand the round values GoCardless at just over $970 million, meaning that the 2011-founded fintech is perhaps best described as a soonicorn (presuming these things are important to you).</p>
<p>The latest fundraise was led by Bain Capital Ventures, and follows 46% year-on-year growth for GoCardless as it benefits from an increase in e-commerce and online payments generally during the pandemic. It brings the total raised by the company to-date to $240 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GoCardless says it will use the funding to accelerate its open banking strategy, which will see it combine open banking-enabled bank-to-bank payments with the global bank debit payments network it has already built out. “For the first time, merchants will be able to access the best of both worlds for recurring payments: Instant open banking payments will provide visibility and speed, while bank debit maximises cash flow and minimises churn by pulling funds automatically from payers &#8211; all at a lower cost than cards,” pitches the fintech.</p>
<p>In addition &#8212; and noteworthy &#8212; GoCardless says it will also expand its offering into the “adjacent e-commerce market” to launch a simple and secure way of making open banking-enabled bank-to-bank payments as a lower-cost alternative to cards.</p>
<p>The company has always pitched direct debits as a much better recurring payments method, especially for subscription commerce and regular B2B payments. That’s because, amongst other things, debit and credit cards expire, breaking any subsequent recurring payments. By adding bank-to-bank payments to its stack, GoCardless is continuing to push up against the card network duopoly of Visa and Mastercard.</p>
<p>“We think the magic is in the combination of open banking payments and our existing direct debit platform,” co-founder and CEO Hiroki Takeuchi tells me, when asked why GoCardless is entering the soon to be commoditized space of open banking payments.</p>
<p>“They are really complimentary as open banking is faster and more secure but direct debit is more flexible and more reliable. The combination will create something entirely new and unique that will not only make our product better for our existing customers but also enable us to go after new markets”.</p>
<p>He says that GoCardless already has the required FCA permissions to do open banking payments, and new products are actively under development. Debut products will be launching in the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>“We have been following open banking very closely but we felt it wasn’t reliable enough or slick enough for payments until quite recently,” adds Takeuchi. “This has been changing and we think now is the perfect time to focus on open banking payments”.</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of open banking is that the U.K. regulator is currently consulting with the industry on plans to make recurring payments possible via open banking, meaning that they could be used instead of direct debits. Arguably, GoCardless’ biggest moat is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/goamerica/">the global recurring payments network</a> it has built, and so I put it to Takeuchi that open banking is both an opportunity and a threat to GoCardless.</p>
<p>“We don&#8217;t worry about this &#8211; we are agnostic to the rails we build on,” he says, pushing back. “What we care about is getting money from one bank account to another as efficiently as possible. In fact, we processed the first (and I think maybe the only) variable recurring payment via open banking last year as part of a test we worked on with the open banking team.</p>
<p>“If open banking offers rails that replicate direct debit then we will adopt those. The reality is that the payment itself is only a small part of the overall value we provide for our merchants &#8212; there are a lot of other basics such as reconciliation, refunds, international settlement, FX etc. that are really important &#8212; so we are confident that there is still a lot for us to do”.</p>
