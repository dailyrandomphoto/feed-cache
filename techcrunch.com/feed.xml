										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://angel.co/">AngelList</a> this week launched AngelList Stack, a new suite of products that will compete with Carta in providing services to help founders start, operate and maintain ownership over their companies. The new software will cover four bases: end-to-end incorporation, business banking, advisor equity grants and cap table management.</p>
<p>“Every time you actually go to start a company, you start off with this optimism,” said AngelList CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avlok">Avlok Kohli</a>. “You have this idea, you’re super confident, and you want to go do it, and then there is all this mundane stuff that you have to figure out.”</p>
<p>The idea with AngelList Stack is to take some of those mundane and arcane processes of starting a company, and make it simpler, said Kohli, who was a repeat founder before joining AngelList.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Wipuc1e29Q"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/angellist-ventures-avlok-kohli-on-rolling-funds-and-the-busy-state-of-vc/">AngelList Venture&#8217;s Avlok Kohli on rolling funds and the busy state of VC</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AngelList Venture&#8217;s Avlok Kohli on rolling funds and the busy state of VC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/angellist-ventures-avlok-kohli-on-rolling-funds-and-the-busy-state-of-vc/embed/#?secret=Wipuc1e29Q" data-secret="Wipuc1e29Q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The end-to-end incorporation service will help founders figure out the paperwork of actually starting a company, from which state to incorporate in to what kind of business classification to pursue. It will also help founders track and file 83(b) filings, a niche but important document for those with equity that can cost millions in back taxes if done wrong.</p>
<p>By providing a simpler UX for founders, Kohli hopes AngelList can do more than a lawyer consultation when it comes to officially launching a company.</p>
<p>“Lawyers usually view incorporation as a loss leader just to build up a relationship with the founder and work with them in the future, or just to make the paperwork easier,” Kohli said. “But then they stop right there.” AngelList, alternatively, wants to then usher founders into its next tool: banking services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The banking tool has two parts: deposit accounts with interest and debit cards. Both accounts make it easier for founders to automatically accept wire transfers from investors, which can then blend into AngelList’s new cap table tool. The cap tool will include issuing digital shares, SAFEs, reporting, 409As and employee option grants.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208945" style="width: 872px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208945" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2208945" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png" alt="" width="862" height="651" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png 1625w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=300,226 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=768,579 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=680,513 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=1536,1159 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208945" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> AngelList</p></div></p>
<p>“Founders can raise their first SAFE round entirely on Stack by sending a link to investors to digitally sign the SAFE,” the company said in a statement. “Once the funds arrive in the bank account, investors are automatically added to the cap table.”</p>
<h2>A full Carta</h2>
<p>AngelList Stack has echoes of Carta, formerly named eShares. While AngelList launched with a focus on angels and venture, Carta broke out with a focus on employees and founders. Over time, both pursued scale with Carta taking over cap table land, and AngelList taking over syndicates and fund operations. As both companies mature, they are overlapping in their vision to be an end-to-end stack for venture and startups.</p>
<p>AngelList, comparatively, is a smaller organization than Carta with only $26.2 million to date, per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/angellist">Crunchbase</a>. While the ability to raise capital doesn’t necessarily illustrate the ability of a company to be successful, it can give the startup runway when its customers &#8212; other startups &#8212; face volatility. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/data-shows-which-tech-roles-might-be-most-vulnerable-amid-layoffs/">Both companies</a> had layoffs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/angellist-lays-off-a-number-of-staff-and-cuts-executive-salaries/">amid the early innings</a> of the COVID-19 pandemic. For signals of how much has changed since, AngelList said that it has nearly doubled its staff to 95 people over the past year to keep up with its product roadmap; and Carta recently valued <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/carta-says-it-just-used-its-own-product-to-establish-a-new-and-far-higher-valuation-for-itself/">its own cap table management and valuation service at $7.4 billion.</a></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208946" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208946" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2208946" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Debit-Card-Design.png" alt="" width="857" height="541" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Debit-Card-Design.png 976w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Debit-Card-Design.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Debit-Card-Design.png?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Debit-Card-Design.png?resize=768,485 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Debit-Card-Design.png?resize=680,429 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Debit-Card-Design.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208946" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> AngelList</p></div></p>
<p>“There are a lot of experiments around point solutions, around solving different problems for different point problems for founders,” Kohli said, in reference to other competitors. “Our view is that founders prefer always being integrated into one bundle.”</p>
<p>At launch, AngelList Stack services are free but AngelList will eventually monetize through SaaS management fees, or through transaction fees on its financial tooling.</p>
<h2>Network, then platform</h2>
<p>Platform plays aren’t new to AngelList. Last year, the startup pioneered rolling funds, an investment vehicle that raises money through a quarterly subscription from interested investors. The early traction of that product inspired the firm to pivot to focus more on venture SaaS more broadly.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UfvT4YJvIt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/angellist-pioneers-rolling-vc-funds-in-pivot-to-saas/">AngelList pioneers rolling VC funds in pivot to SaaS</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AngelList pioneers rolling VC funds in pivot to SaaS&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/angellist-pioneers-rolling-vc-funds-in-pivot-to-saas/embed/#?secret=UfvT4YJvIt" data-secret="UfvT4YJvIt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>AngelList is pursuing a similar strategy when it comes to founders. It piloted roll-up vehicles, which allow founders to raise capital from up to 250 accredited investors with a single line on the cap table, and is now expanding into more services. In other words, AngelList appears to be unbundling venture, and rebundling founder services.</p>
<p>“We are approaching the building of the two businesses very differently,” Kohli said. He explained that the founder&#8217;s products are focused more on workflow software, while its flagship products, targeted to investors, are focused on workflow software and capital allocation.</p>
<p>While some could argue that connecting funders to founders feels like a natural synergy for AngelList to pursue, Kohli explained that the startup has no plans to become a fundraising marketplace such as Hum Capital or ClearCo.</p>
<p>“Our view is that the market is quite efficient, and we can’t offer an experience that is much better than what is happening today,” he said. Ironically, this call is a step away from what AngelList initially launched to do, which was to connect angel investors to entrepreneurs. As it pivots to work on more support SaaS tooling, AngelList is a very different company that it was 10, or even five years ago.</p>
<p>In the past, Kohli has described the power of AngelList as its capital network. Today’s launch illustrates a broader push to make AngelList a capital and creator network. The decade-old company has worked on a rebrand. AngelList.com recently rebranded to include solely AngelList Venture and rolling funds. Talent and Product Hunt, two of AngelList’s other offerings, moved to separate websites and continue operating as independent entities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon today announced a new subscription service called &#8220;Alexa Together,&#8221; designed for families with aging family members who are still living independently, but who may need extra support. The $19.99 per month subscription expands on Amazon&#8217;s existing product, Alexa Care Hub, an earlier investment in elder care, by taking many of Care Hub&#8217;s features and adding on new protections, like an urgent response feature and access to a professional emergency helpline.</p>
<p>The company in November 2020 first introduced <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=21390531011">Care Hub,</a> an option in the Alexa mobile app, which has allowed family members to keep an eye on older parents and loved ones &#8212; with their permission &#8212; in order to receive general information about their activities and to be alerted if the loved one has called out for help.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209424" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209424" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209424" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.07-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.07-PM.jpg 705w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.07-PM.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.07-PM.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.07-PM.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.07-PM.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209424" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>With Alexa Together, family members can continue access features like care alerts, which are designed to keep family members in the loop when an aging family member asks Alexa for help.</p>
<p>Starting early next year, Alexa Together will also make it possible for multiple people to provide support for a loved one &#8212; which is useful in situations where siblings may split the duties of caring for mom or dad, for example. Even nearby neighbors could be added to the support system, so they could check on a customer&#8217;s family member in the case of an emergency.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209425" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209425" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209425" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.03-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="385" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.03-PM.jpg 868w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.03-PM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.03-PM.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.03-PM.jpg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.03-PM.jpg?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.03-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209425" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Caregivers can also do things like set up reminders on loved ones&#8217; devices or link to a music service so they can easily play their favorite songs, Amazon says. And they can add contacts to the family member&#8217;s Alexa account, so they can call friends and family hands-free.</p>
<p>The new subscription also introduces an urgent response feature which enables hands-free, 24/7 access to an emergency helpline. That way, if an elderly family member takes a fall at home or has another type of emergency, they can just ask Alexa to call for help.</p>
<p>Alexa will then do so and alert all the family members, neighbors and anyone else connected to the account.</p>
<p>The subscription will be offered for free for 6 months, then is a $19.99 per month paid subscription if you continue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">iRobot’s CEO once told me, with a wink, that he didn’t become a truly successful roboticist until he became a vacuum salesman. It’s a good line, and one that betrays some fundamental truths about the industry. Robots are hard, and in a lot of ways home robots are doubly so.</p>
<p>That no one has managed to crack the code beyond the wild success of robotic vacuums like the Roomba is not for lack of trying. To date, it’s largely been the realm of startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/29/cozmo-maker-anki-is-shutting-its-doors/">Anki</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/04/the-lonely-death-of-jibo-the-social-robot/"> Jibo</a> (or the rare exception of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/mayfield-robotics-ceases-production-of-kuri-robot-amid-a-questionable-future/">Bosch-created Kuri</a>), but today, Amazon announced that it’s throwing its own tremendous resources behind the problem.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209179" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209179" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2209179" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/astro_media_animation-gif_01.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="575" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209179" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>In fact, it’s doing more than that. The company just announced its first robot, Astro. The product is taking its first baby steps to market as part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/amazon-will-let-users-vote-on-new-alexa-with-pre-orders-including-a-cuckoo-clock/">Amazon’s Day One Edition</a> program. Previously Amazon has used the platform in a manner akin to Kickstarter or Indiegogo, where customers effectively vote with their preorders. The new robot, which shares a name with the Jetsons dog, a track on the White Stripes debut and major league baseball team in Houston, will be available on a limited basis later this year. Astro is, far and away, the most ambitious device to be launched with the program, which has thus far included things like a receipt printer and smart Cuckoo clock. It’s also the most expensive, with a price tag of $999.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208847" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208847" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2208847" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0248.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0248.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0248.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0248.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0248.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0248.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0248.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0248.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0248.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208847" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The robot serves three primary functions at launch:</p>
<ol>
<li>Home security</li>
<li>Monitoring loved ones</li>
<li>Offering a kind of mobile version of the in-home Alexa experience</li>
</ol>
<p>The company begun work on the robot roughly four years ago, leveraging different Amazon departments to build a fully realized home robot.</p>

<p>“We talked about AI, computer vision and processing power, and one of the topics that came up was robotics,” Amazon VP Charlie Tritschler tells TechCrunch. “How has robotics changed to make it maybe possible for consumers. We have a lot of experience using robotics in our fulfillment center, of course, but we thought about what could you do for the consumer in the home to make things more convenient or provide more peace of mind. That started us thinking about it, and by the end we were saying, ‘jeez, does anybody think we won’t have robotics in the home in five to 10 years?’ ”</p>

<p>Amazon Robotics &#8212; which began in 2012 with the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/19/amazon-acquires-online-fulfillment-company-kiva-systems-for-775-million-in-cash/">acquisition of Kiva Systems</a> &#8212; formed a sounding board for the consumer team’s ideas. But the company’s existing robotics are industrial and primarily focused on getting packages delivered in the least amount of time possible. Ultimately, Amazon said it had to build many of Astro’s components from scratch &#8212; including, most notably, the SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) system it uses to map and navigate the home.</p>
<p>That last bit struck me as particularly surprising, given not just how complex an undertaking it is (it’s something iRobot has effectively been iterating on for a decade), but also given some of the robotic technologies Amazon currently houses. Most notably, the company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/amazon-acquires-autonomous-warehouse-robotics-startup-canvas-technology/"> acquired Canvas,</a> a fully autonomous warehouse cart startup, in 2019. But Amazon insists that the new SLAM system was built from the ground up, and while it considered making robotic startup acquisitions, it ultimately didn’t do so in order to build Astro. Other in-house technologies did factor in, however, including Ring’s security monitoring and various Alexa and home technologies, built into the robot, which features Amazon’s smart assistant.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208848" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208848" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2208848" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208848" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>I had the opportunity to interact with Astro last week, and the robot’s got a bit of a dual personality, from that perspective. The robot’s primary personality is best described as something akin to R2-D2/BB8 or Wall-E. Its face, which is effectively a screen or a tablet, sports a pair of minimalist eyes &#8212; like a set of lowercase, bolded letter “o”s. They blink and dart around from time to time, but they’re nowhere near as expressive as what Anki hired a team of ex Pixar and Dreamworks animators to create with Cozmo.</p>
<p>This is augmented by the occasional bleeps and bloops, which bring to mind the aforementioned Star Wars droids. The robot can be summoned with a “hey Astro,” but when you need to converse more directly, that requires an “Alexa,” at which point, the familiar voice assistant takes over.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2209189,2209182,2209190,2209188,2209187,2209184,2209186,2209191"]</p>
<p>Beyond offering some personality, Astro’s 10-inch touchscreen face also serves as a standard Echo Show display, so you can do things like watch a movie, teleconference and control your smart home. The screen moves on its own and can be manually tilted 60 degrees for a better look. The screen also supports Amazon’s new Visual ID facial recognition to personalize interactions with Astro.</p>
<p>There are a pair of speakers on-board, as well. Though the robot itself is surprisingly quiet (it&#8217;s no robotic vacuucm). In fact, Amazon tells me that they had to introduce sound a la an electric car, so you know when it&#8217;s cruising around the house. You do hear the occasional servo sound, however, when it pivots to turn by changing the directions of its wheels.</p>
<p>There’s a cargo bin on the rear (which has an optional cupholder) that can carry up to 4.4 pounds. Inside is a USB-C port so you can charge your phone. Astro itself has a Roomba-like dock and takes less than an hour to charge from zero to full.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208842" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208842" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2208842" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0265.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0265.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208842" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, there are a whole bunch of sensors on board. That includes proximity sensors built into its base and a pair of cameras, including a five-megapixel RGB built into the bezel of its face/screen. The other is decidedly more surprising, popping out the top of its head. This 12-megapixel RGB/IR camera sticks up for livestreaming purposes. Its retractable base can extend as tall as four feet, to serve as a kind of periscope for the robot to get a better look.</p>

<p>Having spent around an hour with the robot and its creators, I have to say I’m pretty impressed with what the team has built here. Of course, the question of how many people are interested in owning the thing is a different one entirely. The company says it has tested Astro in “thousands” of homes to work out some of the kinks &#8212; like getting stuck in the occasional corner. The Day One program is less a public beta than a method for gauging customer interest in the product.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2209216,2209215,2209218,2209214"]</p>
<p>“I think this is the first of the robot series that we’re doing. This is an invite-only program &#8212; we want to make sure that people that get Astro can have a great experience with it, given the challenge of homes and different spaces,” says Tritschler. “As we think long term, as we think of consumer robotics, of course we want to have all different kinds of price ranges and capabilities, and have a more directed mainstream product as part of that. But we think Astro is a good place to start to reaffirm all of the work we’ve done to create value from day one and ensure that what we’ve done actually makes sense for the consumer. We’re going to be interested in getting that feedback when we start shipping the product later in the year.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is introducing two new services tied to user health and fitness, and its Halo personal health devices. They include Halo Fitness, a new service for interactive home video workouts that looks a lot like Apple Fitness+, and Halo Nutrition, a personalized, guided meal planner.</p>
<p>Both of these services will be included as part of Amazon&#8217;s Halo membership for users of its Halo line of fitness trackers, which include the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/amazon-takes-on-fitbit-with-the-80-halo-view/">new Halo View activity tracker that adds an OLED display</a>. The Halo subscription costs $3.99 per month after a six-month free trial bundled with Halo Band, or a 12-month trial with Halo View, and Amazon says it&#8217;ll include both of these new features starting later this year for Fitness, and in January 2022 for Nutrition.</p>
<p>Halo Fitness offers &#8220;studio quality workouts&#8221; led by &#8220;industry experts,&#8221; and offers real-time display of metrics like heart rate and heart rate intensity zone as captured by the Halo fitness bands. The workouts include coaches like Michael Hildevbrand, Elana Cheung, and Elizabeth Andrews, and it will offer cardio, strength, yoga, outdoor and mobility classes in terms of types of workouts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On its first try, Rivian produced the Goldilocks of pickup trucks.</p>
<p>The Rivian R1T electric truck is neither too big nor small. It handles rock crawling and off-camber trails with ease, can zip from zero to 60 miles per hour on a dirt road in just a few seconds without the typical back-end slippage — although there is an option to provide that drifting effect — and it can crank through winding mountain roads, pushing the edge of each corner without body roll.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s loaded with the kind of interior and exterior touches that put it firmly in the premium zone &#8212; and yet the Rivian R1T is no delicate flower.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s designers and engineers helped the truck steer clear of pretension by combining form and function from tip to tail. Some of the added surprises &#8212; the location of functional details like tie-downs, a compressor and outlets &#8212; suggest that numerous Rivian employees tested the truck in real-world conditions, including camping, mountain biking and even more mundane tasks like grocery-fetching.</p>
<p>The result is a vehicle that feels right for all seasons and ready for anything. And, importantly, it&#8217;s a joy to drive.</p>
<p>On a press drive over three days, a near-production-spec R1T proved to be the electric truck none of us knew we needed.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say every choice landed perfectly. There are a few hardware details and elements on the software user interface side of things that could use a nip here and a tuck there. I&#8217;m looking at you, odd notch that is maybe a pen holder, but certainly the soon-to-be dust collector by the wireless charging pad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To be clear, far more time and miles are required to provide a full review. Still, as a total package, the Rivian R1T impresses.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208964" style="width: 2741px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208964" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2208964 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg" alt="Rivian R1T line up Colorado" width="2731" height="1536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg 2731w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2731px) 100vw, 2731px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2208964" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>What Rivian has accomplished with the R1T is no small feat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult for established automakers to anticipate and then tick every box on consumers&#8217; wish lists. It&#8217;s even harder to mass-produce that vehicle all while maintaining proper fit and finish. Rivian is in the rarefied position of aiming to bring the first electric truck to market in the U.S., making it a vehicle that drivers will covet and doing it to scale.</p>
<p>Rivian has delivered on the desirability and drivability fronts. Now it faces two more tests: production and delivery.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s making progress toward those goals. The first production Rivian R1T electric pickup truck in &#8220;Rivian blue&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/rivians-first-production-r1t-electric-pickup-truck-rolls-off-the-line/">rolled off the assembly line</a> earlier this month at the company&#8217;s factory in Normal, Illinois, marking a milestone more than a decade in the making for the automaker and its founder and CEO, RJ Scaringe.</p>
<p>The company, which started in 2009 as Mainstream Motors before adopting the Rivian name two years later, has undergone explosive growth in terms of people, backers and partners in the past few years.</p>
<p>Rivian operated in secret for years before it revealed prototypes of its all-electric R1T truck and R1S SUV at the LA Auto Show in late 2018.</p>
<p>Since then, Rivian has raised billions of dollars ($10.5 billion since 2019); expanded its Normal, Illinois, factory; hired thousands of employees (more than 8,000); landed Amazon as a commercial customer; and, most recently, filed confidentially for an IPO. In addition to its Illinois factory, Rivian has facilities in Palo Alto and Irvine, California; and Plymouth, Michigan; and an office in the U.K.</p>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>

<p>The R1T that I drove was a Launch Edition version in glacier white and equipped with Pirelli Scorpion 20-inch all-terrain tires, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">putting it at about $75,000, excluding the $1,075 destination charge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Launch Edition, which comes with special badging, is no longer available. However, Rivian&#8217;s &#8220;Adventure package&#8221; trim, which starts at $73,000, is nearly identical in terms of offerings. The Launch and Adventure editions, for instance, come standard with an off-road upgrade with reinforced underbody shield, dual front bumper tow hooks and air compressor, as well as interior accents, 100% recycled microfiber headliner and “Chilewich floor mats.”</span></p>
<p>The R1T features a skateboard architecture that houses the battery pack, drive units, an independent air suspension that would prove handy, and thermal and lower body structure. This skateboard chassis integrated all of these pieces together, which means different top hats — or vehicle bodies — can be placed on top. This gives Rivian the flexibility and hopefully cost efficiency to make numerous vehicles using the same foundation.</p>
<p>The result, in this case, is a truck with a low center of gravity and 68 cubic feet of cargo space, which the designers and engineers provide in thoughtful ways that consider customers of all heights. (The two-layered frunk, or front trunk pictured below, being one such example.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209389" style="width: 2741px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209389" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2209389 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg" alt="" width="2731" height="1536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg 2731w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2731px) 100vw, 2731px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209389" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>The powertrain includes a 135-kWh lithium-ion battery, four motors for all-wheel drive, and a single-speed transmission that produces 835 horsepower and 908 pound-feet of torque. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That&#8217;s a lot of numbers that loosely translate to power, performance, and the added benefit of a planted feeling even while accelerating through turns.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">How Rivian architected the quad-motor drive — in which a dual-motor drive unit is on the front and rear axles —</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">is worth noting here since I was able to experience why its design matters. The four motors independently adjust torque, which provides traction control in a variety of conditions. in my case, it was dirt roads. This setup also sends power to the wheels that need it most, depending on the situation, which manages slip and helps control vehicle rotation. </span></p>
<p>The vehicle&#8217;s thermal control and battery management system allows for the vehicle to tow up to 11,000 pounds and a DC fast charge rate of 140 miles in 20 minutes at 200 kilowatts— neither of which we were able to try. Those two items are on my list once I get the vehicle to myself for a few days.</p>
<h2>The circuit</h2>

<p>The press drive started for everyone — except me due to a late plane arrival — at the Denver International Airport. From here, reporters drove about 100 miles along Interstate 70 up and into the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. The drive would end in Breckenridge, a popular ski town that sits at the base of the Ten-Mile Range. (TechCrunch, not Rivian, paid for my travel and accommodations. Rivian supplied the truck and meals.)</p>
<p>My time in the Rivian R1T would have to wait until the following day.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, and after an outdoor breakfast served on the Rivian camp kitchen, a safety check and briefing, we set off for the main event.</p>
<p>Most of the day would be spent off-road, although I would double-dip into the paved mountain highway driving portion. The initial route, which traveled along the North Fork of the Swan River before connecting to Deer Creek and Saints John (yes, Saints) trails, offered a circuit of rock crawling, a challenging V notch section and some steep uphills and downhills, and a few sections of speed-friendly dirt road that allowed us to try &#8220;rally&#8221; mode. (More on that later.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209284" style="width: 2741px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2372.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209284" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2209284 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2372.jpeg" alt="" width="2731" height="1536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2372.jpeg 2731w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2372.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2372.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2372.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2372.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2372.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2372.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2372.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2731px) 100vw, 2731px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209284" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>Drivers would eventually pass through the old mining camp-turned-town of Montezuma and then onto Highway 6, a curvaceous stretch of paved road that travels up and over Loveland Pass. The final part of the day varied in mileage depending on the driver. The afternoon route that I and the other reporter in the truck opted for took us up and over Loveland Pass twice and then back through Keystone, onto Swan Road and to our final destination.</p>
<p>The following morning, reporters again had a chance to drive back to the airport. In all, the first drive encompassed about 270 miles over three days.</p>
<h2>The handling and performance</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2208954" style="width: 1646px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208954" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2208954 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png" alt="rivian R1T back end" width="1636" height="858" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png 1636w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png?resize=1536,806 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1636px) 100vw, 1636px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2208954" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: Rivian</p></div></p>
<p>During the off-road section, the independent air suspension proved its worth. Drivers can pick from one of several modes: all-purpose, sport, off-road, conserve and towing. Within the off-road mode, there are even more options, including off-road auto, rock crawl and rally. There&#8217;s also a drift mode, which I didn&#8217;t test.</p>
<p>The ride height, damping, pedal map that controls regenerative braking, and suspension on the vehicle adjust depending on the drive mode. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For instance, in conserve mode, the vehicle lowers to about 8 inches; in off-road, it can be as high as 14.9 inches. </span></p>
<p>During our off-road excursion, we put the vehicle up and over steep slopes and even made a shallow ford. The ground clearance, combined with an approach angle of 34 degrees, a breakover of 25.7 and departure angle of 29.3 degrees, meant the vehicle never scrapped or stuttered. There were moments when, as I prepared to drive around a particularly large boulder — the standard technique in other vehicles — a Rivian employee would encourage me to just drive over it. And I would, without the negative results.</p>

<p>The only issue that cropped up during our day of off-road driving was the passenger window, which would occasionally lag or stop. While that would be problematic in production-spec&#8217;d vehicle, I suspect, and would hope, that these are the kind of minor glitches found and fixed in the weeks leading up to customer deliveries.</p>
<p>While the performance of the vehicle in these various modes proved worthy, the interface made moving between them a little wonky. More on that next.</p>
<h2>User interfaces</h2>

<p>The interior of the vehicle provides a mostly good balance of technology and physical components. The windshield wipers and gear selector are on stalks, and thankfully not located in the central infotainment system. And there are two thumb toggles on the steering wheel for controlling volume, skipping tracks and controlling the phone and Alexa voice assistant, as well as some of the advanced driver assistance features.</p>
<p>There is also a driver monitoring system (camera) that is meant to be used when the advanced driver assistance system, branded Driver+, is activated. And there is a driver display, which is simple in its design and delivers only a few pieces of critical information, including speed, a navigation map, if needed, and range.</p>
<p>Moving to the right and center is a rectangular central touchscreen that houses nearly everything needed for the vehicle, including a few items that I wish had a redundant physical button or knob. First, a positive note: the infotainment system skips the dreaded home screen button and instead places all of the necessary items permanently on the bottom. This makes finding and navigating to almost everything intuitive.</p>

<p>You won&#8217;t find me whining for more buttons and knobs on a typical day. But when headed up a steep rocky slope, I audibly wished for the ability to move the direction of the air vent without tapping the touchscreen and moving the small dot until the air moved away from my face. Nor did I love trying to change the brake regen levels while bumping along the trail or driving along winding mountain roads.</p>
<p>Some of that awkwardness would likely be erased after more time in the truck. Still, there are specific spots — the HVAC being the big one — where I suspect the Rivian customer will want the option to grab a physical knob or vent.</p>
<p>The software in my truck operated as it should, meaning in this test truck we didn&#8217;t experience any lagginess. My phone connected easily via Bluetooth and was able to play music. Notably, the vehicle is not equipped with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.</p>
<p>Rivian does have the benefit of being software-centric and has a cloud-based architecture that will allow for over-the-air software updates that employees promise me won&#8217;t require a trip to a service center. Instead, these updates will occur with some regularity and deliver new features and apps.</p>
<p>Tesla owners have come to love the OTAs because the company has used them as a means to deliver video games and other fun surprises. The Rivian seems, at least for now, to lean less on this. The &#8220;Easter eggs&#8221; in the vehicle were hardware-focused, which might be based on what Rivian believes its future customers want.</p>
<h2>Hardware accessories</h2>
<p>There are a few hardware components such as the keys, gear tunnel and gear guard that are worth mentioning at least briefly. I&#8217;ll be digging into all of the accessories, including the nifty portable speaker, tire compressor and flashlight, in future articles this week.</p>
<p>First up is the key. Or perhaps <em>keys</em>. Rivian developed four ways for owners to get into their vehicles: the phone app, a fob that has a carabiner-type lock, a credit card-like key and a bracelet. That might seem like overkill, but it is in keeping with the Rivian customer, who is active and likely on some kind of adventure in a remote area.</p>

<p>Next up is the Rivian gear tunnel, which provides 11.6 cubic feet. This is the central feature of the vehicle and the one design element that Scaringe told me remained consistent through numerous iterations of the truck&#8217;s early designs.</p>
<p>Inside the gear tunnel is an optional skateboard upgrade, which the $5,000 camp kitchen can attach to. But clearly, Rivian is preparing for more accessories — maybe a heater for ski and snowboard boots or a snap-on bucket for storing dirty biking clothes (I&#8217;m just making suggestions) — that can be attached to the skateboard.</p>
<p>The gear tunnel doors, which pop up once the user pushes a button on the pickup bed frame, drop down. The doors, which are robust enough for a person to stand on, provide more storage. In the photo below, a Rivian employee can be seen removing the compressor attachment from one of the compartments.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209238" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209238" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2209238 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg" alt="" width="2000" height="1499" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209238" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, there is a hardware and accompanying software feature called Gear Guard, which is included in the Adventure package trim. The system consists of a locking cable that is plugged into the truck bed wall and then can be connected to a bike mounted on the rack or other gear. Once connected, the security system kicks in, as you can see in the photo below.</p>
<p>The security system taps into the vehicle&#8217;s 10 exterior cameras and will record a person if they approach and begin to tamper with the gear. That recorded video and be viewed on the central display, stored and even shared. The missing detail is that this is not delivered immediately to the user&#8217;s phone app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209246" style="width: 2059px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209246" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2209246 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg" alt="" width="2049" height="1536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg 2049w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2049px) 100vw, 2049px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209246" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>I expect that Rivian will add that functionality as it rolls out and improves its app.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the beauty of building a vehicle from the ground up while focused on the integration of software and hardware: Many of these niggling details can be improved.</p>
<p>What Rivian got right just happens to be the stuff that would be the hardest to change. The truck has the off-road capability of a truck, the on-road performance of a zippy sedan or sports car, and the added benefit of quiet electric power, all without skimping on design, interior material choices, software or functional accessories.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the kind of inaugural effort that should build confidence in the brand. And I suspect will hit the right note with customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ring is just one part of Amazon&#8217;s annual devices and services event this year, but they&#8217;re bringing a lot of updates, including a new Pro Alarm suite that includes refreshed hardware and integrated Eero Wi-Fi 6 router capabilities. They also have a new service offering called &#8216;Virtual Security Guard&#8217; that basically keeps an eye on your Ring feeds the way you would in case you can&#8217;t, and they&#8217;re improving alerts on their existing Doorbells and Cams with smarter event recognition.</p>
<h2>Ring Alarm Pro</h2>
<p>Ring Alarm Pro is an upgraded home security system suite that includes a base station with Eero built-in. The base station doubles as a Wi-Fi 6 router that is mesh capable for linking up to other modern Eero hardware (which is some nice consumer brand synergy for another Amazon acquisition). Ring Alarm Pro also includes 24/7 backup internet thanks to 3GB of included cellular data use per month, with extra data available at $3/1GB. Ring&#8217;s Power Pack accessories can be attached to the base station to keep the internet up and running in case of a pwower outage, too.</p>
<p>The Alarm Pro base station also has a microSD card slot with support for cards with up to 64GB in capacity, which can provide local video storage for your connected Ring cameras and doorbells.</p>
<p>Like Ring&#8217;s previous alarm products, it works with their motion sensors, door and window sensors, and fire and moisture sensors and more. The company is also introducing a Pro tier of its subscription product ($20/month), which is how you can gain access to that cellular backup service as well as professional monitoring and (synergy again!) ad blocking, content filtering and threat protection services for your home internet via Eero.</p>
<h2>Virtual Security Guard</h2>
<p>Not to be confused with its new Pro tier subscription (which is offered alongside its existing, $10/month option), is a new separate subscription service called &#8216;Virtual Security Guard&#8217; that aims to replicate the benefits of having an onsite security guard.</p>
<p>Basically, this adds an additional level of scrutiny in terms of professional monitoring, through a partnership with monitoring company Rapid Response. Rapid Response personnel will keep an eye on the Ring camera and doorbell feeds you specific if you&#8217;re a member, responding to motion alerts and providing interventions including triggering sirens and lights, using two-way talk features, and even escalating to actually dispatching emergency services should they judge that that&#8217;s required.</p>
<p>Ring is quick to point out the ways in which Virtual Security Guard remains wholly within the control of the individuals subscribing; cameras are opted out by default, for instance, so that a user selects which will be monitored and when. Agents also can&#8217;t activate the cameras unless they&#8217;re green lighted to be monitored in either Home or Away mode as specified by a user. They can only see real-time videos via Live View, when a motion event is detected, and videos are not saved for download or any other use by the agents. Finally, any Privacy Zones set up by a user are hidden for monitoring agents, and the Ring app also shows live when Virtual Security agents are monitoring feeds, and any past Live Views seen by the agents will also be clearly marked.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s no word on specific pricing here, but it sounds like it&#8217;s going to be a premium since it requires that a user have a professional monitoring plan in place already. They also have to have an outdoor, hardwired video doorbell or security cam from Ring in place in order to use the program, and it&#8217;s going to be available on an invite-only basis starting later this year.</p>
<h2>Custom Event and Package Alerts</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2209167" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/package-alerts-door-state-ring.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209167" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2209167" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/package-alerts-door-state-ring.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/package-alerts-door-state-ring.jpg 1970w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/package-alerts-door-state-ring.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/package-alerts-door-state-ring.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/package-alerts-door-state-ring.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/package-alerts-door-state-ring.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/package-alerts-door-state-ring.jpg?resize=1536,805 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/package-alerts-door-state-ring.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209167" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ring</p></div></p>
<p>Ring has a lot of pretty flashy announcements this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/rings-home-security-drone-is-now-available-in-the-u-s-via-invite-only">including its flying drone actually shipping</a>, but the news that might be the most useful to most of its users is the introduction of new smart alerts, including Package Alerts and Custom Event Alerts.</p>
<p>Package Alerts do exactly what they say, offering you the ability to specify a zone of your choosing and get an alert anytime a package is present in that zone. So you could set it up to watch your front step or your porch, for instance, and get an alert about anything Amazon (for instance) drops off there.</p>
<p>Those are going to be available to anyone with Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 and Ring Video Doorbell (2020 model year) devices with roll-out starting today — provided you have a Ring Protect Plan.</p>
<p>Custom Event Alerts apply for Spotlight Battery Cam users, again provide they have a Ring Protect Plan, and will offer a bit more custom flexibility. So you can, for instance, use a still of your garage door closed as captured by your Ring, and a still of it open, and teach it to differentiate between those two states and alert you about state changes when they happen. Ring mentions this can work with gates and doors, and other types of state changes as defined by users. It&#8217;s going to start rolling out a bit later than Package Alerts, with availability expected &#8220;in the coming months.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Ring Jobsite Security</h2>

<p>Last but not least, Ring is targeting the contractor and job site management crowd with Jobsite Security, a product based around the Ring Alarm Pro that tweaks it for professional use with upgrades like Outdoor Contact sensors for keeping track of gate open/closed status, for instance. There&#8217;s also a lot of Safety Orange involved, which reflects the target audience (pun intended because safety orange is in part used for its reflectivity).</p>
<p>Jobsite Security is a team-up with The Home Depot, which will sell it exclusively starting at $399.99. It&#8217;s a smart extension of the company&#8217;s brand beyond the domestic sphere, and maybe a precursor to more B2B efforts to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, Ring announced at futuristic (slightly dystopian?) take on in-home security with its Always Home Cam, a drone equipped with sensors and a camera that can navigate the interior of your home along custom paths laid out by a user, in response to triggers including Ring Alarm sensors, or a manual command from the Ring app itself. Now, the concept becomes a reality as it starts shipping out to users in the United States — though it&#8217;s an invite-only launch at first.</p>
<p>Ring revealed the $249 Always Home Cam just over a year ago, and it said at the time it would ship in 2021, which it now is. The small drone only measures around 5&#8243; by 7&#8243; by 7&#8243;, which should make it more nimble when navigating your halls. The idea behind the device was to provide a way to essentially have a camera everywhere inside your home when you&#8217;re away, without requiring that you actually buy a whole bunch of individual cameras and put them in every corner.</p>
<p>Ring stresses that the Always Home Cam will only take flight when it&#8217;s directed to do so by a user, either via pre-set trigger or manually. It also doesn&#8217;t activate its cameras or record at all by default when it&#8217;s at rest in its base, which the company says is an intentional decision choice aimed at increasing &#8220;privacy and security.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re inclined to get in on the ground floor of the next generation of aerial domestic surveillance, you can go ahead and r<a href="https://ring.com/always-home-cam-flying-camera">equest an invite from Ring starting today to get on the list</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is preparing to roll out a trio of new features that will allow consumers to further personalize their Alexa experience by helping train the Alexa A.I. using simple tools. In a few months&#8217; time, consumers will be able to teach Alexa to do things like identifying specific sounds in their household, such as a ringing doorbell or instant pot&#8217;s chime, for example. Or, for Ring users, the A.I. could notice when something has visually changed &#8212; like when a door that&#8217;s meant to be closed is now standing open. Plus, consumers will be able to more explicitly direct Alexa to adjust to their personal preferences around things like favorite sports teams, preferred weather app, or food preferences.</p>
<p>The features were introduced today at Amazon&#8217;s fall event, where the company is announcing its latest Echo devices and other new hardware.</p>
<p>The new sound identifying feature builds on something Alexa already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/amazon-rolls-out-alexa-guard-to-help-protect-your-home-while-youre-out/">offers,</a> called Alexa Guard. This feature can identify certain sounds &#8212; like glass breaking or a fire or carbon monoxide alarm &#8212; which can be helpful for people who are away from home or for those who are hard of hearing or Deaf, as it helps them to know there is a potential emergency taking place. With an upgraded subscription, consumers can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/alexa-can-now-bark-like-a-dog-to-scare-people-away-when-1846142970">even play the sound of a barking dog</a> when a smart camera detects motion outside.</p>
<p>Now, Amazon is thinking of how Alexa&#8217;s sound detection capability could be used for things that aren&#8217;t necessarily emergencies.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209318" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209318" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209318" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.16.26-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.16.26-PM.jpg 868w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209318" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>With a new feature, consumers will be able to train Alexa to hear a certain type of sound that matters to them. This could be a crock pot&#8217;s beeping, the oven timer, a refrigerator that beeps when left open, a garage door opening, a doorbell&#8217;s ring, the sound of water running, or anything else that makes a noise that&#8217;s easy to identify because it generally sounds the same from time to time.</p>
<p>By providing Alexa with 6 to 10 samples, Alexa will &#8220;learn&#8221; what this noise is &#8212; a big reduction from the thousands of samples Amazon has used in the past to train Alexa about other sounds. Customers will be able teach Alexa a new custom sound directly from their Echo device or through the Alexa mobile app, Amazon says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, the enrollment and training process will take place in the cloud. But detection of the sound going forward will happen on the device itself, and Amazon will not send the audio to cloud after enrollment.</p>
<p>Once trained, users can then choose to kick off their own notifications or routines whenever Alexa hears that noise. Again, this could help from an accessibility standpoint or with elder care, as Alexa could display a doorbell notification on their Fire TV, for instance. But it could also just serve as another way to start everyday routines &#8212; like when the garage door sounds, Alexa could trigger a personalized &#8220;I&#8217;m Home&#8221; routine that turns on the lights and starts your favorite music.</p>
<p>Amazon says Custom Sound Event Detection will be available next year.</p>
<p>Along similar lines, consumers will also be able to train the A.I. in their Ring cameras to identify a region of interest in the camera feed, then determine if that area has changed. This change has to be fairly binary for now &#8212; like a shed door that&#8217;s either open or closed. It may not be able to handle something more specific where there is a lot of variation.</p>
<p>This functionality, called &#8220;Custom Event Alerts,&#8221; will start rolling out to Ring Spotlight Cam Battery customers in the coming months.</p>
<p>Finally, another Alexa feature will allow the smart assistant to learn a user&#8217;s preferences related to food, sports, or skill providers. (Skills are the third-party voice apps that run on Alexa devices.) Consumers will be able to say something like, &#8220;Alexa, learn my preferences,&#8221; to start teaching Alexa. But the learning can be done in subtler ways, too. For instance, if you ask Alexa for nearby restaurants, you could then say something like, &#8220;Alexa, some of us are vegetarian&#8221; to have steakhouses removed from the suggestions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, after Alexa learns about your favorite sports teams, the A.I. will include more highlights from the teams you&#8217;ve indicated you care about when you ask for sports highlights.</p>
<p>And after you tell Alexa which third-party skill you&#8217;d like to use, the A.I. assistant will default to using that skill in the future instead of its own native responses.</p>
<p>For now, though, only third-party weather skills are supported. But Amazon wants to expand this to more skills over time. This could help to address skills&#8217; lower usage, as people can&#8217;t remember which skills they want to launch. It would allow for a more &#8220;set it and forget it&#8221; type of customization, where you find a good skill, set it as your default, then just speak using natural language (e.g. &#8220;What&#8217;s the weather?&#8221;) without having to remember the skill by name going forward.</p>
<p>Amazon says that this preference data is only associated with the customer&#8217;s anonymized customer ID, and it can be adjusted. For example, if a vegetarian goes back to meat, they could say &#8220;Alexa, I&#8217;m not a vegetarian&#8221; the next time Alexa returns their restaurant suggestions. The data is not being used to customize Amazon.com shopping suggestions, the company said.</p>
<p>This preference teaching will be available before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Amazon says these features represent further steps towards its goal of bringing what it calls &#8220;ambient intelligence&#8221; to more people.</p>
<p>Ambient A.I., noted Rohit Prasad, SVP and head scientist for Alexa, &#8220;can learn about you and adapt to your needs, instead of you having to conform to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alexa, to me, is not just a spoken language service. Instead, it is an ambient intelligence service that is available on many devices around you to understand the state of the environment, and even acts proactively on your behalf,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.heydoc.co.uk/">Heydoc</a>, a system for managing the medical data and admin tasks in medical practitioners, has closed a $8.3m Series A round led by Smedvig Capital with existing investors Hambro Perks, Triple Point Ventures and InHealth Ventures also participating. This brings the total amount raised to date by Heydoc to $12m.   </p>
<p>Heydoc mainly operates in the UK but plans to expand internationally. It competes mostly with legacy systems used by healthcare professionals and clinicians. <a href="https://medefer.com">Medefer&#8217;s</a> customers are almost exclusively NHS, whereas Heydoc is only working with private hospitals and clinics at the moment. Heydoc also connects its clinic customers with various other healthcare providers (e.g., hospital groups, pathology services, pharmacies, etc.).</p>
<p>Launched in 2018, Heydoc, co-founded by Christoph Lippuner and Mikael Landau, adapted to remote consultations through the pandemic and capitalized on a broader switch to cloud-based workflow systems. </p>
<p>Christoph  Lippuner, Co-Founder &amp; CEO at  Heydoc, commented:  “This new raise will help us accelerate our growth in the UK, focus on our product and expand its capabilities, as well as go after international markets.” <br />
 <br />
Jon Lerner, Managing Director at Smedvig Capital, added:  “Heydoc has grown rapidly and proven that its platform can dramatically improve the way clinicians work and the quality of patient interaction.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year after launching its original exercise band, Halo, Amazon just dropped the follow up, Halo View. The company’s not quite ready to go full bore into the smartwatch category just yet, but it clearly has the Google-owned Fitbit brand directly in its sights with the newly announced Halo View.</p>
<p>The device doesn’t quite challenge the low end of the fitness band category currently monopolized by the likes of Huawei, but the $80 price point (which includes a year of the company’s Halo service) is certainly competitive in the mid-tier of the market – particularly among those with built in displays.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2209365" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo-Accessories-03.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo-Accessories-03.jpg 2632w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo-Accessories-03.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo-Accessories-03.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo-Accessories-03.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo-Accessories-03.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo-Accessories-03.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo-Accessories-03.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo-Accessories-03.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The product sports a color AMOLED touch screen, coupled with haptic feedback, designed to react to your activity in real-time. The wearable is waterproof for swimming and sports a week of battery life that can be charged to full in 90 minutes. Built in sensors monitor activity, live work out tracking, sleep and blood oxygen levels.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2209367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HaloView_and_app.jpg" alt="Amazon Halo View and app" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HaloView_and_app.jpg 1962w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HaloView_and_app.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HaloView_and_app.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HaloView_and_app.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HaloView_and_app.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HaloView_and_app.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HaloView_and_app.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Along with the new device, comes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/amazon-reveals-halo-fitness-and-halo-nutrition-programs-for-halo-subscribers/">number of different content features</a>. Halo Fitness takes on the likes of Apple&#8217;s Fitness+ with hundreds of built-in video courses from trainers like <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Michael Hildebrand, Elena Cheung and Elizabeth Andrews. Also new is Halo Nutrition, which is designed to help users create healthier eating habits. All of that is available as part of the Halo software offering. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Like Fitness+, real-time fitness metrics captured with the device are displayed in real-time on the screen during Halo Fitness workouts. </span></p>

<p>The Halo view will be available in three band colors (with more bands sold separate), &#8220;in time for the holidays.&#8221; The original Halo notably drew privacy concerns, with Senator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/amazons-halo-fitness-tracker-raises-privacy-concerns-for-amy-klobuchar/">Amy Klobuchar noting</a>, &#8220;recent reports have raised concerns about the Halo’s access to this extensive personal and private health information. Among publicly available consumer health devices, the Halo appears to collect an unprecedented level of personal information.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you speak to an Amazon Echo device, so far in its history, Alexa would connect to the internet to process requests and deliver a response. Of course, this has sparked concerns among some consumers, since it might feel worrisome to have a Wi-Fi-connected smart device listening for you to say a wake word at all times. But Amazon announced at its fall event today that new Amazon Echo devices, starting with the Echo Show 10 and the latest generation Echo, will be able to process voice commands locally, rather than sending information to the cloud.</p>
<p>Amazon claims it&#8217;s the first company to offer this kind of privacy-first technology on smart speakers. Last year, Amazon unveiled the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453205/amazon-az1-neural-edge-processor-echo-show-10-alexa-voice-on-device">AZ1 Neural Edge</a> processor, which powers current Amazon Echo devices, but its new Echo Show 15 will be powered by the AZ2 processor. Amazon said that this processor can do 22 times more TOPS (trillions of operations per second) than the previous generation.</p>
<p>In addition to local voice processing, the Echo Show 15 will support a new feature called visual ID. Alexa will be able to recognize individual users when they are within the frame of view. This means that it can deliver personalized content &#8212; so if you ask to see your calendar, it will know that you want to see your specific plans for the day, and not another household member&#8217;s work schedule.</p>
<p>Amazon said that visual ID is also built with privacy at its foundation. The feature is optional, and users must enroll to use it &#8212; all processing happens locally on the device, and users can delete their visual ID profile at any time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon today introduced <a href="http://www.amazon.com/glow">Amazon Glow</a>, a new, interactive device aimed at families that allows kids to interact with family members and other remote loved ones over video calls. While something of a competitor to<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/introducing-two-new-portals-including-first-portable-version/"> Facebook&#8217;s line of Portal devices</a>, which are also largely aimed at connecting families over video, Amazon Glow differentiates itself by providing more than just another connected screen experience. It also uses technology to create an interactive, projected space in front of the device to provide a surface for virtual activities &#8212; like games, art, puzzles, and more &#8212; to give the feeling of an in-person experience,</p>
<p>To do so, Amazon Glow combines immersive projection, sensing technologies, and video into a single device. Unlike other smart screens on the market, the Glow doesn&#8217;t look like a tiny TV. Instead, its 8-inch display stands up vertically and a projector creates a 19-inch touch-sensitive space in front of the display for playing virtual games and engaging in other activities with remote family members who are participating on their own tablets.</p>
<p>This gameplay takes place on a special mat, which is also included with the device.</p>

<p>With Amazon Glow, kids and their loved ones can play games like Chess, Checkers, Go Fish, or Memory Match. They can pick from thousands of children&#8217;s books to read together or draw using digital pencils, crayons, brushes, or spray paint, among other activities. The idea is to make the remote, digital play feel more like the sort of experience you&#8217;d have if you were in the same room with the other person.</p>
<p>The Amazon Glow can also do things that combine physical objects and digital play. For example, it can scan the child&#8217;s favorite toy then turn it into a custom jigsaw puzzle by projecting the digital scan on the flat surface in front of the device. The child then smashes the digital scan into bits with their hand to turn it into a puzzle. Or they can scan a drawing they made on paper then transform it into a new artwork, with their family member&#8217;s help, by digitally drawing on the scanned version.</p>
<p>It also ships with something called &#8220;Glow Bits,&#8221; which are physical objects designed to work with the new device. The first Glow Bits kit is the Tangram puzzle game, where the child uses the puzzle bits to solve challenges while the remote family member plays along using digital puzzle shapes on their tablet&#8217;s screen.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209254" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209254" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209254" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Amazon-Glow-Jigsaw-tablet-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Amazon-Glow-Jigsaw-tablet-1.png 8000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Amazon-Glow-Jigsaw-tablet-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Amazon-Glow-Jigsaw-tablet-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Amazon-Glow-Jigsaw-tablet-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Amazon-Glow-Jigsaw-tablet-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Amazon-Glow-Jigsaw-tablet-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Amazon-Glow-Jigsaw-tablet-1.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Amazon-Glow-Jigsaw-tablet-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209254" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>At launch, Glow will support special activities from favorites in children&#8217;s entertainment, like Anna and Elsa from &#8220;Frozen;&#8221; Woody and Buzz from Disney and Pixar&#8217;s &#8220;Toy Story;&#8221; characters from Mattel&#8217;s Barbie and Hot Wheels; Nickelodeon&#8217;s SpongeBob SquarePants and Dora the Explorer; Elmo, Zoe other others from &#8220;Sesame Street,&#8221; and others.</p>
<p>The device is mainly aimed at families who want to stay in better touch with others from a distance. This could be used with families where one parent travels a lot, with grandparents who live far away, and so on. It could also be helpful during this pandemic era, where families have been spending more time isolated from each other for Covid safety.</p>
<p>Amazon Glow doesn&#8217;t allow the child to just call anyone they choose, of course. A parent or guardian will have to first configure the Amazon Glow by providing consent and pre-approving the contacts the child is allowed to call. This way, parents could limit the device only to family members or trusted family friends. And at any time, the parent can disable the cameras and microphone by closing the physical privacy shutter on the device.</p>
<p>Amazon Glow is also not an Alexa device, so no voice or video recordings are collected. It also doesn&#8217;t track or save location data or even the drawings that are made.</p>
<p>However, Amazon will retain things like profile preferences and activity history to suggest relevant activities and content available with the included Amazon Kids+ subscription that families may want to try.</p>

<p>The device will eventually retail for $299.99, but is launching with a discounted price of $249.99. It comes with the mat, a mat case, the Tangram Bits puzzle game, and a one-year subscription to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home">Amazon Kids+</a>. (Amazon Kids+ is a paid service that offers unlimited access to thousands of kid-friendly books, movies, TV shows, educational apps, games, and premium kids&#8217; skills for Alexa.)</p>
<p>Amazon Glow is not yet broadly available.</p>
<p>Instead, customers will need to request an invitation to join the early access program at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/glow">www.amazon.com/glow</a>. The first devices will then ship to U.S. customers in the weeks ahead, said Amazon.</p>
<p>Developers are <a href="http://amazon.com/buildforglow">invited</a> to apply to access the SDK, which will be available in the first half of 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon, for the first time, is making another voice assistant available on Echo devices. The company at its fall event today announced a new voice assistant, &#8220;Hey, Disney,&#8221; developed by Disney and built on top of Alexa technology. The assistant will have its own unique voice and over 1,000 custom interactions for fans to explore, many of which will include authentic character voices and original recordings from Disney&#8217;s vast library. Consumers will be able to use &#8220;Hey, Disney&#8221; at home, and in large-scale partnership, Alexa devices featuring additional &#8220;Hey, Disney&#8221; capabilities will also be installed across Disney World Resort hotels in Orlando starting next year.</p>
<p>At launch, &#8220;Hey, Disney&#8221; will offer a variety of experiences for Disney fans, including jokes, interactive trivia, greetings from favorite Disney characters, and access to audio environments called &#8220;soundscapes,&#8221; which are inspired by Disney films. As users play with the new features, they&#8217;ll hear from favorite characters from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and more. Meanwhile, the experience as a whole will be guided by something called the &#8220;Disney Magical Companion.&#8221;</p>
<p>This companion is basically Disney&#8217;s version of Alexa, as it&#8217;s a custom voice that Disney itself developed to guide users through the new experience. While the companion&#8217;s voice has not yet been revealed, we understand that Disney used a real voice actor to create the sound, and the voice will be &#8220;male-sounding.&#8221; (Mickey perhaps?)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209331" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209331" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209331" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.21.20-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="379" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.21.20-PM.jpg 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.21.20-PM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.21.20-PM.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.21.20-PM.jpg?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.21.20-PM.jpg?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.21.20-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209331" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon/Disney</p></div></p>
<p>Starting next year, guests staying at Walt Disney World Resort hotels will find an Echo Show 5 in their rooms, which they can use to access the &#8220;Hey, Disney&#8221; experience. In this case, the assistant can answer the more specific questions a visitor may have, like what time the park opens, the fastest route to the park, or where to get a meal. Or they can use the assistant to make specific guest service requests &#8212; like ordering extra towels or food from room service. Favorite Disney characters will also be able to play personalized messages for the guests throughout the day.</p>
<p>Amazon worked with Disney on the new voice assistant, following the launch of the Alexa Custom Assistant technology <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-auto/2021/01/Amazon-Announces-Alexa-Custom-Assistant">announced earlier this year</a>. This solution allows device makers and service providers to create their own intelligent assistants tailored to their brand&#8217;s personality and customer needs. While automaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles was the first Alexa Custom Assistant customer, Disney&#8217;s is the first assistant that runs directly on Amazon&#8217;s own Echo devices. This solution is what allowed Disney to give its assistant its own wake word (&#8220;Hey, Disney&#8221;), distinct voice, and personality. It also connects customers to an exclusive library of interactions, most of which are only available after you first launch &#8220;Hey, Disney.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209333" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209333" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209333" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.20.50-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="376" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.20.50-PM.jpg 868w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.20.50-PM.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.20.50-PM.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.20.50-PM.jpg?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.20.50-PM.jpg?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.20.50-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209333" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon/Disney</p></div></p>
<p>There may be a few interactions that can be handed off from one assistant to another, Amazon notes. For instance, if someone tries to silence an alarm by saying &#8220;Hey, Disney, stop the alarm,&#8221; the Echo may respond appropriately &#8212; even though alarms are generally an Alexa function. However, beyond a few simple use cases, most of the Disney interactions will need to be directed by Disney&#8217;s own assistant.</p>
<p>The partnership on the Alexa deployment is also another major aspect of this new agreement between the two companies.</p>
<p>Amazon had announced its Alexa for Hospitality platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/19/amazon-launches-an-alexa-system-for-hotels/">back in 2018</a>, which has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/19/amazon-launches-an-alexa-system-for-hotels/">adopted by Marriott</a> as well as <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2021/03/alexa-hospitality-for-legoland">LEGOLAND Parks</a>. But Disney&#8217;s agreement represents a huge step forward for Alexa for Hospitality, as it encompasses thousands of rooms across the Walt Disney World Resort <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/resorts/">hotels</a> in Orlando.</p>
<p>Amazon told us the &#8220;Hey Disney&#8221; experience offered in the resorts will differ from the home experience, as guests will not be able to log into their personal Amazon accounts and Amazon doesn&#8217;t save the audio recordings for the in-room interactions. The in-home version of &#8220;Hey, Disney,&#8221; however, will adhere to the guidelines for other child-directed experiences running on Alexa. That means parental consent must first be granted, and customers can view and manage their voice recordings using the existing privacy dashboards and interfaces.</p>
<p>Related to this, Amazon also launched a new Disney stand for its new Echo Show 5 smart screen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon just took the wraps off the latest &#8212; and largest &#8212; addition to the Echo Show family. The Echo Show 15 takes the company’s smart screen technology to the wall in the form of a 15.6-inch 1080p display that doubles as a massive digital picture frame.</p>
<p>The $250 device is certainly a novel approach to the growing line that presently includes the Echo Show 5, Echo Show 8 and the Echo Show 10 (also priced at $250), which raised some eyebrows with a rotating screen that follows its subject around the room. The new device ups that particular ante with the addition of Visual ID, which utilizes facial recognition to identity a subject and offer them custom-tailored content.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209085" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209085" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2209085" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/echo-show-15_media_gif_1.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209085" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>The experience is built around a customizable home screen designed to serve as kind of a control panel for the Alexa home ecosystem. This is largely accomplished through customizable widgets, which let you add things like calendar events, to-do lists and recipes &#8212; effectively serving as a kind of digital whiteboard or collection of refrigerator magnets. The list also includes smart home controls, including feeds from security cameras and digital doorbells, which are housed as a single widget.</p>
<p>One thing the Echo Show 15 has in spades is a whole lot of real estate. That means you can get a whole bunch of different information at once, though a tiling effect or the use of picture in picture, when your in a specific service and, say, a video doorbell alert pops up. Really, it&#8217;s the dream of something like the cover of Samsung&#8217;s smart refrigerators, without having to having to shell out a few thousand bucks for an appliance with some cameras built-in.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the device can do pretty much anything you’d expect from an Echo Show at this point, essentially working as a big kitchen TV. That includes streaming Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu and Sling TV. That last one is coming soon, along with content from TikTok, which you can now watch on a 15.6-inch screen, if that’s your thing. You also can cast content from a handset onto the device.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209086" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209086" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2209086" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/echo-show-15_media_gif_2.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209086" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The 1080p screen is coupled with side-firing speakers. Those will probably do the trick for short clips, but you’re probably going to want to connect to another Echo or Bluetooth speaker if you intend to stream music or watch movies or TV for any length of time.</p>
<p>There’s a camera on-board, built into the sizable bezel &#8212; or the &#8220;mat,&#8221; if we&#8217;re keeping up with the picture frame terms here. I do appreciate the use of a white border in this case, which highlights the presence of five-megapixel camera in the upper corner. The presence of a virtually hidden camera can, no doubt, prompt further privacy questions, but at least here it&#8217;s a visible black circle on a white background, next to a flashing 15.6-inch screen.</p>

<p>The device can be used to video chat, which could ultimately make the product an interesting proposition as Amazon pushing its Alexa for Business offering as a method for incorporating more of its hardware into work settings. I could see a product like this serving as a (relatively) low cost teleconferencing device for companies with a tight budget and numerous conference rooms. When not in use, it could give you the weather and corporate events or room bookings on the calendar. Will be interesting to see if Amazon goes more aggressively after IT departments here.</p>
<p>There’s a physical shutter button on board to cover the camera &#8212; but anecdotally, I&#8217;d say that if I was staying at an Airbnb with one of these installed, I would be the guy who unplugs the thing and turns it to face the wall. Of course, I was also the guy who was supremely weirded out by the Echo Show 10&#8217;s face pivot feature, so take that as you will. When Amazon announced the feature last year, they were quick to note that it wasn&#8217;t using specific facial details for the tracking.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209091" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209091" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2209091" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/echo-show-15_media_lifestyle_4.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/echo-show-15_media_lifestyle_4.png 4800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/echo-show-15_media_lifestyle_4.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/echo-show-15_media_lifestyle_4.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/echo-show-15_media_lifestyle_4.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/echo-show-15_media_lifestyle_4.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/echo-show-15_media_lifestyle_4.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/echo-show-15_media_lifestyle_4.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/echo-show-15_media_lifestyle_4.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209091" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Amazon is quick to note here that Visual ID requires the user to opt-in and enroll their face. Users can delete their profile on-device or via the Alexa app if they have second thoughts. I anticipate the feature will become ubiquitous across the company&#8217;s various Show products with built-in cameras. The display is powered by Amazon’s newly announced quad-core AZ2 chip with an on-board neural processor &#8212; the successor to last year’s AZ1. The custom-built chip is designed to do much of the processing on-board, which means it won’t send Visual ID data to the cloud. Given Amazon’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/amazon-rekognition-moratorium/">long track record with face recognition</a>, however, the feature will still, no doubt, raise concerns among privacy advocates.</p>
<p>The Show 15 sports an update to the Sound Detection feature that rolled out in beta earlier this year. At launch, the offering was designed to detect specific noises, such as broken glass or crying baby, at which point it sends an alert to the account holder. A new addition called Custom Sounds, meanwhile, can effectively train the system for alerts by asking the device to listen.</p>

<p>The Echo Show 15 runs $250 and will be available later this year. I can&#8217;t speak to build quality here, having not actually seen the product up close, but for the pricing, one would hope for something more than just a scaled up digital photo frame &#8212; especially given the fact that it&#8217;s designed to hang on a while or sit on a counter or table all the time. It&#8217;s effectively the antithesis of early smart speakers, which were more or less designed to fade into the background. Countertop stands and cabinet mounts will be available as well, but sold separately.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon kicked off its big hardware event today by announce a new smart. The company worked with Honeywell to create the device, but is keeping its own branding on the product (rather than, say, Ring, Blink or any of the other smart home companies it owns). The device runs $60, though the company notes that many or even most homes will be able to buy it for a considerable discount with participating rebates.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2209317" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_03.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_03.png 8000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_03.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_03.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_03.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_03.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_03.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_03.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_03.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The notion behind the device is requiring the user to do as little programming as possible by tapping into the existing Amazon/Alexa home ecosystem. That means the Energy Start device knows when you leave the house or are going to bed and can adjust the temperature accordingly using the &#8220;Hunch&#8221; feature. If you want more control from there, you can adjust it more direct from a connected Amazon device.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209328" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209328" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2209328" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_01.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_01.png 8000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_01.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_01.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_01.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_01.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_01.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_01.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMZ-Smart-Thermostat_media_lifestyle_01.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209328" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>The company says the new smart thermostat will be compatible with most<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">24V HVAC systems. The device sees Amazon taking on the Google-owned Nest thermostat line. At $60, however, the new offering is a fraction of the Nest&#8217;s $200 asking price. It&#8217;s not nearly as good looking as Googles offering, of course, but there&#8217;s likely a large swath of the thermostat-buying publishing that just want a device that get the job. </span></p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s clearly  focused on simplicity here, with a big, bold temperature, arrow touch buttons and not much else. For the rest, that&#8217;s where connected Echo devices come in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two years ago, Notion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/work-collaboration-startup-notion-labs-cozies-up-to-silicon-valleys-top-accelerators/">partnered with dozens of accelerators and incubators</a> to provide free credits for its work collaboration platform to their portfolio startups. The firm is now aggressively making the program open to all startups.</p>
<p>Notion is launching a new startup program Tuesday to offer a credit of at least $500 to any startup globally to try its product for free &#8212; regardless of its size and funding status. Based on the size of the team, the credit could give startups access to Notion’s premium offerings at no cost for as long as a year &#8212; if not longer.</p>
<p>When Notion originally launched the program, it was attempting to “make sure that startups around the world adopt Notion,” said Akshay Kothari, chief operating officer of the startup, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Things have changed dramatically for the work collaboration platform in the past two years. The startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/notion-hits-2-billion-valuation-in-new-raise/">valued at $2 billion</a> in its most recent financing round, has emerged as the productivity suite of choice for many startups (Figma, Substack, Modern Health, Mixpanel, Buffer and Headspace to name a few), developers, creatives and designers among others.</p>
<p>The number of startups using Notion has surged 4x in the last year as businesses around the globe embraced remote working, it said. Over 50% of startups in Y Combinator&#8217;s recent batch have a Notion workspace, and 90 of Forbes&#8217; Cloud 100 companies have a Notion team workspace. About 28% of startups listed on Crunchbase that have raised over $1 million are using Notion globally.</p>
<p>It’s become quite common to see even startup founders in India &#8212; a market Notion has admittedly not particularly focused a lot on &#8212; share their pitch decks created and stored on Notion to potential investors. Many are writing announcements on Notion, taking and sharing notes with their teams in Notion pages.</p>
<p>Kothari said as part of the new push, Notion is also developing new templates to remove friction from such use cases. Additionally, it’s also launching what it calls a startup starter pack, which will feature guides, tutorials, livestream opportunities, customer stories and frequently asked questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our goal is to get to a point where Notion becomes a tool that every startup in the world goes to without even having to think about it,” he said.</p>
<p>To reach that level of scale, Notion is also partnering with two infrastructure giants that are widely admired by startups: AWS and Stripe. The two firms will now provide Notion’s premium offerings &#8212; to a certain limit of credits &#8212; to hundreds of thousands of startups in their programs, Kothari said.</p>
<p>Just as significant AWS and Stripe have become to startups, “we think Notion can become the information infrastructure with them,” he said. “Now that we have launched this, we will continue to look at forming more partnerships.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Notion has been a boon for the Stripe Atlas community, helping businesses of all sizes stay organized and aligned through all of their key milestones, and bringing employees closer than ever before,&#8221; said Krithika Muthukumar, Startups Business Lead at Stripe, in a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;re happy to bring Notion into the Atlas program and explore new ways we can support our community together.&#8221; (In a statement, AWS said its customers “rave” about Notion and it will explore more ways to strategically collaborate with Notion.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sisudata.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sisu Data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to help businesses make better decisions, announced today it has raised $62 million in a Series C round of funding led by Green Bay Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and NEA also put money in the round, along with new investor Geodesic Ventures. The financing brings San Francisco-based Sisu’s total raised since its 2018 inception to over $128 million. NEA led the company’s $52.5 million Series B in October of 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.bailis.org/">Peter Bailis</a>, a former Stanford University professor, founded Sisu Data out of his lab, spending years on research at the school before leaving to focus on the endeavor full time. The company’s mission is simple, even if the technology powering it is not: to operationalize the world’s data so that businesses can “make the best possible decisions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, businesses have massive amounts of complex data, but not enough time, people or the right tools to analyze it,” Bailis said. “That’s the massive problem Sisu is working to solve.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A typical organization has way more data collected than people actually use, because it’s cheaper and easier to get this kind of data and consolidate, especially in the cloud,” Bailis told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business metrics are constantly changing. By the time a company realizes those metrics have changed, and then attempts to understand why, a company could lose a lot &#8212; including productivity, time and money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sisu’s real-time “Decision Intelligence Engine” aims to give analysts and business leaders a way to analyze their cloud data to not only understand what’s happening in their business, but why it’s happening &#8212; and most importantly, to Bailis, what actions to take in response. The end result, notes Green Bay Ventures co-managing director Anthony Schiller, is that companies are equipped with insights they need “to make the best decisions in improving the operations, profitability and success of their business.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you&#8217;re a modern organization, you have information about where your users are coming from, what they&#8217;re doing, how they&#8217;re benefiting from your product or service, why they’re renewing and it&#8217;s kind of unbelievable,” Bailis said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the executive declined to reveal at what valuation this latest round was raised or any hard revenue figures, he did say that Sisu &#8220;more than tripled&#8221; its revenue and saw “steady customer traction” over the past year. Customers hail from a variety of industries and include Mastercard, Samsung, Wayfair, Autodesk, Upwork and Gusto. Bailis described the Series C as a “preemptive inside round.” He also noted that Sisu has doubled its headcount to 65 over the past year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also today, Sisu revealed two new products set to be released this month that it says will help it achieve its goal of “closing the decision gap”: Explorations and Dashboards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explorations aims to allow Sisu users to “quickly and easily” dig into, pivot and visualize metrics, without requiring code. Dashboards will permit users to view explorations, track metric changes and share key data drivers with colleagues and executives. Customers will be able to visualize their data in any way they’d like. For example, they could look at revenue by day or week and view that data with any type of graph, and then collaborate with others in the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sisu plans to integrate the new tools with its existing analysis capabilities so that its users can move between analyzing what has happened in their business to why it has happened, and what to do about it &#8212; “all on a single platform and without writing any code,” the company says</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of the conventional approaches on reporting and dashboards are really slow, and they&#8217;re incomplete and not ultimately actionable, or a lot of people who can’t actually make decisions, they&#8217;re saying &#8212; ‘here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on,’ ” Bailis said. “And so with Sisu, users can look at a result, such as revenue is down, and can go get a detailed comprehensive answer as to why, literally in seconds without ever leaving the product, and then can go and take that result, and share it out with their team, who can go in, create their own analyses and iterate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Sisu, he said, the machine learning and cloud native engine “does all the hard work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The benefit here is really simplicity,” Bailis said. “How you get simple answers quickly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Horowitz, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-founder and general partner </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at a16z, said his firm was first drawn to Sisu because of Bailis’ reputation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was impressed with what I’d heard about Peter&#8217;s [Bailis’] work at Berkeley and Stanford &#8212; especially from his PhD co-advisors Ali Ghodsi and Ion Stoica, who co-founded Databricks,” Horowitz told TechCrunch. In fact, Ghodsi had told Horowitz how Berkeley’s computer science department was so impressed with Peter’s dissertation work that they broke their own rule against hiring their own students for the first time in 20 years to try to get Peter to stay as faculty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The systems Bailis and his team built on campus are now the Sisu engine, and were already in use at big tech companies like Google and Microsoft at the time a16z first invested. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was amazing because these big tech players almost always build in house, but here they were using software developed by a twenty-something-year-old Stanford professor,” Horowitz said. “It solved a real pain point: even the best funded companies in tech don’t have enough analysts to make decisions from the data they have.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horowitz views what Sisu is doing in a similar trajectory as the creation of the spreadsheet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the days before spreadsheets, businesses had rows and rows of people at desks and each person would calculate one cell in a financial model, which was tedious. Then the spreadsheet was created and everything changed &#8212; anyone was capable of financial planning,” he wrote via email. “ We are in a similar spot with decision making. People can think in two, maybe three dimensions, but their data is now in hundreds of dimensions, with billions of data points. As a result, humans don&#8217;t make good decisions when it comes to data, and Sisu’s engine has the power to dramatically simplify these decisions and transform history.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.fairmat.tech">Fairmat</a>, a new French startup that wants to improve the recycling process for sophisticated composite materials. The company wants to produce new kinds of materials from material waste and sell them to industrial companies.</p>
<p>Fairmat just raised a $10 million funding round (€8.6 million) led by <a href="https://singular.vc">Singular</a>. Various business angels also participated in the round.</p>
<p>“We’re working on a scalable solution that handles the end of life of these materials,” Fairmat founder Benjamin Saada told me. He previously co-founded <a href="https://expliseat.com">Expliseat</a>.</p>
<p>The company believes that high-tech materials aren’t going away. Carbon fiber composites are extremely useful for wind turbines or aircrafts for instance as they provide incredible properties. But you don’t need to use sophisticated materials for everything.</p>
<p>That’s why we rely heavily on cheaper materials, such as plastics, wood and various metal alloys to build new stuff. Fairmat doesn’t want to replace carbon fiber composite in wind turbines and aircrafts.</p>
<p>It wants to replace plastics, wood and metal in everyday objects. The company is transforming existing carbon fiber composite into a new material that is both lightweight and robust.</p>
<p>“Today, carbon composite waste is essentially burned or landfilled,” Saada said. With Fairmat’s process, the company can recycle the composite material with a mechanical process that isn&#8217;t too demanding. It doesn’t involve heating carbon fiber composite waste for instance. The startup is also relying on machine learning to test the physical properties of its material.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fairmat then plans to sell its material to industrial clients so that they can use it themselves. For instance, you could imagine building the cargo box of a cargo bike with Fairmat’s material. It could be lighter than wood or metal and it also offers a better carbon footprint compared to virgin material.</p>
<p>Up next, Faitmat plans to increase the size of its team from 15 to 30 team members. The company is working on partnerships with suppliers for carbon fiber composite waste as well as potential clients. It expects to start selling its material at scale at some point during the second semester of 2022.</p>
<p>After that, the startup will iterate and work on other types of material with different properties. In a couple of years, if everything goes well, you might be buying a chair, a laptop or a car built with the company’s material without realizing it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monetization for the creator economy continues to be a huge issue and opportunity, but creators mostly have to lock themselves into platforms like Patreon to realize their value. A better method would be to have a membership system for creators which sat across several platforms.</p>
<p>Now, GMG Ventures (parent company of The Guardian newspaper) has unvested in <a href="https://unlock-protocol.com/">Unlock</a>, the developer of an open-source, Ethereum-based protocol designed to monetize and manage community memberships.</p>
<p>The $4 million funding round was led by VC firms including Betaworks, Cygni Labs, GMG Ventures, and Metacartel Ventures China, along with participation from early investors.</p>
<p>Unlock says its membership/monetization solution is used by artists, musicians, game developers (including Decentraland), writers, Discord communities, and others. It also plans partnerships with major media brands which are using its protocol.</p>
<p>Unlock CEO Julien Genestoux said: “With the funding we have raised to date, Unlock will continue growing to become the most complete, open-source platform to achieve this goal.”</p>
<p>Genestoux previously built Superfeedr, an RSS feed API purchased by Medium.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Unlock is an NFT-based protocol that records all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Use cases include a WordPress plug-in that allows developers to add a membership/subscription option, and a community-created plug-in for Shopify enables retailers to add an Unlock-based purchase option on their website.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Unlock’s open-source protocol for creator community memberships is poised to redefine the way creators interact with and grow their audiences in the years to come,” said Thomas Lueke at Cherry Ventures. “We look forward to celebrating Unlock’s growth as it continues to navigate this space and are excited to have invested in the company.”</p>
