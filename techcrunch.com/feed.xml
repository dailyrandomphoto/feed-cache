										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Our kids can&#8217;t read. As of 2019, roughly a third of US fourth graders were <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=147">unable to read at the level expected of them</a>. The scores have barely changed in decades. Something isn&#8217;t working here.</p>
<p><a href="https://litnerd.com">Litnerd</a>, a company out of New York City, wants to try something new. They&#8217;re writing books and building lesson plans with a twist: professional actors, streamed into the class, to recreate scenes from each book and — hopefully! — help keep students engaged.</p>
<p>Litnerd programs are built as four one-hour, once-a-week sessions. Students read the book between sessions; once a week, an actor is streamed to the class to re-enact scenes, bring everything together, and move the story along. Sometimes this actor&#8217;s segment is pre-recorded. Other times it&#8217;s live, with choose-your-own-adventure elements mixed in to let the students steer the ship.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Something about the whole thing just tugs at my heart strings. It reminds me of &#8220;auditorium day&#8221; in school; those rare days in which our school brought in a special performer — a singer, a motivational speaker, a puppet show, whatever — to somehow wrangle our collective attention. Those days felt so unique, so special. Even decades later, fond memories of those days stick with me.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s currently basing its lesson plans around existing stories and content, Litnerd has its own publishing operation in the works. The goal is to identify the categories and genres that best catch each age group&#8217;s (PreK through 5th grade) attention, then write books that, as the team puts it, &#8220;help celebrate diversity and inclusion so that all children can see themselves in the stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>Litnerd began its life during the pandemic under a different name: TinyBroadway. TinyBroadway shared a lot of its DNA with what would eventually become Litnerd — actors, beamed in through the magic of the Internet, work through lessons and crafts with a handful of kids at a time. Litnerd shifts the concept from B2C to B2B; whereas TinyBroadway&#8217;s customer was the parent looking to fill their own kid&#8217;s schedule, Litnerd dramatically expands its audience (and hopefully deepens its impact as a result) by working with schools.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2179964" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/litnerd-2.jpg?w=670" alt="" width="670" height="414" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/litnerd-2.jpg 670w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/litnerd-2.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/litnerd-2.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/litnerd-2.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /></p>
<p>I asked Litnerd CEO and founder Anisa Mirza for her thoughts on the shift via email:</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality is, the majority of Americans, some 95%, cannot afford homeschooling. ESP when it comes to K-5 years. And doubly when it comes to parents of children belonging to Title 1 schools (majority of NYC schools),&#8221; she writes. &#8220;This isn’t simply because parents can’t pay out of pocket. Rather, because for 95% of Americans, School represents free daycare (if both parents have to work a typical 9-5, they cannot afford to stay home and watch little Anisa, no matter how fabulous the online homeschool teacher is!). This is when I realized that if we truly want to disrupt K-12 (esp K-5) education, we need a solution that works from the outside in &#8211; being part of classroom time and funded by schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>Working with schools introduces new challenges and processes, varying a bit from city to city and state to state. In many regions, schools can&#8217;t just bring in a company like this on a whim — they&#8217;ve got to work with pre-approved, contracted vendors. Since becoming an approved vendor with the New York City Department of Education earlier this year, Anisa tells me over 14,000 students have taken part in Litnerd&#8217;s programs. She expects that number to double in the coming months.</p>
<p>Litnerd&#8217;s books, workshops and lesson plans are built around the social and emotional learning (<a href="http://www.p12.nysed.gov/sss/documents/NYSSELBenchmarks.pdf">or SEL</a>) practices that most US states expect, bringing in topics like self-awareness, responsible decision making, and social awareness to help students grow more than just their ability to read.</p>
<p>Each book comes with its own lesson plan, complete with worksheets and activities for the students and suggested dialogue to help teachers identify and highlight the intended learnings from the stories.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hwWy2UGT0_Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Importantly, the company seems quite mindful about how it all plays out from the teacher&#8217;s perspective. They know that most teachers already have far too much to do, and design lesson plans with the goal of minimizing the amount of work they&#8217;re adding to a teacher&#8217;s day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need SEL for the teachers, too,&#8221; Mirza tells me. &#8220;We need a social and emotional break for them, as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a pretty dang cool gig for actors, particularly as the live acting industry works to recover from the pandemic. Actors currently perform and record all their sessions from home; as Litnerd grows, the company hopes to open up coworking-space style drop-in studios.</p>
<p>Litnerd is currently focused on expanding to more schools in New York City, growing beyond that as the varying regional processes allow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Maya Moufarek, founder of <a href="https://marketingcube.co/">Marketing Cube</a>, spent more than 15 years working for companies like Google and American Express before launching her own growth consultancy. Today, her London-based firm works with startups around the world — and her startup clients have raved about the results, based on what we&#8217;ve heard in our <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">TechCrunch Experts growth marketing survey</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;She&#8217;s an absolute powerhouse who knows growth better than anyone I know,&#8221; according to Alice at <a href="https://theldown.com/">The Lowdown</a>. Nikki O’Farrell of <a href="https://katkin.club/">KatKin</a> told us that &#8220;[She has an] expert ear and eye from the world of startups/scaleups and growth. Her functional and direct approach allows you to execute at speed and see results quickly.&#8221; Constance at <a href="http://www.getluko.com">Luko</a> said that they &#8220;[r]eally liked her mindset, both hands-on, no bullshit while also super strategic.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>We interviewed Moufarek to get her take on lessons she’s learned from working with larger companies, how she applies them to smaller companies, her approach to optimizing her clients’ success, trends she’s seeing in growth marketing and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><em>(This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.)</em></p>
<p><strong>We received many testimonials about you through our<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/"> TechCrunch Experts</a> project that mentioned your direct approach and hands-on experience. How do you think those qualities contribute to your success in working with startups and forming strategies?</strong></p>
<p>The truth is, a lot of the time ambitious founders and executive teams don’t have a marketing background, so they need to outsource to find the right support to deliver on huge growth ambitions &#8212; usually within very limited time frames.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;Choose a marketer or agency with no direct experience and you may simply get the wrong answer for your situation.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In that situation, experience is everything &#8212; there’s no one-size-fits-all marketing approach for startups. Marketing strategies that help find product-market fit are very different from acquiring your first 100 customers, which is very different from scaling your customer acquisition or lead generation. There are also a lot of intricacies to this sort of role, which makes it pretty unique &#8212; choose a marketer or agency with no direct experience and you may simply get the wrong answer for your situation.</p>
<p>Having gained 15+ years of experience in a range of businesses &#8212; from startups to conglomerates, and experience of Series A to private equity &#8212; I’ve had the opportunity to actually apply the tried-and-tested practices of hypergrowth, as well as offer the full stack of C-level support. That’s why I founded<a href="http://marketingcube.co/"> MarketingCube.co</a>, a boutique strategic growth consultancy for innovative startups and scaleups.</p>
<p>Being direct is critical, because by their very nature, startups are after fast and transformative outcomes, not never-ending presentations and lengthy processes, so a hands-on approach is crucial. You need to get straight to the beating heart of the business, understand the culture, involve the right people &#8212; and be comfortable telling founders and exec teams things they don’t always want to hear. In return, they get a solid foundation, ambitious deliverables, and the right tools to hit the ground running and continue to do so after you leave the room.</p>
<p><strong>What lessons did you learn from working with larger companies such as Google and American Express that you use when working with startups?</strong></p>
<p>Now, everyone sees Google as this huge company with endless products and expansive teams, but back in 2005 when I worked there, it didn’t seem like a megacompany. It was post-IPO hypergrowth, but the EMEA and emerging markets I contributed to were like regional startups within a scaleup. At the other end of the scale, American Express was a more traditional and established corporation with legacy systems and processes that was beginning to go through a digital transformation.</p>
<p>So the lessons learnt from these companies vary widely &#8212; but there are some universal principles that are always relevant.</p>
<p>One lesson &#8212; which was especially true at Amex &#8212; is to always be prepared for shifting markets that may disrupt your business. That may seem strange advice for a new startup, but the economy is volatile and things change very fast. It’s hard to prepare for every situation, but you need to have the vision and drive to lead the market, as well as the means to execute it.</p>
<p>In terms of CX/UX, I tell everyone I work with that less is <em>always</em> more. It might be a cliché, but that doesn’t mean it’s not true. By this I mean, customers want fewer clicks, fewer words and simpler, more direct steps to reach their end goal.</p>
<p>Google really understood that it’s essential to provide your customers with a seamless experience and to delight them throughout &#8212; after all, customers are the lifeblood of any successful business.</p>
<p>If your organization is truly customer-centric, it’s always possible to deliver a digital transformation successfully or adapt to a changing market. Amex has shown how a brand and business can reinvent itself many times over.</p>
<p>Finally, always agree on a clear set of objectives and key results (OKRs) to ensure focus, prioritization and collaboration. Agility and speed are the competitive advantages of young businesses and OKRs help deliver that, as well as create accountability.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Has a growth marketing expert made a big difference for your startup? P<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">lease share your recommendation in our </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">survey</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>When looking at your portfolio, you’ve worked with companies in various areas, like Pexxi/Tuune in health tech, YuLife in insurtech and Andjaro in HR tech. How does your approach to each client differ to make sure you’re optimizing your clients&#8217; success in their field?</strong></p>
<p>The first thing is that &#8212; regardless of their specialism &#8212; every company is at a different stage and has different needs. So asking the right questions, setting the right goals, and including the right people and teams at the start is key.</p>
<p>Beyond that, each business model, industry and audience has its own principles, best practices and proven strategies. For instance, in health and finance, credibility and trust are critical. Whereas for an HR SaaS brand, the challenge is all around driving adoption because the market they are creating is totally new.</p>
<p>So, I always start with an audit of their customer base or target audience:</p>
<ul>
<li>What role are they hiring the business to do?</li>
<li>What problem are they solving?</li>
<li>What value do they add?</li>
</ul>
<p>I find Clayton Christensen’s <a href="https://marketingcube.co/the-framework-every-start-up-should-consider-jtbd/">jobs to be done</a> (JTBD) framework very powerful because it’s relevant to the product, marketing <em>and</em> strategy teams. It’s built on the assumption that consumers don’t buy products, they “hire” solutions … and they can “fire” them just as quickly if they’re not doing the job properly. It shifts the focus away from the “ideal” customer persona to the real issue and how to solve it.</p>
<p>Understanding the business levers and <a href="https://blog.growthhackers.com/finding-your-north-star-metric-fc1c1f71cbcb">Sean Ellis’ North Star metric</a> is vital for growth. It’s about focusing on the metric that directly reflects the value that your company and products bring to your customers. For example, for Airbnb that may be the number of nights booked; for Spotify, minutes listened to. It’s all about simplifying your strategy into something that is digestible, memorable and applicable.</p>
<p>The North Star metric is not a revenue metric. Revenue is the result of the value you deliver. Not the value itself.</p>
<p><strong>What do startups continue to get wrong? </strong></p>
<p>All too often startups don’t truly know their audience or make the mistake of thinking that brand-building can wait.</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/"> CB Insights</a>, “no market need” is the main reason startups fail, coming in at 42%. For me, this shows that too often founders do not fully understand the market potential and its alternatives, their customers’ pain points and anxieties, what’s pushing the audience away from their current solutions, and what the pull points are for the business.</p>
<p>This is why I really love the JTBD framework &#8212; it stops you from seeing the customer like a strict “persona” and lets you start seeing the solutions they need to find instead.</p>
<p>No matter what maturity stage or success level of the startup/scaleup, we often end up going back to customer insights and really stress-testing how well they know their audience to help elevate their value proposition, messaging and growth opportunities.</p>
<p>When it comes to brand-building, a brand really exists in the hearts and minds of consumers, which makes it hard to quantify. So founders often delay the brand-building process or laying the foundations for one. But an established brand helps increase perceived value, unlocking incredible margins or market share, depending on a firm’s pricing strategy.</p>
<p>Strong, effective brands are not built overnight. Many founders think that brand-building means costly advertising, which is not the case. Brand-building occurs at every interaction between a brand and its customer base across the purchase lifecycle &#8212; pre (advertising), during (how and where the purchase happens) and post (CRM, warranties, customer service).</p>
<p><strong>On the other side, what are startups doing better now than ever before?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, startups are working on bolder, more diverse and more impactful issues.</p>
<p>I started angel investing and it gave me exposure to a fantastic and wide variety of founders and innovative ideas. I have been fascinated by how far and wide founders are spread to help reshape our lives and change the future.</p>
<p>A few recent businesses that have inspired me are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.fairhq.co/">FairHQ</a> blends scientific research, data-driven insights and best practices to help you embed D&amp;I into your business.</li>
<li><a href="https://thefertilitycircle.com/">Fertility Circle</a> helps find the best tailored fertility information for parents. With one in six struggling to conceive, they connect individuals with a supportive community and provide access to expert medical professionals.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.hapiplan.com/">Hapi plan</a> empowers family and friends to invest in their children to ensure their financial security for the present and in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What major trends are you seeing right now with hiring growth marketers?</strong></p>
<p>I often hear founders say that “growth is the new engineering.” Tech companies have been fighting over engineering talent for as long as I can remember, and now it’s the same for growth talent.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I think there are multiple reasons: One being the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, as businesses heavily impacted by the crisis are now hiring at the speed of light. A lot of small businesses applied the “cut deep and early” recommendations to manage their cash flow, so they now need to rebuild entire marketing and growth functions.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a lot of funding going into startups at the moment, so there has been a huge spike in demand for growth talent. Lastly, as we’ve all seen, the crisis catapulted the digitization of businesses and purchase funnels for more established businesses that now need digital growth marketing talent to help maintain their sustainability.</p>
<p>During times of disruption, there is a great opportunity for innovation, and from what I’ve seen, this has made hiring managers and recruiters quite creative about how they go about sourcing and attracting growth talent. Lots have expanded their geographical search thanks to remote working becoming the norm. Some even applied account-based marketing best practices by building target lists of talent and creating automated sequences to reach out to them. It’s been really interesting to see.</p>
<p><strong>In your “<a href="https://marketingcube.co/hiring-growth-marketers-where-to-begin/">Hiring Growth Marketers — Where to Begin</a>” post on your website, you mention the T-shaped growth marketer. How has the shift in company’s priorities during the pandemic changed the skills that growth marketers consider essential in their T?</strong></p>
<p>During the pandemic, we had two categories of businesses: (a) those seriously impacted by the restrictions and (b) those who saw a spike in demand for services, like Deliveroo and Netflix.</p>
<p>Those severely affected had to pivot and pivot quickly to survive. A great example is Airbnb, launching digital tours and online experiences to support their hosts and ensure they continue connecting with guests. Another is Oxwash, previously exclusively washing laundry within the hospitality industry, who shifted their business to cleaning scrubs and bedding for NHS hospitals during the height of the pandemic. By adapting, they learned to clean to clinical NHS standards and help keep a strained health service afloat. For these businesses, the flexibility and customer development were the essential elements of the T in their growth teams, as they had to build an entirely new proposition on the fly.</p>
<p>On the flip side, businesses who thrived through lockdown saw an increase in requirement for CRM skills and merchandising. To find the right tone to match the mood of the nation &#8212; and curate relevant recommendations or services to engage with existing and new customers &#8212; was the name of the game. Data and analytics became an essential skill to make sense of the changing behaviors, and understanding how to manage pandemic demand levels, especially as companies like Ocado early in the pandemic struggled to meet customer demand and so allocated limited slots for delivery.</p>
<p>The wealth of knowledge and adaptability of the growth teams in both of these types of businesses shows how valuable T-shaped marketers are to whether businesses big and small fail or succeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal-owned payments app Venmo will no longer offer a public, global feed of users&#8217; transactions, as part of a significant redesign focused on expanding the app&#8217;s privacy controls and better highlighting some of Venmo&#8217;s newer features. The company says it will instead only show users their &#8220;friends feed&#8221; &#8212; meaning, the app&#8217;s social feed where you can see just your friends&#8217; transactions.</p>
<p>Venmo has struggled over the years to balance its desire to add a social element to its peer-to-peer payments-based network, with the need to offer users their privacy.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the company was forced to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/the-ftc-settles-with-venmo-over-a-series-of-privacy-and-security-violations/">settle a complaint with the FTC</a> over its handling of privacy disclosures in the app along with other issues related to the security and privacy of user transactions. One of the concerns at the time was a setting that made all transactions public by default &#8212; a feature the FTC said wasn&#8217;t being properly explained to customers. As part of the settlement, Venmo had to inform both new and existing users how to limit the visibility of their transactions, among other changes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, privacy issues have continued to follow Venmo over the years. More recently, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/we-found-joe-bidens-secret-venmo">BuzzFeed News</a> was able to track down President Biden&#8217;s secret Venmo account because of the lack of privacy around Venmo friend lists, for example. Afterwards, the company <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/venmo-private-friends-list">rolled out friend-list privacy controls</a> to address the issue.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179774" style="width: 398px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179774" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2179774" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Home_phone141.png?w=388" alt="" width="388" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Home_phone141.png 601w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Home_phone141.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Home_phone141.png?resize=171,300 171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Home_phone141.png?resize=388,680 388w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Home_phone141.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179774" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Venmo</p></div></p>
<p>In the newly updated app, Venmo will still highlight this friend-list privacy setting so users can choose whether or not they want to have their profile appear on other people&#8217;s friends&#8217; lists. Users will also still be able to remove or add contacts from their friend list at any time, block people and set their transaction privacy either as they post or retroactively to public, private or friends-only. It&#8217;s unclear what advantage posting publicly has though, as the global, public feed is gone. Instead, public transactions would be visible to a users&#8217; nonfriends only when someone visited their profile directly.</p>

<p>In addition to the privacy changes, Venmo&#8217;s redesign aims to make it easier for people to discover the app&#8217;s new features, the company says.</p>
<p>Now, a new bottom navigation option will allow users to toggle between their social feed, Venmo&#8217;s products like the Venmo Card and crypto, and their personal profile. The newly elevated &#8220;Cards&#8221; section will allow Venmo Credit and Debit cardholders to manage their cards and access their rewards and offers, as before. Meanwhile, the &#8220;Crypto&#8221; tab will let users learn and explore the world of crypto, view real-time trends and buy, sell or hold different types of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179776" style="width: 398px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179776" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2179776" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/You_phone111.png?w=388" alt="" width="388" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/You_phone111.png 601w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/You_phone111.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/You_phone111.png?resize=171,300 171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/You_phone111.png?resize=388,680 388w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/You_phone111.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179776" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Venmo</p></div></p>
<p>Venmo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/venmo-adds-support-for-buying-holding-and-selling-cryptocurrencies/">first added support for crypto</a> earlier this year, following parent company PayPal&#8217;s move to do the same, and now offers access to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. Before, the option appeared as a small button next to the &#8220;Pay or Request&#8221; button at the bottom of the screen, which contributed to Venmo&#8217;s cluttered feel.</p>
<p>The updated app will also include support for new payment types and expanded purchase protections, which Venmo <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-06-28-A-New-Way-to-Buy-and-Sell-with-Confidence-on-Venmo">announced</a> last month, and said would arrive on July 20. Customers will now be able to indicate if their purchase is for &#8220;goods and services&#8221; when they transact with a seller, which will make the transactions eligible for Venmo&#8217;s purchase protection plan &#8212; even if the seller doesn&#8217;t have a proper &#8220;business&#8221; account.</p>
<p>Because this now charges sellers a 1.9% plus 10-cent fee,<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/07/02/fact-check-claim-venmos-fee-changes-missing-context/7844100002/"> there had been some</a> backlash from users who either misunderstood the changes or just didn&#8217;t like them. But the move could help boost Venmo revenue.</p>
<p>PayPal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/venmo-to-charge-users-for-selling-goods-and-services-11624705202">said in February</a> that Venmo grew users 32% over 2020 to reach 70 million active accounts, and expects the app to generate nearly $900 million in revenue this year &#8212; likely in part thanks to this and other new initiatives, like its crypto transaction fees.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179773" style="width: 398px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179773" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2179773" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GnS_phone121.png?w=388" alt="" width="388" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GnS_phone121.png 601w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GnS_phone121.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GnS_phone121.png?resize=171,300 171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GnS_phone121.png?resize=388,680 388w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GnS_phone121.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179773" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Venmo</p></div></p>
<p>Beyond the more functional changes and the privacy updates, Venmo&#8217;s redesign also modernizes the look-and-feel of the app itself, which had become a little dated and overly busy. As Venmo had expanded its array of services, the hamburger (three line) menu in the top right of the old version of the app had turned into a long list of options and settings. Now that&#8217;s gone. The app uses new iconography, an updated font, and lots of white space to make it feel fresh and clean.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s changes also somewhat de-emphasize the importance of the social feed itself. Although it may still default to that tab, other options now have equal footing with tabs of their own, instead of being hidden away in a menu or in a smaller button.</p>
<p>Venmo says the redesigned Venmo app will begin to roll out today to select customers and will be available to all users across the U.S. over the next few weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos was so triumphant he was practically glowing at a press conference following the Blue Origin’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">first crewed mission to space</a>, 21 years after he founded the company in 2000. The billionaire talked about the future of the company and his role in it, and then casually gave away a couple hundred million dollars.</p>
<p>Bezos was one of four that rode in the RSS First Step capsule; the others were his financier brother, Mark; aviation legend and Mercury 13 veteran Wally Funk; and 18-year-old Oliver Daemen, the son of the second-highest bidder on the Blue Origin seat auction. (The $28 million dollar winner postponed his seat due to scheduling conflicts.)</p>
<p>The company now joins a very tiny circle of companies that have sent private citizens to space, in the biggest boost yet for the nascent space tourism industry. Tuesday also marks the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, the next step in space travel paying homage to the very first.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The press conference opened with the grinning foursome being pinned with astronaut &#8220;wings,&#8221; a badge traditionally granted to those that have gone to space. “I’m so happy,” said Bezos at the press conference, donning the same cream cowboy hat he wore moments after emerging from the capsule a little over two hours earlier.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RMzFmuNQcG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard carries Jeff Bezos and three crew members to space and back</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard carries Jeff Bezos and three crew members to space and back&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/embed/#?secret=RMzFmuNQcG" data-secret="RMzFmuNQcG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Bezos also thanked the city of Van Horn, acknowledging Blue Origin has made “a dent in it,” and followed by thanking every Amazon employee, plus its millions of customers: “Seriously, you paid for this.”</p>
<p>They also showed a brief video of the four crew members cavorting in four minutes of microgravity, including footage of the crew members catching floating Skittles in their mouths.</p>
<p>This is the second suborbital mission crewed entirely by private citizens this month alone, a first in history. The first was accomplished by Virgin Galactic’s VSS Unity, a rocket-powered spaceplane, on July 11; its founder, billionaire Richard Branson, was aboard, which helped foment a truly petty spat between the two ultrawealthy founders. That aside, the two flights have helped make space tourism more of a reality than ever before.</p>
<p>The flight will also likely be a boost for Blue Origin’s commercial heavy-lift rocket launch arm, which for the moment is largely occupied by Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The same technologies that are used to perfect New Shepard’s reusability could come in handy for the development of New Glenn, the company’s massive orbital launch. Bezos <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/blue-origin-pushes-new-glenn-orbital-rockets-first-flight-to-q4-2022/">said in February</a> that the company was pushing the inaugural launch of New Glenn from late 2021 to the latter quarter of 2022.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179811" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos-etc.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179811" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2179811" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos-etc.jpg" alt="Jeff Bezos speaks into a mic at the blue origin press conference." width="1024" height="609" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos-etc.jpg 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos-etc.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos-etc.jpg?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos-etc.jpg?resize=768,457 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos-etc.jpg?resize=680,405 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bezos-etc.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2179811" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blue Origin / YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>“The fact of the matter is, the architecture and the technology we’ve chosen is complete overkill” for space tourism, Bezos said. Instead, Blue Origin chose it “because it scales [ … ]  the whole point of this is to get practice” for larger and heavier missions.</p>
<p>On why Blue Origin chose liquid fuel, he reiterated that it’s practice for future launches. “Every time we fly this tourism mission, we practice flying the second stage of New Glenn.”</p>
<p>In December 2020, NASA added Blue Origin to its roster of space companies eligible to compete for contracts under its Launch Services II program. While it doesn’t guarantee that New Glenn or any other Blue Origin rocket would be awarded a launch contract, it’s the first step to getting there.</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos confirmed that Blue Origin will fly two additional crewed launches this year alone, but it has yet to announce the price per seat. “We want the cadence to be very high [ … ] We’re approaching $100 million in private sales already.” When asked how to get the cost per seat down, Bezos said the space tourism industry would follow the trajectory of commercial space travel, now widely used by millions of travelers each year.</p>
<p>At the end of the conference, Bezos announced he was starting a $100 million Courage and Civility Award, with CNN contributor Van Jones and Michelin star chef José Andrés as the first two recipients. The winner will give that money away to the charities of their choice. The award is for people who apparently demonstrate civility and resist ad hominem attacks. Reading between the lines (frankly, you don’t even really have to do that) it seems like a commentary on contemporary political discourse, especially the emphasis on civility in disagreement.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, the Amazon founder said he would split his time between Blue Origin and the Bezos Earth Fund, a $10 billion investment fund focused on climate change.</p>
<p>“This is not about escaping Earth. The whole point is, this is the only good planet in the solar system,” Bezos said. “We have to take care of it.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Even though Europe has a reputation for lengthy summer vacations, investors don’t expect much -- if any -- slowdown to come in Europe during this sun-drenched quarter.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The startup market is having a moment around the world, but few regions can brag as much as Europe when it comes to venture capital investment. Yes, the United States is putting up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investors-dont-expect-the-us-startup-funding-market-to-slow-down/">impressive numbers</a> and Indian startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">are booming</a>. But Europe is such a bright spot in the larger world of private startup investment that it deserves more solo attention.</p>
<p>The data coming out of the continent is staggering: According to a <a href="https://dealroom.co/reports/startup-cities-in-the-entrepreneurial-age">Dealroom report</a>, some €49 billion was raised by European startups in the first six months of 2021. That’s 2.9x as much as was raised by the region’s technology upstarts in the first half of 2020 and easily crests previous full-year records set in 2020 and 2019.</p>

<p>The epic start to 2021 for European startup fundraising crushes any preceding year that The Exchange has data for, erasing concerns that the continent simply won’t be able to create breakout tech companies that compete globally.</p>
<p>There are other signals that things are red-hot in Europe, including the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/wise-formerly-transferwise-confirms-direct-listing-on-the-lse-in-early-july-reportedly-at-a-6b-7b-valuation/">direct listing of Wise</a> on the London Stock Exchange. The company was valued at a huge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/wise-shares-indicated-open-10-bln-valuation-auction-2021-07-07/">$11 billion</a> price when it did so.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/the-zoom-five9-deal-is-a-big-bet-for-the-video-conferencing-company/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Rapid investment and big exits are now the norm out of Europe. Naturally, we wanted to learn more about where venture dollars may point in the future. What follows is a synthesis of market data and notes from <a href="https://twitter.com/dianakoziarska">Diana Koziarska</a>, a partner at SMOK Ventures; <a href="https://twitter.com/vinothj?lang=en">Vinoth Jayakumar</a>, a partner at Draper Esprit; <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/simon-schmincke">Simon Schmincke</a>, a partner at Creandum; and <a href="https://twitter.com/JavierSantiso">Javier Santiso</a>, a partner at Mundi Ventures.</p>
<p>The picture that emerges is one of sustained optimism, an expectation that venture investment is going to blast through traditional lulls and sustain a rapid-fire cadence during the rest of 2021. Records shall be smashed. But inside the various superlatives, a few sectors may do better than others. And Europe’s comparative gains in the venture capital world aren’t without impacts. Let’s explore what data says about the first half of 2021 in Europe’s startup market, and what its in-crowd expects for the rest of the year.</p>
<h2>Inside Europe’s epic start to 2021</h2>
<p>The European startup market is putting up notable results for both early-stage and super-late-stage funding. Dealroom reports that in the first half of 2021, some €18.1 billion was raised by European startups in the form of rounds greater than €250 million. For reference, the entire European startup market raised €16.7 billion in the first half of 2020.</p>
<p>But there’s also solid data indicating that Europe is doing a better job than ever in getting smaller companies off the ground. The same Dealroom report indicates that while Europe has created 15% of new global unicorns since 2020, it created 20% of new Series-A-stage startups and a huge 35% of seed-stage tech upstarts.</p>
<p>China, in contrast, is the opposite; the country has 8% of new unicorns since 2020, 6% of Series-A-stage startups and just 3% of the world’s seed-stage tech upstarts.</p>
<p>The interesting China dynamic is repeated in other statistics. Dealroom reports that Latin American venture capital is up 5.5x on a year-over-year basis in H1 2021. Asia excluding China is up 2.3x, as is investment in the United States. In China, a far smaller 1.6x growth rate was seen in the half-year period. But inside that data is the fact that every region we just listed set records in H1 2021, while China posted a figure that was sharply down from prior peak results.</p>
<p>This shows that regions that see a boom in investment can later see declines. But at least in the near term, that doesn’t seem to be in the cards.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaunspivak/">Shaun Spivak</a> is the senior director of Global Customer Support at RingCentral, a global leader in communication and call center software provider.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">There are many things I wish I knew when starting out with my small customer support team at RingCentral, but in the end, we figured it out. I’m going to share some critical lessons I learned along the way that I wish I had known at the outset, so that when it comes to scaling your own support team, you’ll have an idea of what to expect.</p>
<p>When I first started with RingCentral, we were working with a small-scale support team undergoing rapid growth. Our main goal was to maintain an excellent level of customer service with smart operational decisions.</p>
<p>You have some choices when it comes to scaling up customer support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase your employee headcount to cover the increase in customers. This is an expensive option, and onboarding employees too quickly can result in lower-quality training that results in lower-quality customer service.</li>
<li>Operate with a reduced staff and rely on decreased customer interaction. This increases wait times and can prove catastrophic to customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Hiring the right employees is critical. You want to find people with the right foundational skill sets and not necessarily the technical know-how to execute the job.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But the real strategy to embrace, and the one we instituted at RingCentral, was investing in the employees we were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/poor-onboarding-is-the-enemy-of-good-hiring/">onboarding</a> and ensuring all our existing processes were running efficiently.</p>
<p>While automating processes and developing new strategies to address customer support is essential, building an efficient and empowered support team is the real key to scaling your customer support operation.</p>
<p>Hiring the right employees is critical. You want to find people with the right foundational skill sets and not necessarily the technical know-how to execute the job.</p>
<p>A foundational skill set combined with robust training enables employees to thrive with whatever is thrown at them, like adapting to remote support in the past year. An enabled employee can resolve support issues faster, making your whole operation more efficient. That’s a real win-win.</p>
<p>As you scale and onboard employees, make sure they know their importance — emphasize the stakes in their role related to the business and value that responsibility. We want our employees to feel engaged, so we offer them opportunities to pursue passion projects tied to business initiatives and the opportunity to shadow across different organizations.</p>
<p>As you adapt to growth by scaling your support team, you’ll develop operational elements and firm work streams that increase efficiency, enabling you to further grow without the need to hire additional support.</p>
<p>It’s been a team effort to get to where we are now, so keep that in mind as you plan your growth scaling. Your support team is your most important asset.</p>
<h2>Lesson 1: Go beyond simplistic support</h2>
<p>While it’s convenient to buy into the accepted truth that customer support consists of only two departments — inbound and outbound, at RingCentral, I encouraged diversity within our support teams.</p>
<p>With different skill sets come support agents who bring something unique to the table. While developing our support frontline, I soon learned that talents could be utilized in a query-specific function. By placing the support associate in the most suitable role, we increased job satisfaction for employees while remaining highly focused on the customer experience.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of the teams we developed:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late last month, Facebook announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">Bulletin</a>, its newsletter platform. Unlike Substack, Medium and other competitors, Bulletin hand-picks its writers to curate a more controlled platform, with stars ranging from Mitch Albom, whose book &#8220;Tuesdays with Morrie&#8221; continues to break hearts in seventh grade English classes, to Queer Eye&#8217;s Tan France, who taught a generation of young people how to perfect their French tuck. Today, Facebook announced its first new wave of newsletter writers after its initial beta launch.</p>
<p>This next wave of writers includes 24-year-old Nobel Peace Prize Malala Yousafzai, writing about &#8220;big debates and small moments; Maria Celeste, a Puerto Rican journalist who will write Bulletin&#8217;s first Spanish-language newsletter; and Nedra Tawwab, a relationships therapist with millions of social media followers.</p>
<p>Bulletin boasts a breadth of free content and contains minimal Facebook branding &#8212; it&#8217;s hosted on its own separate website, not the Facebook app. But newsletter writers can choose which content to put behind a paywall, which readers purchase access to, of course, via Facebook Pay. Newsletter subscribers might also gain access to subscriber-only Facebook groups, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">Live Audio Rooms</a> and podcasts &#8212; so, Bulletin helps Facebook funnel subscribers into other products under its growing brand. But while Bulletin grows as a curated, invite-only platform for public figures that&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/23/raya-app/">more exclusive than Raya</a>, other platforms have struggled with the ethics of content moderation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We respect the work of writers and want to be clear that anyone who partners with us will have complete editorial independence,&#8221; Facebook wrote in <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/introducing-bulletin-a-platform-for-independent-writers/">a blog post</a> after Bulletin&#8217;s launch. And, after reading comedian Greg Mania&#8217;s Bulletin-hosted <a href="https://saveourserotonin.bulletin.com/560947961592303">essay about hemorrhoids</a>, this statement feels accurate.</p>
<p>But when we talk about &#8220;editorial independence,&#8221; we&#8217;re not really talking about the ability to publish an essay called &#8220;My Date With the Rectal Surgeon.&#8221; With this statement, the company seemed to be nodding to the controversial &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/substack-explains-its-hands-off-approach-to-content-moderation/">hands-off</a>&#8221; approach that Substack has taken with its platform. Medium has dealt with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/">a cultural reckoning</a> of its own, too &#8212; the platform used to host in-house publications like GEN and Elemental, which were written and edited by trained journalists, but <a href="https://ev.medium.com/medium-editorial-team-update-8679bcb9fe81">a pivot in the company&#8217;s vision</a> effectively shut down editorial operations. So, Facebook&#8217;s investment in platforming (a select few) journalists and writers comes in direct opposition with the emphasis from Substack and Medium on user-generated content.</p>
<p>Facebook isn&#8217;t the only major social media platform that&#8217;s interested in newsletters &#8212; in January, Twitter acquired the newsletter platform Revue, but aside from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/twitter-quietly-rolls-out-revue-newsletters-integration-on-web/">some quiet updates</a>, it seems like Twitter&#8217;s attention is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">focused elsewhere</a> for now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We know how much you love a good startup pitch-off. Who doesn&#8217;t? It combines the thrill of live, high-stakes entertainment with learning about the hottest new thing. Plus, you get to hear feedback from some of the smartest folks in the industry, thus learning how to absolutely crush it at your next pitch meeting with a VC.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, we&#8217;re introducing a special summer edition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> that&#8217;s all pitch-off, all the time.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition?ref=12c1c3225394">July 21</a> and <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition-july-28?ref=05f802c5b3e8">July 28</a>, Extra Crunch Live will feature startups exhibiting in the Startup Alley at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ecljuly2021suapost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=eclsuajuly&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September. Those startups will pitch their products/businesses to a pair of expert VC judges, who will then give their live feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is usually a combination of an interview with a founder/investor duo and an audience pitch-off. But as it&#8217;s summer, and Disrupt is right around the corner, we thought it would be fun to bring you even more pitches and even more feedback.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research says that counterfeit medication is the cause of 1 million deaths per year. One-tenth of this number comes from Africa. Counterfeiting is hard to detect, investigate, quantify or stop. It is a global problem, with annual earnings from substandard drugs standing at over $100 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some technologies have helped deal with this menace; for instance, radio frequency identification, which works by assigning serial numbers to containers of each product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More modern approaches are being adopted these days, which is the case of <a href="https://www.rxall.net/">RxAll</a>, a startup using deep technology to provide quality medication to patients</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the U.S. and Nigerian-based company is announcing a financing round of $3.15 million to scale across existing markets and improve its technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RxAll </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2016 by <a href="https://www.rxall.net/about-us">Adebayo Alonge</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amykao02">Amy Kao</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/wei-liu-05d8">Wei Lui</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As students at Yale University, the trio came together to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solve a problem they faced firsthand, either </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or relating to a loved one</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2006, Alonge was a victim of fake pharmaceuticals and almost died after taking medicine that contained lethal levels of diazepam</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He went into a coma for three weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I survived a 21-day coma in Nigeria 15 years ago. My co-founder, Amy, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was hospitalized</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Thailand after taking counterfeit medicine. And Wei lost a family member due to contaminated drugs,&#8221; Alonge told TechCrunch over a call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on an R&amp;D project at the college&#8217;s chemistry department, Alonge, Kao, and Lui began to analyze how to use machine learning and molecular spectroscopy for drug quality and material and quality assurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big idea was to address the problem of poor access to high-quality medicine across Africa first, then the rest of the world by building a marketplace for authenticating the sale of safe and reputable pharmaceuticals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After going through that, information out there further confirmed that what we experienced wasn&#8217;t a one-off situation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s an ongoing problem; 100,000 Africans die from this problem every year. One million people die across the world from this problem,&#8221; CEO Alonge continued. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its proprietary technology, RxScanner, is a handheld authenticator designed for patients to verify their drugs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, the RxScanner can identify the quality of prescription drugs in 20 seconds and display results in real-time via mobile apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RxAll curates high-quality sellers to its marketplace and provides them with the RxScanner. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The machine learning model reads the sample spectra and send test results indicating the identity and the quality versus the reference</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sellers can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be found by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using the filter, and o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nce the batch testing is done, the seller can push out the product into the marketplace and make it available for on-demand ordering, pick-up and deliveries as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company makes money through commissions via transactions made on the marketplace. It also employs a subscription model with the RxScanner for individual and business customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the company&#8217;s innovation, funding has been few and far between, as with many deep tech platforms with a significant focus on Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to the long cycle from research to commercialization of such ventures, so most VCs would instead get involved in the company&#8217;s later stages</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, RxAll has stayed alive by winning grants and prize monies at competitions, with some equity financing from the likes of Africa-focused accelerator <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/09/21/rxall-founders-factory-africa/">Founders Factory Africa</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alonge sees RxAll as a pioneer in the world of deep tech mixed with health tech. He reckons there&#8217;s no direct competition with how the RxScanner operates, at least for the time being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pharmaceutical e-commerce, yes that&#8217;s a different ballgame. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drug testing, the only other solutions out there are laboratory equipment, and they can be expensive. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in the space we play in, the application area, the price point, the way we&#8217;re going about it using deep learning and mobile phones, there&#8217;s no comparison,&#8221; the CEO said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, technological edge alone does not sell a product or run a business. With RxAll, the key to scaling its tech, according to Alonge is making its products affordable for the market despite the costs incurred. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s a challenge the company is taking strides to tackle </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to making its technology easier for investors to understand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179733" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179733" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2179733" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rxall-team.jpg?w=680" alt="RxAll" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rxall-team.jpg 987w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rxall-team.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rxall-team.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rxall-team.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rxall-team.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rxall-team.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179733" class="wp-caption-text">A part of the RxAll team</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RxAll describes itself as a company playing in a global market. But as highlighted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a bulk of its customers and revenues come from Africa, especially Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is currently serving ten cities and is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> validating the authenticity of drugs for 1 million patients while servicing over 2,000 hospitals and pharmacies in the West African nation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company has plans to add an extra 14 cities before this year runs out, with a pan-African play set in motion for next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This financing round is a cumulation of a recently closed $2 million seed round (oversubscribed with $2.25 million) and a $900,000 pre-seed raised at the tail end of last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Launch Africa led the round with participation from SOSV’s HAX and Keisuke Honda via his KSK fund.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the round, managing partner at Launch Africa Ventures Zachariah George said, &#8220;Launch Africa Ventures </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be co-leading this round of financing into a strong, experienced team at RxAll</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that RxAll is bridging a major gap in access to quality healthcare in Africa by pioneering a drug delivery platform to enable pharmacies and patients to buy authenticated medicines online</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to achieve favourable unit economics and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revenue streams by leveraging anti-counterfeiting mobile spectrometer technology, owning the entire drug delivery supply chain and their own payment wallet, provides a massive growth and scaling opportunity across Africa and beyond</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duncan Turner, general partner at SOSV and managing director of HAX added, &#8220;We’ve been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incredibly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> impressed by RxAll’s ability to scale and meet customer demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the last year, the team has brought together world-class hard tech and operational excellence to solve pressing issues for over a million Nigerians, and we couldn’t be more excited by their vision for the broader pharmaceutical market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what&#8217;s next for RxAll? Alonge said the company&#8217;s next focus is on partnerships. According to him, they will be integral in RxAll&#8217;s push to scale its marketplace and scanner across Nigeria, Africa and the rest of the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Asides from the hospitals, pharmacies and patients, we also sell to governments and country FDAs on the scanner side of things. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we&#8217;re looking to secure key partnerships globally, not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Nigeria, but across Africa, Southeast Asia, North America and South America</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Those are the key markets we&#8217;re looking to scale into.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube announced its latest feature, Super Thanks, on Tuesday. This is YouTube&#8217;s fourth Paid Digital Good, which is what the platform calls any product that lets fans directly pay creators. So far, these tools include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/12/youtube-launches-super-chat-a-way-for-creators-to-make-money-from-their-live-streams/">Super Chat</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/youtube-rolls-out-super-stickers-a-new-way-for-creators-to-make-money/">Super Stickers</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/youtube-introduces-channel-memberships-merchandise-and-premieres/">channel subscriptions</a> &#8212; but Super Thanks is YouTube&#8217;s first of these features that allows fans to tip creators for individual uploaded videos rather than livestreams.</p>
<p>If a viewer wants to show extra appreciation for a video, they can pay creators with one of four pre-set amounts, ranging between $2 and $50 in their local currency. When viewers buy Super Thanks, they can leave a message, which will appear highlighted in the comments section.</p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s previous tools for direct payments to creators seemed like a way to play catch-up with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/twitch-breaks-records-again-in-q2-topping-5b-total-hours-watched/">Twitch</a>, but the platform is now differentiating itself with Super Thanks. Even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/instagram-rolls-out-fan-badges-for-live-videos-expands-igtv-ads-test/">Instagram</a> has features that let users tip creators when they go Live, like Badges, but lacks a way for creators to receive a one-time payment for a post or a reel. Instead, Instagram has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/facebook-whatsapp-e-commerce-features/">pivoted hard to e-commerce</a>, which feels like a less organic or direct way for fans to engage with creators than a product like Super Thanks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2179163" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179163" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2179163" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube.gif?w=315" alt="An animation showing how Super Thanks works on YouTube" width="315" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179163" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>Last year was YouTube&#8217;s biggest for Paid Digital Goods &#8212; in 2020, more than 10 million users purchased either a Super Chat, Super Sticker or channel subscription for the first time on the platform. The number of channels that earned a majority of their revenue from these products in 2020 was more than 3x in 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my spare time, I&#8217;m a YouTube creator,&#8221; said Barbara Macdonald, YouTube&#8217;s product manager for Paid Digital Goods. &#8220;I&#8217;m fortunate enough that my insights as a creator have been able to help myself and my team create better products for our users on YouTube.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 tips for brands that want to succeed in the new era of influencer marketing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/5-tips-for-brands-that-want-to-succeed-in-the-new-era-of-influencer-marketing/embed/#?secret=HdEJJl8pUy" data-secret="HdEJJl8pUy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since 2019, Macdonald and her team have been working with a group of YouTube creators to pilot this feature, originally called &#8220;applause,&#8221; as beta testers. These creators provided feedback and suggestions on the product, which YouTube took into consideration &#8212; they suggested changing the name from &#8220;applause,&#8221; adding higher pricing options to maximize revenue potential and differentiating a Super Thanks message from other comments. YouTube takes 30% of revenue from fans&#8217; payments to creators, while competitor Twitch takes 50% of streamers&#8217; subscription revenue.</p>
<p>Starting today, Super Thanks functionality will expand to thousands of creators in 68 countries who are members of the YouTube Partner Program. The expansion is randomized, Macdonald told TechCrunch, but will roll out to all eligible creators in the YouTube Partner Program by the end of this year.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So now, maybe instead of YouTubers ending each video with a reminder to &#8220;like, comment and subscribe,&#8221; it&#8217;ll be, &#8220;like, comment, subscribe and Super Thanks.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a bid to boost sign-ups to its streaming service, HBO Max is partnering with Snap to bring free episodes from its original programing to Snapchat users in the U.S. The episodes will stream via a Snap Mini &#8212; the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/snap-turns-on-minis-bite-sized-third-party-apps-in-snapchat/">bite-sized third-party apps</a> that live within Snapchat. The experience will offer users a way to watch top titles, including both new releases like the rebooted &#8220;Gossip Girl&#8221; as well as fan favorites like &#8220;Game of Thrones,&#8221; among others, while chatting with friends.</p>
<p>To use the feature, Snapchat users will launch the HBO Max Mini experience through the rocket icon that appears within Chat or through Search. Viewers are then required to enter their birthdate to access a curated collection of age-appropriate episodes.</p>
<p>But what makes the experience more interesting than just being another way to stream TV on your phone are the interactive elements the Snap Mini experience provides. Users can invite up to 63 other Snapchat friends to co-watch the shows with them by sending an in-chat message with a link to join the Snap Mini or by sending a clickable sticker link using Snapchat&#8217;s camera. When others join the Mini, their playback will sync up with their friends&#8217; viewing, and they&#8217;ll be able to chat as they watch and share Bitmoji reactions with one another. (Separately, Snapchat just <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/snapchat-bitmoji-3d-1234983864/">announced</a> an upgraded Bitmoji experience involving 3D Bitmoji, but this is focused on users&#8217; profiles.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Co-watching experiences had become popular last year during the pandemic, as family and friends remained apart under COVID lockdown measures. Since users couldn&#8217;t be together in-person, they connected online to watch TV and movies with their loved ones, via <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/03/17/coronavirus-netflix-party-lets-friends-do-movie-nights-quarantine/5072347002/">third-party extensions like Netflix Party</a> and other services. Some streamers, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/amazon-prime-video-introduces-watch-party-a-social-coviewing-experience-included-with-prime/">Amazon Prime Video</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/hulu-officially-launches-its-co-viewing-feature-watch-party/">Hulu</a>, even built co-watching tools directly into their platforms. HBO Max, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/scener-now-lets-you-co-watch-hbo-or-netflix-in-a-virtual-theater-with-up-to-20-people/">worked with browser extension maker Scener</a> to make co-watching possible.</p>

<p>With its Snap Mini, HBO Max is now offering another way for friends to socialize online around favorite shows, where it&#8217;s not just about chatting inside the streamers&#8217; own app, but instead about using a co-watching experience to drive sign-ups for the paid subscription.</p>
<p>According to HBO Max&#8217;s owner, WarnerMedia, the plan will be to use the Snap Mini to entice users to subscribe by presenting the option to go to HBO Max after the episode wraps so they can continue watching the series. (This will only be shown to users 18 and up, the company says).</p>
<p>In addition, the Snap Mini experience allows users to sample some of HBO Max&#8217;s content before committing to becoming a paid subscriber, as an alternative to a free trial where users tend to have to enter their payment card information.</p>
<p>The available titles will be refreshed on an ongoing basis. But for now, the first episode from a number of HBO Max shows will be offered, including &#8220;Craftopia,&#8221; &#8220;Euphoria,&#8221; &#8220;The Flight Attendant,&#8221; &#8220;Game of Thrones,&#8221; &#8220;Genera+ion,&#8221; &#8220;Gossip Girl&#8221; (2021), &#8220;Looney Tunes,&#8221; &#8220;Love Life,&#8221; &#8220;Lovecraft Country,&#8221; &#8220;Selena + Chef,&#8221; &#8220;Titans,&#8221; &#8220;Warrior&#8221; and &#8220;World of Calm.&#8221; The lineup will also include Episode 1 of the second season of &#8220;Betty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People love to come together to watch their favorite HBO Max shows and talk about what’s unfolding,&#8221; said HBO Max EVP, DTC Global Product Management, Sarah Lyons. &#8220;Our partnership with Snapchat is another step towards fulfilling that desire for human connection and providing our fans with co-viewing opportunities, while deepening their emotional relationship with the brand. We believe humans value recommendations that come from other humans, so having the opportunity for friends to suggest, and then subsequently watch content together paves the way for more meaningful discovery,&#8221; she added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ChargePoint struck a deal to buy European charging software company has·to·be for €250 million ($295 million) in cash and stock, the electric vehicle charging network&#8217;s first acquisition since it became a publicly traded company.</p>
<p>Through the deal, ChargePoint gains more than just 125 employees and the company&#8217;s operating software, which manages more than 40,000 networked ports in Europe. The acquisition will give ChargePoint a boost in its pursuit to gain market share beyond North America, as well as VW Group as a strategic partner.</p>
<p>VW Group was an early investor in has·to·be, which was founded in 2013, and will continue a relationship with ChargePoint along with other customers of the software company, <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">such as Ionity, Audi, Porsche, BP, Total, Lidl and GP Joule. ChargePopint will also add to its operations has·to·be offices in </span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Munich, Salzburg and Vienna. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ChargePoint designs, develops and manufactures hardware and accompanying software, as well as a cloud subscription platform, for electric vehicles. The company might be best-known for its branded public and semi-public charging spots that consumers use to charge their personal electric cars and SUVs, as well as its home chargers. However, ChargePoint also has a commercial-focused business that provides hardware and software to help fleet operators manage their delivery vans, buses and cars.</p>

<p>In all, the company has more than 115,000 charging spots globally. ChargePoint also offers access to an additional 133,000 public places to charge through network roaming integrations across North America and Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our continued investment in Europe is critical to our stated growth strategy,&#8221; ChargePoint president and CEO Pasquale Romano said in a statement, later adding that the companies&#8217;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> combined assets &#8220;should position us to accelerate our leadership as electrification continues to take hold across continents.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>ChargePoint agreed in September to merge with special-purpose acquisition company Switchback Energy Acquisition Corporation, with a market valuation of $2.4 billion. ChargePoint was able to raise $225 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, led by institutional investors including Baillie Gifford and funds managed by Neuberger Berman Alternatives Advisors.</p>
<p>ChargePoint said at the time that it planned to use the new capital to expand in North America and Europe, improve its technology portfolio and significantly scale its commercial, fleet and residential businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/">TechCrunch’s China Roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">A tectonic shift is underway in how Beijing regulates and accesses the troves of citizen data collected by its tech giants. More details of China&#8217;s new cybersecurity rules have recently come to light as Didi, the SoftBank-backed ride-sharing dominator in China, became the target of the Chinese government&#8217;s latest effort to heighten data protection. This week, we look at what this changing landscape means to Chinese tech firms wooing investors in the United States.</p>
<h2>Data sovereignty</h2>
<p>The new wave of discussion around China&#8217;s cybersecurity rules started with the bombshell dropped on Didi. Just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/will-didis-regulatory-problems-make-it-harder-for-chinese-startups-to-go-public-in-the-us/">two days after its $4 billion IPO</a> in New York, the ride-hailing giant was <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2021-07/02/c_1626811521011934.htm">hit with a probe</a> by China&#8217;s Cybersecurity Review Office on July 2. Two days later, the same government agency ordered the Didi app, which has amassed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/softbank-uber-tencent-set-to-reap-rewards-from-didi-ipo/">nearly 500 million</a> annual users, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/04/didi-app-pulled-from-app-stores-after-suspension-order/">to be yanked</a> because it was &#8220;illegally collecting user data.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Cybersecurity Review Office is an agency within the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country&#8217;s top internet regulator. It has existed for a few years but its roles were only made clear in April 2020 when China put forward its<a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2020-04/27/c_1589535450769077.htm"> rules on internet security reviews</a>.</p>
<p>Didi appears to be the first target of the department&#8217;s enforcement actions. A memo of an &#8220;expert meeting&#8221; shared among Didi&#8217;s investors, which TechCrunch reviewed, said the ride-hailing firm had failed to assure Beijing its data practices were secure before going public in New York. A major concern was that Didi&#8217;s data, if unguarded by Chinese laws, could be subject to scrutiny by U.S. regulators. But a Didi executive claimed that the firm stored all its China data locally and it is &#8220;absolutely not possible&#8221; that it passed data to the U.S.</p>
<p>Before long, the Cybersecurity Review Office was onto other players that could similarly compromise the data security of Chinese users. <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2021-07/05/c_1627071328950274.htm">On July 5</a>, it put SoftBank-backed truck-sharing platform Full Truck Alliance and recruiting site Boss Zhipin &#8212; both of which recently IPO&#8217;ed in the U.S. &#8212; under the same review process as it did with Didi.</p>
<p>The probes were just the beginning. On <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2021-07/10/c_1627503724456684.htm">July 10,</a> the Cybersecurity Review Office unveiled the draft of a revised version of the data security review rules passed last year. One of the major changes is that any business commanding over one million users is subject to security checks if it is seeking an overseas IPO.</p>
<p>Just as the U.S. government frets over Chinese companies commanding Americans&#8217; data, as in the case of TikTok, China is now making sure that its citizen data stays onshore and protected from U.S. authorities. Foreign players operating in China have to comply, too. Giants like Apple and Tesla have pledged and moved to store their Chinese user data within the country.</p>
<p>The new data rule is no doubt a stumbling block for Chinese companies that want to list abroad. TikTok owner ByteDance indefinitely put on hold its plans of a U.S. listing after Chinese officials told it to address data security risks, according to a report by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bytedance-shelvedipo-intentions-after-chinese-regulators-warned-about-data-security-11626078000">The Wall Street Journal</a>. But how about incumbents like Alibaba that have traded their stocks on Wall Street for years? And do the revised rules apply to companies listing in Hong Kong, which is being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/hong-kong-national-security-law-impact-on-tech/">increasingly integrated with mainland China</a>?</p>

<h2>Also in the news</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tencent and Alibaba may tear down their &#8220;walled gardens.&#8221; </strong>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-and-tencent-consider-opening-up-their-walled-gardens-11626259544">The Wall Street Journal</a>, the archrivals are considering opening their services to each other. This means users may be able to pay via Alipay on the WeChat app, which currently excludes Alibaba-affiliated Alipay. China has recently been working to rein in its tech darlings and already slapped anticompetition penalties on a cohort of tech firms. Jack Ma&#8217;s fintech behemoth Ant Group has been put on the spot and forced to restructure into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/ant-restructuring/">financial holding company</a> that would potentially curb its profitability and subject it to more regulatory oversight.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok tops 3 billion downloads from the App Store and Google Play, </strong>according to Sensor Tower. This makes the hit video platform the only app not owned by Facebook to cross the milestone across the two app stores, said the research firm, and it&#8217;s only the fifth one after WhatsApp, Messenger, Facebook and Instagram to achieve that. TikTok is also generating big bucks for ByteDance. Globally, it has made more than $2.5 billion in consumer spending since its launch.</li>
<li><strong>Tencent ups its stake in food delivery giant Meituan to <a href="http://media-meituan.todayir.com/2021071322080169379850042_en.pdf">17.2%</a>. </strong>The deal cost Tencent, a longtime patron of Meituan, $400 million. The proceeds will allow Meituan to invest further in &#8220;cutting edge tech&#8221; such as unmanned delivery cars and drones, an area where other tech firms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/meituan-jd-com-and-neolix-begin-autonomous-deliveries-in-beijing/">have also made similar promises</a> to automate parcel and food deliveries.</li>
<li><strong>The smart vehicle craze continues. </strong>These days, hardly a week goes by without a major announcement by an autonomous driving or smart car company in China. The news last week came from Banma, which was set up by Alibaba and state-owned carmaker SAIC Motor to make internet-connected cars. It <a href="https://www.ebanma.com/news/86.html">just raised $460 million</a> from Alibaba and SAIC Motor, among others and claimed its technology now serves three million users. It raised its <a href="https://www.ebanma.com/news/29.html">first round in 2018</a> with 1.6 billion yuan (around $250 million) and was already valued at over $1 billion at the time.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://titan.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that is building a retail investment management platform aimed at the new generation of &#8220;everyday investors,&#8221; has closed on $58 million in a Series B round led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing comes just over five months after Titan </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/2113297/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $12.5 million in a Series A round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by General Catalyst, and brings the startup’s total raised since its 2017 inception to $75 million. It values the company at $450 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Catalyst also put money in the Series B round, along with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BoxGroup, Ashton Kutcher&#8217;s Sound Ventures and a group of professional athletes and celebrities including Odell Beckham Jr., Kevin Durant, Jared Leto and Will Smith. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, which describes itself as “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new-guard active investment manager,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched its first investment strategy in February of 2018 and today has 30,000 users. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titan’s platform grew by 500% in the last 12 months, largely organically, according to the company, which expects to cross its first billion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in assets under management </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">later this year. At the time of its last raise in February, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titan </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-founder and co-CEO Joe Percoco said the startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was approaching $500 million in assets under management and was cash flow positive last year. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Titan nabs $12.5M for &#8216;next generation&#8217; investment management&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/2113297/embed/#?secret=vV5y1hvpDc" data-secret="vV5y1hvpDc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What Fidelity and its iconic mutual funds were for baby boomers, Titan is for new generations. Titan is the first DTC, mobile-first investment platform where everyday investors, irrespective of wealth, can have their capital actively managed by investment experts in long-term strategies,” Percoco said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to describe the mutual fund or an ETF as “fundamentally just a piece of technology for an investment manager to accept money from someone in order to invest in securities.” He likened that piece of technology to a VHS tape that “does the job, but is archaic for a few reasons.” Those reasons, he said, are that the investor is an “anonymized dollar value” and the products have layers of costs with high minimums and are difficult to create.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The factory that creates the mutual fund itself is very old. The entire investment management industry is predicated on these VHS tapes,” Percoco said. “These are the archaic technologies being used. We&#8217;re rebuilding it entirely. Fidelity is an old factory. Titan is effectively a new factory.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On August 3, Titan plans to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">launch its </span><a href="https://www.titan.com/crypto/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrency offering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which the company claims will be the first and only actively managed portfolio of cryptocurrency assets available to U.S. investors. At launch, Titan Crypto will be available to all U.S. residents except those with home addresses in New  York. Access for NY-based residents will be provided once Titan’s custodial partner receives regulatory approval for the state’s jurisdiction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Titan said it plans to allow other investment managers to launch their products from its “factory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The initial strategies on Titan’s platform are predominantly in stocks,” Percoco said. “We&#8217;re already getting in-bounds from multibillion-dollar managers asking to launch products on Titan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital toward continuing to build out its underlying platform and suite of investment products as well as hiring. It currently has about 30 employees, up from seven</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a year ago. Percoco expects that Titan will have 100 employees by this time next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A16z general partner </span><a href="https://a16z.com/author/anish-acharya/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anish Acharya</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said that since meeting the Titan team last year, his firm has “consistently been impressed” by Titan’s product vision, execution and team.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we pull back and look at trends happening in consumer investing, we can see that younger generations are embracing more risk in investing, that they demand easy to navigate, mobile-first interfaces and transparency from their banks, and that they want to deeply understand how their money is being invested and participate in the learnings from that process,” said Acharya, who will be joining Titan’s board as part of the financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his view, Titan sits at an “interesting intersection” between passive robo-advisors and active stock-pricing, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowing their customers to ride shotgun alongside some of the best fund managers in the world, thus achieving the returns and knowledge of stock picking without having to make the decisions themselves.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One step at a time, <a href="https://squareup.com">Square</a> is creating a new bank from scratch. Today, the company is launching a new product called <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/banking">Square Banking</a> that combines a checking account, savings accounts, debit cards and loans. With Square Banking, the company wants to convince small businesses that it’s just easier to manage all their money needs through Square.</p>
<p>Originally focused on payments processing, Square launched a debit card for its business customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/17/square-debit-card/">in 2019</a>. This way, business owners can start spending the money they’re bringing in through Square payments without having to transfer the money to a separate bank account first.</p>
<p>With today’s launch, the company is expanding beyond its debit card offering by adding checking and savings accounts. Every time you make a sale, you can access the funds from your new Square checking account. There are no monthly fees, no credit checks and no minimum balance.</p>
<p>And because it’s a traditional checking account, you get your own account and routing numbers — you can receive and send money from your account directly. Behind the scenes, checking accounts are currently provided by Sutton Bank — your funds are FDIC-insured.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RzDjS0e33z"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/what-squares-smashing-earnings-tell-us-about-consumer-bitcoin-demand/">What Square&#8217;s smashing earnings tell us about consumer bitcoin demand</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What Square&#8217;s smashing earnings tell us about consumer bitcoin demand&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/what-squares-smashing-earnings-tell-us-about-consumer-bitcoin-demand/embed/#?secret=RzDjS0e33z" data-secret="RzDjS0e33z" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Square now also lets you open savings accounts. The company is taking advantage of the fact that it also manages your sales through its payments products. You can choose a percentage of your Square sales revenue so that you can save money every day without having to think about it. Users can also create different folders for different business needs — sales taxes, new machine, etc.</p>
<p>Right now, Square offers an annual percentage yield (APY) of 0.50% but that rate is only guaranteed through the end of 2021. Transfers between your savings accounts and your Square checking account are free and instant. Once again, your savings accounts are FDIC-insured.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179698" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179698" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2179698" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/c1b5b439-3e6f-4c62-9dc3-3220439c285c.png" alt="" width="1024" height="564" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/c1b5b439-3e6f-4c62-9dc3-3220439c285c.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/c1b5b439-3e6f-4c62-9dc3-3220439c285c.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/c1b5b439-3e6f-4c62-9dc3-3220439c285c.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/c1b5b439-3e6f-4c62-9dc3-3220439c285c.png?resize=768,423 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/c1b5b439-3e6f-4c62-9dc3-3220439c285c.png?resize=680,374 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/c1b5b439-3e6f-4c62-9dc3-3220439c285c.png?resize=1536,846 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/c1b5b439-3e6f-4c62-9dc3-3220439c285c.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179698" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Square</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, Square is integrating its business loans with the rest of its banking products. Instead of calling it Square Capital, the product is simply called &#8220;Loans&#8221;. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/squares-bank-arm-launches-as-fintech-aims-to-operate-more-nimbly/">recently completed</a> the charter approval process for Square Financial Services, proving that its lending products are a key part of the company’s strategy going forward.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional business loans, Square has simplified repayments. It takes a percentage of your daily card transactions, which means that you pay more when you have more sales and you pay less when you have fewer sales. Of course, if you’re temporarily shutting down your business, you have to pay a minimum payment every 60 days.</p>
<p>Square Banking will be particularly interesting for small businesses already using Square to process payments for in-person and online sales. Chances are these customers also have a business bank account that isn&#8217;t managed by Square. But they could realize that they use those separate accounts less and less as Square keeps adding features to its banking products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The quest to disrupt the traditional baby food aisle continues as more of today’s parents seek out nutritional food for their children.</p>
<p>One of the startups taking on the $100 billion children’s health and wellness market is <a href="https://www.littlespoon.com/">Little Spoon</a>, producing fresh, direct-to-consumer baby and children’s meals.</p>
<p>The New York-based company announced on Tuesday a $44 million round of Series B funding led by Valor Equity Partners, with participation from Kairos HQ. The new financing gives Little Spoon $73 million in total funding since it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/05/little-spoon-gets-7m-for-its-organic-baby-food-delivery-service/">founded in 2017</a> by Lisa Barnett, Ben Lewis, Michelle Muller and Angela Vranich.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The subscription-based service delivers meals from its Babyblends line of organic purees, and Plates, a healthy toddler and kid&#8217;s meals line. Babyblends costs less than $3 per meal, while Plates is less than $5 per meal. It also provides vitamins and natural remedies under its Booster line.</p>
<p>Barnett, president and chief marketing officer, told TechCrunch that the new funding round enables the company to evolve as a children’s nutrition solution and provide more engagement with parents through its “Is This Normal” community platform.</p>
<p>The baby and kid’s market is “very sleepy” traditionally, as is the parenting space as a whole, she said. Legacy companies aren’t staying on top of the needs of today’s parents, and consumers are not tolerating subpar products and experiences.</p>
<p>The four founders of Little Spoon came together to respond to those needs, Barnett said, and that is why more brands are also emerging. Another startup in the premium baby food space is Serenity Kids, offering low-sugar baby food. In June, it <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/exclusive-baby-food-brand-serenity-kids-expands-product-line-with-7m-series-a/">raised $7 million in Series A</a> funding led by CircleUp Growth Partners.</p>
<p>“It’s not an accident that when we started, seven in 10 new parents using our products were of the millennial generation,” Barnett added. “Millennials entered this stage, en masse, more aware of the connection to food, health and nutrition. They don’t want old baby food sitting on the shelf, and they are dual-income households where it isn’t convenient to cook it yourself.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179436" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179436" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2179436" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Little-Spoon-Family.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Little-Spoon-Family.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Little-Spoon-Family.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Little-Spoon-Family.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Little-Spoon-Family.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Little-Spoon-Family.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Little-Spoon-Family.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Little-Spoon-Family.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179436" class="wp-caption-text">Little Spoon products. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Little Spoon</p></div></p>
<p>Little Spoon is differentiating itself from the competition by creating an entire experience around the consumer with its community platform and by providing a range of products for every stage that are high quality and accessible in price.</p>
<p>The Series B comes as the company is doubling down on what is working as it builds out its platform, CEO Lewis said. Aiming to be a holistic solution for parents, he intends to use the new funding to build the community and content platform — what he considers the company’s “secret sauce,” and bulk up operations to support the growth.</p>
<p>The company is on track for more than 300% in revenue growth. This year, it quadrupled its team from 10 to 37 team members. Since its launch, Little Spoon delivered more than 15 million meals.</p>
<p>“We are still in the early innings of what Little Spoon could be,” Lewis said. “We are laser-focused on developing new products, investing in the community, building out more capacity and bolstering operations.”</p>
<p>Alex Fiance, co-founder and co-CEO of Kairos, told TechCrunch that his firm invests in companies whose business model starts with the problem. He sees Little Spoon at the intersection of food tech and healthcare amid the concept of food as medicine.</p>
<p>He’s known the founders for over a decade and liked that the company’s product vision “could run for decades.” He also backs the brand’s mission for following children as they age and becoming a trusted source for keeping children healthy.</p>
<p>In fact, he is also among Little Spoon’s target customers. Fiance’s daughter was born in November 2019 and grew up eating Little Spoon. When it was time to switch her to solid foods, Fiance said he was happy when the company introduced its Plates line.</p>
<p>“Little Spoon makes my wife’s and my life easier,” he added. “I was sad to see that she might have aged out of Little Spoon if they hadn’t launched Plates. We couldn’t be any more believers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Edtech entrepreneurs are using their moment in the sun to rethink the structures and impact of nearly every aspect of modern-day learning, from the art of testing to the reality of information retention. Yet, the most popular product up for grabs may just be a seemingly simple one: the almighty tutoring session. Numerade, an edtech founded in 2018, just had its take on scalable, high-quality tutoring sessions valued at $100 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.numerade.com/home/">Numerade</a> sells subscriptions to short-form videos that explain how certain equations and experiments work, and then uses an algorithm to make those explainers better suited to a learner’s comprehension style. Per CEO and co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nhon-ma-622bb922">Nhon Ma</a>, the startup’s focus on asynchronous, contextualized content will make it easier to scale high-quality tutoring at an affordable price.</p>
<p>“Real teaching involves sight and sound, but also the context of how something is delivered in the vernacular of how a student actually learns,” Ma said. And he wants Numerade to be a platform that goes beyond the robotic Q&amp;A and step-by-step answer platforms such as Wolfram Alpha, and actually integrates science into how solutions are communicated to users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, the company announced that it has raised $26 million at a $100 million valuation in a round including investors such as IDG Capital, General Catalyst, Mucker Capital, Kapor Capital and Interplay Ventures, and strategic investors such as Margo Georgiadis (the former CEO of Ancestry), Khaled Helioui (the former CEO of Bigpoint Games and angel investor in Uber) and Taavet Hinrikus (founder of Wise).</p>
<p>“There are supply and demand mechanics inherent to synchronous tutoring,” Ma said. He explained how the best tutors have limited time, may demand premiums and overall lead to a constraint on the supply side of marketplaces. Group tutoring has been an option employed by some companies, pairing multiple students to one tutor for efficiency sake, but he thinks that it is “really outdated, and actually decreases the quality of tutoring.”</p>
<p>With Numerade avoiding both live learning and Wolfram Alpha-style explainers that just give the answer to students, the company has turned to a third option: videos. Videos are not new to edtech, but currently majorly reside in massive open online course providers such as Coursera or Udemy, or &#8220;edutainment&#8221; platforms like MasterClass and Outschool. Numerade thinks that teacher-led or educator-guided videos can be built around a specific problem within Chapter 2 of Fundamentals of Physics.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179213" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179213" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2179213" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Numerade_image_for-Techcrunch_7.15.21.png" alt="numerade" width="857" height="482" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Numerade_image_for-Techcrunch_7.15.21.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Numerade_image_for-Techcrunch_7.15.21.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Numerade_image_for-Techcrunch_7.15.21.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Numerade_image_for-Techcrunch_7.15.21.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Numerade_image_for-Techcrunch_7.15.21.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Numerade_image_for-Techcrunch_7.15.21.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179213" class="wp-caption-text">Student learning from Numerade videos. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Numerade</p></div></p>
<p>The company has three main products: bootcamp videos for foundational knowledge, step-by-step videos that turn that knowledge into a skill and focus on sequence and, finally, quizzes that assess how much of the aforementioned information was retained.</p>
<p>The true moonshot in the startup, though, is the algorithm that decides which students see which videos. When explaining how the algorithm works, Ma used words like “deep learning” and “computer vision” and “ontology” but mostly the algorithm boils down to this: it wants to bring TikTok-level specificity to educational videos, using users&#8217; historical actions to better push certain content that fits their learning style.</p>
<p>For example, the startup believes that offering step-by-step videos help the brain understand patterns, diversity of problems, and eventually better understand solutions. The algorithm mostly shows up in Numerade quizzes, which will see how a student performs on a topic and then input those results back into the model to assumedly better cater a new series of bootcamps and questions.</p>
<p>“To help a student grow and learn, our model first understands their strengths and weaknesses and then surfaces relevant conceptual, practical, and assessment content to build their subject knowledge. The algorithm can parse structured data from videos and provide different teaching styles to suit the needs of all students,” he said.</p>
<p>As of now, Numerade’s algorithm appears preliminary. Users need to be paid subscribers and have a sufficient usage history in order to start benefiting from more targeted content. Even so, it&#8217;s unclear how the algorithm leads to different pedagogical content to students beyond resurfacing concepts that a student erred on in a previous quiz.</p>
<p>Numerade’s moonshot is built on an equally ambitious premise: that students want to learn concepts, not just Google for the fastest answer so they can finish procrastinated homework. Ma explained how engagement time on Numerade videos can be somewhere from double to triple the video’s entire length, which means that students are interacting with the content beyond just skipping over to the answer</p>
<p>Numerade isn’t alone in trying to take on Wolfram Alpha. Over the past year, edtech unicorns like Quizlet and Course Hero have invested heavily in AI-powered chatbots and live calculators, the latter largely through acquisitions of companies such as Numerade. These platforms are rallying around the idea that tech-powered tutoring sessions should prioritize speed and simplicity, instead of relationship building and time. In other words, maybe students won’t go to a tutor once a week for math, but they will go to a platform that can methodically explain an answer at midnight, hours before their precalculus exam.</p>

<p>Despite its somewhat early-stage algorithm innovation and heavy-weight competition, Numerade’s fresh venture backing and ability to bring in revenue is promising. While declining to divulge specifics, Ma said that the company is “quickly tracking” to eight figures in ARR, meaning it’s making at least $10 million in annual revenue from its current subscriber base. He sees perspective as Numerade&#8217;s biggest competitive advantage.</p>
<p>&#8220;A common criticism of commercial STEM education is that it&#8217;s too modular &#8212; textbooks teach physics as standalone,&#8221; Ma said. &#8220;Our algorithm does not, instead it treats STEM as an interlocking ecosystem; concepts in math, physics, chemistry, and biology are omnidirectionally related.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“We are true believers in the fact that the world needs a new Amazon, a better one, a more sustainable one, one that appreciates local areas and products.” It’s quite one thing to claim you are out to replace Amazon (just as its founder goes into space), but Ralf Wenzel, founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.jokr.it">JOKR</a>, certainly believes his company might have a shot. And he’s raising plenty of money to aim at that goal.</p>
<p>Today the fast-growing grocery and retail delivery platform has closed a whopping $170 million Series A funding round. The round comes three months after the company started operations in the U.S., Latin America and Europe. JOKR’s team consists of people who created both foodpanda and Delivery Hero, so from the outside at least, they have the chops to build a big business.</p>
<p>The round was led by led by GGV Capital, Balderton Capital and Tiger Global Management. It was joined by Activant Capital, Greycroft, Fabrice Grinda’s FJ Labs, as well as Latin America’s tech-specialized VC firms Kaszek and monashees, and HV Capital, the first institutional investor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Based out of New York, where it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/jokr-launches-in-new-york-with-a-different-take-on-on-demand-delivery/">launched last month</a> JOKR plans to roll out across cities in the U.S., Latin America and Europe. Right now it’s live in nine cities across Latin American countries Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Peru, as well as Poland and Austria in Europe.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;JOKR launches in New York with a different take on on-demand delivery&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/jokr-launches-in-new-york-with-a-different-take-on-on-demand-delivery/embed/#?secret=Y9e5Uc1tA4" data-secret="Y9e5Uc1tA4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Wenzel said: “The investment we announced today will empower us to continue our expansion at an unprecedented rate as we continue to build JOKR into the premier platform for a new generation of online shopping, with instant delivery, a focus on local product offerings and more sustainable delivery and supply chains. We are proud to be able to partner with such a distinguished group of international tech investors to help us seize the enormous opportunity in front of us.”</p>
<p>JOKR’s pitch is that it enables small local businesses to sell their goods, sourced from other local businesses, via the platform, thus expanding their reach without the need for complex logistics and delivery networks on their own. But that local aspect also builds sustainability into the model.</p>
<p>Hans Tung, managing partner at GGV Capital and newly appointed member of JOKR’s board, said: “Ralf has put together an all-star team for food delivery that will transform the retail supply chain. The combination of food delivery experience and the sophisticated data capabilities that optimizes inventory allocation and dispatch, set JOKR apart. We look forward to working with the team on their mission to make retail more instant, more democratic, and more sustainable.”</p>
<p>JOKR is joining other fast-delivery grocery providers like Gorillas and Getir in providing a 15-minute delivery time for supermarket and convenience products and pharmaceuticals, but also &#8220;exclusive&#8221; local products that are not available in regular supermarkets. Although, so far, it only has an app on Google Play.</p>
<p>Speaking at an interview with me Wenzel said: “We are close to the equivalent of Instacart, strongly grocery focused. Our offering is significantly broader than the ones of Gorillas&#8217; because we&#8217;re not only focusing on convenience and all kinds of different grocery categories, we&#8217;re getting closer to a supermarket offering, so the biggest competing element would be the traditional supermarkets, the offline supermarkets, as well as online grocery propositions. We are vertically integrating and hence procuring directly, cutting out middlemen and building our own distribution warehouses.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin successfully completed its first crewed launch Tuesday, sending four human passengers to space – including the company’s founder, Jeff Bezos. The result of billions of dollars of investment, dozens of test launches and some petty squabbling amongst ultra-rich founders, the triumph of the New Shepard, along with that of Virgin Galactic earlier this month, undoubtably heralds the dawn of a new age of space tourism.</p>
<p>It was quite the media spectacle. The mission took place at Launch Site One, Blue Origin’s sprawling and secretive facility that sits around thirty miles north of the small town of Van Horn, Texas. Every hotel in Van Horn and nearby towns were sold out of rooms in the days leading to launch as spectators traveled in for the event; meanwhile, a huge gaggle of local, national and online outlets (including yours truly) swarmed the Press Site as early as 2:30 AM CST. Despite some premature calls for rain in the early hours of the morning, the skies stayed clear and things mostly kept to schedule.</p>
<p>The four-person crew – including Bezos, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/jeff-bezos-and-his-brother-will-fly-on-blue-origins-first-human-spaceflight-with-auction-winner/">his brother, Mark</a>, 18-year old student Oliver Daemen, and aviation pioneer and Mercury 13 veteran Wally Funk – emerged from the training center and caught a Rivian R1S electric SUV to the launch pad around 45 minutes prior to launch. (Bezos drove a Rivian R1T pickup to the landing site of the rocket after its last test, a nod to Amazon’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/15/amazon-leads-700m-round-in-electric-automaker-rivian/">sizeable investment</a> in the EV startup). The crew climbed the launch tower and took a brief respite in an adjacent shelter, before climbing into the capsule, dubbed RSS First Step.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There was a brief hold at T-15 minutes, leading to the launch running slightly behind schedule. New Shepard took off at 8:11 CST. They passed the Kármán line (more on that later) at 8:15 AM; capsule separation followed, and the booster returned to the launch site autonomously and with a loud boom at 8:19 AM. The crewed capsule floated slowly to Earth via parachute, touching land at 8:22 AM for an eleven-minutes total flight time.</p>

<p>The flight was the result of fifteen tests of the reusable suborbital New Shepard rocket, including a rehearsal launch in April with a dry run of flight preparations and a mock crew embarking into the capsule, then disembarking before take-off. Blue Origin now joins rival Virgin Galactic in a very, very small group of commercial space companies to send private citizens to orbit.</p>
<p>Daemen was added to the crew after the anonymous auction winner, who bid <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-auctions-off-seat-on-first-human-spaceflight-for-28m/">$28 million</a> for the seat, had to bow out due to a scheduling conflict. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/15/blue-origin-reveals-oliver-daemen-flying-to-space-with-jeff-bezos.html">CNBC reported</a> that Daemen’s father, CEO of the Dutch private equity firm Somerset Capital Partners, placed the second-highest bid. Daemen is the youngest person ever to go to space at 18, and Funk is the oldest ever at 82.</p>
<h2>The route to space</h2>
<p>Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000, six years after he started ecommerce behemoth Amazon. The company has zeroed in on space tourism, and it sees this flight as the requisite proof of concept it needs to start flying customers. To that end, the New Shepard capsule has large, tourism-friendly windows – the largest in spaceflight history, according to the company. “These windows make up a third of the capsule, immersing you in the vastness of space and life-changing views of our blue planet,” it says on the Blue Origin website.</p>
<p>The launch is also the culmination of weeks of squabbling between Bezos and his billionaire spacefaring rival, Richard Branson, who was aboard his own flight to space 10 days earlier. But despite ostensibly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/virgin-galactic-and-richard-branson-celebrate-launch-of-first-passengers-into-space/">beating Bezos to the punch</a>, much of the fighting was over what actually counts as space – and whether VSS Unity, Virgin Galactic’s rocket-powered spaceplane, actually went there.</p>

<p>The kerfuffle is over what’s known as the Kármán line, a generally recognized but not strictly defined imaginary boundary of space that begins where the atmosphere becomes to thin to fly in by ordinary means. VSS Unity flew to around 51.4 miles – above the boundary recognized by NASA and the U.S. Air Force, but other authorities put the line closer to 60 miles. “From the beginning, New Shepard was designed to fly above the Kármán line so none of our astronauts have an asterisk next to their name,” Blue Origin tweeted two days before the Virgin launch. <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1413521627116032001">The tweet</a> also included a little infographic throwing further shade at on Virgin flights.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning for Blue Origin. Director of astronaut sales Ariane Cornell said at a pre-mission briefing on July 18 that she’s been “chatting with many of [Blue Origin’s] future customers who have signed for the subsequent flights.&#8221; She added that the company intends on launching two more flights this year, with CEO Bob Smith estimating that a second crewed New Shepard flight could take place in September or October.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the rest of us (as in, those that don’t have a couple extra million floating around in our bank accounts)? While the so-called billionaire space race is a petty squabble, both Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic’s respective launches are the likely heralds of a new age of space travel for consumers and scientists alike. It will be limited to the wealthy at first, but as TechCrunch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/eat-the-rich-but-let-them-build-rockets-in-the-meantime/">Alex Wilhelm argues</a>, costs will go down and more humans will go to space – including scientists and researchers, maybe even me or you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As its name suggests, venture firm <a href="https://www.pillar.vc/">Pillar VC</a> is focused on building &#8220;pillar&#8221; companies in Boston and across the Northeast.</p>
<p>The Boston-based seed-stage firm closed a raise of $192 million of capital that was split into two funds, $169 million for Pillar III and $23 million for Pillar Select. More than 25 investors are backing the new fund, including portfolio founders.</p>
<p>Jamie Goldstein, Sarah Hodges and Russ Wilcox are Pillar VC&#8217;s three partners, and all three lead investments for Pillar. The trio all have backgrounds as entrepreneurs: Goldstein, who has spent the past two decades in VC, co-founded speech recognition company PureSpeech, which was acquired by Voice Control Systems; Hodges was at online learning company Pluralsight; and Wilcox was CEO of electronic paper company E Ink, which he sold in 2009.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pillar typically invests in a range of enterprise and consumer startups and aims to target Pillar III at startups focused on biology, enterprise SaaS, AI/ML, crypto, fintech, hardware, manufacturing and logistics. The firm will make pre-seed investments of $50,000 to $500,000 and seed-round investments of $2 million to $6 million.</p>
<p>One of the unique aspects of the firm is that it will buy common stock so that it will be aligned with founders and take on the same risks, Goldstein told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The firm, founded in 2016, already has 50 portfolio companies from its first two funds — Pillar I, which raised $57 million, and Pillar $100 million. These include cryptocurrency company Circle, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/cryptocurrency-company-circle-to-go-public-in-spac-deal/">announced a SPAC</a> earlier this month, 3D printing company Desktop Metal that went public, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/desktop-metal-going-public-in-spac-led-deal-that-could-value-3d-printer-company-at-2-5b/">also via SPAC</a>, last year, and PillPack, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/amazon-buys-pillpack-an-online-pharmacy-that-was-rumored-to-be-talking-to-walmart/">bought by Amazon</a> in 2018.</p>

<p>“Pillar is an experiment, answering the question of &#8216;what would happen if unicorn CEOs came in and helped bootstrap the next generation&#8217;,” Wilcox said. “The experience is working, and Pillar does what VCs ought to do, which is back first-of-its-kind ideas.”</p>
<p>In addition to leading investments, Hodges leads the Pillar VC platform for the firm&#8217;s portfolio companies. Many of the portfolio companies are spinouts from universities, and need help turning that technology into a company. Pillar provides guidance to recruit a CEO or partner on the business side, leadership development, recruit talent and makes introductions to potential customers.</p>
<p>Pillar also intends to invest a third of the new fund into that biology category, specifically looking at the convergence of life science and technology, Wilcox said.</p>
<p>In its second fund, the firm started Petri, a pre-seed bio accelerator focused on biotech, and brought in founders using computation and engineering to develop technologies around the areas of agriculture, genetics, cell and gene therapies, medical data and drug discovery. The third fund will continue to support the accelerator through both pre-seed and seed investments.</p>
<p>The first investments from Pillar III are being finalized, but Hodges expects to infuse capital into another 50 companies.</p>
<p>“We are super bullish on Boston,” she added. “So many companies here are growing to be household names, and an exciting energy is coming out.”</p>
