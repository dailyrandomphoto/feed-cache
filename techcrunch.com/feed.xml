										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.earnr.co.uk/">Earnr</a> is a new finance and tax service aimed at the UK creator economy and people doing ‘side-hustle’ businesses. It’s now secured £650,000 to launch an app aimed at ‘solopreneurs’. The round was financed by 7percent Ventures, Antler and FJ Labs.</p>
<p>The startup deals with the financial and tax admin side of their new venture which works with private personal bank account. The app provides a hub of financial tools and services for these self-employed side-hustlers, providing digital bookkeeping and accountancy services, automates tax returns, and comes with access to expert help.</p>
<p>Anyone earning less than £3k from their side hustle can submit their tax return for free, and over that Earnr charges a flat £99 fee. </p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245951" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>CEO Enzo Ottens said: “Many of us in the Earnr team started our own side hustles during the UK’s many lockdowns and although doing this is getting easier than ever, finance and tax admin is always where complexity and the risk of expensive mistakes lurk… So we’ve built a service that does it all for you, and automatically with a minimum of hands-on input.” <br />
 <br />
Andrew J Scott, Founding Partner at 7percent Ventures, said: &#8220;We backed Enzo and the Earnr team because of their ambition to disrupt the half-trillion-dollar accounting sector globally using A.I. At 7percent we love startups which aim to fundamentally transform laggard industries and Earnr were aligned on the fastest way to do that, starting today with tax returns for side earners.” </p>

Also participating was Ascension and D4 Ventures, among others.</p>
<p>HURR launched in 2019 and has a hybrid business model combining peer-to-peer fashion rentals, direct partnerships with fashion outlets, and a white-label service with retailers such as Selfridges Rental. HIt also has a physical store in Selfridges London, and a partnership with global resale platform Depop.</p>
<p>Commenting, Victoria Prew, CEO and founder of HURR, said:“As a millennial, I’m part of a generation that loves shared ownership. We’ve all witnessed the rise of disruptive tech-first businesses such as Airbnb and Uber and, if we can rent our houses and cars, why not our wardrobes.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245941" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Matt Chandler, consumer investor at Octopus Ventures, said: “HURR is perfectly placed to capitalize on the shift towards new models of ownership and spearhead the transition to a more climate-friendly fashion industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is facing the prospect of imminent extradition to the US after the UK High Court granted an appeal by the US government against an earlier (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/uk-judge-denies-us-request-to-extradite-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange/">January</a>) refusal by a UK judge to extradite him on mental health grounds.</p>
<p>A final decision on whether or not to grant the extradition will be made by the UK secretary of state.</p>
<p>The US wants to put Assange on trial for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/arrested-wikileaks-founder-is-now-facing-u-s-extradition/">conspiracy to hack and computer misuse</a>. He also faces a number of charges under the controversial <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/julian-assange-espionage-act/">Espionage Act</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245925" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In all he faces 18 counts connected with &#8220;obtaining and disclosing defence and national security material&#8221; through the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiLeaks website</a>, primarily in 2009 and 2010 but also &#8220;to some extent since&#8221;, per a court summary.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Defenders of the polarizing figure argue he&#8217;s being persecuted for telling truth to power and that his extradition would have a chilling effect on journalism &#8212; given the US government is pursuing charges that include publishing classified information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Assange obtained the information from former US army solider and whistleblower, Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning, who disclosed hundreds of thousands of classified or sensitive military and diplomatic documents that Assange then published via WikiLeaks &#8212; causing huge embarrassment for the US government.</p>
<p>The leaked material included army reports and videos of airstrikes, including instances of civilian deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with hundreds of thousands of US diplomatic cables.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/usa-v-julian-assange-2/">summary of the judgement</a> issued today, the UK High Court said it has accepted a package of assurances from the US government related to the previous district judge&#8217;s concerns that Assange is a suicide risk.</p>
<p>The Court said four assurances have been offered, adding that is &#8220;satisfied&#8221; the assurances exclude the possibility of Assange being subject to “special administrative measures” &#8212; or held at a maximum security prison in Florence, Colorado, USA (either pretrial or after any conviction) vis-a-vis the acts he is currently accused of committing.</p>
<p>The US has also agreed to consent to an application by Assange to be transferred to Australia to serve his sentence if he is convicted; and agreed that while he is in custody in the US he will receive &#8220;appropriate clinical and psychological treatment as recommended by a qualified treating clinician at the prison where he is held&#8221;, per the Court summary.</p>
<p>&#8220;The court rejected various criticisms of those assurances which were argued on Mr Assange’s behalf, and was satisfied that the assurances were sufficient to meet the concerns which led to the DJ’s decision,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>A final decision on whether to allow Assange&#8217;s extradition will now pass to the UK&#8217;s home secretary, Priti Patel.</p>
<p>Almost <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-19957138">a decade ago</a> the British computer hacker Gary McKinnon was saved from extradition to the US to face charges of hacking into military computers after the then home secretary, Theresa May, denied the application on human rights grounds.</p>
<p>Assange, who <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/julian-assange-gets-a-new-australian-passport-20190221-p50zek.html">holds an Australian passport</a>, is not a British national.</p>
<p>He was previously granted citizenship by Ecuador, in 2018 &#8212; in a failed attempt to get him out of the country&#8217;s embassy where he had fled in 2012 to avoid being extradited to Sweden where he faced allegations of rape and sexual assault.</p>
<p>Those charges were subsequently dropped but in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/julian-assange-arrested-in-london-after-ecuador-withdraws-asylum/">2019</a> Ecuador withdrew his asylum and he was arrested by London&#8217;s Met Police for breaching bail conditions in the U.K. by seeking political refuge at the Embassy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jul/28/julian-assange-stripped-of-citizenship-by-ecuador">Earlier this year</a> Ecuador also stripped Assange of his citizenship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup that has built a decentralized exchange as well as a cross-chain infrastructure to facilitate communication across layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain solutions is the latest to receive backing from Coinbase Ventures.</p>
<p>Singapore-headquartered Router Protocol said on Friday it has raised $4.1 million in a strategic funding round from Coinbase Ventures, Alameda Research, Polygon, Woodstock, Wami Capital, QCP, De-Fi Capital, Maple Block, TeraSurge Capital, Wintermute, and Shima Capital as well as several entrepreneurs. The startup also raised $485,000 in its seed round last year.</p>
<p>We have seen a proliferation of layer 1 blockchain networks that are all attempting to solve similar problems in recent years. As these layer 1 projects gain traction, they are able to attract the developer community that builds layer 2 solutions atop of their preferred blockchain.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244704" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Blockchains are like cities and you can scale them endlessly, but unless you build the connectivity infra, nobody goes there,” said Ramani Ramachandran, founder and chief executive of Router Protocol, in an interview with TechCrunch. “So we have had all these blockchains coming up, but no connectivity between them. So that was the genesis of Router Protocol,” he said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.routerprotocol.com">Router Protocol</a>, founded last year, is betting that many of these layer 1 blockchain networks will continue to operate and many more will join the fray. Its offering allows developers to seamlessly move liquidity across chains seamlessly. “There are probably about 50 blockchains, with 50 different communities and their own energy,” he said.</p>
<p>“There are going to be layer 1 scaling solutions &#8212; the Polygons of the world &#8212; and ‘Ethereum killers’ such as Aave, Solana and then we have non-EVM players such as Terra and Algorand that are coming up from different perspectives. You marry that with profusion of capital in the space. All of these players have a large warchest. Nobody is talking about less than a $1 billion warchest. The battle is not going to end anytime soon.”</p>
<p>Router Protocol’s other offering is Dfyn, which is a decentralized exchange, like Uniswap or Pancake Swap, that is built on top of Polygon. “It’s like we have a bunch of airport terminals called Dfyn, and then we have airline routes that connect these Dyfn networks. But they also connect other airports. That’s the beauty of the whole model.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ramachandran said he expects cross-chain solutions to become more popular next year. &#8220;Let&#8217;s imagine you&#8217;re on Solana blockchain and you want to sell Ethereum, but you see much better prices on Binance Smart Chain. Router will enable you to do get the best price on Binance Smart Chain with one click and bring it back to your native blockchain, which is Solana,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Trading is the most popular use case on Router Protocol today, but Ramachandran said he expects many more applications to make inroads in the future. &#8220;One you speak across borders, you can not just trade, but borrow, lend, and do cross-chain governance. Sushi, for instance, has 15 chains and 15 different communities. To get a community vote across these chains is a nightmare as you will be required to do 15 different snapshots. So that is something we can solve. You can borrow from one chain, and lend on another,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The firm plans to deploy the capital to scale its product offerings and also invest in multiple security audits, it said.</p>
<p>Getting blockchains to communicate effectively with each other is the holy grail for DeFi going forward, and we are happy to work with the team behind Router &amp; Dfyn and support their unique approach to solving this problem,&#8221; said Darius Sit, co-founder of QCP Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We anticipate future Web 3.0 activity across several multi-purpose and application-specific blockchains. Router&#8217;s XCLP will be an important cross-chain infrastructure solution enabling the flow of liquidity across chains. We are delighted to back and support the Router team in their efforts in this direction.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.breakout.vc/">Breakout Ventures</a>, a San Francisco-based seed-stage venture firm that funds what it calls creative biosciences startups, has closed the second fund in its five-year history with $112.5 million in capital commitments.</p>
<p>Both of its funds, including a $60 million debut effort that we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/breakout-ventures-spun-out-of-peter-thiels-breakout-labs-has-closed-its-debut-fund-with-60m/">wrote about</a> in 2017, are backed by Dolby Family Ventures, the Thiel Foundation, GRIDS Capital, S Cubed Capital, Chris and Crystal Sacca, Tony Fadell, and Zack Bogue and Matt Ocko of DCVC.</p>
<p>The new fund also pulled in new institutional LPs, including Cortes Capital and Cupola Funds managed by AMG National Trust.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245884" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What its high-wattage backers are betting on are two managing partners who&#8217;ve long focused on startups at the intersection of biology and technology.</p>
<p>Lindy Fishburne, a management consultant earlier in her career, spent more than a decade as the executive director of the Thiel Foundation, which awarded no-strings-attached grants to deep science startups until it became obvious to Fishburne that, given what she was seeing, it was time to start writing venture checks instead.</p>
<p>Julia Moore was meanwhile an associate director at Stanford University before joining the Thiel Foundation as a portfolio director and joining forces with Fishburne afterward at Breakout Ventures. (Moore was promoted to managing partner earlier this year; the Thiel Foundation&#8217;s model has since been retired as the two build out the Breakout Ventures footprint.)</p>
<p>Naturally, the bets the two are making were also critical to the fundraising process, and there was apparently plenty of progress to report, with a portfolio that features a number of highly valued startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among these is Modern Meadow, a company known mostly for its lab-grown leather and that closed on <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/sustainability/modern-meadow-closes-130-million-series-c-funding-names-anna-bakst-ceo/">$130 million</a> in Series C funding back in April (at an undisclosed valuation). Breakout Ventures also wrote one of the first checks to Cytovale, a San Francisco-based company that has gone on to raise $50 million and is currently in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidprosser/2021/10/13/how-cytovale-is-set-to-transform-the-fight-against-sepsis/?sh=7e6496fc372d">final stages of clinical trials</a> of a new test for sepsis that generates results in less than 10 minutes. (Sepsis is the leading cause of death in hospitals, notes Fishburne.)</p>
<p>A third company from that first fund is <a href="https://checkerspot.com/">Checkerspot</a>, a company using synthetic biology and chemistry to produce novel bio-derived oils. Like Cytovale, it has now raised $50 million altogether, including from Viking Global Investors.</p>
<p>Breakout Ventures was an early investor in <a href="https://www.cortexyme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cortexyme</a>. The now publicly traded company is developing therapies for Alzheimer’s disease, though it encountered a related <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-27/alzheimer-s-disease-stock-cortexyme-blows-up-after-trial-failure?sref=gni836kR">setback</a> in October that sent it shares diving, and they have yet to recover.</p>
<p>Altogether, say the two, their portfolio companies have gone on to raise more than $1 billion in follow-on capital and grants. They expect the pace to pick up quickly from here, too, fueled in part by the coronavirus pandemic. Asked about the effect on Breakout by the development of vaccines to treat Covid-19, both investors say the impact was both abrupt and enduring.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been gas on the fire,&#8221; says Fishburne. &#8220;For the world to see how central science is and its capacity to now be able to move so quickly and be so responsive driven by the tools of scale that are now available, that has [created an] enormous on-ramp for our companies and the places that we play.&#8221;</p>
<p>She points, as one example, to a portfolio company called Phylagen, a San-Francisco based biotech company that combines microbial genomics and data analytics to solve complex problems like pandemic management and supply chain verification and which is currently working with several large tech companies to ensure their employees and customers that their offices are safe.</p>
<p>Moore echoes the point. &#8220;What we saw with Moderna and what we&#8217;re seeing at the board level is that [companies&#8217;] ability to code a vaccine over a weekend permanently changed the pace of innovation in biosciences. The pace at which we see our companies monitoring timelines is moving [faster] because they have more actionable information and can iterate on that information at a speed we&#8217;ve never seen before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seemingly, Breakout Ventures is also moving quickly. Already, the firm has invested in three companies with its new fund, including Parthenon Therapeutics, a two-year-old, Cambridge, Ma.-based biotech that&#8217;s developing anti-cancer therapies and which just last week announced <a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/pfizer-ventures-backed-biotech-parthenon-therapeutics-snags-65m-series-a-to-advance-its">$65 million</a> in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Asked how Parthenon fits into Breakout&#8217;s broader thesis, Moore says that while Parthenon looks like a traditional therapeutics, it&#8217;s &#8220;doing a lot of really interesting biomarker work. They&#8217;re working with a novel hypothesis. They have an interdisciplinary team that can do multiple different modalities.&#8221;</p>
<p>While tried-and-true biotech investors led the deal &#8212; in this case, Pfizer and Northpond Ventures &#8212; Breakout Ventures is more focused on its biomarker work and thinking differently about perhaps less traditional partnerships for the company. Says Moore: &#8220;We&#8217;re the ones asking: how do you move faster in looking at the pipeline with pathology and AI?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instant grocery delivery continues to be a very frothy market, but today comes news of a major funding round for one player in it that investors believe will still be standing after the hype has died down.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goflink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flink</a>, the Berlin-based startup that sells food and other essentials at supermarket prices and aims to deliver them in under 10 minutes, has confirmed that it has raised $750 million, a Series B round of funding led by a strategic backer, DoorDash, made at a pre-money valuation of $2.1 billion ($2.85 billion post-money). Flink is already present in some 60 cities across four countries, where it covers 10 million customers; the plan will be to use the funding to continue growing that footprint, both organically and potentially by snapping up rivals (we have confirmed that most of the round is in equity with a small portion in debt for acquisitions).</p>
<p>The involvement of DoorDash &#8212; which went public in December 2020, has a market cap currently of just under $57 billion, and is making its first foray into Europe with this investment (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/doordash-to-acquire-food-delivery-company-wolt/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">€7 billion deal</a> to buy Wolt in Finland has not closed; projected date for that is the second half of 2022) &#8212; was a badly-kept secret in this fundraise, with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dd874d12-a4a3-4565-b5ce-0e52f5ade680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> of the investment <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/doordash-flink-idAFL1N2QQ0T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emerging</a> several months ago. We can confirm that DoorDash&#8217;s investment officially closed in September, with the rest of the round completed in the months following.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245692" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Others in the round included previous backer Mubadala Capital (which backed Flink in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$240 million round</a> made as recently as June) and other unnamed new and past investors. (Previous backers also include German supermarket giant REWE, Prosus, Bond, Target Global, Northzone, Cherry Ventures and TriplePoint Capital.)</p>
<p>What&#8217;s remarkable when you consider the size of the funding is that Flink has only been around for a year, and commercially active for just seven months. In a rare interview &#8212; the company has been media-shy up to now &#8212; CEO and co-founder Oliver Merkel said he believes that part of the reason Flink has attracted attention among what is a crowded field of instant delivery startups is because of the founders&#8217; track records. Merkel spent years as a management consultant at Bain working in grocery and retail; co-founders Julian Dames and Christoph Cordes are Rocket Internet alums who respectively founded the Foodora food delivery startup and furniture e-commerce business Fashion for Home (acquired by Home24, where Cordes became CEO).</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what we bring and why could we win market leadership in such a short amount of time is because we are obsessed about how we do things&#8230; and we bring some experience to the table. We made so many mistakes elsewhere, and we hope we&#8217;ve learned from those,&#8221; Merkel said. (Another reason for wooing investors could be that he&#8217;s quite personable for a media-shy person; that last comment was delivered tongue-in-cheek, as were many of the other quips he made off the record.)</p>
<p>This round has been in the works for some months now and the story behind that speaks to volatility and hype in the market at the moment, and where Flink believes it stands out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DoorDash had originally come to Berlin last summer looking at investing in Gorillas, one of Flink&#8217;s big rivals, but that deal fell through over differences between the two companies&#8217; management styles and longer-term growth plans. So, DoorDash began talking with Flink, where it turned out executives were more aligned in their strategies and approaches to growth. (Gorillas instead raised money from another strategic, Delivery Hero, as part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whopping $1 billion round</a>.)</p>
<p>Flink, meanwhile, fresh off its own funding round, was fending with M&amp;A. Specifically, the startup had been tapped by both e-commerce and delivery behemoth Amazon, as well as by another U.S. instant grocery delivery player GoPuff, as an acquisition target.</p>
<p>Both approaches didn&#8217;t go anywhere &#8212; depending on who you ask, because Flink&#8217;s valuation was too high; or because Flink wasn&#8217;t interested in selling. At the same, Flink was also looking at a potential merger with Gorillas &#8212; a massive consolidation play that also didn&#8217;t happen at the time.</p>
<p>Whether Gorillas and Flink do ultimately join up, consolidation will likely come one way or the other as the many companies in instant delivery that have popped up in the last couple of years &#8212; spurred by the pandemic and changes in how people shopped and moved around &#8212; struggle to get profitable, reach positive unit economics, find new customers, and raise more money. GoPuff has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/after-acquiring-dija-and-fancy-instant-grocery-startup-gopuff-launches-in-the-uk-en-route-to-european-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buying up smaller instant delivery startups in Europe</a> to expand and scale, as has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getir</a>.</p>
<p>And we found out too that Flink itself came close to buying another instant delivery company, Cajoo in France, apparently for the grand sum of €1, before Cajoo instead <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/cajoo-raises-40-million-for-its-instant-grocery-delivery-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opted to raise $40 million</a>.</p>
<p>(TechCrunch has confirmed the above details with executives across the companies.)</p>
<p>Putting all that M&amp;A intrigue to one side, though, Flink has been quietly building out a strategy for how it plans to tackle the market, and it starts with how it sources groceries.</p>
<p>E-commerce is a business of economies of scale &#8212; it&#8217;s one reason why it&#8217;s so hard ultimately to compete against the behemoth that is Amazon &#8212; and the same goes for groceries, which need to be procured by the retailers that sell them.</p>
<p>Rather than try to get to a big enough scale to have the best negotiating power for buying in goods, Flink&#8217;s approach has been instead to partner with huge retailers and lean on them for those deals. In Germany, that has been its strategic backer REWE, and it has followed the same route with its launches in France and the Netherlands, although Flink has declined to disclose so far who those partners are.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flink is on a dynamic growth track, which REWE Group is supporting with its long-term commitment,&#8221; said Lionel Souque, CEO of REWE Group, in a statement on the relationship. &#8220;This also includes the operational cooperation between Flink and Rewe in the area of purchasing, which continues to develop very positively. Our decision to partner with Flink in April of this year has proven to be successful; Flink is now the number one in Quick Commerce in Germany and is ideally placed to further expand their market leadership.&#8221; (As for why a supermarket giant would be interested in a company that is essentially a rival, the logic was explained to me like this: those big supermarkets missed the boat on hard discount rivals like Aldi and Lidl, where they didn&#8217;t anticipate just how competitive the latter would ultimately become, taking away chunks of market share and customers. Now, the idea is to avoid making the same mistake and instead collaborate earlier and more closely with the next big thing to stay abreast of whatever growth might come.)</p>
<p>In the process of growing, the aim for Flink has been to keep the concept of instant grocery delivery as normal as possible and delivered to as wide a range of consumers as possible, not just young urbanites with disposable cash.</p>
<p>&#8220;People in big cities are spoiled,&#8221; Merkel said. &#8220;They get all the new innovations and services, but when we opened in Regensburg&#8221; &#8212; a significantly smaller town in the south of the country where Flink is now also operating &#8212; &#8220;it was crazy, the amount of business we got from day one. It&#8217;s an indication that our model works everywhere. We want to be the supermarket for everyone. Our pricing is supermarket pricing, and our products appeal not just to hipsters but the fireman, the teacher. Normal people.&#8221; It currently offers some 2,500 items in its biggest markets, and following its wide-appeal approach, that selection likely will grow over time.</p>
<p>What will be worth watching also is how Flink grows its talent. At a moment when there are remains a lot of scrutiny &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/eu-gig-economy-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potentially some big changes ahead</a> &#8212; over the rights that gig workers have at the companies where they operate, Flink says that its focus is &#8220;<span class="s1">fully employed riders with unlimited contracts at a massive scale to cope with customer demand.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The company says that on average, its customers are taking multiple orders each week, an engagement metric that caught the eye of DoorDash and will be something to watch as part of how the two companies potentially collaborate together in the future.</p>
<p><span class="s1">&#8220;We’ve been impressed by Flink&#8217;s growth and customer retention,&#8221; said Prabir Adarkar, CFO of DoorDash, in a statement. &#8220;Oliver, Julian, Christoph, and their team share our operator mindset and bring a wealth of industry experience. It&#8217;s not surprising that in less than a year of operating they have established themselves as the leader in key European markets.&#8221; </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;This funding round is a watershed moment for Flink as it continues on its hyper growth trajectory,&#8221; added&nbsp;Amer Alaily of Mubadala. &#8220;We are excited to watch them disrupt the instant grocery delivery space amidst an enormous market opportunity in Germany, France, the Netherlands and beyond &#8211; and we look forward to remaining a trusted partner to Oliver, Julian, Christoph and their team.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tyson Clark, a general partner with Alphabet&#8217;s venture arm, GV, has passed away unexpectedly at age 43. GV CEO David Krane just issued a statement about the team&#8217;s loss, writing, &#8220;With great sadness, we share the news that Tyson Clark, our friend and GV general partner, passed away yesterday due to sudden complications from a health issue. We are stunned and shattered by this loss. The GV team extends our deepest sympathies to Tyson&#8217;s family and loved ones. We are privileged to know his warmth, intellect, integrity, mentorship and humor. We will miss him profoundly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clark, a father of three, joined GV six years ago to focus on enterprise technology, including startups in the SaaS application and data center infrastructure spaces.</p>
<p>He joined the powerful investing unit after working briefly at Andreessen Horowitz in corporate development and, before that, working in corporate development at Oracle and as an investment banker for Morgan Stanley.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245803" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Clark was one of a small if growing pool of Black investors in the most senior positions of the venture industry. Further, Clark was just as rare, if not more so, as a VC who&#8217;d served his country. Indeed, he spent six years in the U.S. Navy, where he served as a nuclear propulsion submarine officer. (He very recently <a href="https://www.gv.com/news/hover-hiring-military-veterans/">hosted a conversation</a> about &#8220;attracting more vets into tech&#8221; with fellow veteran and entrepreneur A.J. Altman, whose company, <a href="https://hover.to/">Hover</a>, creates 3D models of properties and is backed by GV.)</p>
<div class="ajR h4">
<p>Clark &#8212; who studied industrial engineering at Stanford and who had an MBA from Harvard Business School &#8212; talked with TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/vareto-raises-24m-from-gv-menlo-and-all-star-angels-to-reinvent-financial-planning-for-enterprises/">in October</a> about his latest investment, Vareto.</p>
<p>He was also actively investing during the height of the pandemic, including meeting with &#8212; and funding &#8212; founders remotely.  In December of last year, for example, he led a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/17/gv-leads-9-million-investment-in-open-source-product-analytics-platform-posthog/">Series A</a> round for PostHog, an open source product analytics platform whose founder he had not met in person previously.</p>
<p>As it happens, Clark spoke last year with Sonal Chokshi, editor-in-chief at Andreessen Horowitz, for a virtual summit, alongside panelists Kara Nortman of Upfront Ventures and Connie Chan of Andreessen Horowitz. The discussion centered on the investors&#8217; career paths, and proved refreshingly candid.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Asked by Chokshi about the one &#8220;key skill&#8221; that set him up to be an investor, Tyson didn&#8217;t talk about his personality or intelligence or ability to synchronize information, as might some VCs. He said instead: &#8220;You can teach how to invest. You can teach how to interact on a board. But you can’t teach a network. You show up with your network.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also had instructive, no-nonsense advice to offer when Chokshi asked him about sourcing and attribution within venture firms and how much it matters who gets credit for a particular investment. &#8220;Internally, play it cool,&#8221; he&#8217;d said. &#8220;It’s not about attribution internally.&#8221; Externally, he&#8217;d added, &#8220;it’s all about attribution. You want to make sure that people know the deals you’ve done, where you’ve been influential. But internally, it can be very political as you claim credit for a deal. You’ve got to navigate the political structure within your firm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clark separately <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-08-24/black-venture-capitalists-confront-silicon-valley-s-quiet-racism?sref=gni836kR">spoke very openly</a> last year to Bloomberg about being one of the most prominent Black VCs in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>During the renewed attention paid to the Black Lives Matter movement in the spring of 2020, he wondered whether he had done enough to support Black founders and worried he was coming up short. “Have I been so complicit that I’ve traded success for not making a difference?” Clark told the outlet. “Humbly, there are a group of people in my position who want to do something, but feel like we don’t have enough power yet to be influential on this topic. It’s painful for all of us to feel this helplessness.”</p>
<p>Clark will undoubtedly be missed by many, including founders and other team members whose lives he touched. The dozens of companies with which he worked over the years include Evident.io, a company <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2018/palo-alto-networks-closes-acquisition-of-evident-io">acquired</a> by Palo Alto Networks in 2018; Obsidian Security, an identity protection startup; and a digital life insurance company called Ethos.</p>
<p>Clark also served on the boards of the San Francisco Museum of Art; Summer Search, an organization that works with high school students from low-income communities to overcome systemic inequities; and Resurge International, an international non-profit focused on healing impoverished patients who suffer from congenital abnormalities or injuries, with a focus on burn victims.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/italy-fines-amazon-1-3-billion-for-abusing-its-market-position/">Italy fines Amazon $1.3B:</a></strong> The fine is due to the U.S. e-commerce giant having “abused its dominant market position and pushed third-party sellers to use the company’s logistics service Fulfillment by Amazon,” TechCrunch reports, citing the Italian Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato. Most tech fines are too small to even note. This one will sting.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/e-commerce-aggregator-merama-gets-its-horn-after-just-12-months-in-business/"><strong>Build a unicorn with this one weird trick:</strong></a> All you have to do, it appears, is tell investors that you are raising capital to launch or aggregate e-commerce brands in a particular market, and, viola, unicorn status. That’s our takeaway from not only covering dozens of rounds in the e-commerce rollup market lately and the fact that Merama went from zero-to-unicorn in less than a year.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/eu-gig-economy-proposal/"><strong>The EU gets ready to change the gig labor market:</strong></a> If your company depends on using contract labor in the European Union, bad news. Things are likely changing in the coming years. Per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/riptari" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha Lomas</a>, “EU lawmakers have formally proposed legislation for the gig economy they hope will improve conditions for platform workers across the bloc.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the day’s mix of startup happenings, one more piece of data for you to chew on. Silicon Valley may be seeing its status as the The Startup Market being challenged both at home and abroad, but another market is not changing as quickly. Namely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/work-bench-report-finds-just-1-9-of-venture-investment-going-to-female-enterprise-founders/">the funding landscape for women founding business-focused software companies</a>. Given just how big a chunk of the startup market such businesses comprise, the gender gap is staggering. (A small shoutout to our own <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ron Miller</a> for his <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller/status/1469025851664646152" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent reporting on inequities</a> in the startup industry is in order, I think.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/robotic-research-raises-228m-series-a-to-build-out-commercial-autonomous-offerings/">Robotic Research raises nearly a quarter billion dollars:</a> </strong>$228 million, to be clear, which is darn close. What does the company do? It turns out that Robotic Research has “spent the last two decades developing on- and off-road autonomous vehicles for the Department of Defense.” So, yes, this is another huge funding round for autonomous vehicles. Let’s hope that this check is indicative of progress <em>made</em>, instead of progress <em>anticipated</em>, regarding the huge problem space that the startup is tackling.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/petra-emerges-from-stealth-with-30m-raised-for-tunnel-boring-robot-swifty/"><strong>Today in Very Good startup names:</strong></a> If you were founding a startup that made underground drilling tech, what would you call it? Perhaps <a href="https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Petra_(Civ6)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Petra</em></a><em>? </em>That would be a good name. And the robot itself? How about <em>Swifty</em>? Well, if you thought those would be good names, the Petra crew would agree. They just raised a $30 million Series A for their very not boring boring work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/ledger-to-launch-crypto-debit-card/"><strong>Ledger to launch crypto debit card:</strong></a> If you own a lot of crypto, how to actually spend the stuff can be an issue. Ledger is working on a debit card to help the crypto-rich use that wealth IRL. In the meatspace, if you will. Coinbase has a similar product, to give an example. Even the Hodl Gang have to pay rent.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/deed-raises-10m-for-its-workplace-giving-platform/">Deed’s better corporate giving platform lands $10M:</a></strong> Many companies have a corporate giving plan in place. Some companies, for example, match employee charitable giving. Deed wants to help more companies do more with their giving work. The startup just landed $10 million for its efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Today in $8.5M-$8.7M rounds: </strong>Rare is it that we see two rounds with the same dollar amount under the $10 million mark. Today we have effectively three. First, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/bird-buddy-smart-bird-feeder-funding/">Bird Buddy raised $8.5 million</a></strong> for its smart bird feeder tech, no joke. Second, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/airplane-internal-tools/">Airplane raised $8.5 million</a></strong> for its developer workflow automation service. And <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/mio-raises-8-7m-series-a-to-make-enterprise-messaging-interoperable/">Mio raised $8.7 million</a></strong> to help make enterprise messaging services like Slack and Teams interoperable.</li>
<li>And then there was <strong>Rho</strong>, which is seeing its corporate spend product rapidly scale. So quickly in fact that investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/rho-raises-75-million-series-b-for-its-one-stop-corporate-spend-and-cash-management-solution/"><strong>just gave it a $75 million Series B</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Closing out today’s startup notes: Acronyms. Namely fintech acronyms. What would happen if you took B2B and smushed into BNPL? Aside from creating the simply awful B2BBNPL (B2BNPL? BBNPL? 2BNPL 2FURIOUS?) acronym, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/affirm-spinout-resolve-raises-25m-in-insight-partners-led-round-to-grow-b2b-buy-now-pay-later-offering/"><strong>Affirm spinout Resolve just raised $25 million</strong></a> for its efforts to bring the buy now, pay later payments and debt phenom to the business-to-business market.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage-based pricing is a companywide effort</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2244885" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/usage-based-pricing-is-a-companywide-effort-not-a-pricing-strategy/"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244885" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2244885 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1280903246.jpg" alt="three people jumping for bubbles" width="1024" height="707" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1280903246.jpg 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1280903246.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1280903246.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1280903246.jpg?resize=768,530 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1280903246.jpg?resize=680,470 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1280903246.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2244885" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=We+Are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We Are <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/usage-based-pricing-is-a-companywide-effort-not-a-pricing-strategy/">his latest guest post for TechCrunch+</a>, OpenView partner Kyle Poyar explains why usage-based pricing &#8220;is a companywide effort&#8221; that &#8220;requires ditching the old SaaS metrics playbook.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no fad: UBP went mainstream because SaaS companies that use it see dramatically higher growth and retention rates.</p>
<p>Citing examples from powerhouses like Twilio, Stripe, AWS and others, Poyar explains how UBP companies &#8220;share their customers&#8217; success&#8221; and reduce their risk of ending up with a CRM packed &#8220;with lots of unprofitable customers.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/tinder-is-partnering-with-spotify-to-launch-a-new-music-mode-feature/"><strong>Spotify and chill:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, “hanging out” to watch “Netflix” may have become an only marginally coded phrase in English of late, but with Tinder partnering with Spotify to allow users to “hear a 30-second looped preview of a potential match’s chosen song while checking out their profile,” we are curious about how long a variation of the theme will come to market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/netflix-launches-a-website-dedicated-to-news-about-renewals-exclusive-interviews-and-more/"><strong>Netflix takes on SEO spam with new website:</strong></a> American streaming giant has come out with a new website called “Tudum,” which, if you say it out loud, sounds roughly like the noise that the Netflix logo makes when you fire up its app on your television, staring down another night at home thanks to COVID-19. <em>Tudum!</em> Anyhoo, the website “will host consumer news about renewals and release dates,” TechCrunch reports. Which means that those articles about “What To Watch On Netflix November 28, 2021” may lose some of their SEO juice.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/gm-rare-earth-magnet-us-supply-chain/"><strong>GM locks in supplies to build domestic EV tech:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Deciding to build electric vehicles is a step in a longer journey that includes some delicate sourcing work. Getting one’s hands on the raw materials required for battery production is no easy task. Nor is “locking in a domestic source of rare earth minerals, alloy and finished magnets for the electric motors” work that GM has recently undertaken.</li>
<li>And, finally for today’s news roundup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/meta-rolls-out-a-suite-of-new-features-and-discovery-tools-for-facebook-live-creators/"><strong>Meta has rolled out new tooling for Facebook Live users</strong></a>.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tim Berners-Lee’s startup, Inrupt, has raised about $30 million in its Series A financing round, a source familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Forte Ventures led Inrupt&#8217;s new round, the two said Thursday, but both declined to disclose the size of the deal. The round saw participation from “all existing investors,” including Akamai Technologies and Glasswing Ventures, as well as new investors Allstate and the Minderoo Foundation’s Frontier Technology Initiative.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/tim-berners-lee-startup-inrupt-funding/">reported in late October</a> that the three-year-old <a href="https://inrupt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inrupt</a> was in talks to raise between $30 million to $50 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245773" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Inrupt &#8212; founded by the creator of the standards of the world wide web, Berners-Lee, and technologist John Bruce &#8212; is attempting to “reshape the internet” by building a platform that gives users control of their data. The Inrupt team includes cryptography expert Bruce Schneier.</p>
<p>“Business transformation is hampered by different parts of one’s life being managed by different silos, each of which looks after one vertical slice of life,” said Berners-Lee in a statement. “Meanwhile, that data is exploited by the silo in question, leading to increasing, very reasonable, public skepticism about how personal data is being misused.”</p>
<p>Inrupt’s platform enables users to store their personal data in something called a POD (Personal Online Datastores). These PODs are interoperable with decentrealized applications and can be decoupled whenever the user prefers to do so. Inrupt believes, it said in an investor pitch obtained by TechCrunch, that it is attempting to emulate the core infrastructure of companies such as Visa for credit card processing and Verisign, which commercialized the DNS standard.</p>
<p>“This approach allows consumers to take control of their data while giving governments and companies — and their app developers — a more seamless transition into a new internet era and regulatory regime (e.g., GDPR),” wrote Hunter Hartwell, principal at Forte Ventures, <a href="https://medium.com/forteventuresinsights/a-foundation-for-web3-from-the-creator-of-web1-our-investment-in-inrupt-2467a620133e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a blog post</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our thesis for the investment in Inrupt is a simple one: consumers, governments, and many companies are eager to move towards a truly open and collaborative web (aka Web3), and Inrupt’s enterprise Solid server (ESS) represents the most technically advanced and commercially viable path to realizing that future. Embedded in our thesis is the belief that this top-tier team is uniquely qualified to meet the requirements and expectations of government and corporate partners, as well as the broader public,” he added.</p>
<p>Inrupt&#8217;s customers include governments and enterprises. The startup has signed contracts with governments of Sweden, Argentina and Basque, TechCrunch reported earlier. It generated $225,000 in revenue last year, and $200,000 in revenue in September, the report said.</p>
<p>The startup will deploy the funds to “expand its global footprint of Solid deployments in both the government sector and the commercial sector,” said Hartwell.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The company formerly known as Facebook is taking a step toward its goal to transport us to the metaverse. Now, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/facebook-horizon/">Horizon Worlds</a> &#8212; the Second Life or Minecraft of Meta&#8217;s VR apps &#8212; is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/horizon-worlds-open-in-us-and-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding</a> out of invite-only beta, opening up to all users over 18 years old in the U.S. and Canada. This is a huge milestone for the app, which was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/facebook-horizon/"> first announced</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>The free app is a social world-building playground. When you enter the app (after a short tutorial if it&#8217;s your first time), you&#8217;re presented with three options: play (games), attend (events) and hang out. You can explore experiences that Meta itself created, plus community-generated spaces, which anyone can build. In October, the company announced <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/expanding-horizon-new-funding-to-support-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$10 million in funding</a> for creators building these VR experiences, incentivizing users to make new games and hangouts.</p>

<p>Before you enter any of these virtual spaces, the platform reminds you that anyone you interact with is a real person.</p>
<p>On the primary menu, which you access by looking at your left wrist, there&#8217;s a safety button that you can press, which instantly sends you to your &#8220;Safe Zone,&#8221; a private room where you can take a break or block, mute and report people.</p>
<p>One of the first hangout spaces users might encounter is the Plaza, a space created by Meta. Our legless avatar threw paper airplanes with strangers and even spoke with a community moderator, who chatted with newcomers and helped explain how the controls work (they&#8217;re intuitive enough, but take a few minutes to get used to). It was a weirdly pleasant experience, absorbing the futuristic scenery and listening as people around us chatted about their avatars&#8217; outfits, making metaverse small talk.</p>
<p>But in user-generated spaces, there won&#8217;t always be these human moderators who could intervene if something goes wrong. It&#8217;s not realistic to expect to see a Meta representative in every space in Horizon Worlds &#8212; it might even feel a bit creepy &#8212; but the metaverse poses new challenges in keeping people safe online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Meta has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ai-enforce-rules-engineers-doubtful-artificial-intelligence-11634338184" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled</a> to remove hate speech and violent images from Facebook, and the company is reeling from the impact of leaked internal documents that show how its app Instagram can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/seeking-to-respin-instagrams-toxicity-for-teens-facebook-publishes-annotated-slide-decks/">dangerous</a> for teens&#8217; mental health. Just yesterday, head of Instagram Adam Mosseri <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/instagrams-adam-mosseri-senate-hearing-teen-safety/">testified</a> before Congress about online safety for children and teens. But a metaverse world poses additional challenges, as it&#8217;s a more immersive audio-visual experience. Clubhouse <a href="https://www.protocol.com/moderation-clubhouse-building-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled to moderate</a> its live audio rooms, and even Twitter has <a href="https://twitter.com/SBkcrn/status/1465659201800347651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run into issues</a> with harmful content on Spaces as of late. Twitch streamers have dealt with &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/streamers-are-boycotting-twitch-today-to-protest-the-platforms-lack-of-action-on-hate-raids/">hate raids</a>,&#8221; too.</p>
<p>But in terms of user experience, Horizon Worlds is a massive step up from Horizon Venues, Meta&#8217;s platform for immersive events (once Worlds is globally accessible out of beta, Venues might be rendered obsolete).</p>
<p>Right now, if you use Venues, you just get dropped into a blocky entry area, like a hallway in a movie theater. You can choose from a few rooms to enter, where you can watch a pixelated recording of a Billie Eilish concert on loop, for example. Worlds already feels more engaging and promising than Venues. But as Horizon Worlds opens itself up for millions of users to join, Meta needs to prove that it&#8217;s capable of keeping a social platform safe.</p>
<p>To run Horizon Worlds, you&#8217;ll need to download the free app on a Quest 2 device. As of January 13, 2022, it will no longer be supported on Quest 1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So your company is going WFH/Office hybrid. Great! Working from home more rules, even if management decisions or the specifics of your role mean it can&#8217;t happen <em>every</em> day.</p>
<p>Now, how do you coordinate who goes in the office and when? Does it have to be the same day(s) every week? Do you just pick a random day and hope there&#8217;s a desk open? What if you&#8217;re the only one who went in that day — did you really need to commute? Do we track all this in a spreadsheet, or do we need a whole separate tool just to keep track of it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getofficely.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Officely</a> wants to handle it all right through a tool many teams are already on anyway: Slack. They&#8217;ve just raised a $2 million seed round to grow from here.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245730" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Officely&#8217;s main draw is desk booking, allowing you to group desks by which office they&#8217;re in — or, if you&#8217;ve got a bunch of desks, into &#8220;neighborhoods&#8221; within an office. You can see how many people are going in to an office on any given day, see if there&#8217;s a desk open for you, and join if so. There&#8217;s also a few other customizations, like flagging if anyone is bringing a dog into the office on each day — for the folks who might want to stay home because of allergies or, if you&#8217;re like me, only want to go into the office when there&#8217;s at least one dog there.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245751" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245751" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2245751" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Booking-Giff.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="578" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245751" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Officely</p></div></p>
<p>You can set up customizable health screening surveys to make sure no one has a fever or known exposures, and have it automatically remind people to fill out the survey on the morning they&#8217;re expected to come in. If someone gets sick, Officely can also help with contact tracing, building a list of the employees who were in the office on the same days.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve also recently been experimenting with an &#8220;Office Chat&#8221; feature, which automatically creates a new Slack room at the beginning of a day, invites everyone who is scheduled to be in that day, then archives it at the end of the day. Great for figuring out lunch plans without bugging everyone back at home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I fired up a test instance of Officely, and it was really quite smooth. The UI for customizing some things away from their defaults can feel a bit buried, but that&#8217;s mostly because they&#8217;re working within the boundaries of being a Slack app — but they also do a bunch of neat stuff I didn&#8217;t even realize Slack apps can do. Team TC isn&#8217;t spending much time in the office right now so I couldn&#8217;t stress test it super hard, but I liked what I saw enough that we&#8217;ll probably give it a spin if/when we return to the office.</p>
<p>Officely is currently free for small teams, with the free plan capped at 10 employees and one office. If you&#8217;ve got more employees or more offices, they&#8217;ll charge $2.50 per office employee per month (&#8220;We only ever charge for your employees that use Officely to book into the office,&#8221; they note.) Once you grow past 500 employees, they offer custom pricing plans.</p>
<p>So why build the whole thing within Slack? &#8220;The interesting challenge with desk booking tools is the software has to be adopted by everyone in the company to be effective,&#8221; co-founder Max Shepherd-Cross tells me. Convincing everybody to onboard onto some new web app is tough; Slack, meanwhile, is where many companies&#8217; mishmash of teams are already used to coming together.</p>
<p>Officely is a pivot; the team started back in 2017 with a different focus: hotel room booking. &#8220;We just got <em>crushed</em> by COVID. Overnight, we lost all of our customers,&#8221; says Shepherd-Cross. &#8220;After crying into our pillows for a couple of weeks, we had the realization that offices of the future are going to be run like hotels of the past. [&#8230;] The whole booking infrastructure we&#8217;d spent the previous four years building for hotels, we now need for offices.&#8221;</p>
<p>This round was led by TEN13, and backed by angel investors Vu Tran (co-founder of learning platform Go1) and Adam Schwab (CEO of travel co. Luxury Escapes).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has rolled out &#8220;Year in Review&#8221; features for both Facebook and Instagram. On Facebook, users can share their personalized &#8220;Year Together&#8221; card, which highlights the friends, feelings, places and people that mattered most to them in 2021. The new in-feed experience reflects on people&#8217;s year on the platform and curates it into a shareable card. The new feature is available globally starting today and will be accessible until December 30th.</p>
<p>On Instagram, users can share a custom end-of-year &#8220;Playback&#8221; time capsule to their IG Story. The feature leverages the Stories Archive, so users can customize and select up to 10 stories to share with their followers. To be eligible for this feature, users need to have posted more than three stories this year or have Stories Archive turned on. The platform will suggest Playback posts for you, but you&#8217;ll also have the option to pick what you want to share. Users will see a message in their Instagram feed inviting them to create their own Playback. The new feature will be available to users for several weeks.</p>

<p>In previous years, Instagram users have created their own version of an end-of-year feature where they would post their top nine images in a photo grid. This year, Instagram is offering an in-app method for its users to create shareable end-of-year content.</p>
<p>Both Facebook and Instagram&#8217;s new features are fully customizable so users can add or remove content and posts that they choose. Meta notes that these two features are rolling out over the next few days to all users around the globe.</p>
<p>The launch of the new features comes as shareable end-of-year recaps have become increasingly popular thanks to Spotify’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/spotifys-wrapped-2021-arrives-with-artist-video-messages-blend-and-even-a-game/"> annual Wrapped</a> experience that is widely shared across social media each year. Facebook and Instagram join many other digital giants looking to mimic the popular feature by releasing their own versions. For example, Reddit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/reddit-rolls-out-personalized-end-of-year-recaps-with-stats-about-users-habits/">rolled out</a> personalized recaps with stats about users&#8217; habits this week; meanwhile, Snapchat is expected to launch its &#8220;Year End Story&#8221; this month as well.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The world let out a collective sigh of relief when 2021 arrived. We congratulated ourselves for navigating 2020 and welcomed the year when things would finally go back to normal. But as we wrap the year, it’s become clear that &#8220;normal&#8221; is a thing of the past.</p>
<p>This is a reality growth marketers live in everyday. What worked yesterday may not work today and likely won’t work tomorrow. Let’s look at the three growth trends we saw in 2021 and how they will shape marketing in 2022.</p>
<h2>Less data, more privacy and the return of growth hacking</h2>
<p>In April 2021, Apple rolled out iOS 14.5, which made it so that apps required your permission to track your online behavior and serve personalized ads. Predictably, most users didn’t think twice before opting out. Suddenly, the user-level tracking data central to effective audience targeting and marketing attribution was restricted.</p>
<p>Apple implemented this shift in the name of consumer privacy, pledging to create a “safe and trusted place for users to discover apps.” But this change also shifted the power away from social media advertisers such as Facebook and Snap, who went from having unfettered access to user-level browsing and buying data to now receiving only aggregated information, often limited to the past 24 hours.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Meanwhile, platforms like Apple can track performance within their closed ecosystems. In fact, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4c19e387-ee1a-41d8-8dd2-bc6c302ee58e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook, YouTube, Snap and Twitter lost nearly $10 billion</a> in ad revenue, while Apple’s advertising business (search ads) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/074b881f-a931-4986-888e-2ac53e286b9d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tripled its market share</a>.</p>
<p>The change severely limits advertising algorithms and how much data can be used to optimize marketing campaigns. These limitations are localized to mobile activity today, but Apple has also unveiled a new feature for <a href="https://www.litmus.com/blog/apple-mail-privacy-protection-for-marketers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email</a> to hide your IP address from senders. Google is following suit and will start restricting device level IDs from advertisers.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Brands that have had the most success with advertising on influencer platforms urge marketers: &#8220;Don’t make ads, make TikToks.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h3>Predictions for 2022</h3>
<p>No longer armed with user-level data or access to robust platform attribution, marketers will have to roll up their sleeves and do it themselves. Top performers will embrace the roots of marketing measurement and media mix modeling, which involves comparing sales with marketing spend and using regression analysis to draw correlations and assign weightings to your marketing channels.</p>
<p>Brands will also need to experiment by evaluating advertising effectiveness by using <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/blog/tips-strategy/incrementality-testing-for-marketers/">incrementality tests</a>, such as turning channels on and off for select periods of time and using <a href="https://artofmarketingscience.github.io/what-are-geo-experiments/">geographic holdouts</a> (selecting control cities with no ad spend). Growth marketers will also need to collaborate more with their internal data science teams to construct bespoke attribution models, as one size will not fit all.</p>
<h2>TikTok, influencers and the dominance of native creative</h2>
<p>TikTok continued its meteoric rise this year, surpassing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/">1 billion monthly active users</a> in September. Influencer platforms are increasing their share of consumer screen time (~24 hrs/month for TikTok and ~22 hrs/month for YouTube in the U.S.).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

		Peter Gajdoš is a partner at <a href="https://fifthwall.com/">Fifth Wall</a>, where he co-leads the Climate Technology Investment team.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">When I started getting involved in clean tech 1.0 financing back in 2005, “climate change” was some future event.</p>
<p>Hurricane Katrina had just happened, and many experts viewed it primarily as a failure of the government to take care of its weakest citizens in the face of a natural disaster, not as climate change’s early shot. Al Gore’s movie, “An Inconvenient Truth,” had not come out yet. The scale of human-made CO<sub>2</sub> and its impact on temperature were still somewhat debated. Most key scientists and investors understood, but the general population and politicians were ambivalent at best.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2021: Climate change looks like a misnomer and we are in a true climate crisis. We see historic fires in Greece, Portugal and North America’s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/western-wildfires" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entire West Coast</a>; epic floods in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/23/europe/germany-floods-belgium-climate-change-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germany</a>; devastating tornadoes in historically temperate geographies such as the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57605651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Czech Republic</a>; record-breaking hurricanes in the Caribbean and Philippines; drought in Syria that ultimately led to civil war; destruction of the Great Barrier Reef. The list goes on. Nearly every region in the world has been heavily affected.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245500" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The climate crisis is real, happening now and really hurting us. So what do we do about it, and how do we allocate our money, time and brainpower to develop solutions? I believe it is a financial and a moral imperative to make climate technology, together with medicine, the main priority of humanity.</p>
<h2>The financial imperative</h2>
<p>If you don’t reduce carbon in your portfolio and in your business, you will become a dinosaur. Several stakeholders are coming together to create a financial groundswell.</p>
<p>Pensions and endowments are under increasing pressure to divest from fossil fuels. Shareholders are moving away from the likes of Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon, while more than 70 ESG/energy transition companies have <a href="https://qz.com/2036760/the-climate-tech-spac-boom-is-just-getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gone public via SPACs and IPOs</a> in the U.S. just in the past 18 months. Out of these companies, I would be willing to bet that 10 or more will be decacorns and two or three will be hectocorns.</p>
<p>For insurance companies, the natural hazard risk models have broken. FEMA maps are increasingly becoming obsolete; <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/100-year-floods-happening-term-change/story?id=78969683" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100-year floods</a> are happening every few years. Fire risk maps need to be completely redrawn. Having spent most of my adult life on the East and West coasts of the U.S., the damage is real. If buildings are on fire or underwater, they don’t have much value. We are discussing these issues with large insurers and the interest is unprecedented.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Governments are finally putting tough building codes in place. For example, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/16/10percent-london-offices-at-risk-of-becoming-obsolete-under-new-energy-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10% of buildings in London</a> will not be up to code in early 2022. U.S. cities and states have been slower to adopt, but if you don’t think this is coming, look at other regulatory patterns where the EU led and the U.S. followed.</p>
<p>Tenants are demanding cleaner buildings, especially among Gen Zs and millennials. Consumer brands, like <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-announces-2-billion-climate-pledge-fund-invest-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability/climate-innovation-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.unilever.com/news/press-releases/2020/unilever-sets-out-new-actions-to-fight-climate-change-and-protect-and-regenerate-nature-to-preserve-resources-for-future-generations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unilever</a>, are investing billions to invest in climate technology.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as usual in recent history, technology has come to save the prior fumbles by governments and populations. Many promising technologies have matured and now have an easier path to entering the mainstream. The levelized cost of electricity from solar and onshore wind <a href="https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2021/Jun/IRENA_Power_Generation_Costs_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> 85% and 56%, respectively, between 2010 and 2020.</p>
<p>While technological progress has been on an encouraging trajectory in energy and in transportation thus far, we are nowhere near done, especially in real estate and critical infrastructure. Specifically, just deploying the existing technologies in the built environment/real estate will not be sufficient. Even if we ignore payback and return requirements, which are often too difficult to meet, we would take care of less than 50% of the carbon emissions in the built environment with existing technologies, according to a Fifth Wall analysis. Therefore, I believe the focus needs to be twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scale up existing technologies so that payback declines from more than 10 years to two to five years. That’s where growth capital and eventually infrastructure investments come in.</li>
<li>Invent and firm up new technologies. That’s where government, national labs, universities, angel investors and venture capital come in.</li>
</ul>
<p>To tackle the crisis, capital must flood in and even more so than in the past few encouraging years, during which climate tech VC investment <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2020/climate-tech-investment-report-climate-week.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased</a> 40x between 2013 and 2019. We already have several multibillion-dollar tech and biotech venture and growth funds; now is time for several multibillion-dollar climate tech funds globally.</p>
<h2>The moral imperative</h2>
<p>If the financial impact is not convincing enough, I hope the appeal to human decency will be. I have heard so many times from some of the smartest investors in the world that this is not a good time to invest in climate &#8212; and, even more shockingly, that climate is not an “investable thesis.” It is too difficult, too large of a problem, too capital-intensive; we need to leave it to the government.</p>
<p>The short-termism and cynicism are infuriating. If we don’t invest in a major way now, when is the right time? When Northern California’s old forests have burned down? When North Carolina’s beautiful Outer Banks are shredded by hurricanes? When Amazon is worth $5 trillion, while its employees cannot find an insurable home on the West Coast? I would argue we have been focusing our precious resources on the wrong problems.</p>
<p>For the past 20 years, the brightest young people have focused their brains on how to trick people into double-clicking on an ad, getting eyeballs and likes. While certainly major advancements have been made in compute power and interconnectedness, I call the obsession with the social media world of Facebook and Twitter a colossal waste of brainpower given the challenges around health and climate.</p>
<p>The new generation of business leaders must be cut from a different cloth. I want the next Mark Zuckerberg to invent and scale a new battery. The next Jeff Bezos needs to look like Ryan Morris from Turntide Technologies, who is revolutionizing the electric motor industry. The next Jack Dorsey needs to create a new cement or other building material to create sustainable buildings. The next Steve Jobs needs to figure out how to consume, produce and transport water sustainably. Elon Musk might be controversial to some, but the truth is the world needs 10 more Elon Musks. Thus, my call to the next generation of entrepreneurs is to think about carbon, not clicks.</p>
<p>If we believe that the climate crisis is too complex and cannot be fixed fast enough, let’s look at biotech. In a time of crisis, humanity has proved its ability to act decisively. The amazing speed during the pandemic to develop and use vaccines, new monoclonal antibody treatments and ventilator technologies saved lives. Innovation from Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech saved the world from the precipice of an even bigger tragedy &#8212; and this inspires new biotech entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>We need the same urgency applied to climate tech. Many accuse climate tech investors, including myself, and climate scientists as alarmists. I would argue we are not being alarmist <em>enough</em>. The crisis is already unfolding; our minds and bodies are just wired not to feel it too much. Humans have a hard time panicking about a long-lasting, gradually worsening misery. Humanity is the proverbial frog being boiled in the CO<sub>2</sub>-loaded oceans.</p>
<h2>Not investing in climate tech is inexcusable</h2>
<p>Over the past 15 or so years, I have been on both the losing and the winning side of this struggle. We have experienced epic investment failures in biofuels and solar. At the same time, we have enjoyed incredible improvements and wins in batteries, carbon nanotubes, graphene nanomaterials, agtech, solar and wind technology.</p>
<p>I am not naïve; I know how difficult it is to build climate tech businesses. I know it is a capital-intensive sector. I know it takes years to perfect these technologies with a significant component of hardware. I fully appreciate how difficult it is to work with utility and real estate relics and to get them to off-take novel technology when their whole model is built on minimizing capital expenditures and maintenance costs during both construction and operation.</p>
<p>I know we got the timing wrong so many times. The point is this: Because the problem is so large and so hard, we need the brightest scientists, entrepreneurs, lawyers and financiers on it. We do not have a choice. To me, it is not an option to tell my children I was on the wrong side of history: actively supporting the destruction of our planet. I sincerely believe building inefficient, carbon-churning buildings and driving gas-guzzling cars will be looked at in 30 years the same way we look at tobacco or asbestos today: inexcusable.</p>
<p>COVID-19 was the first global war of our generation. Climate is the next, much bigger, one and it will last for several generations. Young entrepreneurs, please, think more about carbon and less about clicks. We will support you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As I<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/deed-pulls-your-employers-charity-and-volunteer-program-into-slack-to-keep-it-front-of-mind/"> wrote</a> earlier this year, <a href="https://www.joindeed.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deed</a>&#8216;s mission is a clearcut one: take the employee giving/charity/volunteer program that many big companies have, and make it better. Give it a proper home — one with a modern UI, built-in community management tools and that hooks into your workflow (read: Slack) so as to not be forgotten.</p>
<p>With that they were able to quickly get some big names on board, citing the likes of Airbnb, Stripe, Box and Adidas as customers quickly after launch. Now they&#8217;ve raised a $10 million Series A to keep the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Last week I hopped on a call with Deed co-founder Deevee Kashi, who stepped away from a conference he was speaking at to catch me up on what&#8217;s new with the company. He tells me that this latest round was led by Earlybird, and backed by PruVen Capital, Y Combinator and Paua Ventures, along with a few names that seem extra interesting from a strategic standpoint — like David Clarke (former CTO of the enterprise workplace management tool Workday), Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Jeffrey Katzenberg&#8217;s Wndrco.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245648" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One thing Kashi tells me about is an evolving focus for Deed right now: helping companies figure out what their employees really care about, and how to shape the company&#8217;s efforts — often wrapped up under a label of &#8220;Environmental, Social, and Governance&#8221; (or ESG) — accordingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;ESG investments are at record highs, right?&#8221; he says. &#8220;Companies are spending a lot of money, but they are not getting [employee] buy-in before doing so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal for Deed is really changing ESG, and the strategies around ESG, from &#8216;me&#8217; to &#8216;we&#8217;.&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Really empowering employees to take action around causes they care about, thereby allowing companies to listen to and discover what their employees actually care about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of making that work, he says, will involve giving individual employees — not just those in charge of a company&#8217;s social impact team — more abilities to create and manage programs, fundraisers and volunteer campaigns. &#8220;[It&#8217;s about] empowering the employees themselves to manage the program for the company, as opposed to the companies managing the program for the employees.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other part, he notes, is building out their data team and finding ways to &#8220;measure and report on impact&#8221; in a clear, actionable way.</p>
<p>Before this, Deed had raised $2 million in a seed round in late 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remember all the way back to December 2020. Where were you? What were your plans? What did you expect and hope the new year would bring? I suspect I’m not alone in feeling like I’ve spent much of the past year on a hamster wheel, with better days just over the horizon. Truth is, few of us reasonably expected the pandemic to stretch on for this long. And our expectations of “normal” have adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>As we reflect on how the last year has played out for robotics &#8212; and the way things look, going forward &#8212; the pandemic is, once again, the primary force guiding practically every facet of the industry. As I mentioned last week, we’re going to spend these next few weeks wrapping up the year here on Actuator. This week, I want to talk about delivery robotics, a category that’s seen some of the biggest investment this past year.</p>
<p>But first, we’ll be asking some of the industry’s leading names to reflect on the year that was &#8212; and help us forecast how 2022 might look for robotics and automation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245088" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2245095" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245095" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2245095" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="441" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg 1799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg?resize=300,129 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg?resize=768,330 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg?resize=680,293 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg?resize=1536,661 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cmubd.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245095" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CMU/Boston Dynamics</p></div></p>
<p>First up is Matthew Johnson-Roberson, who recently became the director of CMU’s Robotics’ Institute. Johnson-Roberson served as co-director for the University of Michigan’s Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles and co-founder of Refraction AI &#8212; which is to say, it’s not surprising that he offers some insight into how things will look for the autonomous driving industry.</p>
<p><strong>What was the defining robotics/AI/automation trend of 2021?</strong> I’m seeing increasing trends in application-specific AI companies (computer vision tasks, robotics devices to solve a problem, chat bots for x, etc.). Those seem poised to continue as the market looks for good fits for increasingly powerful algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>What will 2022 bring for these categories?</strong> In the coming year, I expect more of the large self-driving companies to continue their consolidation and more to go public as they prepare to burn capital attempting to expand and serve customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week we also spoke to Rob Playter, the longtime Boston Dynamics executive who was appointed CEO early last year.</p>
<p><strong>What was the defining robotics/AI/automation trend of 2021?</strong> Legged robots coming of age. 2021 saw the introduction of multiple legged robots to the market. Quadrupeds are leaving the lab and entering the workplace, and the ongoing labor shortages plaguing many industries has only intensified the need. We&#8217;ve seen strong interest for Spot around industrial use cases where mobile robots can navigate worksites that include stairs, doors and other obstacles that would foil wheeled or tracked robots. Our customers are using Spot as a dynamic sensing platform to collect reliable, repeatable data around their sites for tasks like thermal anomaly detection in industrial manufacturing, radiation mapping in nuclear facilities and digital twin modeling on construction sites. Products like Spot are proving they can add real value in the real world.</p>
<p><strong>What will 2022 bring for these categories?</strong> Operational adoption. In 2022 customers will begin deploying mobile robots like Spot at greater scale across their enterprises. We&#8217;ve seen tremendous uptake by industrial innovation teams exploring mobile robots for a wide variety of applications, and next year we expect to see customers integrating more robots into their asset management programs and day-to-day operations. But for industrial mobile robots to expand rapidly at enterprise scale, we also need to see greater reliability from the industry as a whole. We&#8217;ve seen a lot of products announced that are conceptual-only or that have only been deployed in small proof-of-concept exercises. As more and more businesses look to invest in real-world technology, the most reliable, robust and accessible products will prevail.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195465" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195465" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2195465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg" alt="Nuro-Las Vegas fundraising round" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nuro-Vegas_Announce-5.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195465" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nuro</p></div></p>
<p>Few segments of this industry gained more traction over these past two years than delivery. Prior to the pandemic, much of the conversation around autonomous delivery centered around regulation and questions of demand. After the first several months of the pandemic brought much of the world to a standstill, leaving many afraid to venture outside the safety of their own homes, delivery services like Seamless and Uber Eats saw a sharp uptick in usage.</p>
<p>While stay-at-home orders have loosened in much of the world throughout 2021, myriad issues have continued to plague industries, leaving sharp demand for automation. These include widespread staffing shortages for food service and other blue-collar jobs, as well as global supply chain and shipping issues. That is to say that delivery issues aren’t just a matter of last- or middle-mile &#8212; it’s every segment here.</p>
<p>For those reasons (for starters, at least), it’s unsurprising that so much of this has been met with a massive uptick in investments across the board. As with so much of robotics, problems analysts expected companies would be tackling five or 10 years down the road are suddenly impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>Nuro led the way with one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/nuro-lands-investment-from-google-tiger-global-in-new-600-million-round/">biggest robotics raises in recent memory</a>, led by (who else?) Tiger Global. The $600 million Series D, announced early last month, increased the company’s valuation north of 70%, to $8.6 billion. Integral to the deal is a new partnership with Google Cloud, which finds both parties pushing the service toward commercialization, as they “explore opportunities together to strengthen and transform local commerce.”</p>
<p>If you’ve spent any time near college campuses, there’s a decent chance you’ve seen delivery robots like Kiwibot out in the world. And while funding &#8212; and, in Nuro’s case, production &#8212; is ramping up, you’re almost certainly getting a majority of packages delivered to you by human beings at this point.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241938" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241938" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2241938" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg" alt="The Coco One sidewalk delivery robot powered by Segway on the Palisades" width="1024" height="819" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg 4653w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg?resize=768,614 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg?resize=680,544 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg?resize=1536,1229 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg?resize=2048,1638 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COCO1-Palisades01.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241938" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Coco</p></div></p>
<p>Speaking of campuses, UCLA spinout Coco saw a decent size round early this year with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/last-mile-robotic-delivery-firm-coco-raises-36m/">a $36 million raise</a>, bringing the company’s funding up to $43 million. Co-founder and CEO Zach Rash insisted that the time is now for such delivery technologies, noting in a release, “I strongly believe the delivery service industry in its current state is massively under-serving merchants. We have an enormous opportunity to create a better experience for hundreds of thousands of merchants and their customers, today. This is not a research program experimenting with technology to be productized at some unknown point in the future.”</p>
<p>The firm, formerly known as Cyan Robotics, doesn’t have a high-profile partner like Nuro’s Domino’s deal, thought it does list 18 partners, largely in the Los Angeles area. It’s currently operating deliveries in Santa Monica and five other LA areas. So, while it’s true that robotic deliveries are currently more the exception than the rule, if you order food in the right place at the right time, it just might be a robot on the other end.</p>
<p>This week, the company also announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/segway-makes-its-first-foray-into-sidewalk-robot-delivery-with-coco-partnership/">a manufacturing deal with Segway</a>. The latter&#8217;s VP of global business development, Tony Ho, tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is just the beginning of our partnership. We will stay on the product side of things, and Coco will be the operators. So it’s a bit similar to the micromobility space where we provide the vehicles and hardware and they provide the relationship with the city and the staff and the whole operation behind it. Right now, we’re seeing this almost like it was with scooters in 2017, where the whole industry is booming. It’s a land grab.</p></blockquote>

<p>Starship, meanwhile, kicked off the year with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/starship-technologies-raises-17m-to-roll-out-more-delivery-bots/">healthy $17 million raise</a>. The company is among those robotic delivery services focused on getting food to campuses, announcing plans to expand from 15 universities to 100.</p>
<p>Autonomous trucking had a great year, as well, citing similar concerns around staffing shortages. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/self-driving-truck-startup-kodiak-robotics-raises-125m/">Kodiak Robotics raised a $125 million Series B</a>, with plans to double its headcount, while Swedish firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/autonomous-trucking-startup-einride-raises-110m-ahead-of-expansion-into-united-states/">Einride drummed up $110 million</a>, with plans to expand into the U.S.</p>

<p>And as we transition into the robotics news of the week, here’s yet another delivery raise. The $13 million Series A comes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/uber-spinout-serve-robotics-gets-13m-seed-round-to-expand-sidewalk-robot-deliveries/">courtesy of Serve Robotics</a>, which spun out from Uber’s Postmates earlier this year. “Our goal is to put robots in every major U.S. city in the next two to three years,” co-founder Ali Kashani said of the company’s grand ambitions.</p>
<p>7-Eleven’s investment wing, 7-Ventures, was involved in the round. The convenience store giant is especially bullish about robotics deliveries these days, having piloted with Nuro, among others. Delivery Hero, which also participated in the round, has worked with Starship previously.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244494" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244494" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2244494" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Recording-2021-12-07-at-4.23.01-PM.2021-12-07-16_24_45.gif" alt="" width="600" height="509" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244494" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Petra</p></div></p>
<p>Next, we move underground, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/petra-emerges-from-stealth-with-30m-raised-for-tunnel-boring-robot-swifty/">Petra emerges from stealth</a> to announce a $30 million Series A. The company uses thermal technology to bore tunnels into some of the strongest rock on Earth. To demonstrate this feat, the startup also announced that its robot, Swifty, successfully bored a 20-foot tunnel through Sioux Quartzite at a rate of one-inch-per-minute.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Kim Abrams says:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve invented a completely new way to excavate rock and this will have profound implications on the future of tunneling. By delivering a boring solution that affordably undergrounds utilities through high-grade rock, we can finally protect communities from exposure to wildfires and ensure the safety of critical infrastructure in disaster-prone areas, especially in places like the Sierra Nevada mountains, Rocky Mountains, and coastal regions.</p></blockquote>

<p>A <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/system-designing-training-intelligent-soft-robots-1207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fun bit of research from MIT CSAIL</a> to close us out this week. The lab unveiled “Evolution Gym,” a testing simulator for soft robotic designs. It’s still a simulation, of course, but it offers some interesting insights into how compliant robots can adapt to different environmental challenges.</p>
<p>CSAIL notes, “The result looks like a little robot Olympics. In addition to standard tasks like walking and jumping, the researchers also included some unique tasks, like climbing, flipping, balancing, and stair-climbing.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix has launched a <a href="http://www.netflix.com/tudum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new website</a> called &#8220;Tudum,&#8221; which will host consumer news about renewals, release dates and extra content featuring its TV shows and movies. The company is marketing the website as &#8220;a place to discover more about your Netflix favorites.&#8221; For a more curated experience, users can log into the website with their Netflix account. Netflix says the website is still currently in its early days, as it plans to continue to build it out and add new features in the future.</p>
<p>Tudum will feature extra content and information about Netflix&#8217;s TV shows and movies. For example, Netflix notes that users will be able to dig deeper into its content and use the website to find out things like where else they&#8217;ve seen the cast of &#8220;The Witcher&#8221; and whether &#8220;Maid&#8221; is based on a true story. The website includes exclusive interviews, cast breakdowns, information about content that&#8217;s popular on the platform, a trending news section, details about upcoming shows, an explore section and more.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Say hello to Tudum — a backstage pass that lets you dig deeper into the Netflix films, series, and stars you love!

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Tudum, which is named after the sound users hear when they press play on Netflix, is also the name of Netflix&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/netflix-sets-tudum-its-first-ever-virtual-global-fan-event-for-september-25/">global virtual fan</a> event that took place in September. The event included exclusive first looks and panels with stars from some of Netflix&#8217;s most popular titles. It featured conversations with the creators and stars of some of Netflix’s most popular shows, including “Stranger Things,” “Emily in Paris,” “The Witcher,” “The Crown,” “Cobra Kai” and “Bridgerton.”</p>
<p>The streaming giant&#8217;s chief marketing officer, Bozoma Saint John, announced the launch of the new website in a <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/meet-tudum-your-backstage-pass-to-the-netflix-stories-you-love" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, stating that Netflix is &#8220;e<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">xcited to introduce Tudum for fans to dive deeper into the stories they love, fuel their obsessions and start new conversations. It’s still early days, and our launch today is just the beginning.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The new website is now accessible around the globe but is currently only available in English. It&#8217;s unknown if Netflix plans to launch the website in more languages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome to part two of our venture capital-recommended book gift guide for 2021!</p>
<p>Yesterday we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/gift-guide-the-best-non-business-books-for-2021-recommended-by-vcs/">tackled <em>non</em>-business books</a> recommended by a raft of venture capitalists. Today we’re flipping it around and talking about books with a business theme. There were a few titles that straddled the gap, so if any of the below strike you as a modest stretch regarding how <em>businessy</em> they are, well, we hear you.</p>
<p>Regardless, keep in mind that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">The Exchange</a> is paywall-free today again, as we’re huge book fans and wanted to keep this as accessible as possible. Oh, and <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anna</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> will be dropping their personal recs in this weekend&#8217;s Exchange newsletter, which lots of you already receive on Saturdays, but you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">get here</a> if you’d like.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245444" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A big thanks to the dozens of venture capitalists who contributed ideas to these posts, and double points to those who didn’t have an assistant handle their emailing! Oh, and we only had two books recommended by the people who wrote them, which was a lower ratio than we anticipated. Good job!</p>

<p>Recommended by <a href="https://twitter.com/vc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Chapman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zachcoelius" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zach Coelius</a>, this book carries blurbs from Kara Swisher and Nick Bilton, so it appears to be one that crosses the technology-media divide that we occasionally have to treat like a DMZ. The gist is that the market for zero-day cyber weapons is not what it once was. In the old days, the United States controlled the arsenal. At great expense, but who cares. Then it lost control of the zero-day world. And what comes next, people say, is staggering.</p>

<p>Daisy Garcia at <a href="https://twitter.com/JetBlueVentures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JetBlue Ventures</a> recommended it alongside Reeves Wiedeman&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Billion-Dollar-Loser-Spectacular-Neumann/dp/0316461369" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Billion Dollar Loser: The Epic Rise and Spectacular Fall of Adam Neumann and WeWork</a>,&#8221; describing both books as &#8220;good reminders to invest in what you know and also fun.” Alex and Anna both read &#8220;Bad Blood,&#8221; and from our desks, this book is the rare must-read in the business book pantheon. You must read it to understand how far things can go off the startup rails, and, frankly, learn a hell of a lot about the world of business.</p>

<p>Next year, we’ll add a section for books that we bought and have on our shelves but have yet to start. &#8220;An Ugly Truth&#8221; is one such book. Alex bought a copy when it came out and has been promising himself since that he will stop reading fiction and get around to it. So far, so bad, but it’s still a book that feels like a mandatory read.</p>
<p>Why? Because Facebook is hardly giving up on its long-term goals. The company is shifting its growth model somewhat, but has hardly gone through a DNA-level change regarding how it considers its political setup (one owner, led by the blind) or operational goals (all your eyes are belong to us).

<p>This one has been on Anna&#8217;s reading list ever since she listened to the &#8220;<a href="https://www.radicalcandor.com/candor-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radical Candor&#8221; podcast</a>, which distills the book&#8217;s ideas into a conversational format. But whatever medium you choose, make sure you don&#8217;t stop at the title, or you might misunderstand the message. Being radically candid is not about being brutal; it is a form of kindness, because honesty beats niceness.</p>
<p>This could apply to many areas in life, but this is definitely business content, and especially relevant to the startup and tech world. Author Kim Scott is a former Apple and Google executive and knows a thing or two about leadership &#8212; we are not surprised that VCs are reading. &#8220;The book provides great guidance on delivering effective feedback — whether it’s positive or negative,&#8221; Steffens noted. &#8220;It has helped me recommit to passing quickly when I’m not convinced of the opportunity — and to deliver that message clearly, so there’s no room for confusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maximizing value creation for shareholders is, at times, not a very good idea. That’s because the cost of doing so in particular situations creates such heavy societal burdens that it’s a clear net-negative for humanity. A few examples that come to mind include the oil industry hiding its knowledge of global warming for decades, the tobacco industry fighting the obvious truth that smoking is cancerous and the recent lobbying efforts by alcohol companies to combat cannabis legalization. The impact of those actions was unchecked carbon emissions, lots of cancer deaths and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/07/america-drinking-alone-problem/619017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">miserable rates of alcoholism</a>.</p>
<p>And then there are the Sacklers. Not that we want to diminish the impact of the above shareholder-value-creating actions, but the Sacklers might have them beat. If you’re not aware, the Sackler dynasty helped foment an opioid addiction epidemic, recycling some of their ill-gotten gains into charitable donations — the standard billionaire method of hiding the source of their wealth with some media-friendly wrapping paper. We want to read this book to better understand just how things went so wrong, for so long.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Aristocracy of Talent&#8221; comes with a recommendation from Molten&#8217;s James Clark, but also with a blurb from one of Anna&#8217;s favorite thinkers, <a href="https://twitter.com/sapinker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven Pinker</a>. Here&#8217;s what he wrote about Adrian Wooldridge&#8217;s latest book: &#8220;This unique and fascinating history explains why the blame now being piled upon meritocracy is misplaced — and that assigning responsibilities to the people best able to discharge them really is better than the time-honored customs of corruption, patronage, nepotism and hereditary castes. Wooldridge upends many common assumptions and provides an indispensable back story to this fraught and pressing issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are all for upending assumptions here, especially when the topic is so frequently brought up in our tiny bubble — and we are curious to read more.</p>

<p>So there’s this idea in the market that the blockchain world is akin to a new internet. There are some issues with the idea, chiefly that blockchain tech runs on the internet, making it at most a layer-two effort for the web. Still, the concept that what today’s hackers are building will tear up the past and rewrite the future is strong.</p>
<p>Enter &#8220;The Infinite Machine,&#8221; which digs into the Ethereum blockchain, which some compare to an infinite computer or machine. We have our questions. For example, how did the web3 kids manage to build a computer that costs so much money to simply access? Snark aside, it’s worth taking the time to understand precisely why some folks are so rabidly bullish about the crypto market. They might be right!</p>

<p>You may have heard about this book on TechCrunch: Our colleague Connie Loizos <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/were-now-very-much-at-war-with-china-argues-a-provocative-new-book">interviewed its author</a> a couple of months ago. Their conversation covered key themes of the book &#8212; Silicon Valley, China, Russia &#8212; and made us keen to find out more, though not particularly reassured. From Connie: &#8220;Helberg lays out how China’s &#8216;techno-totalitarian&#8217; regime may be first impacting the Chinese people (its &#8216;first victims,&#8217; he says), but why its efforts to increasingly control the software and the hardware of the internet are a real and present and fast-escalating danger to the U.S. and democracies everywhere.&#8221; Having written quite a bit about China in 2021, and being aware that it will likely play some part in 2022, this makes a great candidate from our reading list.</p>

We’re surprised that more poker books didn’t make the list. But Purushotham brought one to us, so we made sure to include it. Per the investor, the book, written by “World Series of Poker champion-turned-business consultant Annie Duke, explains why it’s essential to embrace uncertainty when we make decisions.” That may seem counterintuitive, but as Purushotham noted, “whether you’re deciding which company to invest in, which product to build or which growth strategy to follow, the key to placing the best bets is accurately assessing what you do and don’t know, and accepting that great decisions don’t always lead to great outcomes — because luck always has a hand to play.”</li>

Colella provided a somewhat longer-than-usual explanation for this title, which we’re including in its entirety:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>“At Citi Ventures, we like to say that &#8216;culture is the backbone of innovation,&#8217; and as Citi’s Leadership Principles make clear, a culture of innovation begins with creating space for everyone’s insights and ideas to be shared and heard. That, in turn, starts with listening. The best-selling book &#8216;You’re Not Listening&#8217; describes how difficult true listening is, despite — or perhaps because of — our constant access to digital communication channels and engagement opportunities. The book provides an important road map for reversing this trend and can help build a strong foundation for driving empathy, innovation and transformation.”</p></blockquote>
