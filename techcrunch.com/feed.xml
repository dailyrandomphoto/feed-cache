										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Doosan Robotics this week announced $33.7 million in funding, led Praxis Capital Partners and Korea Investment Partners. The fundraising news arrives as the Seoul-based company shows off its wares at CES in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The company says the funding will be used to increase research and development and attract new partners as it looks to expand its global footprint. Doosan also notes in a release that its robotics systems have hit 1,000 units annually, while sales outside of Korea (primarily North America and Western Europe) now account for roughly 70% of that total figure. The company is also in the process of eyeing an IPO.</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to expediting the growth of our business with the recent funds raised,” CEO Junghoon Ryu said in a release. “We will further enhance the competitiveness of new products and software that are mounted with our proprietary technology and strive to attain the position as number one market share holder in the global cobot market.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254204" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Doosan is primarily known for its collaborative robots (cobots), whose use run the gamut from manufacturing and research to the coffee-making barista robot, Dr. Presso, which debuted late last year.</p>
<p>Aside from the funding news, the company also announced the NINA (&#8220;New Inspiration. New Angle”) camera system. We’d mentioned it a few weeks ago, after it collected a CES Innovation award, but this week we’re getting more information on the robotic system, which is due out in March.</p>
<p>The company refers to NINA as a “prosumer” system, which likely applies to what’s supposed to be a relatively push-button approach to grabbing potentially complicated shots. That arrives in part, due to things like object tracking, coupled with an open platform that allows users to program different shots.</p>
<p>&#8220;NINA brings in a whole new era for Doosan as we expand our offerings into the entertainment and content genre,” the company’s CEO said in a separate statement. “Our goal has been to deliver something accessible yet innovative for professional content creators across entertainment, advertising, social media, and other relevant industries, and we’re confident NINA will deliver in big ways across the board.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Perhaps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/05/kickstarters-most-successful-fundraiser-shares-lessons-from-a-failed-campaign/">PodCase</a> was ahead of its time. It certainly made sense for devoted Apple fans: a one-stop portable charging solution for one’s iPhone and AirPods. The product also had the pedigree to match, including Pebble co-founder (and future YC partner) Eric Migicovsky. Ultimately the project failed to reach its lofty $300,000 Kickstarter goal.</p>
<p>For its part, Brooklyn-based Power1 kept its funding goals more grounded. The firm made $48,342 of a $20,000 Kickstarter target and has already begun production on the production, which is currently available for preorder for $99.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing around with a unit for a couple of weeks now, before its debut on the floor at CES. This model isn’t quite production-ready, mind. As the company’s founder put it to me: don’t drop it. That is to say, we’re not dealing with the final materials here. But it still gives you a pretty good picture of what you’re in for.</p>
<p>It’s split into two pieces: a rubberized case/bumper, and a charging addition that snaps on via MagSafe. The modularity is a nice touch &#8212; I’ve been primarily using it detached from the battery because, well, I don’t leave my apartment as much as I did in the before times.</p>

<p>The battery comes in white or black, with a contoured design similar to battery cases from companies like Mophie. It monopolizes most of the device’s rear, but for a cutout for the camera module. To its right is the AirPods case, with a flip-up transparent lid. The battery charges via USB-C and sports a little on-off switch on the bottom.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>For size reasons, it’s impossible to make a universal case, so at launch it will be limited to the iPhone 12, 12 Pro or 13, while the AirPods are only compatible with the latest models and not the Pros. One assumes that if the Power1 is a hit, AXS will expand availability. We&#8217;ll know soon enough if it&#8217;s truly an idea whose time has come.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a crazy year in growth marketing, what with the meteoric rise of TikTok, radical iOS privacy shifts and <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q3-2021-pitchbook-nvca-venture-monitor?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=vc_market_update&amp;utm_medium=nl-na&amp;utm_source=daily_pitch&amp;utm_content=q3_2021_pitchbook-nvca_venture_monitor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a staggering $240 billion poured into U.S. startups</a> as of September 30.</p>
<p>All of this new money has meant heavier investments in growth marketing throughout 2021. The heavier investments have occurred during uncertain times, with startups scrambling to find ways to measure iOS conversions and unlock TikTok as a new channel.</p>
<p>Last year, I wrote a <a href="https://jmstrategy.substack.com/p/2021-growth-marketing-predictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">column</a> on my predictions for 2021, which emphasized creativity being key, the inherent increase in attribution issues due to privacy changes and the power of leveraging influencers. While much has changed in this past year, there is a clear overlap from last year’s predictions with my growth marketing predictions for 2022. I’ll dive deeper on certain concepts like incrementality testing and continued growth in video engagement, while introducing a new prediction on the direction of ad platforms.</p>
<h2>Incrementality 2.0</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Uncertain months of endless scrambling would likely be the best way to summarizing the past year for paid channels like Facebook.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As we face industrywide degradation of data, marketers must become more comfortable with practicing incrementality testing — using controlled tests to understand the effectiveness of growth marketing efforts. As an example, if we wanted to test the impact of our Facebook efforts, we could pause the campaigns and measure the conversion deltas before and after making the change.</p>
<p>That’s incrementality testing at a macro level. But advertisers will need to be more sophisticated now. I like to call this the 2.0 age of incrementality testing. This new age will increase the precision and understanding of growth performance.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The InnerSpace concept looks like a futuristic car from the outside—but inside, there's a two-seat loveseat surrounded by one of the widest screens we've ever seen, and no steering wheel or pedals.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After introducing a six-person self-driving box and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-cadillac-ev-drone-vtol-concept-lyriq-celestiq-144643388.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="12" data-v9y="1">a frickin&#8217; ridable drone concept last year</a>, GM&#8217;s latest luxury self-driving EV idea is much more grounded. The <a href="https://media.cadillac.com/media/us/en/cadillac/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2022/jan/ces/0105-cadillac-halo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="13" data-v9y="1">InnerSpace concept </a>looks like a futuristic car from the outside—but inside, there&#8217;s a two-seat loveseat surrounded by one of the widest screens we&#8217;ve ever seen. There&#8217;s no steering wheel or pedals, of course. Instead, there&#8217;s a built-in ottoman and a compartment for slippers and a blanket. Where GM&#8217;s going, you won&#8217;t need any sort of manual control.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBDJBKZg9iA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Even stepping into the car seems like something from science fiction: the doors pop out, while the large windshield/sunroof rises up. As usual, concepts like the InnerSpace are a way for car designers to flex their muscles and imagine what future vehicles could actually be like. While it certainly seems out of reach for most people, perhaps Cadillac&#8217;s more affluent clientele would be intrigued by owning a personal spaceship. At least it&#8217;s better for the environment than full-sized luxury SUVs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254171" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Electrification and autonomous driving will fundamentally change the role of vehicles and the experiences customers have with them,” Bryan Nesbitt, GM&#8217;s executive director of Global Advanced Design, said in a statement. “We’re exploring where that will go with these innovative concepts, envisioning mobility as an ally of wellness, giving customers the ultimate luxury, more personal time rather than taking it.”</p>
<p>As someone who hates the act of driving, but lives in a place where I can&#8217;t avoid it, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how car makers turn these self-driving concept vehicles into a reality. And maybe after getting these wild designs through their systems, they&#8217;ll show us more concepts for self-driving family EVs.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anandsrao">Anand Rao</a> is global head of AI at <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en">PwC</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The rocket ship trajectory of a startup is well known: Get an idea, build a team and slap together a minimum viable product (MVP) that you can get in front of users.</p>
<p>However, today’s startups need to reconsider the MVP model <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ai-analytics/ai-predictions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) become ubiquitous in tech products</a> and the market grows increasingly conscious of the ethical implications of AI augmenting or replacing humans in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>An MVP allows you to collect critical feedback from your target market that then informs the minimum development required to launch a product — creating a powerful feedback loop that drives today’s customer-led business. This lean, agile model has been extremely successful over the past two decades — launching thousands of successful startups, some of which have grown into billion-dollar companies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253013" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>However, building high-performing products and solutions that work for the majority isn’t enough anymore. From facial recognition technology that has a bias against people of color to credit-lending algorithms that discriminate against women, the past several years have seen multiple AI- or ML-powered products killed off because of ethical dilemmas that crop up downstream after millions of dollars have been funneled into their development and marketing. In a world where you have one chance to bring an idea to market, this risk can be fatal, even for well-established companies.</p>
<p>Startups do not have to scrap the lean business model in favor of a more risk-averse alternative. There is a middle ground that can introduce ethics into the startup mentality without sacrificing the agility of the lean model, and it starts with the initial goal of a startup — getting an early-stage proof of concept in front of potential customers.</p>
<p>However, instead of developing an MVP, companies should develop and roll out an ethically viable product (EVP) based on responsible artificial intelligence (RAI), an approach that considers the ethical, moral, legal, cultural, sustainable and social-economic considerations during the development, deployment and use of AI/ML systems.</p>
<p>And while this is a good practice for startups, it’s also a good standard practice for big technology companies building AI/ML products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here are three steps that startups — especially the ones that incorporate significant AI/ML techniques in their products — can use to develop an EVP.</p>
<h2>Find an ethics officer to lead the charge</h2>
<p>Startups have chief strategy officers, chief investment officers — even chief fun officers. A chief ethics officer is just as important, if not more so. This person can work across different stakeholders to make sure the startup is developing a product that fits within the moral standards set by the company, the market and the public.</p>
<p>They should act as a liaison between the founders, the C-suite, investors and the board of directors with the development team — making sure everyone is asking the right ethical questions in a thoughtful, risk-averse manner.</p>
<p>Machines are trained based on historical data. If systemic bias exists in a current business process (such as unequal racial or gender lending practices), AI will pick up on that and think that’s how it should continue to behave. If your product is later found to not meet the ethical standards of the market, you can’t simply delete the data and find new data.</p>
<p>These algorithms have already been trained. You can’t erase that influence any more than a 40-year-old man can undo the influence his parents or older siblings had on his upbringing. For better or for worse, you are stuck with the results. Chief ethics officers need to sniff out that inherent bias throughout the organization before it gets ingrained in AI-powered products.</p>
<h2>Integrate ethics into the entire development process</h2>
<p>Responsible AI is not just a point in time. It is an end-to-end governance framework focused on the risks and controls of an organization’s AI journey. This means that ethics should be integrated throughout the development process — starting with strategy and planning through development, deployment and operations.</p>
<p>During scoping, the development team should work with the chief ethics officer to be aware of general ethical AI principles that represent behavioral principles that are valid in many cultural and geographic applications. These principles prescribe, suggest or inspire how AI solutions should behave when faced with moral decisions or dilemmas in a specific field of usage.</p>
<p>Above all, a risk and harm assessment should be conducted, identifying any risk to anyone’s physical, emotional or financial well-being. The assessment should look at sustainability as well and evaluate what harm the AI solution might do to the environment.</p>
<p>During the development phase, the team should be constantly asking how their use of AI is in alignment with the company’s values, whether models are treating different people fairly and whether they are respecting people’s right to privacy. They should also consider if their AI technology is safe, secure and robust and how effective the operating model is at ensuring accountability and quality.</p>
<p>A critical component of any machine learning model is the data that is used to train the model. Startups should be concerned not only about the MVP and how the model is proved initially, but also the eventual context and geographic reach of the model. This will allow the team to select the right representative dataset to avoid any future data bias issues.</p>
<h2>Don’t forget about ongoing AI governance and regulatory compliance</h2>
<p>Given the implications on society, it’s just a matter of time before the European Union, the United States or some other legislative body passes consumer protection laws governing the use of AI/ML. Once a law is passed, those protections are likely to spread to other regions and markets around the world.</p>
<p>It’s happened before: The passage of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU led to a wave of other consumer protections around the world that require companies to prove consent for collecting personal information. Now, people across the political and business spectrum are calling for ethical guidelines around AI. Again, the EU is leading the way after releasing a 2021 proposal for an AI legal framework.</p>
<p>Startups deploying products or services powered by AI/ML should be prepared to demonstrate ongoing governance and regulatory compliance — being careful to build these processes now before the regulations are imposed on them later. Performing a quick scan of the proposed legislation, guidance documents and other relevant guidelines before building the product is a necessary step of EVP.</p>
<p>In addition, revisiting the regulatory/policy landscape prior to launch is advisable. Having someone who is embedded within the active deliberations currently happening globally on your board of directors or advisory board would also help understand what is likely to happen. Regulations are coming, and it’s good to be prepared.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that AI/ML will present an enormous benefit to humankind. The ability to automate manual tasks, streamline business processes and improve customer experiences are too great to dismiss. But startups need to be aware of the impacts AI/ML will have on their customers, the market and society at large.</p>
<p>Startups typically have one shot at success, and it would be a shame if an otherwise high-performing product is killed because some ethical concerns weren’t uncovered until after it hits the market. Startups need to integrate ethics into the development process from the very beginning, develop an EVP based on RAI and continue to ensure AI governance post-launch.</p>
<p>AI is the future of business, but we can’t lose sight of the need for compassion and the human element in innovation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It's not been a great start to 2022 for your local venture capitalist's near-term liquidity chances.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some of the most high-flying stocks of the pandemic are struggling in the new year and it&#8217;s bad news for tech companies of all sizes.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/vcs-and-founders-are-max-bullish-as-public-markets-flash-warning-signs/">TechCrunch noted</a> yesterday that software stocks were having a pretty poor start to the year. That was, it turned out, only the beginning of the damage. Today&#8217;s trading took yet another bite out of the key tech sector.</p>
<p>Observe the following five-day chart of the WisdomTree Cloud Computing ETF, which tracks the <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bessemer Cloud Index</a>, long a key barometer of the performance of modern software shares:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254107" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2254122" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254122" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2254122 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png?resize=1536,962 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-2.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254122" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: YCharts</p></div></p>
<p>Per <a href="http://ycharts.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YCharts data</a>, the index closed at 46.30, or some 29% and change from its recent all-time highs. The turnaround in the value of software stocks is pretty wild. Today alone the index shed 5.91%.</p>
<p>For a sense of scale, a 10% decline from highs is considered a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correction.asp">correction</a>. A 20% decline is a technical <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp">bear market</a>. And a 30% decline? I think that&#8217;s called a shitstorm.</p>
<h2>Public fear versus private ebullience</h2>
<p>The disconnect that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/vcs-and-founders-are-max-bullish-as-public-markets-flash-warning-signs/">we discussed yesterday</a> of the private markets staying incredibly bullish while public markets run colder on some of the hottest startup categories is underscored by today&#8217;s trading.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s worth noting that there is quite a lot of momentum to today&#8217;s pace of startup investment, hinting that the stock market&#8217;s decision to revalue software stocks may take some time to trickle down to the startup level. What do we mean? That venture capital funds have already been raised at particular dollar amounts and investment schedules. This in essence sets up a lot of big, high-priced startup rounds to get done even as their future exit window tightens; it&#8217;s going to be harder to land an up exit if the public markets keep their minds changed regarding the value of software revenue.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vxAOj0Dy5k"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/the-era-of-ultra-rich-software-valuations-could-be-behind-us/">The era of ultra-rich software valuations could be behind us</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The era of ultra-rich software valuations could be behind us&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/the-era-of-ultra-rich-software-valuations-could-be-behind-us/embed/#?secret=vxAOj0Dy5k" data-secret="vxAOj0Dy5k" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In more on-the-ground terms, startups that today raise, say, a Series A that values them on future revenues are setting up a challenge in which they have to keep raising at high revenue multiples as they grow. This will become a more difficult <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLTcdOr66lA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrow to shoot</a> as they scale through later rounds. The closer those startups get to IPO scale, the more that public markets will impact their ability to price their shares. Falling public prices and fat private valuations will get into a tangle at some point. And there are a lot of unicorns out there that won&#8217;t fare super well on the exit front if stocks keep falling as they are.</p>
<p>Not a great start for 2022 for your local venture capitalist&#8217;s near-term liquidity chances, it appears.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, there has been a growing number of startups </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trying to make credit more accessible to consumers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such startup, </span><a href="http://www.petalcard.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announced today that it has raised a $140 million Series D round of funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s new valuation is $800 million &#8212; more than triple what Petal was valued at when it announced a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/valar-petal-series-c/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$55 million Series C round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September of 2020, according to a source familiar with the transaction.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254039" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2016, New York-based Petal offers two Visa credit card products aimed at underserved consumers with little to no credit history. The startup says its goal is to help people “build credit, not debt.” And it offers that credit based on cash flow rather than credit scores. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/kapor-capital-square-co-founder-sam-wen-back-tomocredit-in-its-10m-series-a-funding-round/">TomoCredit</a>, which TechCrunch has also covered, has a similar model. (The cards are issued by WebBank, a member of the FDIC). </span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, </span>Petal offers &#8220;modern&#8221; Visa credit cards, along with a mobile app, designed to help people &#8220;responsibly&#8221; build credit and manage their finances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its latest raise follows a year in which Petal has tripled its user base and more than quadrupled its revenue, from $11 million to nearly $50 million. Today, there are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nearly 300,000 Petal cardholders, which the company refers to as “members.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been adding 10,000 to 20,000 new members per month, according to Jason Gross, Petal’s co-founder and CEO. <span style="color: #000000;">Petal members are largely younger, digitally-native consumers that are building credit for the first time, although the startup has also served many other customer segments as well, including those seeking to rebuild their credit, noted Gross.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petal operated under stealth until launching its first product, and announcing its first funding, in September 2017. The company says its technology analyzes banking history — assessing creditworthiness by taking into account a person’s income, spending and savings to help people qualify <span style="color: #000000;">even if they’ve never used credit before. </span>It’s dubbed the process “CashScoring&#8221; and says the approach makes credit accessible to a greater pool of people and “on terms tailored to each person’s unique financial situation.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of Petal members had thin or no credit history when they first applied for a Petal card, and more than 40% of new members approved for a Petal card in 2021 were first denied credit by a major bank, the company said. The company claims that members who joined with no prior credit history have gone on to achieve an average credit score of 676 — a “prime” score qualifying them for auto loans, mortgages &#8220;and other financial opportunities previously out of their reach.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petal’s CashScore became a product of its own in 2021 as the company announced the launch of its first B2B enterprise service,</span><a href="http://www.prismdata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Prism Data</span></a>. That new B2B platform, designed to help other fintech startups and financial institutions use Petal’s “CashScoring” technology to grow their own businesses, <a href="https://medium.com/petal/from-raw-data-to-actionable-insights-introducing-prism-data-and-the-cashscore-bb7c97ff407e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went live</a> in early 2021 and is described as a &#8220;sister company&#8221; by Gross. <span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to say that Prism is a “next-generation data intelligence platform that translates raw transaction data into actionable insights and scores,&#8221; making the CashScore<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> technology &#8220;available to the broader market for the first time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin Allard, who previously held executive positions with Bloom Credit, Green Dot and The Bancorp, has been named general manager of the company and will lead Prism Data. Petal now has more than 160 employees, doubling its team over the last year.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We’re following in the footsteps of other fintech firms like Lithic and Upstart that have created sizable new B2B platforms by productizing the novel technologies they initially created to solve their own problems,&#8221; Gross told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, he added that Prism Data was founded on the belief that open banking and access to consumer-permissioned bank account transactional data will change the way consumer finance works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With this change, the credit score of the future will be a complete, real-time and holistic assessment of a consumer&#8217;s financial position, including their income, cash flows and assets, in addition to debt and repayment history,” Gross said. “Prism Data exists to give financial providers the tools they need to create next-generation products and capabilities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tarsadia Investments led Petal’s Series D financing, with participation from Valar Ventures (which led its Series C), CUNA Mutual, Encore Bank, Volery Capital Partners, Gopher Asset Management, RiverPark Ventures, Afore Capital, Gaingels and “a number” of other new and existing investors. To date, Petal has raised more than $240 million in equity capital and more than $450 million in debt financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rishi Reddy, head of venture and growth investing at Tarsadia, believes that the traditional credit system is broken and that consumers “are in desperate need of more modern and accessible financial products.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In addition to exponential user growth, Petal has proven the power of its tech as evidenced by stellar credit performance and the rapid scaling of Prism,” Reddy said in a written statement. “We are excited to double down on Jason and the team as they pioneer a new way to accelerate financial inclusion.”</span></p>
<p>Gross said Petal is hiring for more than 100 new roles in 2022 and we will use its capital &#8220;to add hundreds of thousands of new cardmembers in the coming year.&#8221; The company also plans to add new features and benefits to its cards.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After fitting some of its cars with comfy lounge chairs at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/bmw-wants-you-to-lounge-during-your-autonomous-ride/">CES 2020</a>, BMW today unveiled the next step in its in-car entertainment story: a 31-inch 8K smart TV with support for Amazon&#8217;s Fire TV service (with a country-specific streaming service for China in the works, too). This new 32:9 &#8220;My Mode Theatre&#8221; screen for rear passengers, combined with a Bowers &amp; Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System, is meant to give passengers a cinema-like experience while they cruise down the highway.</p>
<p>With its 5G connection, the car will be able to stream the latest shows on demand, while BMW&#8217;s My Mode system will set the mood for binge-watching the latest episodes of The Expanse. For now, there isn&#8217;t a lot of 8K content to watch &#8212; and Fire TV doesn&#8217;t support it yet &#8212; but at least your car will be ready for it when that time comes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253389" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253389" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253389" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg 9411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMWTheatreScreen_Backseat_View_16_9.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253389" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253379" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>And because you don&#8217;t always want a giant screen blocking your view, the screen is extended out of the headliner on request. The touch controls to do so are built into the rear doors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We develop immersive, digital experiences for sheer driving pleasure,&#8221; Frank Weber, member of the board of management of BMW AG Development, said in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;In Theatre Mode, the rear of the interior is transformed into a private cinema lounge. With the 31-inch display, 5G connectivity, 8K resolution, surround sound and individual streaming program, an unprecedented experience is created that sets new standards for in-car entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p>To set the mood in the car, whether for movie watching or anything else, BMW&#8217;s latest iDrive displays and operating system these days feature My Mode, which changes the driving and transmission controls to change the car&#8217;s overall driving behavior, as well as the theme of the displays, sounds and overall lighting in the car based on your personal preferences.</p>

<p>Until now, the available modes were &#8220;Efficient,&#8221; &#8220;Sport&#8221; and &#8220;Personal,&#8221; but at CES today the company also introduced a few new variants: &#8220;Expressive,&#8221; &#8220;Relax,&#8221; &#8220;Digital Art&#8221; and &#8212; for watching movies &#8212; &#8220;Theatre.&#8221; These new modes will roll out in the second half of the year and for most of these new modes, we&#8217;re mostly talking about theming the car more than changing its driving characteristic.</p>
<p>For the digital art mode, BMW partnered with Chinese multimedia artist Cao Fei, who created new artwork for the launch that is meant to symbolize&#8221; the deep connection of humankind and nature.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253410" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253410" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253410" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg 4961w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ID8_MyModes_DigitalArt_Mode_04.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253410" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, for its sound design, BMW has once again partnered with film music composer Hans Zimmer to create specific sounds for its electric fleet. BMW IconicSounds Electric will make their debut in the BMW i4 in the first half of 2022 and the BMW iX in the second half of the year, and will be available as an over-the-air software update.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After first teasing it a few weeks ago, BMW today officially unwrapped its color-changing car at CES. The BMW iX Flow, as the German automaker has dubbed this experimental vehicle, is wrapped in what is basically a form of e-paper, which BMW developed in cooperation with <a href="https://www.eink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E Ink</a>.</p>
<p>As of now, we&#8217;re only talking about black and white as color options (with a few shades of grey in between), but that could change over time. And because just like your Kindle&#8217;s screen doesn&#8217;t use any energy after the content has changed, the iX Flow&#8217;s electrophoretic technology doesn&#8217;t use any energy either after you&#8217;ve set up your preferred color and design.</p>

<p>First and foremost, this is obviously about giving drivers more options to customize their car&#8217;s look. <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This gives the driver the freedom to express different facets of their personality or even their enjoyment of change outwardly, and to redefine this each time they get into their car,&#8221; says Stella Clarke, head of Project for the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink. &#8220;Similar to fashion or the status ads on social media channels, the vehicle then becomes an expression of different moods and circumstances in daily life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Right now, BMW is only showing off the entire surface of the vehicle changing at once, but you could easily imagine the equivalent of e-ink bumper stickers or &#8212; because this is the world we live in &#8212; full-sized ads on the side of the car.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253831" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253831" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253831" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="674" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg 4961w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg?resize=1536,1010 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg?resize=2048,1347 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/37_SW_FinBMW-iX-eInk_Seite_02.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253831" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>But BMW also argues that there are other motivations here. Maybe drivers could choose a light surface on warm sunny days instead of a black, heat-absorbing one, for example (or the other way round on cold days). &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">This reduces the amount of energy the vehicle electrical system needs and with it also the vehicle&#8217;s fuel or electricity consumption,&#8221; the company argues in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;In an all-electric car, changing the colour in line with the weather can therefore also help to increase the range. In the interior, the technology could, for example, prevent the dashboard from heating up too much.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the end of the day, that&#8217;s a nice bonus, but what most people will simply want is a supervillain-style color-changing car. They won&#8217;t be getting that anytime soon, though. For now, this is only an experiment, with no ETA for when &#8212; or if &#8212; it&#8217;ll come to a production car.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is adding two more electric vehicle SUV models under the Chevrolet brand by 2023 in addition to the upcoming Silverado EV WT pickup, General Motors CEO and Chair Mary Barra said at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">2022 CES</a> tech trade show Wednesday.</p>
<p>The company, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/the-chevy-silverado-finally-goes-electric/">revealed Wednesday two versions of the upcoming Silverado EV pickup</a>, also announced that it will begin selling electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Chevrolet Blazer in 2023.</p>
<p>&#8220;As our most popular vehicle brand, Chevy will be front and center in our mission to provide EVs for everyone,&#8221; Barra said. &#8220;We&#8217;re at the tipping point of electrification and we are expecting this to be a massive year for Chevrolet&#8217;s EV future.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253974" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Chevrolet will also launch a Silverado Work Truck (WT) in spring 2023, followed by a more expensive luxury model called the Silverado RST in 2024. Both trims will have an estimated range of 400 miles and standard DC fast-chaging up to 350 kilowatts.</p>
<p>The Silverado launch has been expected for weeks now, but Wednesday was the first time the company has provided more information, and even some teaser images, of other upcoming Chevy electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Chevrolet said it will expand its EV lineup in fall 2023 to include the Equinox EV, an affordable, functional compact SUV that will start at an estimated MSRP of around $30,000 in the United States. The company plans to launch the Equinox EV in fleet and retail versions, including LT and RS trims.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253996" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Chevrolet-Equinox-EV-001.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253996" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2253996 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Chevrolet-Equinox-EV-001.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1224" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Chevrolet-Equinox-EV-001.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Chevrolet-Equinox-EV-001.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Chevrolet-Equinox-EV-001.jpg?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Chevrolet-Equinox-EV-001.jpg?resize=768,470 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Chevrolet-Equinox-EV-001.jpg?resize=680,416 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Chevrolet-Equinox-EV-001.jpg?resize=1536,940 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Chevrolet-Equinox-EV-001.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253996" class="wp-caption-text">General Motors Chair and CEO Mary Barra confirmed during her 2022 CES keynote address that Chevrolet will launch the Chevrolet Equinox EV. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> GM</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Barra also confirmed that the Chevrolet Blazer is coming in 2023 (as a 2024 model) and said more details would come at a later this year. She did add that the Blazer would be &#8220;priced right and will offer a high level of refinement and options.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Equinox, Bla0zer and Silverado will join the two existing EVs — the Bolt and Bolt EUV — under the Chevy brand. All of these new EVs will be based on GM&#8217;s Ultium EV platform.</p>
<p>GM introduced in March 2020 its Ultium electric architecture that was designed to be the foundation of the automaker&#8217;s future EV plans and support a wide range of products across its brands, including compact cars, work trucks, large premium SUVs and performance vehicles. This modular architecture, called &#8220;Ultium,&#8221; is be capable of 19 different battery and drive unit configurations, 400-volt and 800-volt packs with storage ranging from 50 kWh to 200 kWh, and front-, rear- and all-wheel drive configurations.</p>
<p>At the heart of the new modular architecture are large-format pouch battery cells manufactured as part of a joint manufacturing venture between LG Chem and GM.</p>
<p>Chevrolet is not the only GM nameplate that is introducing EVs in the next two years. The company has started to deliver the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/first-drive-the-electrifying-gmc-hummer-ev/">GMC Hummer EV pickup truck</a> and is also introducing the Hummer EV SUV in 2023. An electric GMC Sierra is coming to market, likely in 2023 as well.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s luxury Cadillac brand is launching the Lyriq this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors just pulled the sheet off the Chevrolet Silverado EV. It has a range of 400 miles, up to 664 horsepower and a starting price of $39,900 for a basic work truck edition. The fully loaded, four-wheel steering RST First Edition costs $105,000. Both will hit production lines in 2023. Can&#8217;t wait? Get in line for the slightly more expensive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/first-drive-the-electrifying-gmc-hummer-ev/">GMC Hummer EV</a>; it&#8217;s nearly the same vehicle.</p>
<p>Today, General Motors CEO Mary Barra unveiled the vehicle at a CES 2022 virtual keynote address. Along with announcing Chevy&#8217;s answer to the Ford F-150 Lightning, the company also announced several other mass-market electric vehicles and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/gm-personal-autonomous-vehicles/">plans to sell personal autonomous vehicles by the middle of the decade</a>.</p>
<p>The Silverado EV is the third electric truck announced by General Motors, following the Hummer EV and the Sierra Denali. Little is known about the Denali &#8212; GM teased it just last month &#8212; but it appears the Silverado shares the majority of its parts with the impressive Hummer EV. Don&#8217;t mistake the Silverado EV as an afterthought. The Silverado EV is the most important of the bunch. The Chevy Silverado has long been the main competitor with the top-selling Ford F-150 pickup.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254002" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2254004" style="width: 5710px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254004" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2254004 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Silverado-EV-WT-045.jpg" alt="" width="5700" height="3800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Silverado-EV-WT-045.jpg 5700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Silverado-EV-WT-045.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Silverado-EV-WT-045.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Silverado-EV-WT-045.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Silverado-EV-WT-045.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Silverado-EV-WT-045.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Silverado-EV-WT-045.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2024-Silverado-EV-WT-045.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5700px) 100vw, 5700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254004" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GM</p></div></p>
<p>Two versions of the Silverado EV 2024 Silverado EV WT will be available at launch: the Work Truck (WT) edition for $39,900 and a fully spec&#8217;d RST First Edition for $105,000. Both come with an estimated range of 400 miles. Eventually, more trims will hit price points between $50,000 and $80,000.</p>
<p>The Silverado RST First Edition features a bevy of technology enhancements. It shares the same four-wheel steering and adaptable air-ride as the Hummer EV. A massive 17-inch LCD screen sits in the center, while the driver gets an 11-inch screen and a huge HUD. This edition also has Chevy&#8217;s Advanced Trailering System.</p>
<p>GM released less information about the $39,900 Work Truck edition. It will sport less power, with 510 HP and 615 lb-ft of torque instead of the 664 HP and 780 lb-ft of torque found in the RST model. In addition, it features a towing capacity of 8,000 pounds, down from 10,000 pounds. The interior is likely to be radically different, as well, and will feature a dashboard without the huge LCDs found in the $105,000 RST model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The RST edition also has a larger storage capacity thanks to a removable panel between the cab and the bed. It also has a larger center console and a fixed-glass roof.</p>
<p>Both the WT and RST edition feature public DC fast charging capabilities (350 kW), gaining 100 miles of range in 10 minutes. Like the Ford Lightning, the Silverado EV can act as a 110v generator, but the Chevy has a maximum output of 10.2 kW, up from Ford&#8217;s 9.6 kW.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s history between Chevy and Ford. The two automakers have long chased each other&#8217;s developments, and Ford beat Chevy by months when it announced the Ford F-150 Lightning in May 2021. Since then, Ford was overwhelmed with reservations and announced earlier this week it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/ford-double-production-lightning-pickup/">doubling production</a> to hit 150,000 vehicles a year by mid-2023.</p>
<p>General Motors said today it intends to start producing the $39,900 Chevy Silverado Work Truck in spring 2023. In addition, the RST First Edition is slated for production starting in fall 2023. Eventually, Chevy expects to bring more trim levels to marketing, including an off-road themed Trail Boss edition, which was previewed today.</p>
<p>The Ford F-150 Lightning and Chevrolet Silverado EV are fundamentally different vehicles for the first time. The two automakers took different approaches. The Ford F-150 Lightning is built on a traditional body-on-frame platform. This is the same arrangement that&#8217;s used in today&#8217;s Ford F-150, Chevy Silverado and the rest of the pickup market. General Motors instead opted for a unibody affair that merges the body and frame into one piece. This is the same construction used on the Tesla Cybertruck too. This arrangement often results in a more rigid structure, but often at the expense of towing and cargo capacities.</p>
<p>The electric truck market is quickly expanding, and the Silverado is scheduled to hit the market later than some competitors. Production is underway for the Silverado&#8217;s cousin, the Hummer EV, and some customers are taking delivery of their pickups. The same is happening at Rivian, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/rivian/">with the startup spinning up its first pickup</a>, the R1T. Some customers received their pre-ordered truck in December 2021.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybertruck/">Tesla Cybertruck</a> is a large unknown looming on the horizon. Elon Musk announced the wild pickup in November 2019, and has yet to reveal many other details. The estimated production timeline was removed from Tesla&#8217;s website. The market largely agrees the Cybertruck is still in the works, but the timing is unknown.</p>
<p>General Motors&#8217; EV approach is opening up. The company started with the Chevy Volt back during the dark days of the 2008 auto bailout. Next, it produced its first mass-market EV in the Chevy Bolt in 2017. Then, on March 4, 2020, in the weeks before COVID, General Motors&#8217; CEO Mary Barra announced Ultium, its next-generation EV platform. Since then, despite a chip shortage and global pandemic, the company announced the Hummer EV, GMC Sierra Denali, the Cadillac Lyriq, Chevrolet Silverado, Chevrolet Blazer EV and the Chevrolet Equinox.</p>

		Justin Beals is the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.strikegraph.com/">Strike Graph</a>, a SaaS solution that simplifies security compliance such as SOC 2 Type I/II, HIPAA and ISO 27000 Series to achieve trust and move deals.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a former CTO, I know that integrations are required to deliver data-driven products online. I’ve designed transactional data systems that integrated with global telecom networks, applicant tracking systems and cloud-based infrastructures. Powerful integrations are not hard to conceive. It’s easy to identify data you would like to share between two different systems.</p>
<p>An integration, however, is beset by the same suite of pitfalls that any product feature or technological innovation may require, with one big wrinkle: At least half of the requirements were never designed with you, your use case or your organizational goals in mind.</p>
<p>The complex relationship of your vendors, technology and your overall business makes integrations a hard problem. It also makes potential solutions very brittle. If the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve is a SOC 2 audit or ISO 27001 certification to drive sales, an integration will not make passing your audit quicker. In reality, it will make it harder to achieve.</p>
<h2>The problem you’re trying to solve</h2>
<p>Before widely published security standards like SOC 2 or ISO 27001, much of security work was siloed into specific business functions like board management, HR or infotech. Each group designed best practices according to the expertise of their leaders. Few buyers ever asked questions.</p>
<p>Having a published standard with a validated testing or audit methodology provides an important new signal in your entire organization&#8217;s maturity. Buyers can point at specific credentials and require companies to accomplish an independent assessment to be certified. As the number and variety of vendors have grown, buyers have increasingly identified efficient tools to analyze your security stance.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The best time to implement an integration is when you&#8217;re sure it’s useful. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>If the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve is trust via certification, does a technical integration accelerate compliance?</p>
<h2>Integrations inhibit compliance and increase risk</h2>
<p>There are zero integration requirements for SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA or even CMMC, and there is no published security standard that requires an integration to achieve compliance. Even common standards such as PCI-DSS, GDPR or CCPA can be achieved without integrations, deployed agents or enterprise technology.</p>
<p>This is because all security standards are designed to not require any specific technology, personnel or processes. The authors of standards such as ISO 27001 recognize that each company is increasingly unique. For example, companies that offer an on-prem or private cloud deployment model are likely not required to comply with the monitoring portion of the SOC 2 Security standard during audit. Services organizations that develop intellectual property, such as software for their customers, are likely not required to comply with the change management portions of ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Security.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Matter is designed to finally fix the issues around fragmented smart home systems so that all of your devices can be easily set up and routed from one place.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies unveil their new smart home devices at the 2022 CES tech show, underway now in Las Vegas, much of the hype involves <a href="https://buildwithmatter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matter</a>, an open source connectivity standard built around a shared belief that smart home devices should seamlessly integrate with other systems and be secure and reliable.</p>
<p>If you like devices, you are probably among the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/deloitte-pandemic-stress-tested-digital-home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">66% of households that have smart home devices</a>, according to Deloitte. We also know you don’t just stick with one company or brand, but probably have purchased from at least half a dozen different companies. That’s why for any company launching a smart home device this year, having Matter support will be helpful.</p>
<p>Not only is the protocol being developed by some of the biggest tech companies — think Apple, Amazon and Google — and smart home device makers, it is designed to finally fix the issues around fragmented smart home systems so that all of your devices can be easily set up and routed from one place.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253977" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Matter, via a local controller device, is essentially the infrastructure, the pipeline and the language that will enable all of the devices to communicate. Its Internet Protocol will ​​define a specific set of IP-based networking technologies for device certification so that manufacturers can build devices that are compatible with your Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. Matter’s first protocol will run on Wi-Fi and Thread network layers and will utilize Bluetooth Low Energy for commissioning.</p>
<p>The Connectivity Standards Alliance, formerly the Zigbee Alliance, which is organizing the testing for the first Matter-certified devices, identified over two dozen companies that were exhibiting or showcasing Matter at their booths, meeting rooms or virtually at CES this year. They include NXP, Qualcomm, Samsung SmartThings, Telink, Texas Instruments and Universal Electronics.</p>
<p>In May, Google said it was <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/four-google-smart-home-updates-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bringing Matter to Android and Nest</a>, and today announced that in a few months, you will be able to use its Android “Fast Pair” feature to quickly <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/ces2022-bettertogether/?_ga=2.195738469.895121817.1641405935-38337487.1641405935" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connect new Matter-enabled smart home devices</a> to your home network, Google Home and other apps with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>And earlier today, <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/a-snapshot-of-our-ces-news%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon said</a> its “frustration-free setup” documentation was now available for device makers to review, and it is working with a host of companies on both set-up experience and <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2022/01/ces-amazon-announces-new-matter-support-device-makers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexa capabilities</a>, including adding that device as a second administrator for Matter devices so you can still control them even if your internet connection is down.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It is also collaborating with silicon vendors on what will become a Matter System-on-a-Chip to support the frustration-free setup. All of this comes after last year’s <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> that most Echo devices would support Matter and that 4th-gen Echo and eero devices will become Matter Thread border routers.</p>
<p>In addition, here are some other companies that announced new devices or services that support Matter:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Comcast mentioned it while launching its new <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220103005265/en/Comcast-Launches-New-WiFi-6E-Gateway-%E2%80%93-Its-Most-Powerful-WiFi-Device-to-Date" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xFi Advanced Gateway Router</a> equipped with features like “IoT for Smart Homes of the Future” that was Zigbee and Matter compatible to act as a central connector for IoT and home automation devices like smart lights, plugs and locks.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Eve Systems, which produces connected home products, created <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us/news/eve-and-coulisse-eve-motionblinds-availability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eve MotionBlinds</a>, touting it as “the first connected blinds and shades motors in the market to support Thread.”</li>
<li aria-level="1">Home security brand Arlo Technologies unveiled its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arlo-clinches-2022-ces-innovation-award-for-fourth-consecutive-year-with-unveil-of-all-new-arlo-security-system-301452565.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arlo Security System</a>, a set of sensors with eight different functions, that correspond with a security hub and integrated keypad for small businesses and consumers that want more of a do-it-yourself security monitoring solution. The company also stated its commitment to Matter as a way of solidifying its stance on broad-range compatibility in the smart home space.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Edge computing company Veea unveiled its Smart-home-as-a-Service offering, which will include support for Matter, Thread and Wi-Fi 6. The offering includes the Veea SmartHub mesh router for the home called STAX.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Among Belkin’s several Matter-enabled product announcements at CES for the home are its new <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wemo-introduces-smart-video-doorbell-030000986.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wemo video doorbell</a> that works with Apple’s HomeKit, and the Wemo Smart Plug, Smart Light Switch and Smart Dimmer that will work with Matter over Thread.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Mui Lab debuted its Matter-ready “<a href="https://muilab.com/en/journal/mui-lab-to-debut-matter-ready-platform-that-turns-any-smart-devices-into-calmer-ones-at-ces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">muiPlatform</a>” that turns smart devices into “calmer ones,” which includes a board that turns Amazon’s Alexa into a more visual interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>One device Michelle Mindala-Freeman, vice president of marketing for the Connectivity Standards Alliance, is watching is Schlage’s announcement made Tuesday introducing it new <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ces-2022-introducing-schlage-encode-plus-smart-wifi-deadbolt--a-trusted-solution-for-apples-new-home-keys-experience-301453042.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smart Wi-Fi deadbolt</a>, which will be among the first to support Apple&#8217;s latest enhancement to its HomeKit experience with home keys capability.</p>
<p>She says <a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/news_and_articles/creating-certainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 will be a big year for Matter</a>. There are hundreds of companies involved in both CSA and Matter, and 50 companies have brought through 134 products already, Mindala-Freeman told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It is expected that CSA will have the certification, specifications, testing tools and SDK released by the middle of the year. This will enable companies to be faster to market with new hardware and innovations and reach a broader consumer audience.</p>
<p>“At a fundamental level, our job at CSA is to eliminate fragmentation and help companies to grow and do it in a way that is highly valuable to consumers,” Mindala-Freeman said. “Standards like Matter do that, and we believe it is a rising tide that raises all boats.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There was market expectation, perhaps, that the tech part of the tech startups building insurance products would have a faster and larger impact on their bottom lines.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There was a period of time when insurtech startups actually selling their own insurance products were hot tickets in the private and public markets. Things have changed.</p>
<p>The venture-backed insurtech rollout to the public markets was lengthy. Lemonade, which sells rental insurance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/high-flying-ipos-for-lemonade-and-accolade-may-encourage-other-unicorns-to-go-public/">went public in early July  2020</a>. Root, which focuses on auto insurance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/3-lessons-from-roots-ipo-pricing/">went out in October of the same year</a>. Metromile, also in auto insurance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/how-will-investors-value-metromile-and-oscar-health/">went public via a SPAC in February 2021</a>. And, finally, Hippo, focused on home coverage, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/why-have-the-markets-spurned-public-neoinsurance-startups/">went public via a blank check company</a> in August of last year.</p>
<p>It was quite the run of liquidity for companies that racked up impressive venture backing in their early days.</p>
<p>Since those debuts, however, the public markets have not proved kind. Metromile <a href="https://ir.metromile.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lemonade-acquire-metromile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it would sell itself to Lemonade after losing nearly all of its value; today, Metromile is worth around $2 per share, down from a 52-week high of just over $20 per share.</p>
<p>Its peers also struggled. Lemonade has seen its value erode from just over $188 per share to $38.68 as of the time of writing. Root is worth $3.16 per share, down from a 52-week high of $25.63. Hippo is down to $2.62 per share from $15 per share at its peak. We&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/what-happens-when-wall-street-falls-out-of-love-with-your-sector/">covered the carnage over the last few quarters</a>.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s Oscar Health, a consumer health coverage company that had one hell of an IPO. Our take on its pricing was a bit rude, as you might recall:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volvo Cars is working with lidar company Luminar and its autonomous driving (AD) software subsidiary Zenseact to introduce an AD feature to its next generation of fully electric cars, the automaker said on Wednesday at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">CES</a>. The company aims to first introduce the feature, named &#8220;Ride Pilot,&#8221; as an add-on subscription to an electric SUV that will be revealed later this year.</p>
<p>Ride Pilot is what Volvo is calling an &#8220;unsupervised&#8221; AD feature – meaning the car will be able to drive itself, giving passengers plenty of time to enjoy &#8220;secondary activities like reading, writing, working or socializing,&#8221; according to Volvo. Luminar and Zenseact, in which Volvo owns a majority stake, have been working on building these capabilities since at least March 2021, when the two companies shared plans to combine tech and create a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/luminar-volvo-subsidiary-partner-to-sell-automated-driving-systems-to-automakers/">&#8220;holistic autonomous vehicle stack&#8221;</a> that could be offered to other automakers. Nvidia&#8217;s system-on-a-chip will power Volvo&#8217;s core compute system.</p>
<p>Volvo is the latest automaker to create a strategy around getting commercial passenger vehicles with autonomous capabilities to market. Tesla has pushed out its misleadingly named &#8220;Autopilot&#8221; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/tesla-will-open-controversial-fsd-beta-software-to-owners-with-a-good-driving-record/">&#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; software</a>, which rely solely on cameras and computer vision tech to provide advanced driver assistance features that can handle tasks like autosteering within a clearly marked lane, traffic-aware cruise control, auto lane change, auto park, summon and traffic and stop sign control. Chinese automaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/top-highlights-from-xpengs-2021-tech-day/">Xpeng is also rolling out its next generation of ADAS called &#8220;Xpilot,&#8221;</a> which relies on lidar, radar and cameras to provide automated navigation assisted driving from point to point based on the route set by the driver.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252858" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The key thing here with Ride Pilot is that it&#8217;s actually self driving,&#8221; Martin Kristensson, Volvo&#8217;s VP of digital business, told TechCrunch. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to keep your hands on the steering wheel. You don&#8217;t have to look at the road ahead. You can actually eat your breakfast in the car or read a book or watch a movie and the car will drive itself. We will take liability when the car is driving itself. So I think that in that sense, it is an offer that doesn&#8217;t exist in the market today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Ride Pilot goes to market, the software will undergo rigorous verification and testing protocol, which includes validating the technology for safe use on highways in a number of conditions, Volvo says. Initially, Ride Pilot will be available on a limited operational design domain. Specifically, it will only operate on highways that Volvo has validated and at lower speeds.</p>
<p>Customers in California will be the first to experience Ride Pilot before a gradual rollout to other markets, which makes sense given the state&#8217;s favorable regulatory environment to autonomous testing, sunny weather and accumulation of highways packed with cars. <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/l-a-commuters-spend-an-average-of-119-hours-a-year-stuck-in-traffic-most-in-u-s-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles commuters apparently spend an average of 119 hours per year stuck in traffic</a>, time Volvo thinks can be better spent.</p>
<p>Volvo will still need to secure permits for testing its vehicles on public roads in California, but Kristensson says the company is &#8220;in dialogue with relevant regulatory bodies, including the California DMV, to secure all necessary approvals.&#8221; So far, the company is only testing Ride Pilot in Sweden with Zenseact, but it expects to receive the necessary permits to begin testing on public roads in California by the middle of the year. The regulation Volvo will need to actually implement this tech on a commercial scale is not yet mature enough for what the industry is offering. For example, California currently has laws to prohibit drivers from using their phones while driving, which might be a snag in Volvo&#8217;s plans to entice drivers to subscribe to Ride Pilot so they can scroll through Twitter or respond to emails while the car drives itself.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles did not respond to TechCrunch&#8217;s request for information in time.</p>
<p>Volvo did not share how much the Ride Pilot subscription would cost, nor how much the SUV might sell for, but Kristensson did say the car would be around the same price of the 2022<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/11/how-volvo-plans-to-maintain-its-safety-rep-while-staying-in-the-fast-lane/"> Volvo XC90</a>, which has a starting price of around $50,000. Whether or not customers choose to add on the software, their vehicles will be built with all of the sensors needed to make AD and ADAS capabilities happen. Chief among those sensors is Luminar&#8217;s Iris lidar sensor, which is more seamlessly integrated into the roofline of the vehicle rather than attached to the rooftop like a glowing jewel. In addition, the new SUV will come with five radars, eight cameras and 16 ultrasonic sensors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Volvo decided to standardize the hardware meaning that all the vehicles, whether people are subscribing to Ride Pilot or not, will have the hardware that&#8217;s possible to launch this software, and also possible to collect the data that we need to monitor and make sure we&#8217;re safe and able to launch,&#8221; Zenseact CEO Ödgärd Andersson told TechCrunch. &#8220;So every car will have a basic level of safety, which is like helping you do emergency braking or steering, and that&#8217;s standard. Now with this new level of technology and the lidar to actually take it to a whole new level, on top of that there&#8217;s the cruise functionality to assist while you&#8217;re driving that&#8217;s taken to a new level because we have better sensing and compute.&#8221;</p>
<p>As with Tesla&#8217;s FSD, the software itself and updates can be sent over-the-air to both users in new markets as well as existing users in order to continuously ensure redundancy.</p>
<p>Volvo hasn&#8217;t yet shared details about the design of its upcoming electric SUV, but Kristensson said its concept EV revealed in July called<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/volvo-cars-sets-the-tone-for-its-next-gen-vehicles-with-concept-recharge-ev/"> &#8220;Concept Recharge,&#8221;</a> which looks a bit like a crossover with a flat floor, a glass ceiling and rear suicide doors, is &#8220;a good indication of what the actual car will look like.&#8221; Volvo is partnering with companies like Northvolt, which makes EV batteries, Google and Luminar to build out this EV, as well as future vehicles.</p>
<p>During CES, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/qualcomm-ces-auto-snapdragon-digital-chassis/">the automaker also shared plans to implement Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon digital cockpit</a> infotainment center into the new electric SUV. Volvo also announced on Wednesday more details of its partnership with Google, like an integration with Google Assistant-enabled devices that will allow users to do things like ask Google to warm up their car, as well as enabling YouTube to be downloaded to the vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see that drivers will spend more time in the car not driving, while electrical cars are charging and you&#8217;re waiting for it to charge, or maybe in a situation with an autonomous vehicle where you&#8217;re riding and relaxing rather than driving, so we want to enable more digital services in the car,&#8221; said Kristensson.</p>
<p>The suite of digital services that Volvo is building through strategic partnerships give Volvo a chance to build out its subscription model and learn how customers want to interface with these new products.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will see a lot of services and experiences coming through to our consumers in the next year that they can actually subscribe to rather than buy it upfront,&#8221; Anne-Mette Nygaard, head of digital consumer products, told TechCrunch. &#8220;So more flexible ownership and more transparency directly with our consumers is the way to go.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is working with the likes of Intel, Acer and HP to make easier connecting your phone to your Windows PC through Fast Pair, share files between Android devices and Windows PCs with Nearby Share, set up Bluetooth accessories and sync text messages between the two computing ecosystems.</p>
<p>These new capabilities will come to select Windows PCs later this year and are part of what Google calls its effort to &#8220;invest in more helpful ways for your devices to work better together.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252412" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8.-HP-Windows-PC.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252412" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2252412" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8.-HP-Windows-PC.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2252412" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252411" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Over the course of the last few years, Google and Microsoft have both launched a number of initiatives that brought Android devices and Windows PCs closer together. That includes Microsoft&#8217;s work on its own Android launchers for its Surface phones, but more importantly, apps like Microsoft&#8217;s My Phone on Windows, which lets you make calls and send text messages from your PC, or the Android subsystem for Windows that lets you run Android apps on Windows 11, though that&#8217;s a cooperation with Amazon, not Google.  </span></p>
<p>In the case of the new features the company announced today, Google doesn&#8217;t like Microsoft as one of its partners either, so we&#8217;re mostly talking about some pre-installed software on new PCs from a small set of manufacturers here, not a new Windows 10 or 11 feature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google unveiled at CES on Wednesday a range of new ways to keep its Android devices connected, and that includes cars. As more vehicles go electric and automakers evolve into software developers, we can only expect to see more plays directed at turning cars into connected devices.</p>
<p>One exemplar of this phenomenon is Volvo Cars, which will launch a direct integration with the Google Home ecosystem in the coming months, both Volvo and Google announced on Wednesday. The integration should allow car owners to turn their car on and off, control the temperature and get car information like battery life by issuing voice commands to Google Assistant-enabled home and mobile devices. Once customers pair their Volvo car to their Google account, they also can talk directly to Google while in their car.</p>
<p>This feature will be available in the United States and in European markets, like Sweden, Norway, Germany, Italy, France and Spain, with others soon to follow, according to Google.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253576" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition, because newer Volvo car models have Google built-in, they will soon be able to serve as a platform on which to download YouTube, thus enabling video streaming in cars, according to the automaker. YouTube will be available via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/qualcomm-ces-auto-snapdragon-digital-chassis/">Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon digital cockpit infotainment system,</a> which Volvo announced would be implemented into its upcoming electric SUV. The partnership with Google is part of a larger move by Volvo to facilitate more digital services and keep passengers entertained, particularly as it prepares to introduce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/volvo-partners-with-luminar-and-zenseact-to-bring-autonomous-driving-feature-to-new-e-suv/">Ride Pilot, its new &#8220;unsupervised&#8221; autonomous driving feature</a> that is expected to fully self-drive Volvo&#8217;s upcoming electric SUV on highways to start, allowing drivers to be completely hands-free for whatever other activities they&#8217;d rather be doing than holding onto a steering wheel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allowing our customers to watch videos while charging or when waiting to pick up their children from school is part of our promise to make their lives better and more enjoyable,&#8221; said Henrik Green, chief product officer at Volvo Cars, in a statement. &#8220;With YouTube and other major streaming services coming soon, our customers can enjoy their charging break instead of seeing it as just a hassle &#8212; making electric car ownership that bit easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google isn&#8217;t stopping with Volvo. In December, <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-features-december-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the tech giant unveiled its digital car key</a>, which enables users to lock, unlock and even start compatible BMW cars from 2020, 2021 and 2022 through select Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones. On Wednesday, Google said users later this year will be able to utilize the ultra-wideband digital car key to both unlock their vehicle without taking their phone out of their pocket, as well as share the key with others. The feature will be available in multiple markets across Europe, Asia, North America and parts of Africa, as well as Russia, New Zealand and Australia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year’s CES is likely to be fairly light from Google on the hardware front, but the company’s got a number of new software features to announce. Chief among them are some key updates to its Fast Pair offering, which has thus far largely been the domain of earbud pairing. A handful of new additions look to position the feature as a kind of unifying platform between Google devices and even operating systems.</p>
<p>“We’re continuing our work with partners to further extend Fast Pair’s functionality beyond audio connectivity with wearables, headphones, speakers and cars and extending it to TVs and smart home devices, so you can instantly start using all the devices in your life,” the company writes in a blog post.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252775" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252775" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2252775" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.-Quick-setup-Chrome-OS-to-Android.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252775" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252767" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The additions come as Google moves to more broadly adopt the Matter standard, designed to offer a kind of unifying platform for connected smart home devices. First up is increased functionality for Chromebooks, bringing instant headphone pairing to ChromeOS. That feature is set to arrive in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Later this year, meanwhile, owners of new Chromebooks will be able to instantly set up their devices using an Android handset, instantly porting over things like Google logins and Wi-Fi passwords. In addition to the existing ability to unlock Chromebooks via an Android device, Google will be adding the ability to do so with Wear OS as it continues to look toward building a competitive wearable operating system.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252776" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252776" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2252776" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3.-Wear-OS-unlock-Android.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252776" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Fast Pair will also sync headphones with Google TV and Android TV OS devices in the coming months, while Android’s Matter support will help quickly get smart home device up and running. Auto switching is coming to Google’s headphones as well, letting users switch connections between Android devices. That’s also arriving at some point in the coming months, along with spatial audio functionality, as Google looks to compete more directly with Apple’s headphone offerings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google is also partnering with third-party manufacturers to build Chromecast functionality into hardware, starting with Bose’s soundbars and smart speakers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is making good on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/instagram-head-adam-mosseri-says-the-app-will-offer-a-chronological-feed-option-early-next-year/">promise it made</a> last month to bring back the chronological feed.</p>
<p>In a tweet Wednesday, Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced that the platform is rolling out some big changes to the way the core feed experience works, letting users choose between three different feeds. Two new options, Favorites and Following, sort content chronologically, while a third &#8220;home&#8221; option offers the algorithmically sorted feed we have now.</p>
<p>Mosseri says that the non-chronological home feed will feature &#8220;more and more recommendations over time,&#8221; functioning more as a discovery hub than a way to keep up on content from people you already follow. Favorites will finally let anyone who uses the app easily keep up to date on all updates from a small cluster of friends and family, though users can still find posts from everyone else they follow in the Following view.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253875" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The changes are &#8220;already out or going out over the next few weeks&#8221; according to Mosseri, and the company plans to roll out a finalized version of the chronological feed options in the first half of 2022. Unlike many limited tests that Facebook and Instagram experiment with regularly, expect to see these changes broadly implemented into the app&#8217;s experience.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>We’re starting to test the ability to switch between three different views on your home screen (two of which would give you the option to see posts in chronological order):<br />&#8211; Home<br />&#8211; Favorites<br />&#8211; Following</p>
<p>We hope to launch these soon. More to come. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/270c-1f3fc.png" alt="✌🏼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/9zvB85aPSp">pic.twitter.com/9zvB85aPSp</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Adam Mosseri (@mosseri) <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1478767105444966401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Instagram users enjoyed a chronological feed for years, but the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/15/filteredgram/">switched to an algorithmic feed back in 2016</a> after years of foreshadowing from parent company Facebook (now Meta) that the app would be its next advertising cash cow. With an algorithmic feed, Instagram was able to aggressively intersperse the ads that still dominate there, moving the app away from its origins as a chronological photo sharing space.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2022 and the company isn&#8217;t re-introducing chronological feeds just to keep its users happy — if that was the case, they would have immediately reverted the changes back in 2016 in light of the public backlash. Instagram&#8217;s decision to bring back chronological feeds is a win for anyone who uses the app, but it&#8217;s also another example of how Meta generally only implements common sense changes to make its apps safer or better for users only when under duress, whether from bad press or looming regulation.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in the U.S. are focusing on the dangers of social media algorithms and some proposed legislation would force platforms to give users more choice or provide deeper transparency into how those algorithms rank content.</p>
<p>One bill, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/section-230-bills-algorithms-congress-hearing/">Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act</a> would suspend Section 230 liability protections from companies like Instagram when they use algorithms that &#8220;amplify misinformation that leads to offline violence.&#8221; Another bill, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/bipartisan-bill-seeks-to-curb-recommendation-algorithms/">Filter Bubble Transparency Act</a> would require platforms to add a toggle that lets users disable algorithmic recommendations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe in more transparency and accountability and we believe in more control,&#8221; Mosseri said during his first ever testimony before Congress last month. &#8220;That’s why we’re currently working on a version of a chronological feed that we hope to launch next year.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s always fun tech for pet owners at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">CES</a>, and 2022 is no different. But a handful of gadgets this year are taking care to treat dogs and cats not just as beloved furry friends but as intelligent animals with their own processes, emotions and even a desire to express themselves.</p>
<p>At the most basic level — which is to say, pretty advanced compared with a few years ago — we have <strong><a href="https://rabo.cat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catlog</a></strong>, a smart cat collar and weight-sensing platform that helps owners keep track of their feline&#8217;s daily movements.</p>
<p>The collar senses movement and vibrations, which it correlates with &#8220;cat-like behavior&#8221; like sleeping, sitting there, washing its paws, eating and drinking — even moving around, which some cats have been known to do. All these actions (including hairballs) gets sent to you through an IoT hub nearly live. And you can look back over your cat&#8217;s day to see when and how often they&#8217;ve played, slept and so on.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253251" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This basic aspect of illuminating a pet&#8217;s daily life when you&#8217;re not around is a good first step to understanding that they are more than a lap accessory — they exist and do things even when you&#8217;re not looking.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ksne8tpBsvE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Invoxia</strong> takes things a little further with its smart collar that tracks your dog&#8217;s location but also its heart and respiratory condition. Now, I can&#8217;t vouch for the efficacy of this, but given the advances we&#8217;ve made in smart watches and other devices that can detect adverse events or conditions in humans, it doesn&#8217;t seem implausible at all that something similar could be whipped up for dogs.</p>
<p>Animals have heart and lung issues just like any other animal with those organs, and sadly some breeds are predisposed to them as well. Sure, you can take them to the vet twice a year so she can listen to the dog&#8217;s breathing, but why not also have a collar that alerts you if something seems off? Just like with ourselves, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>

<p>Beyond just detecting physiological signs we find <strong><a href="https://www.inupathy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inupathy</a></strong>, a dog-worn backpack that the company claims can detect a variety of psychological conditions as well. Now, let us not give too much credit here, as human-focused devices along these lines have had very mixed results as well. But Langualess, which makes the backpack, <a href="https://langualess.com/#tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explains their work as follows</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An animal&#8217;s heart normally beats at a gentle rhythm, but accelerates when the animal starts feeling nervous. This change in the rhythm is triggered by the sympathetic nervous activity. Through our independent research, we have found that it is possible to estimate the dogs’ mental state in more detail by analysing the heart rate variability in depth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Heart rate analysis is of course a field with a long and rich history, and one with as many hits as misses. But it is not unreasonable to think that you can tell whether a dog is relaxed, temporarily excited, or entering a prolonged angry or anxious state. The company&#8217;s main tech advance has been to create a local sensor and circuit that reliably detects and characterizes the animal&#8217;s heart rate.</p>
<p>There are of course more external tells, like tail position, stance and vocalizations, but not every dog is so emotive and anyway, why not add a little more data to the mix?</p>
<p>A propos additional data, Taiwan&#8217;s largest applied research institution ITRI showed off its neat <strong>iPetWeaR</strong> concept, which goes deep on data-driven early warning signals for doggie heart attack prevention. The low-power physiological detection radar technology is harmless &#8211; it does not require skin contact with the pet &#8211; and can be attached to a pet&#8217;s collar or stuffed into a doggie bed for flexible sensing.</p>
<p>The basic US$80 product package includes a sensor device, a collar selected from various options, and a mobile app &#8211; and works for both cats and dogs. The company put together an adorable demo video, which of course an excellent reason for us to include it in our roundup:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GUHGec_9sCI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The physiological data collected by the iPetWear is scooped up and beamed to the pet owner&#8217;s phone by Bluetooth. In the case of irregular heartbeat or breathing, a notification is sent so the owner can intervene &#8211; and the product promises early detection of a pet’s underlying health condition.</p>
<p><a href="https://wagz.com/"><strong>Wagz</strong></a> has been around for a hot minute, and its Freedom Collar introduced virtual geofences so you can ensure your four-legged friends stays put. With GPS tracking, fitness mapping and &#8216;humane&#8217; corrections (as opposed to a shock collar), the collar has become a popular solution for training pups. New for CES 2022, though, is the addition of Wagz Tags. The idea is letting the dog roam free around the house, but creating small zones where the pup isn&#8217;t allowed. When the collar gets too close to a Wagz Tag, it triggers the geofencing. A great &#8211; and super clever &#8211; way of keeping Fido off the furniture.</p>
<p>The Wagz Tagz let you create customizable Keep Out Zones from 3 ft to 15 ft to keep your pet safe and away from areas you want to protect.</p>

<p>While we&#8217;re at it, why not let the dog straight-up talk to you? <a href="https://fluent.pet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That&#8217;s the idea with <strong>FluentPet</strong></a>, which makes a set of buttons for teaching your dog to express itself using human vocabulary. Kind of.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253371" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253371" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253371" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg" alt="A dog's paws press buttons that emit words." width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253371" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> FluentPet</p></div></p>
<p>Clearly inspired by the social media stardom of button-expressing canines <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hunger4words/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stella</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/whataboutbunny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bunny</a>, whose seemingly coherent utterances suggest a richer than expected intellectual landscape, the FluentPet buttons are an easy way to see if your dog is similarly gifted. (Let&#8217;s be honest — all dogs are good, but not all of them can reliably form sentences.)</p>
<p>The various kits contain self-contained and labeled buttons that, when pressed, produce a word like &#8220;outside,&#8221; &#8220;food&#8221; or of course &#8220;love you.&#8221; These stick into larger, easily identifiable foam mats (hopefully they don&#8217;t taste good) to aid learning by sight.</p>
<p>Does the dog really know what it means when it says &#8220;love you&#8221;? Perhaps, perhaps not — the love is not in doubt, but it may understand that when it presses that one, it gets pets. Likewise, the food button tends to speed up dinner. And pressing &#8220;outside&#8221; works faster than staring wistfully at the door. You may not be carrying on full conversations with the dog, but it could be a fun way to change up the way your best friend expresses themselves — because they certainly do that, and sometimes in regrettable ways.</p>
