										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In between A/B testing, customizing targeted ads and formatting for different digital platforms, some design teams are tasked with campaigns that include thousands of images, videos and other visual content. Based in Bangalore, <a href="https://rocketium.com/">Rocketium</a> automates much of the process, allowing teams to scale-up campaigns while reducing their workload. The company announced it has raised $3.2 million led by Emergent Ventures to launch in the United States and expand in other markets.</p>
<p>Rocketium’s clients include Urban Company, CasaOne, BigBasket, cure.fit and Meesho. It says visuals made on its platform are seen by 100 million end users. Its latest funding brings Rocketium’s total raised so far to $4.2 million, including a $1 million seed round from Blume Ventures and 1Crowd.</p>
<p>Rocketium’s platform is currently invite-only and it plans to open self-service usage and purchases in 2022, along with more integrations with e-commerce and advertising platforms (its current integrations include Salesforce, Mailchimp, YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia and Hubspot).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To use Rocketium, design teams create a core set of templates in Photoshop or After Effects and import them to the platform. Then Rocketium customizes ads for different scenarios. For example, if a retailer is running a targeted campaign with free shipping in certain areas, they enter that information into a spreadsheet and Rocketium automatically updates the text in the templates. Then ads and videos are formatted for different platforms, like banners for web advertising or square format for Instagram.</p>

<p>One of Rocketium’s clients, fitness app cure.fit, uses it to<a href="https://rocketium.com/is/success-stories/cure-fit/"> run about five to six campaigns each month for different membership plans</a>. The platform enables cure.fit to reduce the production time for visual content and personalize campaigns based on users’ interests, demographics and locations.</p>

<p>Rocketium also includes tools for A/B testing, ad targeting and data analytics.</p>
<p>Other companies that help marketing teams create visual advertising campaigns include Canva, InVideo and Lumen5. Co-founder and chief executive officer Satej Sirur told TechCrunch that Rocketium was designed specifically for clients that need to create hundreds or thousands of ads, video and other creative content a month, and can be used to create up to 10,000 visuals at a time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) contribute heavily to the economic success of many countries, particularly those in the developing world. They are the backbone of most economies: Globally, SMEs represent about 90% of existing businesses and create more than 50% of employment.</p>
<p>In South Africa, these businesses contribute around one-third of the country&#8217;s GDP. Last year, the coronavirus pandemic threatened the existence of some of these SMEs, and its effects linger as owners worry about revenue, sales and cash flow.</p>
<p>Since launching in 2013, South African fintech <a href="https://www.yoco.com/za/">Yoco</a> has positioned itself as the go-to platform to access offline payments among merchants in the country. Today, the company is announcing $83 million in Series C funding to scale offline and online offerings and expand to new markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite South Africa&#8217;s high card and mobile penetration rates of over 70%, the country&#8217;s SMEs still struggle to accept cards. Yoco&#8217;s portable card machines have proved masterful in solving this problem; when TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/south-africas-yoco-raises-16-million-to-boost-digital-services-to-small-businesses/">covered the company</a> three years ago after its $16 million Series B raise, it had little over 30,000 merchants using its platform. Now, that number has quintupled.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="91jQ7tIvT6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/south-africas-yoco-raises-16-million-to-boost-digital-services-to-small-businesses/">South Africa’s Yoco raises $16 million to boost digital services to small businesses</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;South Africa’s Yoco raises $16 million to boost digital services to small businesses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/south-africas-yoco-raises-16-million-to-boost-digital-services-to-small-businesses/embed/#?secret=91jQ7tIvT6" data-secret="91jQ7tIvT6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As Yoco grew exponentially in providing offline payments, it built an online offering. After being in beta for a while, the rollout came right on time some days into South Africa&#8217;s lockdown in March last year. This way, South African merchants could continue accepting payments on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to offer whatever payment methods our merchants need. And we did start in the in-person payment space, focusing on terminals, which was where the biggest demand was,&#8221; chief business officer <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/carlwazen">Carl Wazen</a> said. &#8220;But the pandemic, which had a devastating effect on so many businesses that relied on in-person trade, accelerated the need for businesses to accept payments online.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the height of the lockdowns in South Africa, sentiment across SMEs owners on a scale of -100 to 100 dropped to an all-time low of -12 in Q2 2020, according to Yoco&#8217;s small business pulse monitor. It has since improved following the easing of the lockdowns, allowing businesses to move more freely and continue in-person payments. As a result, Yoco&#8217;s online payments account for a minute part of the transactions made on the platform.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not to say people are transacting with cash. In fact, it&#8217;s the opposite, according to Wazen. Wazen says one post-pandemic behavior he noticed was that once the lockdown was lifted, people came back to make in-person payments in an accelerated way because they stopped using cash. “Recent consumer behavior shows a shift away from cash, and businesses have to rapidly adapt to this change. This presents a huge opportunity, and it is our mission to support that transition,” he added.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, chief executive <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/katlegomaphai">Katlego Maphai</a> said Yoco was looking to expand its services into other aspects of digital payments. He listed mobile money, QR payments and electronic funds transfer (ETF) as offerings in its pipeline. Wazen corroborated this, but didn&#8217;t provide an update about where the company is with these offerings. He did mention, however, that the company is still very much a card-focused payment provider.</p>
<p>Yoco&#8217;s strategy as the foremost card payments provider in South Africa lies in creating access and removing barriers to adopting digital financial services. The company does that by focusing on product capabilities that Wazen claims are the most comprehensive for small and medium businesses. He adds that in terms of market presence, Yoco is also the easiest for merchants to access services through different channels seamlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a brand that is recognized now. That&#8217;s how we win and it&#8217;s about staying as focused as possible on that part of the market that, in our opinion, people like other competitors are not focused on enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>South Africa has over 6 million small businesses that still transact only in cash; this provides a huge opportunity for Yoco. According to the company, the number of small businesses that were fully cashless jumped 300% from March to July 2020. Yoco currently serves 150,000 of these businesses and adds over 500 merchants per day. The company claims to be processing more than $1 billion in card payments per year, and in its six years of existence, it has processed over $2 billion in card payments.</p>

<p>Yoco has raised a total of $107 million. The company&#8217;s Series C investment is the largest of its kind in South Africa and one of the largest for any African fintech (third only to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/africa-has-another-unicorn-as-chipper-cash-raises-100m-series-c-led-by-svb-capital/">Chipper Cash</a>). Wazen also claims it is the largest by any small business-focused payments platform in the Middle East and Africa.</p>
<p>Yoco is currently one of the most valuable startups on the continent, and as a fintech startup, it comes as no surprise. The sector continues to dominate startup venture capital funding in Africa while its heavy hitters bring first-time investors to the continent.</p>
<p>In Yoco&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s <a href="https://dragoneer.com/">Dragoneer Investment Group</a>. The fund has famously backed fintech giants like Chime, Klarna, Nubank, Mercado Libre and Square.</p>
<p>Other investors that participated include new investors Breyer Capital, HOF Capital, The Raba Partnership, 4DX Ventures and TO Ventures; and existing investors Partech, Velocity Capital Fintech Ventures, Orange Ventures and Quona Capital. Current and former executives from global tech companies such as Coinbase, Revolut, Spotify and Gojek took part as well.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t be more excited to partner with the Yoco team,&#8221; Christian Jensen, co-head of private investments at Dragoneer, said in a statement. &#8220;At Dragoneer, we look for great teams that are building durable businesses with wonderful economic models, and that is exactly what we’ve found at Yoco. Yoco is already beloved by customers, and the product roadmap that the company is investing behind will drive even more value for merchants. While there is tremendous room for continued growth domestically, the opportunity for Yoco goes well beyond South Africa.”</p>
<p>There are three core enablers to Yoco&#8217;s thriving business, Wazen pointed out. First is its product capabilities, second is its platform and third is its market presence. This investment will be there to accelerate all three. Yoco is transitioning from a pure payment acceptance play into a full financial ecosystem on the product side. The platform play will see Yoco continue to integrate and take advantage of regulatory easing vertically, and Yoco is deepening its market presence in South Africa.</p>
<p>While Wazen believes Yoco has barely scratched the surface in South Africa, he&#8217;s looking forward to replicating its growth in other parts of Africa and the Middle East. With over 100 million SMEs transacting in cash across both regions, Yoco plans to reach at least a million within the next four years.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, Yoco is increasing its team by 200 people remotely and across its offices in Cape Town and Amsterdam within the next year. The company is also tapping into a current trend that has seen African soonicorns and unicorns hire former top employees from global companies to scale theirs to new heights. While it doesn&#8217;t mention names, some of Yoco&#8217;s new hires include a former VP of product at Monzo, a former product marketing director at Paypal and a former head of communications at Uber. The company has also brought on board a new chairman, Juan Fuentes, the former managing director of fintech unicorn Pagseguro.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onto has raised $175 million in a combined equity and debt Series B round, capital the U.K.-based electric vehicle subscription startup plans to use to expand within the country as well as move into new markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This latest round brings Onto&#8217;s total funding to $245 million. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Swedish VC Alfvén &amp; Didrikson is leading the round on the equity raise, and British investment company Pollen Street Capital is providing a senior-secured asset-backed debt facility, which likely means Onto’s fleet of over 3,000 electric vehicles will be used as collateral. Onto did not disclose how much of the round came from equity versus debt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car-as-a-service company is finding that sweet spot between society’s growing adoration for subscription services and EV adoption driven by legislation. The U.K., like many other countries, is banning internal combustion engine new car sales by 2030, so more people are looking for ways to make the switch to electric. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That shift from gas to electric is accelerating. New registrations of all-electric<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plug-in hybrid vehicles had a market share of 10.7% in the UK in 2020, <a href="https://www.smmt.co.uk/2021/01/uk-automotive-looks-to-green-recovery-strategy-after-29-4-fall-in-new-car-registrations-in-2020/">according to the </a></span>Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. That&#8217;s up from 6.6% in 2019. The organization noted that battery and plug-in hybrid electric cars together accounted for more than one in 10 registrations, up from around one in 30 in 2019.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying a car is often considered one of the worst investments you can make; it&#8217;s an asset that both depreciates and costs money the moment a customer buys it through financing. Yet there are millions of new car sales each year in the U.K. With a market size that large, Onto founder and CEO Rob Jolly thinks there’s plenty of room to make the subscriptions business a sustainable and profitable one.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our total cost of ownership is very comparable with having your own car but you don’t have to worry about charging fees or servicing,” Jolly told TechCrunch. “The ballpark cost is £330 (~$450) per month. There’s no upfront deposit, which is huge. What we&#8217;re trying to do is remove all the barriers and actually make it easier for people to recognize that having a car on subscription is actually easier and more affordable than having a petrol or diesel car.” </span></p>
<p>A brief glance at <a href="https://on.to/electric-cars">Onto&#8217;s website</a> shows that the <span style="font-weight: 400;">£330 ballpark is only accurate for certain cars at the lower range of the company&#8217;s fleet. The middle range could be a Peugeot at £450 (~$622) or a Hyundai at £560 (~$775), and high range could be a Jaguar or Tesla at £1299 (~$1,800).</span></p>
<p>If we crunch the numbers for leasing a Hyundai Kona, for example, it&#8217;s not clear that Onto&#8217;s service is cheaper. <a href="https://www.carwow.co.uk/hyundai/kona/lease#gref">A lease for this vehicle in the U.K. could cost a customer annually </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">£9,888 over a four year period with a down payment of £2,152. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/may/08/electric-car-insurance-in-uk-is-45-less-than-for-petrol-or-diesel-vehicle">average cost of insurance for EVs in the U.K. is £2,264</a>. The <a href="https://www.bts.gov/archive/publications/highlights_of_the_2001_national_household_travel_survey/section_02#:~:text=On%20a%20daily%20basis%2C%20the,about%2023%20vehicle%20miles%20traveled.">average person travels 35 miles by personal car per day</a></span>, and the Hyundai Kona has a range of about 245 miles, so you really only need to fully charge it once a week. The <a href="https://pod-point.com/guides/vehicles/hyundai/2018/kona-64-kwh">average cost of charging the battery is about </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">£10, so you&#8217;re looking at about £520 per year on charging. Maintenance for electric vehicles is minimal and usually included in a lease agreement. Tally it up and you get a number in the ballpark of £15,000 (~$20,700) over four years. At £560 per month, Onto&#8217;s service would cost a customer £26,880 (~$37,145) over the same four year period. When factoring in U.K.&#8217;s plug-in car grant, you could <a href="https://www.hyundai.co.uk/new-cars/kona-electric">buy the car for £27,950</a> (~$38,620). </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly more of a high-end service, and the premium is on the convenience and flexibility. Onto&#8217;s pricing is certainly comparable to other EV subscription businesses, like <a href="https://www.steerev.com/plans-pricing/">Steer in North America</a>. Flux, in San Francisco, is markedly cheaper, offering Teslas for $600 per month, but it doesn&#8217;t include the &#8220;all-inclusive&#8221; services like road tax and insurance that Onto does. Granted, in the U.K., EV owners don&#8217;t actually have to pay for road tax.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among other things Onto says are included in a subscription are home delivery on its vehicles and access to free charging via network partners like BP Pulse, Tesla Supercharger, InstaVolt and as of earlier this year </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ev-subscription-service-onto-partners-with-shell-to-expand-access-to-charging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shell Recharge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company has partnerships with 10 car brands and rents out 12 different EV models, and is in the process of firming up more automaker partnerships. Jolly wouldn&#8217;t share specifics on future partnerships. However, updates to the company&#8217;s website, which shows most recent additions of car models to book, suggest Volkswagen and its 2021 e-Up! will be the latest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jolly said it might take a while for the masses to catch on to both EVs and subscriptions, but he&#8217;s confident that offering customers a white-glove service that can be canceled anytime makes the choice as easy as possible. In fact, Jolly said Onto is very nearly profitable, and that&#8217;s evident in the company’s plans to double its team size, which is currently at 70 staff members, every three to six months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onto’s lead investor, Alfvén &amp; Didrikson (A&amp;D), which usually invests in more SaaS businesses, has a long term investing structure. This has allowed the VC to take bigger bets on businesses like Onto’s that requires large upfront costs, according to Tiyam Afshari, partner at A&amp;D.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re happy to take those bets that we see are transforming an industry,” Afshari told TechCrunch. “Subscription as a form of ownership when it comes to cars is just a no-brainer if you look at all the hassle that comes from owning a car. So we feel quite strongly that the subscription model should and will grow to quite a significant part of the financing industry, and Onto is in a prime position to capitalize on that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given its lead investor’s long term bet on Onto, it’s perceivable that the company might look towards Sweden as it seeks to expand outside the U.K. After all, the Scandinavians have taken to EVs faster than other countries, and another EV subscription service in Norway, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/the-station-bird-has-dramas-in-san-francisco-drone-delivery-startup-zipline-raises-250m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">imove, recently raised $19 million in a Series A.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many users, the EV subscription service isn’t just about not having to worry about things like road tax, auto insurance and servicing. It’s about the flexibility of keeping up with the latest EV models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The iPhone has updates every year because the tech is improving and the battery life gets slightly better,” said Jolly. “The same thing is going to happen and already is happening with EVs. We’re seeing that this is car ownership now for millennials. They can swap in for the latest and greatest car when it comes out, even if it’s just a car with 30 miles extra range. And that’s hugely prevalent within our customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Simon Smith of East Devon, 32, it’s never been about trying out the newest car. He joined Onto’s service in 2019 for ethical and financial reasons, and has found the different iterations of the Renault Zoe ZE40 to suit his needs entirely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s still the most affordable way for me to drive electric,” Smith told TechCrunch. “I really wanted to go electric, but there wasn’t any obvious way of doing that or making that happen in 2019, and I would say it’s still fairly limited in the U.K. If you wanted to go electric, you’d probably have to save up a good deal of money even to buy second hand, and then you just wouldn’t have the flexibility.”</span></p>
<p>Smith says using Onto is a good approach for people who want to try before they buy, as well, which is no doubt at least partly why automakers like Tesla, Hyundai, Jaguar, Audi and Peugeot are interested in partnering up.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Again, it&#8217;s an enormous market, of which we can kind of sit hand-in-hand with the car manufacturers and dealerships and the other aspects where we are one of a number of methods people have of acquiring the car now,&#8221; said Jolly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing investors Legal and General, Campden Hill Capital and JamJar also participated in the equity round, alongside new investments from TotalEnergies Ventures, Vlerick Group, Dutch insurer Achmea Innovation Fund and the family office of Jim O’Neill. Lazard acted as financial advisor to Onto.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many have tried to do away with it, but email refuses to die&#8230; although in the process it might be (figuratively speaking) killing some of us with the workload it brings on to triage and use it. A startup called <a href="https://sedna.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sedna</a> has built a system to help with that &#8212; specifically for enterprise and other business customers &#8212; by &#8220;reading&#8221; the text of emails, and chats, and automatically actioning items within them so that you don&#8217;t have to. And today, it&#8217;s announcing funding of $34 million to expand its work.</p>
<p>The funding, a Series B, is being led by Insight Partners, with Stride.VC, Chalfen Ventures and the SAP.iO fund (part of SAP) also participating. The funding will be used to continue building out more data science around Sedna&#8217;s core functionality, with the aim of moving into a wider set of verticals over time. Currently its main business is in the area of supply chain players, with Glencore, Norden, and Bunge among its customers. Other customers in areas like finance include the neobank Starling. London-based Sedna is not disclosing valuation.</p>
<p>Bill Dobie, Sedna&#8217;s CEO and founder originally from Vancouver but now in London, said the idea for the company was hatched out of his own experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I spent years building software to help users be more productive, but no matter what we built we never really reduced people&#8217;s workload,&#8221; he said. The reason: the millstone that is called email, with its endless, unsolicited, inbound messages, some of which (just enough not to ignore) might be important. &#8220;What really struck me was how long it spent to move items out of and into email,&#8221; he said of the &#8220;to-do&#8217;s&#8221; that arose out of there.</p>
<p>Out of that, Sedna was built to &#8220;read&#8221; emails and give them more context and direction. Its system removes duplicates of action items and essentially increases the strike rate when it comes people&#8217;s inboxes: what&#8217;s in there is more likely to be what you really need to see. And it does so at a very quick speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our main value is the sheer scale at which we operate,&#8221; Dobie said. &#8220;We read millions or even billions of messages in sub second response times.&#8221; Indeed, while many of us are not getting &#8220;millions&#8221; of emails, there is a world of messaging out there that needs reading beyond that. Think, for example, of the volume of data that will be coming down the pike from IoT-based diagnostics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smart&#8221; inboxes have definitely become a thing for consumers &#8212; although arguably none work as well as you wish they did. What&#8217;s notable about Sedna has been how it&#8217;s tuned its particular algorithms to specific verticals, letting them get smarter around the kind of content and work practices in particular organizations.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Right now the work is driven by an API framework, with elements of &#8220;low code&#8221; formatting to let people shape their own Sedna experiences. The aim will be to make that even easier over time. AN API driven frame work right now, some low code we’re heading into, but mostly its SAP or shipping or trading system that understands the transaction under way, then Sedna uses a decision tree to categories. </span></p>
<p>Another area where Sedna might grow is in how it handles the information that it ingests. Currently, the company&#8217;s tech can be interconnected by a customer to then hand off certain work to RPA systems, as well as to specific humans. There is an obvious route to developing some of the second stage of software there &#8212; or alternatively, it&#8217;s a sign of how something like Sedna might get snapped up, or copied by one of the big RPA players.</p>
<p>“Bill started reimagining email where it was most broken and therefore hardest to fix—large teams managing huge volumes and complicated processes,&#8221; said Rebecca Liu-Doyle, principal at Insight Partners, in a statement. &#8220;Today, Sedna&#8217;s power is in its ability to introduce immense speed, simplicity, and delight to any inbox experience, regardless of scale or complexity. We are excited to partner with the Sedna team as they continue to make digital communication more intelligent for teams in global supply chain and beyond.” Liu-Doyle is joining the board with this round.</p>
<p>SAP is a strategic investor in this round, as Sedna potentially helps its customers be more productive while using SAP systems. “SAP continues to partner with SEDNA to deliver value to SAP customers. The ability to turn complex information into simpler intelligent collaboration has been a growing priority for many SAP customers,&#8221; said Stefan Sauer, global transport solutions Lead at SAP, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://element.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Element</a> acquired<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/element-acquires-gitter-to-get-more-developers-on-board-with-the-open-matrix-messaging-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Gitter last year</a> to bring in more users and features into its own decentralized, Matrix-based messaging app, the startup is announcing some funding to invest in its growth.</p>
<p>Element has picked up $30 million in a Series B round of funding. Some of the funding will be used to expand its technology to continue catering to use cases among the large organizations already using it. They include the French government covering some 5.5 million civil servants; Dataport (which is incorporating it into Germany&#8217;s education and public administration systems); and BWI, which supplies the communications system used by the German armed forces &#8212; in all, some 10 government engagements, the company said.</p>
<p>Matthew Hodgson, Element&#8217;s CEO and the technical co-founder of the open source, non-profile Matrix protocol, also said that some will be used to continue investing in the company&#8217;s peer-to-peer architecture to eliminate any need for servers. And a third area of investment will be building out the company&#8217;s decentralized voice and videoconferencing services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It will be transformational in terms of security,&#8221; he said in an interview.</p>
<p>Element today is available as an on-premise systems or a cloud-based platform. Most public sector customers choose the former, and private sector ones opt for the latter, the startup said. Cloud revenues grew 300% in the last 12 months, and although the company didn&#8217;t disclose how much that is in actual money, it&#8217;s a sign that Element is growing (another reason for taking funding now, even though as co-founder Amandine Le Pape noted, it didn&#8217;t need it).</p>
<p>This round includes investments from <a href="https://protocol.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protocol Labs</a> (the open-source R&amp;D lab behind libp2p, IPFS and Filecoin) and <a href="https://metaplanet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaplanet</a> (a fund set up by Jaan Tallinn, co-founder of Skype). WordPress parent <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> and <a href="https://notion.vc/">Notion</a> &#8212; both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/automattic-pumps-4-6m-into-new-vector-to-help-grow-matrix-an-open-decentralized-comms-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past investors</a> &#8212; are also participating. No valuation is being disclosed. Element has raised $48 million to date.</p>
<p>Matrix, the not-for-profit protocol on which Element is based, was built to shake up how the internet worked by creating a place where multiple, siloed communications environments could be integrated and engaged with in a cohesive, single platform, and those communications in turn can be &#8220;owned&#8221; by the entity organizing it. The idea here is that by bringing it all together, it&#8217;s easier to manage those conversations from the perspectives of security and practical use.</p>
<p>Matrix has been growing in its own right, with usage up 190% in the last 12 months, now up to 75,000 deployments with over 35 million &#8220;addressable&#8221; users. Those deployments can be on something as small as a Raspberry Pi or a giant server run by a government. But to be clear, &#8220;active&#8221; is a significantly smaller number than addressable users. While Matrix, much less Element, cannot &#8220;see&#8221; how others are using Matrix (that is one of the security advantages that governments like), Hodgson notes that on its own servers there are 1.2 million active users.</p>
<p>Element &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/riot-wants-to-be-like-slack-but-with-the-flexibility-of-an-underlying-open-source-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally had been called Riot</a> &#8212; was set out as a kind of Slack/Discord rival that was a native messaging platform on top of Matrix, there to capture audience already doing something else with the protocol to give them a clean and secure alternative at a time when only a handful of platforms control the majority of the world&#8217;s messaging data.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been building messaging technology for more than 15 years,&#8221; Le Pape said. &#8220;It just felt crazy that you have a few players [dominating] and keeping everyone&#8217;s data hostage. This is to open anyone’s communication. That is what we are trying to fix, data sovereignty.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the regard, Element (and Matrix) sit at the heart of a much bigger trend in technology, where some of the brightest minds in the field are reckoning with the defaults of how it all works, have decided that an alternative, a less centralized approach, must be a part of the bigger equation as data becomes more valuable and communications channels only become increasingly essential.</p>
<p>“Internet communication protocols have become fundamental for humanity. Today, most messaging happens over fickle proprietary centralized walled gardens who hold us hostage to their short-term business outlook,&#8221; said Juan Benet, CEO of Protocol Labs, in a statement. &#8220;Matrix is a beacon of hope: an open network for secure, decentralised communication, built with sound internet infrastructure principles. Element &#8212; both product and company &#8212; empowers organizations with control, ownership, and a great user experience for all their conversations.”</p>
<p>While there are a number of other encrypted messaging platforms on the market that are seeing mass adoption &#8212; they include Telegram, Signal and even to some extent Facebook&#8217;s WhatsApp &#8212; Element (and Matrix&#8217;s) early adopters have been large organizations. However, with Matrix, the engine underpinning Element, also doing early work with the likes of Twitter on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Sky</a> decentralized platform efforts, that could potentially give Element another boost of users, beyond those early adopters.</p>
<p>But just as clouds have silver linings, so too do sunny outlooks cast shadows&#8230; As with other decentralized communications platforms like Telegram and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/rocket-chat-raises-19m-for-its-open-source-approach-to-integrated-enterprise-messaging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocket.chat</a>, end-to-end encryption can cut both ways: it can help keep communications from being hacked, but it might also be used to evade detection when planning something malicious. Matrix (and by default Element) has been exploring <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alternatives to backdoors</a> into encrypted systems, which is one route that governments are considering to fix this, the argument being that mandating one will simply move the bad actors to another.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the investment here, and the usage of Element, is a vote in the direction of sticking with decentralization despite those misgivings and existing issues.</p>
<p>“When communication is centralised it becomes a very appealing target for abuse; whether that’s through propaganda, surveillance, censorship or worse,&#8221; said Metaplanet&#8217;s Tallinn. &#8220;Consumers need rescuing from surveillance capitalism, and organisations need a secure neutral way to communicate.  Matrix is the most advanced platform to provide that missing communication layer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With Microsoft now being an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/22/microsoft-invests-1-billion-in-openai-in-new-multiyear-partnership/">investor in OpenAI</a> the field now more open for new insurgents into the open-source AI arena. Now a German company hopes to take on the next AI mantle and produce something akin to the success of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a> AI model.</p>
<p>German AI startup Aleph Alpha has now raised €23 million / $27 million in a Series A funding co-led by Earlybird VC, Lakestar, and UVC Partners. Following a seed round of €5.3 million from LEA Partners, 468 Capital, and Cavalry Ventures in November 2020, Aleph Alpha has now raised a total of €28.3 million (people in $33.3 million).</p>
<p>Headquartered in Heidelberg, Germany, Aleph Alpha was founded in 2019 by Jonas Andrulis and co-founder Samuel Weinbach.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea behind Aleph Alpha is that it researches, develops, and “operationalizes” large AI systems towards generalizable AI, offering GPT-3-like text, vision and strategy AI models. The platform will run a public API enabling public and private sectors to run their own AI experiments and develop new business models.</p>
<p>The team says it will have a strong commitment to open-source communities (such as Eleuther.AI), academic partnerships, and will be pushing “European values and ethical standards,” it says, “supporting fairer access to modern AI research – aimed at counteracting ongoing &#8216;de-democratization&#8217;, monopolization, and loss of control or transparency.” The move is clearly meant to be a stake in the ground in the international world of AI development.</p>
<p>It’s also quite clear that there is a “European Union” angle going on here.</p>
<p>One of Aleph Alpha&#8217;s key messages is that it will aim to be a “sovereign EU-based compute infrastructure” for Europe’s private and public sectors. In other words, they want to firmly center themselves in the EU under EU law, GDPR and regulation. They may well prove a useful “Fortress Europe” for the company.</p>
<p>Jonas Andrulis, CEO and founder of Aleph Alpha said: “Aleph Alpha’s mission is to enable the accessibility, usability and integration of large, European multilanguage and multimodal AI models following the likes of GPT-3 and DALL-E, driving innovation for the explainability, alignment and integration. The funds significantly accelerate the process of bringing the latest generation of AI technology into application and secure the digital sovereignty for public and private sector partners in Europe and beyond”.</p>
<p>Dr. Hendrik Brandis, Co-Founder, and Partner at Earlybird: “We’re excited to partner with the exceptional team around Jonas and Samuel on their vision to develop one of the most transformative platform technologies of our time and bring Artificial  General Intelligence into reality &#8211; made in Europe. They are uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications, unlocking incredible potential across industries.”</p>
<p>Dr. Klaus Hommels from Lakestar commented: “The latest advances towards artificial general intelligence – non-domain specific autonomous systems delivering task performance beyond human capabilities &#8211; especially in the domain of large language models, provides us with glimpses of AI’s tremendous promise for the future. We believe Europe has to step up its game to secure access to technologies with such vast and profound transformational potential. We are impressed by the results Aleph Alpha has delivered to date. We believe Aleph Alpha has the right people and ambition to deliver generalizing AI models that are as innovative as their US and Chinese counterparts.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to health issues like menopause, fertility, pregnancy, and even early parenthood, the data tells us that people typically turn to search engines and social media for advice to ask about symptoms or concerns they have. They tend not to go to a medical practitioner, in the first instance. The suggestion, therefore, is that there is plenty of room for startups to fill that gap This is effectively the verticalisation of the model first pioneered by startups like KRY, Babylon Health, and Ada Health.</p>
<p><a href="https://peppy.health/">Peppy</a>, a B2B digital health platform addressing just these concerns, has now raised a £6.6M/$10M Series A funding round led by Felix Capital, with previous investors including Outward VC, Seedcamp, and Hambro Perks, also participating.</p>
<p>Peppy is a little like a ‘Babylon Health before you need Babylon Health’. The company says it provides expert-led support to individuals before they need to see a doctor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in London in 2018 by co-founders Evan Harris, Max Landry, and Mridula Pore, the startup address major life and family moments: menopause, fertility, pregnancy, and early parenthood. </p>
<p>It offers its services to a corporate customer base, which then incorporates Peppy into its employee health programs, enabling it to acquire some large employers in the UK and grow &#8211; it says &#8211; by 20 percent month-on-month for the past 12-months. Customers include BNP Paribas, Santander, DFS, Wickes, NHS trusts, the University of Sheffield.</p>
<p>The startup is pushing at an open door: Women of menopausal age are the fastest-growing demographic in the UK, and most say their work is negatively impacted, but &#8211; and here’s the crucial bit, they’d rather not talk about it to their line manager. Peppy says this is one of their biggest selling points into companies, which can now address the problem and help employees back to work more easily.</p>
<p>Just as with other telemedicine products, there are features such as access experts via a secure mobile app, with instant messaging, group chat, video consultations, live events, evidence-based articles, videos and programs. Furthermore, users can join a community of people who are experiencing similar challenges.</p>
<p>Mridula Pore, Co-Founder of Peppy, said: “The pandemic has shown us that employers can’t just talk about supporting their employees’ health and wellbeing anymore, they have to take action. More and more leading businesses are turning to us to provide the support their people really need – not a one-size-fits all solution, but support that is trustworthy, personalized, and delivered by experts. We’re still at the surface of what is possible for Peppy.”</p>
<p>Susan Lin, Investor at Felix Capital, said: “Since Felix started, ‘aspiration for a better life’ has been a core theme and we believe in the strong opportunity for digital health and wellness solutions to improve this. Peppy is at the forefront of three huge market trends and we believe is positioned to become a category-defining brand. First, massive growth in targeted employee benefits, driven by increasing awareness of the importance these have in boosting morale, productivity, and retention. Second, demand for much more convenient ways to access healthcare, which has been further accelerated by COVID-19. And finally, a need for much more personalized solutions, especially in critical life stages such as menopause and early parenthood.”</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Pore expanded on the problem: “Today, people&#8217;s alternative is to go to their GP/MP. They may be lucky, have a GP who knows a lot about the issues to offer the support the patient needs. We know that a lot of women aren&#8217;t getting the support they need, they suffer, they struggle, they&#8217;re embarrassed to talk to their manager about what&#8217;s going on. They muddle through and they&#8217;re worried about being fired because for ‘women&#8217;s problems’. Some women quit. All the surveys suggest that people either switch their working arrangements, make different decisions or quit. It’s a big headache for employers, and we know the same thing happens for new parents.”</p>
<p>She added: “We&#8217;ve seen a real tidal change, especially in the last two years and I think COVID has massively accelerated companies putting menopause policy into line manager training. But none of those really address what the individual needs are because ultimately they still go to their GP and they&#8217;re back at square one. And so what we&#8217;re doing with Pepe is giving them access to our nurses and counselors on our programs, so they can get informed, educated on what their options are, medical and nonmedical, have the information they need to be able to go and seek out the right options for them, try them and they get that support over months, because we know that it will go up and down over time and you know everyone&#8217;s health journey evolves.”</p>
<p>She told me that the tech solution means Peppy allows people to connect to human experts “through the way that suits them in a personalized way and convenience so they can get child support, they can get video consultations, they&#8217;ll get content that&#8217;s tailored for them, they can join in live sessions on topics that are relevant for them. That can be anything from the basics of menopause, to your sex life. You can do it on your own time, in short bursts, or if you need it, for a 45-minute phone consultation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online abuse, disinformation, fraud and other malicious content is growing and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/world/europe/disinformation-social-media.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting more complex to track</a>. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.activefence.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActiveFence</a>, which has quietly built a tech platform to suss out threats as they are being formed and planned, to make it easier for trust and safety teams to combat them on platforms, is coming out of the shadows to announce significant funding on the back of a surge of large organizations using its services.</p>
<p>The startup, co-headquartered in New York and Tel Aviv, has raised $100 million, funding that it will use to continue developing its tools and to continue expanding its customer base. To date, ActiveFence says that its customers include companies in social media, audio and video streaming, file sharing, gaming, marketplaces and other technologies &#8212; it has yet to disclose any specific names but says that its tools collectively cover &#8220;billions&#8221; of users. Governments and brands are two other categories that it is targeting as it continues to expand. It has been around since 2018 and is growing at around 100% annually.</p>
<p>The $100 million being announced today actually covers two rounds: its most recent Series B led by CRV and Highland Europe, as well as a Series A it never announced led by Grove Ventures and Norwest Venture Partners. Vintage Investment Partners, Resolute Ventures and other unnamed backers also participated. It&#8217;s not disclosing valuation but I understand it&#8217;s over $500 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are very honored to be ActiveFence partners from the very earliest days of the company, and to be part of this important journey to make the internet a safer place and see their unprecedented success with the world’s leading internet platforms,” said Lotan Levkowitz, general partner at Grove Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p>The increased presence of social media and online chatter on other platforms has put a strong spotlight on how those forums are used by bad actors to spread malicious content. ActiveFence&#8217;s particular approach is a set of algorithms that tap into innovations in AI (natural language processing) and to map relationships between conversations. It crawls all of the obvious, and less obvious and harder-to-reach parts of the internet to pick up on chatter that is typically where a lot of the malicious content and campaigns are born &#8212; some 3 million sources in all &#8212; before they become higher-profile issues.  It&#8217;s built both on the concept of big data analytics as well as understanding that the long tail of content online has a value if it can be tapped effectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;We take a fundamentally different approach to trust, safety and content moderation,&#8221; Noam Schwartz, the co-founder and CEO, said in an interview. &#8220;We are proactively searching the darkest corners of the web and looking for bad actors in order to understand the sources of malicious content. Our customers then know what&#8217;s coming. They don&#8217;t need to wait for the damage, or for internal research teams to identify the next scam or disinformation campaign. We work with some of the most important companies in the world, but even tiny, super niche platforms have risks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The insights that ActiveFence gathers are then packaged up in an API that its customers can then feed into whatever other systems they use to track or mitigate traffic on their own platforms.</p>
<p>ActiveFence is not the only company building technology to help platform operators, governments and brands to have a better picture of what is going on in the wider online world. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/factmata-gets-backed-by-eyeo-maker-of-adblock-plus-and-takes-over-its-trusted-news-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Factmata</a> has built algorithms to better understand and track sentiments online; <a href="https://company.primer.ai/blog/primer-raises-110m-series-c-to-accelerate-nlp-solutions-for-government-and-commercial-organizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primer</a> (which also recently raised a big round) also uses NLP to help its customers track online information, with its customers including government organizations that used its technology to track misinformation during election campaigns; <a href="https://bolster.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolster</a> (formerly called RedMarlin) is another.</p>
<p>Some of the bigger platforms have also gotten more proactive in bringing tracking technology and talent in-house: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2018/07/02/thebloomsbury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook acquired Bloomsbury AI</a> several years ago for this purpose; <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/Twitter-acquires-Fabula-AI.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter has acquired Fabula</a> (and is working on a bigger efforts like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/twitters-birdwatch-fights-misinformation-with-community-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Birdwatch</a> to build better tools), and earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/discord-buys-sentropy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord picked up Sentropy</a>, another online abuse tracker. In some cases, companies that more regularly compete against each other for eyeballs and dollars are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-facebook-tech-giants-target-manifestos-militias-database-2021-07-26/">even teaming up</a> to collaborate on efforts.</p>
<p>Indeed, may well be that ultimately there will exist multiple efforts and multiple companies doing good work in this area, not unlike other corners of the world of security, which might need more than one hammer thrown at problems to crack them. In this particular case, the growth of the startup to date, and its effectiveness in identifying early warning signs, is one reason why investors have been interested in ActiveFence.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to support ActiveFence in this important mission” commented Izhar Armony, the lead investor from CRV, in a statement. “We believe they are ready for the next phase of growth and that they can maintain leadership in the dynamic and fast growing trust and safety market.”</p>
<p>“ActiveFence has emerged as a clear leader in the developing online trust and safety category. This round will help the company to accelerate the growth momentum we witnessed in the past few years,&#8221; said Dror Nahumi, general partner at Norwest Venture Partners, in a statement.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As of next week, Lime's vehicles will be included as a travel option in tandem with public transit for either all or part of a multimodal journey on the Israeli app.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shared electric micromobility company Lime announced a partnership to integrate its electric scooters, bikes and mopeds into the Moovit trip planning app. As of next week, Lime&#8217;s vehicles will be included as a travel option in tandem with public transit for either all or part of a multimodal journey on the Israeli app.</p>
<p>Nearby Lime vehicles will show up in Moovit in 117 cities across 20 countries, including the United States, South Africa, Australia and throughout Europe. Lime says this partnership is the largest micromobility integration within an app fully dedicated to mobility as a service (MaaS) to date based on the number of cities involved. It plans to add 40 other cities in the following months.</p>
<p>The partnership between Lime and Moovit, which is a subsidiary of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/intels-mobileye-takes-its-autonomous-vehicle-testing-program-to-new-york-city/"> Intel&#8217;s Mobileye</a>, follows a trend in the transportation world that integrates public transit, ridesharing and micromobility into one optimized system.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/"> Uber, one of Lime&#8217;s lead investors</a>, delivered a<a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/transit/horizons-paper/"> whitepaper</a> this year laying out its plans to facilitate such a centralization of mobility modes. Some public transit agencies, like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/maas-transit-the-business-of-mobility-as-a-service/"> St. Louis Metro Transit</a>, that have experienced a decline in ridership hope directing users to third-party apps that lay out different forms of mobility would eventually bring it back. Others might just see joining forces as a way to get commuters out of cars, giving them seamless options for traveling that last mile from home to the train station without contributing to carbon emissions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“This partnership signifies that mobility companies recognize the need to collaborate together to offer riders more convenient modes of public and shared transportation as they return,” Nir Erez, Moovit co-founder and CEO, said in a statement. &#8220;Offering more alternative options that can easily get people to their destinations is a critical component of a MaaS platform, especially in some of the most congested cities in the world.”</p>
<p>Lime is touching on a moment with cities, no doubt in a way that will lead to more permit awards for the micromobility giant. The pandemic has caused many cities to embrace micromobility and draft recovery plans that highlight sustainable mobility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moovit captures a market specifically focused on planning commutes and local travel, and helping users access micromobility as part of those journeys will hopefully reduce car travel and further encourage people to take public transit again,&#8221; Tiffani Gibson, senior manager of Lime&#8217;s corporate communications, told TechCrunch. &#8220;We want cities to view us as a sustainable partner that works in tandem with the broader transit ecosystem. We provide an additive service that eases and encourages connections to transit, especially in traditionally underserved areas. We want riders to return to transit in conjunction with our service and are looking to replace car trips, not transit trips.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Moovit&#8217;s<a href="https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index-COVID19"> COVID-19 mobility report,</a> public transit is back on the rise in big cities like New York, Paris and London, which is probably why Lime wants to tap into the market now. Last month, 41% of Lime&#8217;s scooter rides were taken during peak commuting hours, according to data from the company, which also says historical data has shown a significant amount of Lime rides connecting riders with public transit.</p>
<p>Lime is also integrated with Google Maps, one of the most downloaded MaaS apps in the world, but it wouldn&#8217;t say in how many cities Lime&#8217;s vehicles are integrated with the app. On Google Maps, users can choose to route their destination via car, public transit, walking or bike. Bikers are offered Lime&#8217;s vehicles as a transport option for the whole journey, whereas with Moovit, the point is to feature Lime vehicles for first- or last-mile solutions to mass transit.</p>
<p>With both Google Maps and Moovit, users can see in real-time where a Lime vehicle is nearby, how long it&#8217;ll take to walk there, an estimated trip cost and remaining battery percentage. To unlock the journey, users will be redirected to the Lime app after clicking on the logo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian social media platform ShareChat said on Tuesday it has raised an additional $145 million and is now valued at nearly $3 billion, less than three months after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/sharechat-valued-at-2-1b-in-502-million-fundraise/">secured $502 million at a valuation of $2.1 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Temasek and Moore Strategic Ventures led the new tranche of investment while Mirae-Naver Asia Growth fund participated in the new financing round (Series F), the Bangalore-based startup said. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">reported earlier this month</a> that six-year-old ShareChat was in talks to raise at around $2.8 billion valuation. ShareChat, which has now raised over $911 million to date, has closed the Series F financing round, it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This additional investment for Series F is a validation of our market leadership and a reflection of investor trust in our execution capabilities. We are immensely proud of what we have been able to achieve with Moj and ShareChat in the last 12 months,&#8221; said Ankush Sachdeva, co-founder and chief executive of video app Moj and ShareChat.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have been very fortunate to attract a bunch of very high quality names in our series F and the list just got longer with Temasek, MSV and Mirae-Naver joining hands with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a recent interview with TechCrunch, Sachdeva said the short video app Moj, which the startup launched last year shortly after New Delhi banned TikTok citing cybersecurity concerns, is the fastest growing product within the firm and he expects it to be bigger that ShareChat one day.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182367" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182367" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2182367 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/india-short-video-apps.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="226" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/india-short-video-apps.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/india-short-video-apps.jpg?resize=150,33 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/india-short-video-apps.jpg?resize=300,66 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/india-short-video-apps.jpg?resize=768,169 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/india-short-video-apps.jpg?resize=680,150 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/india-short-video-apps.jpg?resize=1536,339 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/india-short-video-apps.jpg?resize=50,11 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182367" class="wp-caption-text">Monthly active users of short-video apps in India, according to mobile insight firm App Annie. (Sourced by TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>ShareChat, which claims to have more than 160 million users, offers its social network app in 15 Indian languages and has a large following in small Indian cities and towns, or what venture capitalist Sajith Pai of Blume Ventures refers to as “India 2.”</p>
<p>Very few players in the Indian startup ecosystem have a reach to this segment of this population, which thanks to users from even smaller towns and villages — called “India 3” — getting online has expanded in recent years.</p>
<p>Moj, on the other hand, competes with a handful of players, including Times Internet’s MX TakaTak, as well as Glance’s Roposo and DailyHunt’s Josh — both of which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">received funding from Google late last year</a>. The search giant was also in talks to invest in ShareChat late last year, TechCrunch reported earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a monthly active user base of 160 million and 50+ million strong creator community, Moj in a year has grown into India’s number one short video app. To strengthen our leadership position, we will continue to invest in our AI capabilities, scaling our global AI org, building advanced editing tools and helping our creators monetize on the platform,&#8221; said Sachdeva, adding that the short video app clocks 4.5 billion views each day and a user typically spends about 34 minutes with the app daily.</p>
<p>TechCrunch also reported earlier that Twitter had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/twitter-explored-buying-indian-startup-sharechat-and-positioning-moj-as-a-global-tiktok-rival/">held talks to acquire majority stakes in ShareChat</a> and expand the Moj app globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to partner with Moj as they build India’s premier short form video platform, and have been impressed by this management team’s speed and agility in capturing the opportunity. This round will help to accelerate that growth and allow Moj and ShareChat to continue to develop the best ecosystem for content creators and consumers alike,” said James McIntyre, Senior Managing Director and COO at MSV, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Freight forwarders often keep track of rates on spreadsheets they email to customers, but the pandemic has made that difficult because prices are constantly fluctuating. <a href="https://www.freightify.com/">Freightify</a>, a startup that refers to itself as the “Shopify for maritime freight,” provides white-label rate management and e-booking tools that freight forwarders can use to set up online stores, reducing the time they need to spend on administrative work.</p>
<p>The startup announced today it has raised $2.5 million in pre-Series A funding led by Nordic Eye Venture Capital, with participation from Tradeworks VC, Venture Catalysts, 9Unicorns and Blume Funders Fund. The round also included returning investor Vinod Kumar Talreja.</p>
<p>Freightify currently serves customers in 10 countries and plans to use part of its funding to expand into the United States and Europe. Its customers are freight forwarders who range in size from handling 250 shipments a year to more than 100,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zencargo raises $42M to expand its digital-first freight-forwarding platform internationally&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/zencargo-raises-42m-to-expand-its-digital-first-freight-forwarding-platform-internationally/embed/#?secret=HHvWWtLMTO" data-secret="HHvWWtLMTO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company was founded in 2016 by Raghavendran Viswanathan, its chief executive officer. Freightify started out as FreightBro, a freight marketplace, before its technology evolved into Freightify’s automated rate management system.</p>
<p>Freightify says the platform has handled more than $400 million in freight revenue for customers and corresponding gross merchandise volume of $2 billion.</p>
<p>Freightify can be integrated with freight forwarders’ existing transport management systems, which track the movement of cargo. Once freight forwarders set up an online store with Freightify, their customers use it to compare rates, ask for quotes, book online and track shipments. Freightify draws pricing data from the APIs of ocean carriers like Maersk, CMA-CGM and Evergreen or automates the entry of offline contract rates from carriers without APIs.</p>
<p>Viswanathan told TechCrunch that before the COVID-19 pandemic, freight rates were relatively static, so freight forwarders were able to share them with customers through spreadsheets. But the pandemic created a host of new challenges.</p>
<p>“The ocean freight transportation industry is going through a flux right now,” Viswanathan said. “The industry went into a downward spiral since the start of the pandemic. Freight rates have been hitting record numbers for four straight quarters,” with rates up 500% since the beginning of 2020.</p>
<p>Furthermore, other factors, like the Suez Canal blockage by the Ever Given and pandemic-related port delays, have made supply chains even less predictable.</p>
<p>Freightify solves some of these challenges by giving freight forwarders and their customers a live pricing platform like the ones used by travelers to compare airfares, showing real-time rates on a single screen.</p>
<p>“Freight forwarders are like the travel agents for the global trade,” Viswanathan said. “However, air travel is not as complicated as global trade. Supply chains require experts to manage cargo throughout the entire lifecycle and freight forwarders play a vital role in greasing the wheels.”</p>
<p>Freightify is working on a new product where its customers can share data with one another, making it easier to communicate across timezones while reducing the amount of emails they need to send. A closed group product pilot is expected to happen at the end of this year.</p>
<p>In a statement about the funding, Nordic Eye investment manager Ib Drachmann said it’s “exciting to follow a dynamic and ambitious organization that has great chances of making a huge digital impact in international freight forwarding.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Nium’s new round adds fuel to a fire shared by a number of companies all going after a global B2B payments market valued at $120 trillion annually.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Business-to-business payments platform Nium announced Monday that it raised more than $200 million in Series D funding and saw its valuation rise above $1 billion.</p>
<p>The company, now Singapore-based but shifting to the Bay Area, touted the investment as making it “the first B2B payments unicorn from Southeast Asia.”</p>
<p>Riverwood Capital led the round, in which Temasek, Visa, Vertex Ventures, Atinum Capital, Beacon Venture Capital and Rocket Capital Investment participated, along with a group of angel investors like DoorDash’s Gokul Rajaram, FIS’ Vicky Bindra and Tribe Capital’s Arjun Sethi. Including the new funding, Nium has raised $300 million to date, Prajit Nanu, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The B2B payments sector is already hot, <a href="https://www.llrpartners.com/growth-bit/fintech-trends-2019-b2b-payments/">yet underpenetrated, according to some experts.</a> To give an idea just how hot, Nium was seeking $150 million for its Series D round, received commitments of $300 million from eager investors and settled on $200 million, Nanu said.</p>
<p>“This is our fourth or fifth fundraise, but we have never had this kind of interest before — we even had our term sheets in five days,” he added. “I believe this interest is because we’ve successfully managed to create a global platform that is heavily regulated, which gives us access to a lot of networks. This is an environment where payment is visible, and our core is powering frictionless commerce and enabling anyone to use our platform.”</p>
<p>Nium’s new round adds fuel to a fire shared by a number of companies all going after a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/earnings/2019/mastercard-contactless-b2b-cross-border-growth/">global B2B payments market valued at $120 trillion annually</a>: last week, Paystand raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/paystand-banks-50m-to-make-b2b-payments-cashless-and-with-no-fees/">$50 million in Series C</a> funding to make B2B payments cashless, while Dwolla <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/dwolla-raises-21m-to-bring-more-customizable-payment-and-money-transfer-options-to-fintechs-and-brands/">raised $21 million</a> for its API that allows companies to build and facilitate fast payments. In March, Higo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/mexicos-higo-ai-nets-3-3m-to-become-the-venmo-for-b2b-payments-in-latam/">brought in $3.3 million</a> to do the same in Latin America, while Balance, developing a B2B payments platform that allows merchants to offer a variety of payment methods. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/lightspeed-and-max-levchin-bet-on-balance-to-bring-b2b-payments-into-the-digital-world/">raised $5.5 million</a> in February.</p>

<p>Nium’s approach is to provide access to a global payment infrastructure, including card issuance, accounts receivable and payable, and banking-as-a-service through a single API. The company’s network enables customers to then send funds to more than 100 countries, pay out in more than 60 currencies, accept funds in seven currencies and issue cards in more than 40 countries, Nanu said. The company also boasts money transfer, card issuances and banking licenses in 11 jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Francisco Alvarez-Demalde, co-founding partner and managing partner at Riverwood, said in an email that the combination of software — plus regulatory licenses — and operating a fintech infrastructure platform on behalf of neobanks and corporates is a global trend experiencing hyper-growth.</p>
<p>Riverwood followed Nium for many years, and its future vision was what got the firm interested in being a part of this round. Alvarez-Demalde said that “Nium has the incredible combination of a great market opportunity, a talented founder and team, and we believe the company is poised for global growth based on underlying secular technology trends like increasing real-time payment capabilities and the proliferation of cross border commerce.</p>
<p>“As a central payment infrastructure in one API, Nium is a catalyst that unlocks cross-border payments, local accounts and card issuance with a network of local market licenses, partners and banking relationships to facilitate moving money across the world,” he added. “Enterprises of all types are embedding financial services as part of their consumer experience, and Nium is a key global enabler of this trend.”</p>
<p>Nanu said the new funding enables the company to move to the United States, which represents 3% of Nium’s revenue. He wants to increase that to 20% over the next 18 months, as well as expand in Latin America. The investment also gives the company a 12- to 18-month runway for further M&amp;A activity.  In June, Nium <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nium-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-b2b-travel-payments-leader-ixaris-301306501.html">acquired virtual card issuance company Ixaris</a>, and in July <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/nium-to-acquire-wirecard-forex-india-private-limited-838969270.html">acquired Wirecard Forex India</a> to expose it to India’s market. He also plans to expand the company’s payments network infrastructure, invest in product development and add to Nium’s 700-person headcount.</p>
<p>Nium already counts hundreds of enterprise companies as clients and plans to onboard thousands more in the next year. The company processes $8 billion in payments annually and has issued more than 30 million virtual cards since 2015. Meanwhile, revenue grew by over 280% year over year.</p>
<p>All of this growth puts the company on a trajectory for an initial public offering, Nanu said. He has already spoken to people who will help the company formally kick off that journey in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>“Unlike other companies that raise money for new products, we aim to expand in the existing sets of what we do,” Nanu said. “The U.S. is a new market, but we have a good brand and will use the new round to provide a better experience to the customer.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tesla CEO Elon Musk has warned about battery supply constraints before and the effect it might have on the Tesla Semi. That warning was apparently warranted.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is pushing the launch of its electric Semi truck program to 2022 due to supply chain challenges and the limited availability of battery cells, the company said in its second-quarter earnings report Monday.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has warned about battery supply constraints before and the effect it might have on the Tesla Semi, which was first unveiled as a prototype in November 2017. Back in January, Musk said the engineering work on the Tesla Semi had been completed and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/elon-musk-says-tesla-semi-is-ready-for-production-but-limited-by-battery-cell-output/">deliveries were expected to begin this year</a>. He did add the caveat, at the time, that the availability of battery cells could limit the company&#8217;s ability to produce the Semi.</p>
<p>That warning was apparently warranted. From the shareholders&#8217; letter posted today after the market closed:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>We believe we remain on track to build our first Model Y vehicles in Berlin and Austin in 2021. The pace of the respective production ramps will be influenced by the successful introduction of many new product and manufacturing technologies, ongoing supply-chain-related challenges and regional permitting.</p>
<p>To better focus on these factories, and due to the limited availability of battery cells and global supply chain challenges, we have shifted the launch of the Semi truck program to 2022. We are also making progress on the industrialization of Cybertruck, which is currently planned for Austin production subsequent to Model Y.</p></blockquote>
<p>While not mentioned on the call or in its earnings report, the delay follows the departure of Jerome Guillen, a critical executive at Tesla who was working on the development and eventual production of the Tesla Semi. Guillen’s resignation in June came just three months after he was moved from the president of automotive position, which included oversight of the Tesla Semi, to a role with less responsibility as head of heavy-duty trucking. Guillen had led Tesla’s entire automotive business from September 2018 until March 2021.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tesla&#8217;s Cybertruck, which is supposed to go into production in late 2021, looks like it might be pushed into next year as well. Musk didn&#8217;t answer questions, but comments from Musk as well as Tesla VP of engineering Lars Moravy during the earnings call suggest that it could shift to 2022.</p>
<p>Cybertruck is currently in its alpha stages of prototyping, with the basic engineering and architecture of the vehicle completed. While the Model Y takes priority, the company is moving into a beta phase of the Cybertruck later this year, Moravy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be looking to ramp that in production in Texas after Model Y is up and going,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Musk leaned in on how difficult the Cybertruck would be, perhaps as a way to cushion expectations for its arrival in 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cybertruck ramp will be difficult because it is such a new architecture,&#8221; Musk said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a great product; it might be our best product ever, but it does have a lot of fundamentally new design ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on to make the point that he has used as other vehicles have gone from prototype to volume production: Manufacturing is hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the risk of being repetitive, it&#8217;s actually easy to make prototypes or a handful of small-volume production, but anything produced at a high volume, which is really what&#8217;s relevant here, is it&#8217;s going to move as fast as the slowest of the rough order of magnitude of 10,000 unique parts and processes.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Small as it is, the division is selling more energy storage and solar. Revenue from this division grew 62% from the previous quarter and more than 116% from the same quarter in 2020.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla&#8217;s primary source of revenue comes from the sale of its electric vehicles, but its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-quarterly-profit-surpasses-1-billion/">latest quarterly earnings report</a> showed growth in its energy storage and solar business.</p>
<p>The demand picture will get even sunnier for the division if the company can access enough chips for its energy storage products, according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Tesla on Monday <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22">reported</a> $801 million in revenue from its energy generation and storage business &#8212; which includes three main products: solar, its Powerwall storage device for homes and businesses, and its utility storage unit Megapack &#8212; but that&#8217;s just a sliver of the nearly<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-quarterly-profit-surpasses-1-billion/"> $12 billion in total revenue</a>. Small as it is, the division is selling more energy storage and solar. Revenue from this division grew 62% from the previous quarter and more than 116% from the same quarter in 2020. Tesla doesn&#8217;t separate solar and energy storage revenue.</p>
<p>More importantly, the cost of revenue for its solar and energy storage business was $781 million, meaning that for the first time the total cost of producing and distributing these energy storage products was lower than the revenue it generated. That&#8217;s good news.</p>
<p>As one might expect, total deployments also rose. Tesla installed 1,274 megawatt-hours of energy storage in the second quarter of 2021, a 205% increase from the same period last year. Similarly, the amount of solar energy deployed in the second quarter of this year was 85 MWh, up 214% from Q2 2020. As a side note: Tesla&#8217;s total solar and energy storage deployments were essentially flat when comparing Q2 2019 and Q2 2020 numbers, likely due to the pandemic&#8217;s general halting of business.</p>
<p>The important nugget is revenue growth. In 2019, Tesla reported $369 million in revenue from solar and storage. Revenue was stagnant in Q2 2020, with $370 million from that business. This quarter was more than double what Tesla brought in during the same quarters of 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p>What changed? Besides COVID-19, Tesla points to several Megapack projects coming online and growing popularity in its combined solar and Powerwall product. (Tesla no longer allows customers to order Powerwall without a solar installation.) <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">According to a configurator on Tesla&#8217;s website, one Megapack is about $1.2 million before taxes. In some states, Tesla says the earliest deliveries will be in 2023.</span></p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s energy storage business is facing headwinds, however. Musk said demand for both the Megapack and the Powerwall both exceed supply, and a backlog is growing. The company is unable to meet that demand because of the global chip shortage, he said.</p>
<p>Tesla uses the same chips in its Powerwall as it does in its vehicles, and Musk said vehicles are the priority while supply is low.</p>
<div class="c-message_kit__gutter">
<div class="c-message_kit__gutter__right" data-qa="message_content">
<div class="c-message_kit__blocks c-message_kit__blocks--rich_text">

<div class="p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper--first">
<div class="p-rich_text_block" dir="auto">
<div class="p-rich_text_section">&#8220;As that significant shortage is alleviated, then we can massively ramp up Powerwall production,&#8221; Musk said during an earnings call. &#8220;I think we have a chance of hitting an annualized rate of a million units of Powerwall next year — maybe, on the order of 20,000 a week. Again dependent on cell supply and semiconductors. &#8230; As the world transitions to a sustainable energy production, solar and wind are intermittent, and by their nature really need battery packs in order to provide a steady flow of electricity. And when you look at all the utilities in the world, this is a vast amount of backup batteries that are needed.&#8221;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Musk said in the long term, Tesla and other suppliers would need to produce a combined 1,000 to 2,000 gigawatt-hours per year in order to keep up with energy storage demands. Musk said the company has asked its cell suppliers to double their supply in 2022, a goal that Musk caveated would be dependent on supply chain issues. The company&#8217;s current strategy is to overshoot cell supply and route it outward to its energy storage products, but as in the case of chip shortages, vehicle production would be prioritized, according to Musk.</p>
<h2>Battery cell plans</h2>
<p>While much of the battery cell discussion focused on its 4680 cell that is in development, Musk also touched on Tesla&#8217;s intentions to power some of its products with cheaper lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries. Specifically, he said there&#8217;s a good chance that all stationary storage could move to iron-based batteries and away from nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) and nickel-cobalt-aluminum batteries.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think probably will see a shift, my guess is probably to two-thirds iron, one-third nickel,&#8221; Musk said of Tesla&#8217;s plans. &#8220;And this is actually good because there&#8217;s quite a bit of iron in the world, an insane amount of iron. But there&#8217;s much less nickel and there&#8217;s way less cobalt.&#8221;</p>
<p>The one-third of batteries that will remain nickel-based will be used for its longer-range electric vehicles. All of its other EVs would also move to LFP batteries, which is already the case in its vehicles assembled in China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung sent out invites for its August 11 Unpacked event last week. While it’s clear this is going to be packed (somewhat ironically) even by the company’s standards, the event may well be as notable for what it doesn’t include. Namely, a slew of rumors have pointed to Samsung skipping its annual Galaxy Note update.</p>
<p>In a blog post today, the company’s president and head of Mobile Communications Business, TM Roh, writes, “Instead of unveiling a new Galaxy Note this time around, we will further broaden beloved Note features to more Samsung Galaxy devices.” The language isn’t entirely clear what that means for the future of Samsung’s beloved – if occasional erratic – phablet. No Note this event? This year? This … ever?</p>
<p>Samsung offered TechCrunch the following clarification, “We will not be launching new Galaxy Note devices in 2021. Instead, Samsung plans to continue to expand the Note experience and bring many of its popular productivity and creativity features, including the S Pen, across our Galaxy ecosystem. We will share more details on our future portfolio once we are ready to announce.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Early rumors chalked the lack of a new Note up to supply chain problems that have persisted throughout much of 2020 and 2021. But further speculation has left many wondering whether the company may finally be sunsetting the Galaxy Note series on the eve of its 10th anniversary. Is it possible that the pioneering phablet has run its course, especially as other Samsung flagships get larger and siphon off its biggest features?</p>
<p>What’s clear is that some of the devices announced on the 11th will follow in the footsteps of the Galaxy S21 and bring Note-like features including S-Pen functionality. Likely this means at least the Galaxy Z Fold, confirming earlier rumors that the foldable would be the latest Galaxy device to blur the line between it and the Note. Presumably this also means a further reinforced display for the product. <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/latest-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-leak-shows-how-youll-store-s-pen">Recent leaks</a> point to a carrying case with a pen holster, rather than baking the slot directly into the Fold&#8217;s already complicated design.</p>
<p>“I hope you’ll join us as we debut our next Galaxy Z family and share some foldable surprises — including the first-ever S Pen designed specifically for foldable phones,” Roh writes. The executive also promises “even more refined style, armed with more durable, stronger material” on the new Galaxy Z Flip, while also confirming the arrival of a new Z Fold.</p>
<p>Rounding out the news is a reference to the One UI Watch that appears to confirm that the latest Galaxy Watch will also make a cameo at the upcoming Unpacked.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 26, 2021. Tech news got off to a cracking start this week after the Chinese government spent the weekend rolling out a new regulatory framework for the myriad edtech startups in the country. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">Ant IPO</a> was really just the start of the recent blizzard of changes concerning how China’s government runs its economy. The food delivery market was also impacted recently, along with Tencent Music. I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">noodled a bit here</a> on what the situation may mean for the country’s startups. &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3 (or so)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/bezos-offers-billions-in-incentives-for-nasas-lunar-lander-contract/">Bezos wants U.S. space contracts:</a> </strong>After retired U.S. billionaire Jeff Bezos recently went up to zero-g for a few minutes, much snark concerning the wealthy spending their fortunes on a vanity space race was tweeted. The flip of that argument is that there’s real-world applications for all the money that Bezos, Branson and Musk are spending. In this case, Bezos is willing to cut the price of Blue Origin’s lunar lander project just to get access to a NASA contract. This is either a neat way to save taxpayer money or some weird sort of corporate bribe. Your call on that one.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/box-unwraps-its-answer-to-the-3-8b-e-signature-market-box-sign/">Box wades into the signature wars:</a></strong> The other month, Box, the former startup darling, dropped $55 million on an e-sig company. Now Box is rolling out Box Sign to all its customers for free. The e-sig market is full of big players (DocuSign) and smaller entities (PandaDoc). To see Box offer its e-sig service to existing business customers for no cost means that the software capability is becoming more table stakes than standalone product. Startups take note.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/notco-gets-its-horn-following-235m-round-to-expand-plant-based-food-products/">A new alt-food unicorn:</a></strong> NotCo makes plant-based milks and meats. It just carved itself a fresh slice with a $235 million Series D that values the company at $1.5 billion. We’re highlighting this round because it underscores the amount of capital and, we presume, demand that alternative food products are attracting today. What was a dream just a few years ago is building big startups and even some public companies.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/court-orders-us-capitol-rioter-to-unlock-his-laptop-with-his-face/">Keep your password, but show your face:</a></strong> We don&#8217;t often wade into the nuances of the Fifth Amendment, but a judge&#8217;s order out of D.C. caught our eye. Alleged insurrectionist Guy Reffitt was arrested three weeks after the January 6 Capitol riot and faces five federal charges. The FBI seized his laptop, which was password-protected. However, prosecutors said it could be unlocked using Reffitt&#8217;s face. The government used a &#8220;loophole in the Fifth Amendment,&#8221; TechCrunch&#8217;s Zack Whittaker writes, to compel the use of biometrics to open a Windows laptop.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Kicking off our startup news today, make sure you check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/one-of-nigerias-high-profile-angel-investors-is-launching-a-fund-for-african-startups/">this profile of Olumide Soyombo</a>, a Nigerian angel investor who just put together a new fund. Soyombo’s brand-new firm, which he’s dubbed Voltron Capital, intends to invest all over Africa. It’s a potentially huge market for startups and venture capital, so expect more stories like this. How did it come to be? We’re sure that the check that Soyombo wrote to PayStack before Stripe bought it had something to do with it.</p>
<p>As we head into our regular digest of recent funding rounds, one startup sector that is <em>not</em> struggling to attract capital is facial recognition. Sure, you probably find it creepy that companies and agencies are tracking your face without your consent, but that isn’t stopping the financial class from pumping funds into the companies that comprise the facial recognition market. Zack Whittaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/facial-recognition-flush-with-cash/">has the story here</a>.</p>

<h2>Data-driven iteration helped China’s Genki Forest become a $6B beverage giant in 5 years</h2>
<p>Many Extra Crunch readers will not have heard of China&#8217;s fastest-growing bottled beverage company: Genki Forest is a direct-to-consumer startup that started selling its sodas, milk teas and other products just five years ago.</p>
<p>Today, its products are available in 40 countries and the company hopes to earn $1.2 billion in 2021. After closing its latest funding round, Genki Forest is valued at $6 billion.</p>
<p>Industry watchers frequently compare the upstart to giants like PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, but founder Binsen Tang comes from a tech background, having funded ELEX Technology, a social gaming company that found success internationally.</p>
<p>“China doesn’t need any more good platforms,” Tang told his team in 2015, “but it does need good products.”</p>
<p>Leveraging China&#8217;s robust distribution network, lighting-fast manufacturing capabilities and a vast pool of data that enables holistic digitization, Genki Forest sells more than 30% of its products online.</p>
<p>“Everything feels right about the company,&#8221; said VC investor Anna Fang. &#8220;The space, the founder, the products and the back end … they exemplify the new Chinese consumer brand.“</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reusable rocket startup iRocket has entered into a new partnership with NASA in its quest to reach commercialization in just two years.</p>
<p>The partnership will give iRocket access to testing facilities and engineering support, chiefly at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The company is hoping that it will conduct its first rocket engine test — an on-the-ground engine firing test — at the Huntsville site in September.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irocketusa.com/">iRocket</a> is earmarking $50 million over the next five years for the testing and development of its reusable engines and launch vehicle. Access to NASA facilities also means access to test stands — crucial infrastructure that provides controlled conditions for engine testing. iRocket will be able to conduct vacuum testing (which simulates space conditions) at the Glenn Research Center in Ohio and sea level testing at Marshall.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re engaged in very intimate discussions, all the way at the center level, at Marshall Space Flight Center,” iRocket CEO Asad Malik said in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The engines in question will eventually power iRocket’s inaugural Shockwave launch vehicles, fully reusable, autonomous small launchers capable of carrying payload with a maximum size of around 300 kg (661 lbs.) and 1,500 kg (around 3,300 lbs.). Manufactured via 3D printing, the engines will be powered by methane and liquid oxygen. “Methane is going to be the fuel of choice for deep space missions,” Malik said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qlXd6b9kJb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/ny-based-autonomous-reusable-rocket-startup-lands-air-force-contract/">NY-based autonomous reusable rocket startup lands Air Force contract</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;NY-based autonomous reusable rocket startup lands Air Force contract&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/ny-based-autonomous-reusable-rocket-startup-lands-air-force-contract/embed/#?secret=qlXd6b9kJb" data-secret="qlXd6b9kJb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The New York-based startup is also aiming to make the engines hypersonic capable, an ambitious goal. But iRocket has ambitious plans. Malik wants to turn the company into the premier supplier for both reusable rocket engines and the rockets themselves. Because it’s designing both rocket stages to be reusable as well — a striking difference between it and other rocket developers — Malik said the company could one day not only launch satellites and cargo missions, but also clear space junk or retrieve experiments for biotech companies.</p>
<p>Malik pointed out that the sale of Aerojet Rocketdyne to Lockheed Martin — which is still under review by the Federal Trade Commission — is going to leave a gap in the market. “That’s going to open up the U.S. without an independent rocket supplier at a time when Congress is really pushing hard for us to move away from foreign-bought parts,” he said. “So it’s an opportunity for us to work with the government, the Pentagon, NASA and other partners to develop this next-generation space propulsion capability that we need.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22">reported</a> Monday an eye-popping $1.14 billion in net income in the second quarter, results that blew past analyst expectations and marked the first time the company&#8217;s quarterly profit (on a GAAP basis) has passed the three-comma threshold. The results pushed shares up more than 2.2% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Tesla was able to beat expectations and log its eighth straight quarter of profitability even as it grappled with supply chain challenges and losses stemming from its bitcoin investment. Operating income was $1.3 billion, which increased year over year from $327 million, due to volume growth and cost reduction, the company said. Those positive results were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, supply chain challenges, lower regulatory credit revenue and the aforementioned bitcoin-related impairment of $23 million.</p>
<p>Supply chain challenges, notably the global shortage of semiconductor chips and congestion at ports, were two factors that affected its business in the second quarter. Tesla noted that it will continue to impact operations and its rate of delivery growth in 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;With global vehicle demand at record levels, component supply will have a strong influence on the rate of our delivery growth for the rest of this year,&#8221; the company said in its shareholder deck released Monday.</p>
<p>Tesla reported revenue of $11.96 billion, a nearly 100% increase from the $6.04 billion it generated in the second quarter of 2020. Revenue in the second quarter was also higher than last quarter&#8217;s total of $10.39 billion. Analysts surveyed by Factset estimated $11.4 billion in revenue and $600 million in profit.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s automotive revenue was $10.2 billion in the second quarter. Notably, only $354 million of that automotive revenue came from the sale of regulatory credits, 17% lower than last quarter and the lowest in the past four quarters. Meanwhile, Tesla&#8217;s automotive gross margins popped to 28.4%, a historic high for the metric.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s Q2 net income of $1.14 billion compared favorably with the $104 million worth net income in the same period last year, a gain just shy of 1,000%. That record-setting number is nearly three times more its Q1 2021 net income of $438 million. Tesla’s adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $2.24 billion in the quarter, up from $1.21 billion in the same year-ago period, a gain of roughly 100%.</p>
<p>Quarter-end cash and cash equivalents decreased to $16.2 billion in the second quarter, according to Tesla, which said that decrease was driven mainly by net debt and finance lease repayments of $1.6 billion, partially offset by free cash flow of $619 million.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Tesla reported its produced 206,421 vehicles in the second quarter. Of those, the company delivered 201,250 vehicles, nearly 9% more than the first quarter of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In May, the neighborhood crime-watch app Citizen <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dpyw/inside-crime-app-citizen-vigilante">offered its user base $30,000</a> to track down a suspected arsonist on live video, only to discover that they&#8217;d sent a mob of civilians after the wrong guy. Now, Citizen is covertly hiring journalists to <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/25/citizen-pays-new-yorkers-25-an-hour-to-livestream-crime-scenes/?utm_source=twitter_sitebuttons&amp;utm_medium=site%20buttons&amp;utm_campaign=site%20buttons">livestream on the app at crime scenes</a> for $25 per hour through third-party websites. I&#8217;m tired.</p>
<p>When Citizen first hit the App Store in 2016, it was called Vigilante — it marketed itself as a platform to <a href="https://citizen-app.medium.com/vigilante-manifesto-e665696a4ebb#.g2di4nexy">fight injustice with transparency</a>, which might sound good in theory, but in practice, it deliberately encouraged users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/controversial-crime-reporting-app-vigilante-banned-from-app-store">seek out crime scenes</a> to report them. Vigilante was removed from the App Store for violating a clause in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">Apple&#8217;s App Developer Review Guidelines</a> that an app shouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;likely to cause physical harm from its use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Surely, this would be the end for the nascent platform. But like a cockroach after an apocalypse, the app chugged on. It rebranded itself as Citizen, added disclaimers that no one should interfere with a crime scene, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/banned-crime-reporting-app-vigilante-returns-as-citizen-says-its-report-incident-feature-will-be-pulled/?_ga=2.175516256.336873417.1550176258-1373501013.1516818895">reentered the App Store</a>, and continued to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/citizen-app-crime-sequoia-san-francisco-12-million-series-a/">raise VC funding</a>. Now, the app is like a crowd-sourced crime blotter — as its App Store page says, &#8220;Citizen may notify you of a crime in progress before the police have responded.&#8221; But this level of hypervigilance can <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/justinbrannan/nyc-brooklyn-safe-citizen-app-freakout">fuel panic</a>, rather than make people feel safe — not to mention that user-reported crime incidents might be incorrect at best, and racist at worst. The app pulls data from 911 calls, but not all information in those dispatches are verified, which can be cause for false concern.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>But Citizen can only function if it has enough of a user base, and its attempts to corral civilians to use the app have gotten more and more desperate. According to SensorTower, the app hit a monthly download high in June 2020, in the wake of widespread Black Lives Matter protests. (So, as the country protested police brutality, 677,000 people responded by downloading a policing app). But the following month, just 207,000 people downloaded the app. Since then, growth has been pretty stagnant — 292,000 people downloaded Citizen in March 2020, and 283,000 people downloaded it in March 2021.</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/citizen-app-landon/">the Daily Dot reported</a> that one specific user named &#8220;Landon&#8221; was livestreaming from multiple crime scenes in one day, attempting to interview witnesses and first responders — given how often he seemed to stumble upon these crime scenes, it seemed unlikely that he was just an enthusiastic app user. Yesterday, the New York Post reported on another user named &#8220;Chris&#8221; who livestreamed on Citizen from <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/25/citizen-pays-new-yorkers-25-an-hour-to-livestream-crime-scenes/?utm_source=twitter_sitebuttons&amp;utm_medium=site%20buttons&amp;utm_campaign=site%20buttons">six emergencies in one day</a>. Citizen confirmed that both Landon and Chris were working for the app as members of its Street Team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Citizen has teams in place in some of the cities where the app is available to demonstrate how the platform works, and to model responsible broadcasting practices in situations when events are unfolding in real time. We believe these teams will ultimately help guide our users on how to broadcast in an effective, helpful and safe way,&#8221; a Citizen spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Citizen has had Street Teams since the app&#8217;s launch; a spokesperson said that they&#8217;ve never tried to hide this. But these jobs are not listed on the Citizen website. Instead, they&#8217;re listed by a third-party recruiter called Flyover Entertainment on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210722213718/https://www.journalismjobs.com/1666655-field-reporter--street-team-lead-flyover-entertainment">JournalismJobs board</a> without mention of Citizen. An NYU Journalism website shared <a href="https://careerservices.nyujournalism.org/job/2021-07-16/field-reporter-street-team-leads/">a similar listing</a>, which did include the Citizen name. Citizen confirmed to TechCrunch that both of these listings are for the app&#8217;s Street Team. Citizen pays $250 per day for a 10-hour shift in LA, and $200 per day for an 8-hour shift in NYC, which comes out to $25 per hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Broadcast journalists have experience in broadcasting safely and responsibly. This is a requisite for our Street Team members,&#8221; said the Citizen spokesperson. When asked why these jobs were posted on third-party job boards, but not Citizen&#8217;s own website, the spokesperson reiterated that it was because Citizen specifically wanted to find journalists. However, it could presumably also find journalists on its own website.</p>
<p>Surveillance state vigilantism concerns aside, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/local-news-is-dying-and-americans-have-no-idea/585772/">local news is dying</a>, and Citizen is not built to be a substitute for neighborhood journalism. Sure, local newspapers report on crime too, and it&#8217;s not as though Citizen is doing something unprecedented by sending reporters to scope out crime scenes. But there&#8217;s a difference between reporting news and livestreaming from a crime scene on a surveillance app that only discloses who is a paid worker and who is an average civilian when directly asked. For an app that is modeled on &#8220;<a href="https://citizen.com/">increasing transparency</a>,&#8221; these covert job postings don&#8217;t feel so transparent. Plus, for an infrequent freelance gig with no benefits or paid time off that requires established broadcasting skills, $25 per hour is a pretty bad rate.</p>
<p>Now, Citizen&#8217;s latest attempt at growth is a paid service for $19.99 per month called Protect, which lets users send their location and a livestream from their camera to a Protect Agent. Citizen says its Protect Agents include former law enforcement officers and 911 operators, who can send an &#8220;<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dpyw/inside-crime-app-citizen-vigilante">instant emergency response</a>&#8221; in case of emergency. This sort of seems like paying to get a personal 911 operator, which, again, feels like a poor alternative to policing, an already poor system.</p>
<p>Maybe Silicon Valley-bred tech companies aren&#8217;t the answer to the United States&#8217; centuries-long crises of police brutality, racial profiling and surveillance. Maybe a better way to reduce crime is to ensure that all people have access to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/01/03/new-evidence-that-access-to-health-care-reduces-crime/">health care</a>, <a href="https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/53294/theeffectsofunemploymentoncimerates.pdf">jobs</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/15/homes/rent-affordability-minimum-wage/index.html">affordable housing</a>. Who knows!</p>
