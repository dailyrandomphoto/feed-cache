										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bryte.com">Bryte</a> today announced $24M in Series A funding led by ARCHina Capital. This comes as the company moves away from selling its $8,000 mattress direct to consumers and instead is working with partners who would utilize Bryte&#8217;s technology in their mattresses.</p>
<p>Bryte says several deals are in the works.</p>
<p>According to the company, this pivot has always been part of the plan. They feel that through licensing, they can better accomplish the company&#8217;s goal of improving people&#8217;s sleep experience. Bryte doesn&#8217;t want to become another direct to consumer brand, but rather the underlying technology in some of the best mattresses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s original product is still available to consumers. Called the Restorative Bed, the mattress has built-in sensors and 100 computer-controlled pneumatic coils that work with the platform as it learns the owners&#8217; sleeping patterns and adjusts to best suit them &#8212; for both sleepers. Bryte says its technology enables better sleep patterns by adjusting the mattress through monitoring temperature, pressure points, and room environment.</p>
<p>The user selects several starting points for the mattress system. The system uses micro-adjustments to fine-tune the system to the sleeper. Each night&#8217;s sleep provides the mattress with more data points, which it uses to continually adjust the settings. The company says the greatest gains happen within 2-4 weeks and tend to reach an optimal level within 90 days.</p>
<p>With this funding round, the company is adding serious cash to its mission.</p>
<p>ARCHina Capital lead the $24M Series A funding round, with ARCHina&#8217;s Co-Founder Amy Huang joining Bryte&#8217;s board. The round also included investors John Warnock, co-founder of Adobe, and Dave Mooring, former President of Rambus.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last June, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/apple-commits-100m-to-its-new-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative/">committed $100 million</a> to a Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI). Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, is leading the initiative. Today, Apple is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/apple-launches-major-new-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative-projects-to-challenge-systemic-racism-advance-racial-equity-nationwide/">sharing</a> some of its work as part of the initiative.</p>
<p>“We’re launching REJI’s latest initiatives with partners across a broad range of industries and backgrounds — from students to teachers, developers to entrepreneurs, and community organizers to justice advocates — working together to empower communities that have borne the brunt of racism and discrimination for far too long. We are honored to help bring this vision to bear, and to match our words and actions to the values of equity and inclusion we have always prized at Apple,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company will contribute $25 million to the <a href="https://propelcenter.org">Propel Center</a>, an innovation and leaning hub for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. It is going to be both a virtual platform and a physical campus in the Atlanta University Center. Apple is sharing some early renderings of the new building (see above and below).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Students will be able to follow different educational tracks focused on artificial intelligence, agricultural technologies, social justice, entertainment, app development, augmented reality, design and create arts and entrepreneurship. This isn’t just a monetary investment for Apple as employees will help develop curricula and provide mentorship as well. There will be internship opportunities for students.</p>
<p>In Downtown Detroit, the company will also open an Apple Developer Academy focused on young Black entrepreneurs. This is a collaborative effort with Michigan State University. It’ll be open to all learners across Detroit and teach valuable skills for entrepreneurs, creators and coders.</p>
<p>There will be two programs. A 30-day introductory program will help you learn more about app economy careers. And if you’re willing to dive deeper, there’s an intensive 10- to 12-month program. Apple is trying to reach 1,000 students per year with these two programs.</p>
<p>The third effort is focused on investment opportunities for Black and Brown entrepreneurs. Apple will invest $10 million with <a href="https://harlem.capital">Harlem Capital</a>, a VC firm based in New York. There will be more collaboration between Harlem Capital and Apple down the road.</p>
<p>Apple is also investing $25 million in Siebert Williams Shank’s Clear Vision Impact Fund. Finally, Apple is making a contribution to The King Center.</p>
<p>As you can see, Apple’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative is an on-going effort that requires evaluating new opportunities constantly. The company isn’t just trying to give money to everyone. It is evaluating each opportunity individually to find the best collaboration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A wave of organizations &#8212; propelled by global Covid-19 pandemic circumstances &#8212; are moving their commercial and financial interactions online, and today one of the big players helping to enable that shift is announcing a significant round of growth funding to expand the tools and services that provides to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rapyd.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapyd</a>, which provides an API-based &#8220;fintech-as-a-service&#8221; platform covering payments, banking services, fraud protection and more, has raised $300 million, funding that CEO and co-founder Arik Shtilman said in an interview will be used to expand its team, build out more technology (next up: expanded fraud ID services and a wider marketplace), and to make selected acquisitions.</p>
<p>Rapyd&#8217;s customer base now numbers about 5,000 businesses, which includes marketplaces (labor marketplaces, and marketplaces for goods), e-commerce businesses, other kinds of lenders, and any business that might want to incorporate transactions or new financial services into their wider offerings. Shtilman said that at the moment, Rapyd is seeing its strongest growth yet, onboarding about 500 new customers each week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is coming at a $2.5 billion post-money valuation, Shtilman confirmed. (For some context on that, Rapyd was last valued at $1.2 billion in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/rapyd-which-offers-fintech-as-a-service-via-a-single-api-adds-20m-more-to-its-coffers-at-a-1-2b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 2019</a>.)</p>
<p>The round is a Series D and is being led by prolific growth-round VC Coatue, with Spark Capital, Avid Ventures, FJ Labs, and Latitude (all new backers) and General Catalyst, Oak FT, Tiger Global, Target Global, Durable Capital, Tal Capital, and Entrée Capital (all previous backers) also participating. Other past investors, notably, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/13/rapyd-nabs-40m-led-by-stripe-and-gc-for-fintech-as-a-service-a-single-api-for-payments-money-transfer-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">include another major player in the world of API-based financial services, Stripe</a>.</p>
<p>As with other companies in categories that have seen a huge surge of demand in the last year, financial services &#8212; and in particular those providing services to be able to carry out transactions online via the internet or phone &#8212; have proven to be some of the most mandatory and most used. (And no wonder, since bills still need paying, food and other items still need to be purchased, loans very much still need to be made, and so on.)</p>
<p>Notably, this was what many call and &#8220;opportunistic&#8221; raise, made not to keep the lights on or to extend runway, but because they money was being offered at good terms, and there were smart places where it could be put to use to grow the business.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn’t plan to raise money when we raised this round, but when the pandemic came in our business started to boom,&#8221; Shtilman said. &#8220;We were approached by existing investors to scale beyond our original business plans after we completed our 2021 growth plans in three months in 2020. So we thought the timing was probably right for world domination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shtilman was partly (only partly) joking &#8212; he has a sort of deadpan delivery that I can&#8217;t quite capture here &#8212; but it&#8217;s a far cry from the startup&#8217;s early days, when &#8220;no one wanted to invest because e<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">veryone thought it would be too hard to execute. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Even our early investors advised us to focus on a smaller concept. But we thought building globally doesn’t work to start small it’s against the idea. Over the last several years the need to explain and what we do almost vanished.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The challenge (and opportunity) that Rapyd identified back in 2017 when it first opened for business is that the global commerce and financial markets are very highly fragmented: consumers and businesses in individual markets have their own preferred payment methods and demands, regulations differ, and the key companies involved vary from country to country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, APIs have long been a great instrument for integration and connection: using a few lines of code &#8212; and presuming your own services are built on code too &#8212; you can knit together services, and bring in commoditized functionality that would take ages to build from the ground up, cutting down the effort and work needed, to focus on making your core business more unique.</p>
<p>While companies like Stripe, Twilio and many others had identified the opportunity of leveraging APIs to scale out a world of functionality to a wider set of would-be customers, what Rapyd really identified and built out was the idea of loading not just one, two, or three services, but hundreds (even thousands) of features into that proposition. The idea is smart and, as Shtilman noted, very much in keeping with the economies of scale that exist in e-commerce and fintech: individual transactions are at the end of the day very incremental, so services that bring many together can finally start to conceive of interesting returns.</p>
<p>That, of course, is not just something Rapyd has identified and run with. That is to say, the company has a number of competitors now in the market. Just last week, Germany-based Mambu, which also provides an API-based suite of services (7,000 at last count) under the idea of &#8220;banking as a service&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mambu-raises-135m-at-a-2b-valuation-for-an-saas-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised $135 million at a valuation of over $2 billion</a>. <a href="http://stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe</a>, a backer of Rapyd, also has continued to expand and add in a number of services well beyond payments. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/thought-machine-nabs-83m-for-a-cloud-based-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thought Machine</a> also raised a big round last year; <a href="https://www.temenos.com/">Temenos</a> and Italy’s <a href="http://www.ederabs.com/">Edera</a> are also strong players here. And the field has so much opportunity that it&#8217;s even attracting a lot of newer entrants: witness <a href="http://unit.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unit</a>, another interesting player that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/unit-raises-18-6m-to-offer-banking-features-as-a-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">came out of stealth in the U.S. in December</a> with an interesting list of backers of its own.</p>
<p>&#8220;To build infrastructure doesn’t matter whether you are small mom and pop or something bigger, you need many things, and if you want to sell in more the one jurisdiction you need a lot of those services,&#8221; Shtilman noted about the need for scale and breadth in a fintech platform proposition. He&#8217;s also very sanguine about competition. &#8220;They have emerged like mushrooms after the rain. But if you don’t have competition it means you don’t have a business so this is good. It means there is a lot of demand. But for now we are the market leader. We think we will become the AWS of this space.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where investors like Coatue are also landing for now.</p>
<p>“The payment landscape varies dramatically across countries. A company doing business globally might need to accept hundreds of local payment methods. Rapyd’s API, which abstracts away this complexity, is currently powering what we think are many of the world’s most exciting companies,” said Kris Fredrickson, Managing Partner at Coatue, in a statement. “We are honored to partner with Arik and team for the next phase of the Rapyd journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube has been the slowest of the big social media platforms to react to the threat of letting president Trump continue to use its platform as a megaphone to whip up insurrection in the wake of the attack on the US capital last week. But it&#8217;s now applied a temporary upload ban.</p>
<p>In a short <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1349205689395245056">Twitter thread</a> today, the Google-owned service said it had removed new content uploaded to Trump&#8217;s YouTube channel &#8220;in light of concerns about the ongoing potential violence&#8221;.</p>
<p>It also said it&#8217;s applied a first strike &#8212; triggering a temporary upload ban for at least seven days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the time of writing the verified Donald J Trump YouTube channel has some 2.78M subscribers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the ongoing concerns about violence, we will also be indefinitely disabling comments on President Trump&#8217;s channel, as we&#8217;ve done to other channels where there are safety concerns found in the comments section,&#8221; YouTube adds.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/ Given the ongoing concerns about violence, we will also be indefinitely disabling comments on President Trump’s channel, as we’ve done to other channels where there are safety concerns found in the comments section. <a href="https://t.co/1aBENHGU5z">https://t.co/1aBENHGU5z</a></p>
<p>&mdash; YouTubeInsider (@YouTubeInsider) <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1349205689395245056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>We reached out to YouTube with questions about the content that was removed and how it will determine whether to extend the ban on Trump&#8217;s ability to post to its platform beyond seven days.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman confirmed content that was uploaded to the channel on January 12 had been taken down for violating its policies on inciting violence, with the platform saying it perceiving an increased risk of violence in light of recent events and due to earlier remarks by Trump.</p>
<p>She did not confirm the specific content of the video that triggered the takedown and strike.</p>
<p>According to YouTube, platform is applying its standard &#8216;three strikes&#8217; policy &#8212; whereby, within a 90 day period, if a channel receives three strikes it gets permanently suspended. Under this policy a first strike earns around a week&#8217;s suspension, a second strike earns around two weeks and a third strike triggers a termination of the channel.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAql2DyGU2un1Ei2nMYsqOA">Trump&#8217;s official YouTube channel</a> has a series of recent uploads &#8212; including five clips from a speech he gave at the Mexican border wall, where he lauded &#8220;successful&#8221; completion of the pledge during the 2016 election campaign to &#8216;build the wall&#8217;.</p>
<p>In one of these videos, entitled &#8220;President Trump addresses the events of last week&#8221;, Trump characterizes supporters who attacked the US capital as a &#8220;mob&#8221; &#8212; and claims his administration &#8220;believes in the rule of law, not in violence or rioting&#8221; &#8212; before segueing into a series of rambling comments about the pandemic and vaccine development.</p>
<p>The clip ends with an entreaty by Trump for &#8220;our nation to heal&#8221;, for &#8220;peace and for calm&#8221;, and for respect for law enforcement &#8212; with the president claiming people who work in law enforcement form the backbone of the &#8220;MAGA agenda&#8221;.</p>
<p>An earlier clip of Trump speaking to reporters before he left for the tour of the border wall is also still viewable on the channel.</p>
<p>In it the president attacks the process to impeach him a second time as &#8220;a continuation of the greatest witch-hunt in the history of politics&#8221;. Here Trump name-checks Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer &#8212; in what sounds like a veiled but targeted threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;[For them] to continue on this path, I think it&#8217;s causing tremendous danger to our country and it&#8217;s causing tremendous anger,&#8221; he says, before tossing a final caveat at reporters that &#8220;I want no violence&#8221;. (But, well, if you have to add such a disclaimer what does that say about the sentiments you know you&#8217;re whipping up?)</p>

<p>While YouTube has opted for a temporary freeze on Trump&#8217;s megaphone, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">Twitter banned the president for good</a> last week after one too many violations of its civic integrity policy.</p>
<p>Facebook has also imposed what it describes as an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">&#8220;indefinite&#8221; suspension</a> &#8212; leaving open the possibility that it could in future restore Trump&#8217;s ability to use its tools to raise hell.</p>
<p>Up to now, YouTube has managed to avoid being the primary target of ire for those criticizing social media platforms for providing Trump with a carve out from their rules of conduct and a mainstream platform to abuse, bully, lie and (most recently) whip up insurrection.</p>
<p>However the temporary freeze on his account comes after civil rights groups had threatened to organize an advertiser boycott of its platform.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-google/exclusive-civil-rights-groups-demand-google-remove-trumps-youtube-channel-idUSL1N2JN3A3">Reuters</a>, the Stop Hate for Profit (SHP) campaign &#8212; which previously led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/facebook-instagram-rei-patagonia-north-face-brands-join-stophateforprofit-boycott/">major advertisers boycott of Facebook last summer</a> &#8212; had demanded that YouTube take down Trump’s verified channel.</p>
<p>“If YouTube does not agree with us and join the other platforms in banning Trump, we’re going to go to the advertisers,&#8221; one of SHP&#8217;s organizers, Jim Steyer, told the news agency.</p>
<p>In its official comments about the enforcement action against president Trump, YouTube makes no mention of any concern about ramifications from its own advertisers. Though, in recent years, it has faced some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/att-verizon-boycott-google-ads/">earlier boycotts</a> from advertisers over hateful and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/21/after-youtube-boycott-google-pulls-ads-from-more-types-of-offensive-content/">offensive content</a>.</p>
<p>In background remarks to reporters, YouTube also claims it consistently enforces its policies, regardless of who owns the channel &#8212; and says it makes no exceptions for public figures. However the platform has<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> been known to reverse a three strike termination &#8212; recently </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/youtube-reverses-ban-on-uks-talkradio-for-covid-19-policy-breaches/">reinstating the channel of UK broadcaster TalkRadio</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, for example, after it received a third strike related to coronavirus misinformation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In that case the channel&#8217;s reinstatement was reported to have followed an intervention by TalkRadio&#8217;s owner News Corp&#8217;s chairman, Rupert Murdoch. UK ministers had also defended the channel&#8217;s right to debate the merits of government policy.</span></p>
<p>In Trump&#8217;s case there are a dwindling number of (GOP) politicians willing to ride to his defense in light of the shocking events in Washington last week and continued violent threats being made online by his supporters.</p>
<p>However concern about the massive market power of tech platforms &#8212; meaning they are in a position to be able to take unilateral action and shut down the US president&#8217;s ability to broadcast to millions of people &#8212; is far more widespread.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Germany&#8217;s chancellor, Angela Merkel, called Twitter&#8217;s ban on Trump &#8220;problematic&#8221;, while lawmakers elsewhere in Europe have said it must lead to regulatory consequences for big tech.</p>
<p>So whatever his wider legacy, Trump certainly looks set to have a lasting policy impact on the tech giants he is now busy railing at for putting him on mute.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok announced today it&#8217;s making changes to its app to make the experience safer for younger users. The company will now set the accounts for users ages 13 to 15 to private by default, as well as tighten other controls for all users under 18, in terms of how they can interact with other users and TikTok content itself. TikTok is also announcing a partnership with nonprofit <a href="https://www.commonsensenetworks.com/">Common Sense Networks</a>, an education and advocacy group that helps parents and educators navigate today&#8217;s media landscape, including children&#8217;s use of technology.</p>
<p>The partnership will see Common Sense Networks working with TikTok to provide additional guidance on the appropriateness of its content for users under 13.</p>
<p>The social video app in 2019 had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/musical-ly-tiktok-fined-5-7m-by-ftc-for-violating-childrens-privacy-laws-will-update-app-with-age-gate/">fined $5.7 million by the Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) for violating U.S. children&#8217;s privacy laws. The FTC had begun looking into the app back when it was known as Musical.ly. The earlier version, prior to its acquisition by ByteDance, had collected personal information for children under 13 without parents&#8217; consent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a result of that ruling, TikTok created a new, legally compliant experience for younger users in the U.S. with age-appropriate content and no ability to publish videos.</p>
<p>Now, TikTok will restrict the experience for other minors using the app who are over 13, too.</p>
<p>For children ages 13 to 15, accounts will be set to private by default and TikTok will turn the setting &#8220;Suggest your account to others&#8221; to Off. This will allow users&#8217; videos to only be seen by those they approve as a follower and limits their account from being recommended to others elsewhere in the app.</p>
<p>Commenting controls are also being locked down for these users.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll now be able to choose between &#8220;Friends&#8221; or &#8220;No One&#8221; in terms of who can comment on their videos, and the &#8220;Everyone&#8221; option will be removed. The Dueting and Stitching features will also be removed, which limits how these younger users can engage with other TikTok users and their content. They won&#8217;t be able to make their videos downloadable either.</p>
<p>For those ages 16 to 17, the default setting for Duet and Stitch will be set to &#8220;Friends,&#8221; and they&#8217;ll only be able to download videos created by users 16 and over as a result of the lockdowns for younger users. Downloads for their own videos will also be set to Off by default, but they can enable this, if they choose.</p>
<p>TiTok had already restricted younger users&#8217; accounts before today in various ways, including not only through the under-13 age gated experience, but also by <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-introduces-family-pairing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-introduces-family-pairing&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610579819115000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRgT1gRjbUAcP9h_PQply7b0LdrQ">restricting direct messaging</a> and hosting live streams to accounts 16 and over, and restricting<a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/updating-our-gifting-policies"> virtual gifts</a> to users over 18. Parents additionally have had the option to control their child&#8217;s experience through the <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/supporting-youth-and-families-on-tiktok">Family Pairing</a> feature, which offers parental controls and screen time limits, among other things.</p>
<p>Of course, any of these restrictions can be worked around for those who lie about their age upon sign-up. But it&#8217;s still fairly unusual for a large social network to do more than look the other way when it knows that minors are on its app.</p>
<p>In TikTok&#8217;s case, however, it has a large underage user base &#8212; some <a href="https://blog.globalwebindex.com/trends/tiktok-music-social-media/">estimates</a> had said that 41% of TikTok is between ages 16 and 24. But in the U.S., TikTok has attracted a particularly large teenage userbase. The company <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiktok-cfius-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-opens-national-security-investigation-into-tiktok-sources-idUSKBN1XB4IL">said in 2020 that 60%</a> of its 26.5 million monthly active users in the U.S. were between 16 and 24. Even some of TikTok&#8217;s biggest stars, like Charli D&#8217;Amelio, are still just teenagers.</p>
<p>The attention to minor safety and parental controls gathered TikTok praise from notable youth safety experts, which the company also shared.</p>
<p>Today, TikTok is <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/">touting praise</a> it&#8217;s received from the National PTA, ConnectSafely, NCMEC, Family Online Safety Institute, and WeProtect Global Alliance. The groups believe the changes will help teens be able to use the app more safely, responsibility, and without the further risk of exploitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn’t be more pleased about partnering with TikTok to develop better content experiences for users under the age of 13,&#8221; added Eric Berger, CEO of Common Sense Networks, in reference to his organization&#8217;s partnership with the social video platfrom. &#8220;At Common Sense Networks, we see this engagement as an opportunity to double down on our commitment to elevate the quality of children’s digital media so that age-appropriate content is the rule in our industry and not the exception,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The changes will roll out starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is doubling down on one of the biggest strengths of Prime Video streaming service: Aggressive pricing.</p>
<p>The e-commerce giant on Wednesday launched Prime Video Mobile Edition, an even more affordable tier of the on-demand video streaming service &#8212; now also bundling some mobile data.</p>
<p>Prime Video Mobile Edition, for which Amazon has partnered with Indian telecom network Airtel, will feature 28-day mobile-only, single-user, standard definition (SD) access to customers in India for Rs 89 ($1.22). This tier will include 6GB of mobile data that customers can consume during the subscription period. There&#8217;s also a slightly expensive plan for Prime Video Mobile Edition that will charge customers Rs 299 but will offer 1.5GB mobile data for each day of the subscription. To anyone who subscribes to Prime Video Mobile Edition, Amazon says it will pick the tab for the first month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2095627" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095627" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2095627 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Prime-Video-Mobile-Edition-Plans-v1-1.jpg" alt="" width="470" height="705" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Prime-Video-Mobile-Edition-Plans-v1-1.jpg 470w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Prime-Video-Mobile-Edition-Plans-v1-1.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Prime-Video-Mobile-Edition-Plans-v1-1.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Prime-Video-Mobile-Edition-Plans-v1-1.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Prime-Video-Mobile-Edition-Plans-v1-1.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095627" class="wp-caption-text">Amazon Prime subscription costs $1.7 a month in India and includes access to Prime Video and Prime Music.</p></div></p>
<p>The new Prime Video plan is currently only available in India. Its launch comes two years after Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/netflix-launches-rs-199-2-8-mobile-only-monthly-plan-in-india/">unveiled a similar plan in India</a>.</p>
<p>Affordable pricing is key for on-demand steaming services that are looking to make inroads in India, the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. Even as more than 600 million users are online in the country today, only a fraction of them currently pay to access digital subscriptions. In a recent report to clients, analysts at Goldman Sachs estimated that gaming, and video streaming market in India could clock as much as $5 billion in gross value transactions by March 2025.</p>
<p>“India is one of our fastest growing territories in the world with very high engagement rates. Buoyed by this response, we want to double-down by offering our much-loved entertainment content to an even larger base of Indian customers. Given high mobile broadband penetration in the country, the mobile phone has become one of the most widely used streaming devices,” said Jay Marine, Vice President, Amazon Prime Video Worldwide, in a statement.</p>
<p>Airtel, the second largest telecom operator in India, is the first roll-out partner for Prime Video Mobile Edition, said Sameer Batra, Director, Mobile Business Development at Amazon, suggesting that the company may ink similar deals with other telecom operators in the country as it looks to expand the &#8220;reach of our service to the entire pre-paid customer base in India.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nearly every on-demand video streaming service in India, including Netflix and Disney+ Hotstar, maintain various partnerships with local telecom operators and satellite TV providers to reach more users in the country. Amazon did not explicitly say when or if it plans to extend Prime Video Mobile Edition outside of India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.winnoz.com/">Winnoz</a>’s Haiim is designed to make collecting blood from fingertips easier, increasing the volume drawn so it can be used for more types of tests. The New Taipei City, Taiwan-based company’s vacuum-assisted device can collect up to 150 to 500 microliters of blood from a finger prick, depending on the person, in about two minutes.</p>
<p>Winnoz is <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/7d1a5eb1-a320-4085-955d-fa5f0cec3119?index=1">currently presenting</a> Haiim and eGGi, its molecular detection device that supports isothermal DNA/RNA amplification methods, at CES’ Taiwan Tech Arena pavilion, with the goal of finding new partners and investors.</p>
<p>Haiim was inspired by founder and chief executive officer Joses Hsiung’s childhood memories of watching his mother go into clinics for regular blood testing. Since his mother’s veins were hard to see, it often took multiple punctures for phlebotomists to draw enough blood. Eventually, her veins collapsed. Hsiung began working on the device to maximize the amount of blood that can be taken from finger pricks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While finger blood draws are typically used for tests that require less than 10 microliters of blood, like glucose monitoring or cholesterol panel, Haiim can draw enough for ones that need a larger volume, potentially helping patients avoid venipuncture blood draws.</p>
<p>The device consists of two parts, the main unit and single-use cartridges that stores the blood until it is tested. Since many clinics and hospitals are understaffed, it is designed so personnel can start using it with less training than traditional blood collection methods. Haiim was approved by the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration in 2019 and is intended for use by health care organizations, clinics and hospitals.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not disclosing how much it&#8217;s shelling out for NexTravel, which has some 700 customers globally and has processed around 300,000 trips since being founded back in 2013, but says the deal is its largest acquisition to date &#8212; with the aim of beefing up its business in the US. (Also today it&#8217;s announcing a partnership with Southwest Airlines that plugs a key gap in its US offering.)</p>
<p>The US has always been a top five market for TravelPerk, per<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> CEO and co-founder, Avi Meir, but after the NexTravel acquisition it becomes its largest market.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;US customers, US know-how, [US-based] team,&#8221; he said, listing the drivers for the acquisition. &#8220;They&#8217;ve built an amazing product. It&#8217;s a Y Combinator company who started 2-3 years before us and they focused only or mostly on the US market so they have an expertise that is very complementary to what we&#8217;re doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meir confirmed NexTravel&#8217;s founders and team are joining TravelPerk as part of the deal. Existing customers include the likes of Yelp, Stripe and Harry’s.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a great company. I really think we have great execution and we got into the crisis with a much better cash position and COVID-19 is creating opportunities that didn&#8217;t exist before,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We had friendly competition and just the context of the situation was we were in a better position to acquire them vs them acquiring us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plan is to migrate users of the US product onto TravelPerk&#8217;s platform over time but Meir said the NexTravel team will continue to support the product for the foreseeable future while it works on understanding and plugging any functionality gaps with the aim of ensuring a smooth, eventual transition for NexTravel customers in the future.</p>
<p>The acquisition is only TravelPerk&#8217;s second after it picked up risk management startup Albatross last summer &#8212; underlining how the coronavirus crisis is retooling priorities for businesses in the travel sector.</p>
<p>Or at least those that have enough funding to see them through the revenue crunch. And Meir confirmed TravelPerk has its eye on more acquisition targets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in the process of talking with a few more [potential acquisitions],&#8221; he said, adding: &#8220;In a moment of crisis consolidation typically happens so I think it&#8217;s fair to expect more of this.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Three travel startups tell us how they&#8217;re responding to the coronavirus crisis&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/three-travel-startups-tell-us-how-theyre-responding-to-the-coronavirus-crisis/embed/#?secret=UHEGUlyzU3" data-secret="UHEGUlyzU3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While a couple of years ahead of TravelPerk in starting up a business travel booking business, NexTravel has raised considerably less over its run &#8212; pulling in circa $4.5M in funding, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nextravel">Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>The younger Spain-based startup, meanwhile, grew faster and has raised orders of magnitude more (~$134M to date) &#8212; including a $60M top-up to its Series C in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/18/on-a-growth-tear-work-trip-saas-travelperk-adds-60m-to-its-series-c/">2019</a> when it was reporting 2,000 customers globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just happen to be in Europe,&#8221; Meir told TechCrunch, discussing how his European startup is in a position to buy a US rival (when the reverse is all too often the case in tech) &#8212; and pointing to knowledge of how to localize as a key advantage<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span>&#8220;We were never targeting the Spanish market exclusively or not even the European market.</p>
<p>&#8220;To win in business travel, one of the paradoxes is you have to build a very localized product&#8230; So we never saw ourselves as a European business we just recognize that we have to really localize deeply in order to be successful anywhere. But we have to do it across the world. So this acquisition is just another step in localizing for the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;[The acquisition] will obviously drive a lot of product development, of commercial investments, of partnerships,&#8221; he added. &#8220;In a way we&#8217;re doing it knowing that it will force us to do more of the US &#8212; so it&#8217;s kind of a self-fulfilling prophesy &#8212; but it&#8217;s a $300BN business travel market so we should better make some moves around it.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the pandemic continuing to ravage much of the globe &#8212; including both the US and Europe &#8212; there&#8217;s likely to be considerably fewer billions of dollars on business travel value up for grabbed for a sizeable chunk of 2021. And Meir confirmed that TravelPerk isn&#8217;t expecting to see a revival in the market before the second half of this year.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he remains bullish that once vaccinations are rolled out to the most vulnerable groups in society business travellers will be on the move once again &#8212; predicting that Zoom fatigue and the boom in remote working will rekindle demand for face-to-face human contact.</p>
<p>&#8220;My best guess right now is everything converges to around the second half of this year &#8212; around May-June maybe &#8212; where seasonality should hopefully hit. Meaning we&#8217;ll see the same decline in hospitalizations and deaths as we saw last year. That&#8217;s my hope,&#8221; he predicted. &#8220;On top of that we have the vaccines&#8230; Within the next 4-5 months there is reason to expect that we&#8217;ll see [vaccine rollouts] accelerating and then everything converges. We just need the at risk population to be safe for the world to be open again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;ll be completely done with corona but it won&#8217;t be as deadly as it is now so we&#8217;ll be able to open up more and remove restrictions and see travel coming back again,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Pressed on whether businesses might not have adjusted to a new, &#8216;more digital&#8217; normal after 1.5 years of living with COVID-19 &#8212; having come to rely on a suite of videoconferencing and virtual meeting tools &#8212; Meir quashes the idea of a smaller business travel market replacing the pre-pandemic industry, predicting a &#8220;roaring &#8217;20s&#8221; revival for business travel instead, fuelled by &#8220;Zoom fatigue&#8221; and networking FOMO once social distancing restrictions can be lifted.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you still own any Zoom shares you should sell them!&#8221; he quipped, speaking via Zoom call (obviously). &#8220;This is going down from now. Everybody is tired of this. The Zoom fatigue is real. It creates a lot of mental health concerns, social isolation&#8230; Maslow&#8217;s Pyramid of Needs is still here, and it&#8217;s even stronger than ever, I think, because we realize how bad it is when we don&#8217;t meet people in real life. When everything has to be through this weird, proxy to human connection. The virus doesn&#8217;t change human nature. We still need to meet each other face to face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The first sales person who&#8217;s going to lose a sale because the competition went and took the customer to dinner and they wanted to do it via Zoom, they&#8217;re on a plane the next day. So competition will solve it &#8212; even if we put aside human nature,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I think we all recognize even more how much we need human connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>So even if some some &#8220;transactional meetings&#8221; do move permanently to Zoom, as Meir conceded &#8220;maybe&#8221; happens, he said they&#8217;re not the primary driver for the bulk of business travel anyway.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the pandemic will create new demand for business travel because of the boom in remote working creating ongoing need for distributed colleagues to travel to meet each other face to face, with Meir arguing that more flexible working is certainly here to stay.</p>
<p>&#8220;My team, like many other teams, used to be all in Barcelona in the same building &#8212; and now we allow them to work from anywhere in the world. Because why not? Many companies will stick to that I think,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have recognized that people like it, the employees like it and it&#8217;s cheaper, because you don&#8217;t have to have as much office real estate &#8212; and people are more productive and they&#8217;re happier and they have a better balance between their personal and work life.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this requires a new type of travel because&#8230; you have to bring [your team] together for a week of work together. So I think the small decline in business travel due to this one hour transactional call that you can move to Zoom will be compensated even more &#8212; increased by &#8212; this new way of working that requires a new type of business travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>While TravelPerk was fortunate enough to go into the pandemic well-capitalized, having topped up its Series C in 2019, investor interest in travel startups undoubtedly went on holiday for a considerable chunk of last year. But, again, Meir suggests, an uptick on that front.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need to raise any time soon &#8212; we have enough cash. The expectation is for the business to go back to growing year on year sometime in Q3, Q4 of this year,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;Having said that, what&#8217;s interesting &#8212; and I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m the only one &#8212; is we went from [being a fast-growing company] and you get a lot of inbound from investors and then COVID-19 hit and my inbox was empty for a while.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was pretty sad, pretty pathetic. And then the last few weeks &#8212; since the beginning of the school year &#8212; September/October, my inbox is not empty anymore. So there is some movement in the market. There&#8217;s a lot of money looking for a home &#8212; for good investments. And I think even in an industry which is suffering obviously, the good companies can raise at good terms right now. So I&#8217;m not looking to raise but I&#8217;m always open to the opportunity.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile adoption continued to grow in 2020, in part due to the market forces of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to App Annie&#8217;s annual &#8220;State of Mobile&#8221; industry report, mobile app downloads grew by 7% year-over-year to a record 218 billion in 2020. Meanwhile, consumer spending grew by 20% to also hit a new milestone of $143 billion, led by markets that included China, the United States, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Consumers also spent 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone, the report found.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2095420" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.30-PM.jpg?w=593" alt="" width="593" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.30-PM.jpg 1614w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.30-PM.jpg?resize=131,150 131w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.30-PM.jpg?resize=262,300 262w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.30-PM.jpg?resize=768,880 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.30-PM.jpg?resize=593,680 593w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.30-PM.jpg?resize=1340,1536 1340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.30-PM.jpg?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In another shift, app usage in the U.S. surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours on their mobile device.</p>
<p>The increase in time spent is a trend that&#8217;s not unique to the U.S., but can be seen across several other countries, including both developing mobile markets like Indonesia, Brazil and India, as well as places like China, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., Germany, France and others.</p>
<p>The trend isn&#8217;t isolated to any one demographic, either, but is seen across age groups. In the U.S., for example, Gen Z, millennials and Gen X/Baby Boomers spent 16%, 18% and 30% more time in their most-used apps year-over-year, respectively. However, what those favorite apps looked like was very different.</p>
<p>For Gen Z in the U.S., top apps on Android phones included Snapchat, Twitch, TikTok, Roblox and Spotify.</p>
<p>Millennials favored Discord, LinkedIn, PayPal, Pandora and Amazon Music.</p>
<p>And Gen X/Baby Boomers used Ring, Nextdoor, The Weather Channel, Kindle and ColorNote Notepad Notes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2095418" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.52-PM.jpg?w=569" alt="" width="569" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.52-PM.jpg 1480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.52-PM.jpg?resize=125,150 125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.52-PM.jpg?resize=251,300 251w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.52-PM.jpg?resize=768,918 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.52-PM.jpg?resize=569,680 569w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.52-PM.jpg?resize=1284,1536 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.05.52-PM.jpg?resize=42,50 42w" sizes="(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px" /></p>
<p>The pandemic didn&#8217;t necessarily change how consumers were using apps in 2020, but rather accelerated mobile adoption by two to three years&#8217; time, the report found.</p>
<p>Investors were also eager to fuel mobile businesses as a result, pouring $73 billion in capital into mobile companies &#8212; a figure that&#8217;s up 27% year-over-year. According to Crunchbase data, 26% of total global funding dollars in 2020 went to businesses that included a mobile solution.</p>

<p>From 2016 to 2020, global funding to mobile technology companies more than doubled compared with the previous five years, and was led by financial services, transportation, commerce and shopping.</p>
<p>Mobile gaming adoption also continued to grow in 2020. Casual games dominated the market in terms of downloads (78%), but Core games accounted for 66% of games&#8217; consumer spend and 55% of the time spent.</p>
<p>With many stuck inside due to COVID-19 lockdowns and quarantines, mobile games that offered social interaction boomed. Among Us, for example, became a breakout game in several markets in 2020, including the U.S.</p>

<p>Other app categories saw sizable increases over the past year, as well.</p>
<p>Time spent in Finance apps in 2020 was up 45% worldwide, outside of China, and participation in the stock market grew 55% on mobile, thanks to apps like Robinhood in the U.S. and others worldwide, that democratized investing and trading.</p>
<p>TikTok had a big year, too.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2095437" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg?w=608" alt="" width="608" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg 1512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg?resize=134,150 134w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg?resize=268,300 268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg?resize=768,859 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg?resize=608,680 608w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg?resize=1373,1536 1373w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" /></p>
<p>The app saw incredible 325% year-over-year growth, despite a ban in India, and ranked in the top five apps by time spent. The average monthly time spent per user also grew faster than nearly every other app analyzed, including 65% in the U.S. and 80% in the U.K., surpassing Facebook. TikTok is now on track to hit 1.2 billion active users in 2021, App Annie forecasts.</p>
<p>Other video services boomed in 2020, thanks to a combination of new market entrants and a lot of time spent at home. Consumers spent 40% more hours streaming on mobile devices, with time spent in streaming apps peaking in the second quarter in the west as the pandemic forced people inside.</p>

<p>YouTube benefitted from this trend, as it became the No. 1 streaming app by time spent among all markets analyzed except China. The time spent in YouTube is up to 6x that of the next closet app at 38 hours per month.</p>
<p>Of course, another big story for 2020 was the rise of e-commerce amid the pandemic. This made the past year the biggest ever for mobile shopping, with an over 30% increase in time spent in Shopping apps, as measured on Android phones outside of China.</p>

<p>Mobile commerce, however, looked less traditional in 2020.</p>
<p>Social shopping was a big trend, with global downloads of Pinterest and Instagram growing 50% and 20% year-over-year, respectively.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2095438" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg?w=552" alt="" width="552" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg 1466w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=122,150 122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=244,300 244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=768,946 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=552,680 552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=1247,1536 1247w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px" /></p>
<p>Livestreaming shopping grew, too, led by China. Downloads of live shopping TaoBao Live in China, Grip in South Korea and NTWRK in the U.S. grew 100%, 245% and 85%, respectively. NTWRK doubled in size last year, and now others are entering the space as well &#8212; including TikTok, to some extent.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2095439" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.32-PM.jpg?w=608" alt="" width="608" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.32-PM.jpg 1630w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.32-PM.jpg?resize=134,150 134w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.32-PM.jpg?resize=268,300 268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.32-PM.jpg?resize=768,858 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.32-PM.jpg?resize=608,680 608w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.32-PM.jpg?resize=1374,1536 1374w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.32-PM.jpg?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" /></p>
<p>The pandemic also prompted increased usage of mobile ordering apps. In the U.S., Argentina, the U.K., Indonesia and Russia, the app grew by 60%, 65%, 70%, 80% and 105%, respectively, in Q4.</p>
<p>Business apps, like Zoom and Google Meet among others, grew 275% in Q4, for example, as remote work and sometimes school, continued.</p>
<p>The analysis additionally included lists of the top apps by downloads, spending and monthly active users (MAUs).</p>

<p>Although TikTok had been topping year-end charts, Facebook continued to beat it in terms of MAUs. Facebook-owned apps controlled the top charts by MAUs, with Facebook at No. 1 followed by WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram.</p>

<p>TikTok, however, had more downloads than Facebook and ranked No. 2 by consumer spending, behind Tinder.</p>
<p>The full report is available only as an <a href="http://appannie.com/go/state-of-mobile-2021">online interactive experience</a> this year, not a download. The report largely uses data from both the iOS App Store and Google Play, except where otherwise noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon on Wednesday launched Amazon Academy, a service that will aim to help students in India prepare for entry into the nation’s prestigious engineering colleges. The American firm is the latest entrant to this market where scores of startups and institutes have launched digital offerings in recent years.</p>
<p>The e-commerce giant, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">invested more than $6.5 billion</a> in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, said <a href="https://academy.amazon.in/">Amazon Academy</a> offers curated learning material, live lectures, mock tests, and comprehensive assessments to help students learn and practice Math, Physics and Chemistry and prepare for the Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE), a government-backed engineering entrance assessment conducted in India for admission to various engineering colleges in the country. About two million students take JEE test each year.</p>
<p>Tests offered on Amazon Academy are &#8220;designed to mirror the JEE experience helping students understand the nuances of the examination. Students will also benefit from shortcuts, mnemonics, tips, and tricks, equipping them with the necessary tools to retain concepts and solve questions effectively,&#8221; the company said in a press note.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon began testing Amazon Academy, previously known as JEE Ready, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/amazon-computer-science-education-program-future-engineer-in-india/">in India in mid-2019</a>. Amazon Academy, available via its website and as an app for Android and iOS, is free and will remain so for the &#8220;next few months,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2095600 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="562" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg?resize=768,421 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg?resize=1536,842 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>More than 260 million children go to school in India and much of the population sees education as a key to economic progress and a better life. TechCrunch reported last month that Amazon was also looking to hire executives in India to launch Amazon Future Engineer, a program through which it aims to bring computer science education to underserved and underrepresented children and young adults, in India by this year.</p>
<p>“Amazon Academy aims to bring high quality, affordable education to all, starting with those preparing for engineering entrance examinations. Our mission is to help students achieve their outcomes while also empowering educators and content partners reach millions of students. Our primary focus has been on content quality, deep learning analytics and student experience. This launch will help engineering aspirants prepare better and achieve the winning edge in JEE,” said Amol Gurwara, Director, Education at Amazon India, in a statement.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s global rivals, Facebook and Google, have also made push in India&#8217;s education market in recent years. Last year, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/05/facebook-makes-education-push-in-india/">partnered with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)</a>, a government body that oversees education in private and public schools in India, to launch a certified curriculum on digital safety and online well-being, and augmented reality for students and educators.</p>
<p>Facebook also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/facebook-backs-indian-education-startup-unacademy/">invested in Unacademy</a>, a Bangalore-based startup that offers online learning classes. Google, which <a href="https://entrackr.com/2020/12/exclusive-cuemath-scores-40-mn-in-series-c-round-valuation-crosses-170-mn/">invested in Indian edtech startup</a> Cuemath, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-makes-education-push-in-india/">also partnered with CBSE</a> to train more than 1 million teachers in India and offer a range of free tools such as G Suite for Education, Google Classroom and YouTube to help digitize the education experience in the nation.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s top edtech startups &#8212; Byju&#8217;s, Unacademy, and Vedantu &#8212; also offer students classes to prepare for JEE test. Last year, these startups onboarded tens of millions of students to their platforms after the coronavirus outbreak prompted New Delhi to shut down schools across the nation. Byju&#8217;s, which became the world&#8217;s most valuable edtech startup last year, is in talks to buy decades-old Aakash Educational Services Aakash Educational Services, which owns and operates more than 200 physical tutoring centres across the country aimed at students preparing to qualify for top engineering and medical colleges, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/byjus-is-reportedly-buying-indian-brick-and-mortar-institute-aakash-for-1-billion/">for $1 billion</a>, Bloomberg reported this week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Megvii, one of China&#8217;s largest facial recognition startups, is gearing up for an initial public offering in Shanghai. The company is working with CITIC Securities to prepare for its planned listing, according to an <a href="http://www.csrc.gov.cn/pub/beijing/bjfdqyxx/bjfdqyjbqk/202101/P020210112533742962617.pdf">announcement</a> posted by the China Securities Regulatory Commission on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The move came more than a year after Megvii, known for its computer vision platform Face++, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/megvii-the-chinese-startup-unicorn-known-for-facial-recognition-tech-files-to-go-public-in-hong-kong/">filed to go public</a> in Hong Kong in August 2019. At the time, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-megvii-ipo/chinese-ai-start-up-megvii-files-for-hong-kong-ipo-of-at-least-500-million-idUSKCN1VG05I">reported</a> that the company could raise between $500 million and $1 billion. However, the firm&#8217;s IPO application in Hong Kong has lapsed for undisclosed reasons and its focus is now on Shanghai&#8217;s STAR board, a person with knowledge of the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In 2019, China established the STAR board to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/china-new-tech-board/">attract high-growth, unprofitable Chinese tech startups</a> after losing them to the U.S. for years. In the meantime, a domestic flotation is increasingly appealing to Chinese firms, especially those that count on government contracts and are caught in the U.S.-China tech competition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Megvii and its rivals SenseTime, Yitu, and CloudWalk are collectively recognized as the &#8220;Four AI Dragons&#8221; of China for their market dominance and fundings from highflying investors. Megvii&#8217;s technology can be found powering smart city infrastructure across China as well as many smartphones and mobile apps. Alibaba, Ant Group and the Bank of China are among the group of investors who have pumped about <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/megvii-technology">$1.4 billion</a> into the ten-year-old company since its inception.</p>
<p>The AI Dragons are less celebrated outside their home market. Last year, Megvii, Yitu and SenseTime <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/eight-chinese-tech-firms-placed-on-u-s-entity-list-for-their-role-in-human-rights-violations-against-muslim-minority-groups/">were added to the U.S. Entity List</a> for their alleged roles in enabling the government&#8217;s mass surveillance of the Muslim minority groups in western China. CloudWalk was subsequently added to the blacklist in 2020 and cut off from its U.S. suppliers.</p>
<p>According to the notice posted by China&#8217;s securities authority, Megvii plans to issue <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/china-wants-its-tech-firms-back-are-cdrs-the-answer-quicktake?sref=gni836kR">Chinese depositary receipts (CDRs)</a>, which are similar to American depositary receipts and allow domestic investors to hold overseas shares. That suggests the Beijing-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/megvii-750-million/">AI unicorn</a> has not ruled out listing outside mainland China.</p>
<p>This week, Hong Kong-listed Lenovo, one of the world&#8217;s top PC makers, has also <a href="https://doc.irasia.com/listco/hk/lenovo/announcement/ca210112.pdf">announced plans</a> to sell shares through CDRs on the Shanghai tech board.</p>
<p>Currently seeking guidance in the pre-application stage, Megvii&#8217;s planned listing still needs approval from Chinese regulators.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.molotov.tv">Molotov</a> provides an OTT TV streaming service in France with live TV, premium channels, a cloud DVR and on-demand content. While the service has managed to attract 13 million users in France, it has yet to expand to other countries.</p>
<p>Molotov is starting its international expansion this year with a dozen countries on the roadmap. First, the service will be available in seven African countries, starting with Ivory Coast where it’s already live, Senegal in January, Cameroon in February, Burkina Faso in March, Tunisia in April, Guinea and Democratic Republic of Congo after that.</p>
<p>“When it comes to features, the service is more or less the same but content is different,” co-founder and CEO Jean-David Blanc told me. Molotov is betting on local partnerships to launch its service in new countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In today’s case, Molotov is partnering with <a href="https://www.digitalvirgo.com">Digital Virgo</a>, a mobile payments company available in 40 countries. Digital Virgo is handling the relationships with local content owners. Molotov is taking care of operations and the tech stack.</p>
<p>There will be 15 channels at launch, such as Nina TV, Passions TV, Trace Urban, Trace Africa, Trace Urban Africa, Savannah TV, Gametoon, Africanews, Euronews, France24, Trace Sport Stars and DocuBox. Molotov will also grant access to its ad-supported on-demand streaming service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/molotov-launches-free-ad-supported-streaming-service-mango/">Mango</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095287" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095287" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="606" class="size-full wp-image-2095287" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=768,455 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=1536,909 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095287" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Molotov</p></div></p>
<p>In order to support its international expansion plans, the startup had to rework its infrastructure so that it’s more robust — it relies more on cloud hosting and it is partnering with more CDN companies. For instance, the service should work better if you don’t have as much bandwidth as before.</p>
<p>And this is just a start as Molotov is already talking with different B2B partners in Asia, South America and Europe. “Our strategy is that we lean on local players to launch Molotov in new countries,” Blanc said. So you can expect more news on the international front with new countries and new partners.</p>

We broke out the top 10 tech companies from the list of large businesses (1,000+ employees) as well as from the small to medium-sized business list.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">For the large business list, the rankings are based on employee feedback from companies with more than 1,000 employees. Through Glassdoor, employees rate companies based on things like their CEO, career opportunities, compensation and benefits, culture and values, and work-life balance. To be considered for the large list, each employer needed at least 75 ratings across each of the workplace attributes. For the SMB list, companies needed at least 75 ratings to be considered.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are the top 10 tech companies to work for in the U.S., according to Glassdoor. In parentheses, you&#8217;ll find each company&#8217;s overall ranking on the list of the 100 best companies along with the average employee rating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

As people continue staying home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the company is introducing a smart home cooking appliance with multiple functions.

Takumi is connected by RFID to an app with preprogrammed recipes, which also sends alert when its water container is running low.</p>

<p>If you live in the Bay Area, you might have seen Yo-Kai Express’s Octo-Chef, a vending machine that serves hot noodle dishes (ramen, udon and pho), in venues like the San Francisco International Airport, the Metreon mall in San Francisco and corporate campuses. But the company is adapting as people stay home. In April, it launched a <a href="https://www.yokaiexpress.com/homemealkit">home meal kit delivery service</a> that is now available in all states.</p>
<p>Created for people who want a home-cooked meal but are short on time (and space), the Takumi’s pre-programmed recipes have cooking times of just two to eight minutes. Yo-Kai Express is known for noodle dishes, but the Takumi’s menu will also include rice bowls, dim sum, dumplings and pasta.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The spread of misinformation and fake news online has a dangerous impact on public well-being. Misinformation is difficult to fight, and 73% of Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/09/few-americans-are-confident-in-tech-companies-to-prevent-misuse-of-their-platforms-in-the-2020-election/">surveyed by Pew Research</a> ahead of the presidential election expressed little or no confidence in the ability of major tech companies to keep their platforms from being misused. The open-source <a href="https://vimeo.com/494323381">Starling Framework for Data Integrity </a>was launched to protect the veracity of online content using blockchain technology, creating “birth certificates” for photos and videos and tracking any changes made to them. <a href="https://numbersprotocol.io/">Numbers Protocol</a>, a Taipei, Taiwan-based startup, founded by Startling Framework collaborators, is now commercializing its tech to make it more widely available.</p>
<p>Numbers is currently presenting its blockchain camera, Capture App, <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/f61536ff-5b81-49fd-ba52-8564c2fb8ad7?index=1">during CES at the Taiwan Tech Arena pavilion</a>. The app is available for download in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/capture/id1536388009">App Store </a>and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.numbersprotocol.capturelite">Google Play</a>.</p>
<p>While journalism, especially citizen journalism, is an obvious use case for Capture App, it can also be used by people who want to prove that they created images that are being shared online. Numbers will add more features to the app, including a video camera.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2095006" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EqGQjfdUUAABbW0.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095006" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2095006" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EqGQjfdUUAABbW0.jpg?w=680" alt="A screenshot of blockchain camera app Capture App by Taiwan startup Numbers Protocol" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EqGQjfdUUAABbW0.jpg 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EqGQjfdUUAABbW0.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EqGQjfdUUAABbW0.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EqGQjfdUUAABbW0.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095006" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot of blockchain camera app Capture App by Taiwan startup Numbers Protocol</p></div></p>
<p>All photos taken by the Capture App have their metadata <a href="https://medium.com/numbers-protocol/securing-our-data-with-numbers-starling-capture-54dbad4bedc2">certified and sealed on the blockchain</a> (users can adjust privacy settings if they, for example, don’t want to share their precise location). Then any changes to the photo, including ones made with editing software, are traced and recorded.</p>
<p>Numbers plans to add a video function to the app and create a channel where people can publish certified content, with the goal of changing the information industry, co-founder Tammy Yang told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Before launching Numbers, Yang worked with the Starling Framework, an initiative by Stanford University and <a href="https://sfi.usc.edu/">the USC Shoah Foundation</a>. The Shoah Foundation’s work includes preserving testimonies from survivors of genocide and mass violence and the Starling Framework&#8217;s technology was created to help them safeguard photos and videos. The Starling Framework was also<a href="https://filecoin.io/blog/starling-framework/"> used by Reuters journalists</a> to capture, verify and store photos taken during the U.S. presidential primaries in March. (The Starling Framework’s other collaborators include Filechain, Hala Systems and Protocol Labs).</p>
<p>The Starling Framework worked with the Shoah Foundation and Reuters to integrate its technology into their workflows, since many photojournalists use digital SLRs and programs like Adobe Photoshop. Capture App was created to allow wider access to the same technology.</p>
<p>Fake news and misinformation has created more public awareness of the need to preserve photo integrity, said Yang. While there are other companies that use blockchain tech to protect data and content, Numbers focuses on certifying photos at their point of origin, and then continuing to record any alterations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We focus very much on the camera itself, so at the time the photo is taken, the integrity is already preserved,&#8221; said Yang. &#8220;If content is captured on a camera app and then copied to a content platform, it’s already very difficult to verify its origin. If I take a photo from Facebook and register it on the blockchain, it means nothing. It’s very different if I take a photo with Capture App and immediately create a registration on the blockchain.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As expected, this year’s (virtual) CES has brought with it a new flood of smart home gadgets. The technology has been a major presence over the last several CES events, and with a world stuck at home for the foreseeable future, a lot of this tech has become all the more appealing.</p>
<p>Nobi stands out from the pack, not so much because of any flashy features, but rather a kind of practicality it brings to the table. Created by a Belgian startup of the same name, the ceiling-mounted smart light features motion sensors and infrared detection.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/_lapF6eiWzo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When the user sits up, the top light illuminates. If they stand up to walk, it illuminates the ground. More interestingly, it can detect irregular motions in the user, as well as falls. If the user does the latter, the on-board speaker will ask, “did you fall.”</p>
<p>If the answer is “no,” nothing happens. If the answer is anything else, it will send a notification to a caregiver, which may include a photo, depending on the specific settings. The lamp is currently undergoing a testing period and will be available for sale by year&#8217;s end. Users can buy them outright, or rent them, along with a subscription.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brian Acton is crossing paths again with Facebook. Over more than a decade of building and operating WhatsApp, the company&#8217;s co-founder first competed against and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-buying-whatsapp-for-16b-in-cash-and-stock-plus-3b-in-rsus/?_ga=2.110338893.954111183.1610362407-37075995.1609086401">sold his instant messaging app to the social juggernaut</a>. Only a few years ago he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/13/whatsapp-co-founder-brian-acton-is-leaving-to-start-a-non-profit/">parted ways with the company</a> that made him a billionaire in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/whatsapp-founder-brian-acton-says-facebook-used-him-to-get-its-acquisition-past-eu-regulators/">bitter split over messaging and privacy</a>.</p>
<p>Now Acton says the ongoing outrage over what Facebook has done to the messaging service he helped build is driving people to his latest project &#8212; Signal. Acton, who serves as the executive chairman of the privacy-conscious messaging app&#8217;s holding company, told TechCrunch in an interview that the user base of Signal has “exploded” in recent weeks.</p>
<p>“The smallest of events helped trigger the largest of outcomes,” said Acton on a video call. “We’re also excited that we are having conversations about online privacy and digital safety and people are turning to Signal as the answer to those questions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“It’s a great opportunity for Signal to shine and to give people a choice and alternative. It was a slow burn for three years and then a huge explosion. Now the rocket is going,” he said.</p>
<p>The event Acton is referring to is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/elon-musk-dunks-on-facebook-and-recommends-signal-in-wake-of-u-s-capitol-insurrection-attempt/">recent change</a> in <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/answering-your-questions-about-whatsapps-privacy-policy">data-sharing policy disclosed by WhatsApp</a>, an app that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/">serves more than 2 billion users</a> worldwide.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical alignnone size-full wp-image-2095451" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-data-sharing-policy-new.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="829" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-data-sharing-policy-new.jpg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-data-sharing-policy-new.jpg?resize=109,150 109w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-data-sharing-policy-new.jpg?resize=217,300 217w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-data-sharing-policy-new.jpg?resize=492,680 492w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-data-sharing-policy-new.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Through an in-app alert, WhatsApp has asked users in recent days to agree to new terms of conditions that grants the app the consent to share their personal data with Facebook. Users will have to agree to these terms by February 8 if they wish to continue using the app, the alert said.</p>
<p>Acton said WhatsApp is grappling with incorporating monetization features while still protecting people’s privacy. And its new “complicated policy” has forced WhatsApp and the media to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification/">scramble for explanations</a> and “everyone is confused.”</p>
<p>Acton did not disclose how many users Signal has amassed in recent weeks, but he said the app currently ranks at the top on App Store in 40 countries and on Google Play Store in 18 countries. (Signal is not the only app that users have explored in recent days as their new home. Telegram said on Tuesday noon that more than 25 million users had joined the platform in the last 72 hours. The app now has over 525 million monthly active users.)</p>

<p>According to mobile insight firm App Annie, data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch, Signal had about 20 million monthly active users globally at the end of December 2020. According to Sensor Tower, the app was downloaded more than 7.5 million times between January 6 and January 10.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2018, Signal has promised that it won’t sell its users’ data and that it won’t show its users ads. In 2018, Acton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/21/signal-expands-into-the-signal-foundation-with-50m-from-whatsapp-co-founder-brian-acton/">invested $50 million in Signal Foundation</a>, a check that he said helped get the ball rolling. But how does the messaging app plan to stay afloat in the future?</p>
<p>Signal today also relies on donations to bankroll the business &#8212; and more users mean more donors, he said. “If Signal gets to a billion users, that’s a billion donors. All we have to do is get you so excited about Signal that you want to give us a dollar or 50 rupees. The idea is that we want to earn that donation. The only way to earn that donation is building an innovative and delightful product. That’s a better relationship in my opinion,” he said.</p>
<p>Acton said this model has worked for the business, which keeps a small staff of below 50. Between its frugal spending and the foundation&#8217;s largesse, Signal still has some money in the bank.</p>
<p>Signal Foundation has also previously said that messenger is its first product, and like Mozilla and Wikimedia Foundation, it intends to expand to more categories. Acton said in the coming years, the team will take a call on whether they want to work on email and storage products, but he said the current focus remains on the messaging app.</p>
<p>Even as Acton has publicly urged users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/after-selling-his-company-to-facebook-for-19-billion-brian-acton-joins-deletefacebook/">get off Facebook</a>, in our conversation he did not suggest that people should stop using WhatsApp. On the contrary, Acton said he envisions people relying on Signal for conversations with their family and close friends, and using WhatsApp for other chats. &#8220;I have no desire to do all the things that WhatsApp does. My desire is to give people a choice,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Otherwise, you&#8217;re locked into something where you have no choice. It&#8217;s not strictly a winner take-all scenario.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the criticisms that WhatsApp often receives is that it does not do enough to curb the spread of false information on its platform, which has resulted in <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/whatsapp-destroyed-village-lynchings-rainpada-india">real-life casualties</a>. I asked Acton what Signal, which also protects its users&#8217; conversations with end-to-end encryption, would do if people started to use his app for a similar purpose. Acton said it&#8217;s a difficult challenge and while technology and platform have their own share of responsibilities, they can only do so much especially when you can&#8217;t look at the content of the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should be teaching your children good digital responsibility. Don&#8217;t just immediately take the information that you get. Understand its source. Understand who are trusted sources. As a society, teach every member how it works,&#8221; he said, pointing to earlier days of the internet when email scams were rampant and with time and education people learned how to identify them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lime has changed its corporate travel policy to ensure not a dime of its money ends up in the coffers of the Trump Organization&#8217;s hotels and other properties in response to the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol that led to several deaths.</p>
<p>The micromobility startup wants to take that action further and has asked TripActions, the Palo Alto-based corporate travel booking service that it uses, to encourage other customers to do the same. TripActions has not returned emails seeking comment.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Lime asked TripActions to remove Trump properties from showing up in a search if one of its employees is booking corporate travel, according to an internal email written by Lime CEO Wayne Ting and sent to the rest of the staff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#8220;While some startups have argued that companies should never be political, we have always understood that the work we do here at Lime is inherently political,&#8221; Ting wrote. &#8220;We are speaking out and standing up for what we believe is right because that is the right thing to do. And we are looking for ways to ensure our actions &#8212; and dollars &#8212; don’t support those who are complicit in this attack on our democracy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Lime has not made any political contributions to date, according to the email. (TechCrunch confirmed with Lime that it hasn&#8217;t made any federal political contributions.) Ting wrote that the company will never support any elected <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">official who voted to challenge the certification of the results of the Electoral College. He then went further, extending it to the Trump Organization, a real estate portfolio that includes hotels, golf properties and resorts as well as residential holdings like Trump Tower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#8220;Moreover, we are committing to never support or spend money at any of the business ventures and affiliates of the Trump and Kushner families,&#8221; Ting wrote. &#8220;In fact, earlier today, we asked TripActions to remove all Trump properties from Lime search results and encouraged them to institute this policy for all of their customers.&#8221;</span></p>
<div dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Here&#8217;s the complete email, which TechCrunch has viewed:<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">I know many of us watched last week’s events in Washington DC in shock and horror. The bedrock of any democracy is the peaceful transfer of power based on the will of the people. It was horrific to see a mob of insurrectionists &#8212; including white supremacists, neo-nazis, and conspiracy theorists &#8212; spurred on by the President, storm the halls of Congress to undermine and overturn that most sacred democratic ritual through violence and intimidation. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The day was made even more disturbing by the stark contrast in police response between last week’s violent riots and last summer’s overwhelmingly peaceful protests for racial justice. If the rioters last week had been black and brown and held high the flag of Black Lives Matter instead of Donald Trump and the Confederacy, would they have been allowed to overrun the Capitol, ransacked offices, and walked back out the front door in their own volition? The unfortunate thing is the answer is self-evident.  </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">As more information became available over the last few days, it’s also clear that President Trump and certain Members of Congress still do not comprehend the gravity of their offenses, show appropriate remorse for inciting such unbelievable violence, or commit to ensure they never happen again. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">While some startups have argued that companies should never be political, we have always understood that the work we do here at Lime is inherently political. We are speaking out and standing up for what we believe is right because that is the right thing to do. And we are looking for ways to ensure our actions &#8212; and dollars &#8212; don’t support those who are complicit in this attack on our democracy.</span></p>

And while we have not made political donations to date, we are committing now to never support any elected official who voted to challenge the certification of the results of the Electoral College. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Moreover, we are committing to never support or spend money at any of the business ventures and affiliates of the Trump and Kushner families. In fact, earlier today, we asked TripActions to remove all Trump properties from Lime search results and encouraged them to institute this policy for all of their customers.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">I know these events have been difficult to watch, painful to comprehend, and deeply hurtful on the most personal level for many of our colleagues.

<p><strong>The big story: Visa calls off Plaid acquisition</strong></p>
<p>The deal, valued at $5.3 billion, was first announced just over a year ago.

<p>In today&#8217;s announcement, Visa said it could still have made things work, but the threat of &#8220;protracted and complex litigation&#8221; ultimately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">prompted it to call things off</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The year of the first-ever all-virtual CES is, unsurprisingly, the year of the virtual gym. The past 12 months have seen most of our fitness routines completely transformed &#8212; speaking for myself, my Apple Watch step count shows two big empty spots where March and April are.</p>
<p>Fitness startups have seen unexpected windfall in all of this. In June, Lululemon announced plans to acquire Mirror for $500 million, while competitors like Tonal saw a 7x increase in sales for the year. In December, Apple launched Fitness+, its own on-demand service designed to take on the Pelotons of the world.</p>
<p>It’s hard to shake the feeling that we’re starting to see a streaming service-style land rush on the fitness side of things. It’s a massive industry, of course, and odds are things will never return exactly to “normal” in the wake of all of this, but unlike movie services, it’s hard to imagine people subscribing to more than one at a time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uyPBzLp7UX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/lululemon-set-to-acquire-home-fitness-startup-mirror-for-500m/">Lululemon set to acquire home fitness startup Mirror for $500M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lululemon set to acquire home fitness startup Mirror for $500M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/lululemon-set-to-acquire-home-fitness-startup-mirror-for-500m/embed/#?secret=uyPBzLp7UX" data-secret="uyPBzLp7UX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Perhaps the biggest name to enter the market thus far at CES is Samsung. The electronics giant announced Smart Trainer, an addition to its growing line of fitness-focused apps. The system is designed specially for Samsung’s Smart TVs, using a webcam to track exercises. On that front, at least, it seems to be a bit more in-depth than Apple’s Watch-only tracking, which relies on an accelerometer and heart-rate monitor for feedback. Like Fitness+, it will employ trainers to lead exercises, including workout celebrity Jillian Michaels.</p>
<p>Ultrahuman is another major fitness video platform making its debut this week. The startup recently closed an $8 million round. Like Fitness+, its biotracking is built around the Apple Watch, showcasing heart rate and calories burned, among other metrics. The service compares its offering to a “masterclass” for fitness.</p>
<p>Partners include leading athletes and celebrities like Crossfit champion Kara Saunders, fitness celebrity Amanda Cerny, coach Johannes Bartl, hybrid athlete and coach Kris Gethin and MindSize CEO Christian Straka to name a few. Available on iOS and Android devices, the app also integrates biofeedback via its Apple Watch integration to measure and improve the efficacy of meditation and workouts. Compared to Calm and Headspace&#8217;s celebrity content approach, Ultrahuman uses a technology platform-based approach to improve experience and long-term results.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PG9spLbhpH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/fitness-wont-replace-the-gym-but-it-will-help-you-break-a-sweat/">It won’t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweat</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;It won’t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweat&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/fitness-wont-replace-the-gym-but-it-will-help-you-break-a-sweat/embed/#?secret=PG9spLbhpH" data-secret="PG9spLbhpH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>These services set themselves apart from the likes of Mirror, Peloton and new offerings from the likes of NordicTrack, in that these technologies ditch the heavy exercise equipment, lowering the barrier of entry (though I suppose Samsung’s does require a big, expensive TV). The fact is that demand will decrease when people feel more comfortable going to the gym. That will certainly shake out the industry to a certain extent.</p>
<p>For many people, however, once the secrets of home fitness have been unlocked, they may never want to visit the gym again.</p>
