										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, there are a number of website builders aimed at creators who want to point fans to a dedicated landing page from their social media profile. If you&#8217;ve spent any time on TikTok or Instagram, you&#8217;ve likely come across one of these simplified &#8220;link in bio&#8221;-style websites &#8212; like those hosted by <a href="https://linktr.ee/">Linktree</a>, for example. A new startup called <a href="https://beacons.ai/">Beacons</a> is now entering this market with the goal of making &#8220;link in bio&#8221; websites even more powerful. Its website builder offers creators an expanded set of tools to monetize their community, including through donations, sales, paid requests, affiliate shopping and more.</p>
<p>After signing up for the service, <a href="https://beacons.ai/">Beacons</a> walks the user through a series of questions, many which can be answered with just a &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221; For example, Beacons may ask the user if they want to accept donations or collect followers&#8217; emails, if they make TikTok or YouTube videos, and which category they&#8217;re in, in terms of the content they create.</p>
<p>This information is used to set up their Beacons landing page with the right content sections, which Beacons calls &#8220;blocks.&#8221; At launch, Beacons offers around a dozen of these configurable blocks, like email and SMS collection modules, video embed blocks for TikTok or YouTube creators, music blocks for embedding a track or album, a Twitter block to embed a tweet or Twitter profile, and link blocks, similar to Linktree, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s even a &#8220;friends&#8221; block, which is like a modern-day Myspace Top 8. This lets you link out to your friends on either Beacons, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok.</p>
<p>An area where Beacons differentiates itself from other &#8220;link in bio&#8221; website builders, however, is with its set of &#8220;monetization&#8221; blocks. Today, it has four tools for creators who want to generate revenue from their online presence. One of these is similar to <a href="https://www.cameo.com/">Cameo</a>, as it allows the creator to set up a menu of options to take fan requests for personalized content. For instance, fans could ask a fitness influencer to critique their routine, or they could pay to have their burning questions answered by someone they admire. The creator can then send out a personalized response either publicly or privately.</p>
<p>Other monetization blocks allow creators to accept donations or sell digital downloads &#8212; like e-books or paid video content, for instance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111827" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111827" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111827" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="341" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png 2524w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?resize=768,385 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?resize=1536,770 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?resize=2048,1027 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111827" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://beacons.ai/gallery">Beacons</a></p></div></p>
<p>The fourth, and perhaps most interesting, monetization block is a TikTok shopping feature. It allows creators to embed their TikTok videos where they recommend products directly on their Beacons website. From here, they can add affiliate links to the products in question, allowing them to directly generate revenue when fans purchase the items they&#8217;ve featured.</p>
<p>This particular feature comes at an opportune time. Today, TikTok is only beginning to formalize its plans around e-commerce. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/629c1c17-3daa-46af-8177-1814baaa2bed">In a recent presentation to marketers,</a> TikTok spoke of its plans to launch new online shopping tools that would allow brands to more directly reach TikTok&#8217;s younger audience. TikTok has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">partnered with Shopify</a> on social commerce, and has experimented with live video shopping, including with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">a holiday event hosted by Walmart</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QcVH5ainLA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">Walmart to pilot test livestreamed video shopping on TikTok</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Walmart to pilot test livestreamed video shopping on TikTok&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/embed/#?secret=QcVH5ainLA" data-secret="QcVH5ainLA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But TikTok&#8217;s creators have already been driving shopping trends across categories like <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-tiktok-changed-fashion-this-year">fashion</a>, <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/tiktok-biggest-fashion-beauty-trends-1234684172/">beauty</a>, <a href="https://www.whowhatwear.com/tik-tok-home-decor-trends">home décor</a>,<a href="https://people.com/lifestyle/viral-tiktok-finds-amazon/"> household items</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/tiktok-is-driving-massive-toy-sales-during-coronavirus-pandemic.html">toys</a> and much more, to the point that <em>&#8220;TikTok made me buy it,&#8221;</em> has become a common excuse for the impulse purchases prompted by TikTok&#8217;s viral content. By allowing creators to now more directly and financially benefit from these trends is the next logical step.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111830" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111830" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111830" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-monetize.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="407" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-monetize.jpeg 1270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-monetize.jpeg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-monetize.jpeg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-monetize.jpeg?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-monetize.jpeg?resize=680,407 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-monetize.jpeg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111830" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Beacons</p></div></p>
<p>The idea for Beacons comes from co-founders Neal Jean, Jesse Zhang, Greg Luppescu and David Zeng. Neal, Jesse and David met while in the PhD program at Stanford studying different areas of research, like machine learning and AI. Greg, meanwhile, did his Master&#8217;s at Stanford, then went on to work at Apple on the Apple Watch team.</p>
<p>Neal, Jesse and David had teamed up on Beacons and went through the Y Combinator Summer 2019 batch, iterating on ideas and pivoting the product several times. Some of those early concepts may eventually return &#8212; like a Shopify integration that would connect creators with brands selling on Shopify, for example.</p>
<p>The broader focus, however, had always been on helping creators make money, says Neal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even before our current product, we were really focused on trying to help creators solve monetization,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;When we kind of made this mini-pivot into the more Linktree-like product, we thought about building features that can help creators actually generate revenue &#8212; which I don&#8217;t think Linktree or any of the existing incumbents in the space were doing. Even today, you can&#8217;t actually make any money through Linktree,&#8221; he notes.</p>
<p>Linktree, of course, is only one of many &#8220;link in bio&#8221; websites on the market today, which means Beacons still faces <em>a lot</em> of competition. Other rivals include <a href="https://later.com/linkinbio/">Linkin.bio</a>, <a href="https://lnk.bio/">Lnk.bio</a>, <a href="https://dash.shorby.com/smartpage?&amp;lp">Shorby</a>, <a href="https://tap.bio/@tap.bio">Tap.bio</a>, <a href="https://embedsocial.com/feedlink/">Feedlink.io</a>, <a href="https://linkinprofile.com/">Link in Profile</a>, <a href="https://milkshake.app/">Milkshake</a>, <a href="https://campsite.bio/">Campsite</a>, <a href="https://bio.fm/">bio.fm</a>, <a href="https://url.bio/">url.bio</a> and <a href="https://biolincs.me/">biolincs.me</a>, for example.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hM-HxQWYC1A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Unlike some of its competitors, Beacons offers its tools for free and instead monetizes through a <a href="https://pricing.beacons.ai/">premium plan</a> ($10/mo) that allows creators to use their own custom domain. It also makes money by taking a percentage of sales on the requests and sales blocks, which is either 9% on the free plan or 5% on the paid plan. This rev share doesn&#8217;t bring in much money today &#8212; only &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of dollars &#8212; but the team believes that will scale as the startup grows and gains a large user base.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our strategy is&#8230;to continue building out more of these different kinds of revenue streams for creators,&#8221; says Neal. &#8220;And as we do that, I think, the fraction of transactional revenue will become higher relative to the subscription revenue than it is today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since launching in private beta last September, Beacons has seen 90,000 sign-ups and now has over 20,000 people who are considered active users of the product &#8212; most arrived in the last couple of months when the service began to roll out some of its newer features. So far, Beacons hasn&#8217;t done any paid marketing, with around 77% of new users coming to Beacons because they saw it on someone else&#8217;s profile.</p>
<p>The team raised a small, post-YC angel round of around $600,000 but is looking to fundraise in the future.</p>

<p>For in-person interviews not recorded in Pineapple’s Brooklyn studio, my basic reporting kit includes a Zoom H5, which has two XLR channels and allows me to give one Rode NTG-2 shotgun mic to the host Natalia and the other to the interviewee. (On mic stands, of course — the mic itself is prone to handling noise.) I’ve got a Rode pistol grip for when we, say, knock on doors in the neighborhood of the former Chippendales club in LA, looking for people who had been around when the party scene at the club was supposedly causing wars between the owners, neighbors and the police. (Luckily, we found Naomi, 94, who had been there since 1972 and had stories for days. She’s in the podcast.) Christine showed me how she brilliantly uses a cross-body camera strap attached to her recorder so she can hang it comfortably around her. For gear bags I used to swear by the Lowepro Passport Sling, but now that I’m older (lol), one-strapping isn’t comfortable for a long day in the field, so I use a regular backpack. My kit also includes Sony MDR-7506 headphones, an assortment of three- and six-foot XLR cables (always have backups), a deadcat, extra SD cards, an Electro Voice RE50/B mic, pens, snacks, release forms and batteries. So many batteries.</p>

<p>Then the pandemic hit. We all went on lockdown. We had done most of our interviews but there were a few we still needed, plus all the host tracking for the series. So we shipped Natalia a kit: a Zoom H6, a Shure SM7B cardioid dynamic announcer microphone, a CloudLifter CL-1 Microphone Activator, a broadcast arm, XLR cables and a windscreen. Natalia set up shop in her closet, surrounded by clothes, a fleece blanket on the floor, and as many cushions as she was willing to pull off her couches and chairs. (Sound bounces off of hard surfaces. The soft materials absorb it so the recordings won’t sound echoey or “roomy.”) We sent our amazing engineer Hannis Brown mic tests so he could diagnose the set-up from afar and suggest tweaks. And Natalia, bless her, was incredibly game to essentially become her own recording engineer ON TOP OF hosting an entire show. We quickly got accustomed to doing everything remotely and over Zoom, as all of us everywhere did.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111791" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111791" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2111791" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.47.44-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="975" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.47.44-PM.png 1348w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.47.44-PM.png?resize=150,143 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.47.44-PM.png?resize=300,286 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.47.44-PM.png?resize=768,732 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.47.44-PM.png?resize=680,648 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.47.44-PM.png?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111791" class="wp-caption-text">Natalia’s closet studio. Image Credits: Eleanor Kagan</p></div></p>
<p>When it came to remote interviewing, we would connect over Zoom, and both Natalia and our interviewee would record themselves. (We always recorded the Zoom as a backup too.) It was up to us producers to talk our interviewees through self-syncing. Experience and teamwork was of the utmost importance here. Interviewees only had so much time, and explaining how to set up a recording on a smartphone (or iPod!, yes, really) and transfer a test recording quickly, and then troubleshooting any audio problems in their location was important to getting a high-quality interview without taxing anyone&#8217;s patience. There are several useful guides and graphics out there that walk through the set-up. There’s something a little bit lost, of course, when we don’t get to walk into people’s homes for interviews, or even when former Chippendales dancers can’t produce their original costume in the middle of the interview — as one guy did. But everyone was incredibly kind and patient and willing to do this for us, for which we are very, very grateful.</p>
<p>In the end, we interviewed about 70 people for this series. We wrote 26 drafts of our first episode. We reviewed 100+ hours of archival footage. And I believe there are still more stories to be told when it comes to Chippendales.</p>
<p>Thankfully, no matter where in the world anyone is, we have the tools to do it.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a deep tech investor, I have often noticed that deep tech startups go through a different evolution cycle than a typical B2B or B2C company.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the challenges they face along the way are different — commercialization tends to be more complex and founders are often required to approach it differently.</p>
<p>Deep tech companies are usually built around a novel technology that offers significant advances over existing solutions in the market; often they create new markets that don’t yet exist. Taking these technologies from &#8220;lab to market&#8221; requires substantial capital carrying a much higher degree of risk than an average venture investment.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The majority of VCs are often surprised by the amount of complexity involved in building a successful deep tech company.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Typically, the underlying intellectual property (IP) of a deep tech company is unique and hard to recreate, resulting in a significant competitive advantage.</p>
<h2>High risk, high reward</h2>
<p>Since most deep tech companies are built around a fundamentally new and unproven technology, they carry higher risk. Typically, the tech has been tested in a lab or a research center and the early results are therefore often derived in a controlled environment. As a result, while building a product, founders are likely to encounter technical challenges along the way and won’t be able to eliminate the technology risk until later in the process.</p>
<p>By comparison, if a company is building a marketplace for used cars, for example, the technology risk is almost zero. Deep tech companies have the capability to create new markets with little competition and can replace existing technologies while fundamentally transforming an industry.</p>
<p>Microsoft, Nvidia, ARM, Intel and Google were all deep tech startups in the beginning. These companies will almost always require higher capital, carry higher risk and have longer time to return on investment.</p>
<p>However, if successful, they could deliver outsized returns over an average venture investment.</p>
<h2>Technology-first approach</h2>
<p>An obvious, but fundamental difference with deep tech companies is their technology-first approach. Typically, the founder has developed a novel technology or IP as part of their Ph.D. thesis or postdoc work and is in search for a real-world problem it can solve. Most startups, in general, pick an existing problem in a market they know well and develop a product that solves for that problem and they have a clear sense of the problem they need to solve.</p>
<p>Deep tech entrepreneurs take the opposite approach and as a result they often suffer from SISP (a solution in search of a problem), as Y Combinator calls it. Founders need to be aware of this and must be willing to pivot and repivot based on market and customer feedback. Investors should be prepared for this before backing the company and support the founders as they navigate through the challenges of building a successful deep tech company.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toyota Motor North America said Wednesday it will bring three new electrified vehicles to the U.S. market, as the automaker seeks to win over customers by offering a variety of lower emission and zero-emission cars and SUVs.</p>
<p>Two of the new vehicles will be all-electric and one will be a plug-in hybrid, the company said Wednesday. Sales of the vehicles are expected to being in 2022.</p>
<p>The aim, according to Bob Carter TMNA&#8217;s executive vice president of sales, is to offer customers multiple choices of powertrain that best suits their needs. The automaker is developing and selling hybrids, plug-in hybrids like the Toyota Prius and Toyota RAV4 and fuel cell vehicles such as the Toyota Mirai.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said that by 2025, its Toyota and luxury Lexus models will have an electrified option. The automaker is also developing a dedicated battery electric platform called e-TNGA, that can be configured to meet different needs.</p>
<p>This all-of-the-above approach is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and capturing more market share, which Toyota believes can only be achieved through variety. Toyota wants to to have 40% of new vehicle sales be electrified models by 2025. By 2030, the company expects that to increase to nearly 70%.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe the fastest way to lower greenhouse gases in the transportation sector is to offer drivers lower carbon choices that meet their needs,&#8221; Gill Pratt, chief scientist of Toyota Motor Corporation and CEO of Toyota Research Institute, said in a statement. &#8220;At every price point and with multiple powertrains, we can put more people in cleaner automobiles across North America to have the greatest near-term impact on total carbon emissions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s internal research, which was <a href="https://github.com/khamza075/PVC">built off of a tool</a> that shows the trade-off between GHG Emissions and total cost of ownership, found that emissions of a currently available battery-electric model and a plug-in hybrid model are roughly the same in on-road performance when factoring in pollutants created by electricity production for the average U.S. energy grid used to charge batteries.</p>
<p>Manufacturing is a component of GHG emissions, Toyota noted. Researchers found that the production of a PHEV emits less GHG since it uses a smaller, lighter weight battery. The company also argued that plug-in hybrids are less expensive to buy and own, compared to a BEV.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s argument — that BEVs and PHEVs can provide similar environmental benefits — syncs up with its business plan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since the start of the year, I&#8217;ve covered nine M&amp;A deals already, the largest being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/citrix-is-acquiring-wrike-from-vista-for-2-25b/">Citrix buying Wrike for $2.25 billion</a>. But not every deal involves a huge price tag. Today we are going to look at three smaller deals that show there is plenty of activity at the lower-end of the acquisition spectrum.</p>
<p>As companies look for ways to enhance their offerings, and bring in some talent at the same time, smaller acquisitions can provide a way to fill in the product road map without having to build everything in-house.</p>
<p>This gives acquiring companies additional functionality for a modest amount of cash. In smaller deals, we often don&#8217;t even get the dollar amount, although in one case today we did. If the deal isn&#8217;t large enough to have a material financial impact on a publicly traded company, they don&#8217;t have to share the price.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at three such deals that came through in recent days.</p>
<h2>Tenable buys Alsid</h2>
<p>For starters, <a href="https://www.tenable.com/">Tenable</a>, a network security company that went public in 2018, bought French Active Directory security startup <a href="https://www.alsid.com/">Alsid</a> for $98 million. Active Directory, Microsoft&#8217;s popular user management tool, is also a target of hackers. If they can get a user&#8217;s credentials, it&#8217;s an easy way to get on the network and Alsid is designed to prevent that.</p>
<p>Security companies tend to enhance the breadth of their offerings over time and Alsid gives Tenable another tool and broader coverage across their security platform. &#8220;We view the acquisition of Alsid as a natural extension into user access and permissioning. Once completed, this acquisition will be a strategic complement to our Cyber Exposure vision to help organizations understand and reduce cyber risk across the entire attack surface,&#8221; according to the<a href="https://investors.tenable.com/investor-resources/investor-faqs"> investor FAQ on this acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>Emmanuel Gras, CEO and co-founder, Alsid says he started the company to prevent this kind of attack. &#8220;We started Alsid to help organizations solve one of the biggest security challenges, an unprotected Active Directory, which is one of the most common ways for threat actors to move laterally across enterprise systems,&#8221; Gras said in a statement.</p>
<p>Alsid is based in Paris and was founded in 2014. It raised a modest amount, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/alsid-raises-14-7-million-to-secure-your-active-directory-installation/">approximately $15,000</a>, according to Crunchbase data.</p>

<h2>Copper acquires Sherlock</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.copper.com/">Copper</a>, a CRM tool built on top of the Google Workspace, announced it has purchased <a href="https://www.sherlockscore.com/">Sherlock</a>, a customer experience platform. They did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>The pandemic pushed many shoppers online and providing a more customized experience by understanding more about your customer can contribute to and drive more engagement and sales. With Sherlock, the company is getting a tool that can help Copper users understand their customers better.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sherlock is an innovative engagement analytics and scoring platform, and surfaces your prospects&#8217; and customers’ intentions in a way that drives action for sales, account management and customer success professionals,&#8221; Copper CEO Dennis Fois wrote in <a href="https://www.copper.com/resources/copper-acquires-sherlock-engagement-analytics-platform?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=sherlockannouncement">a blog post announcing the deal</a>.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;Relationships are based on engagement, and with Sherlock we are going to create CRM that is focused on action and momentum.&#8221;</p>

<h2>RapidAPI snags Paw</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that APIs have changed the way we think about software development, but they have also created a management problem of their own as they proliferate across large organizations. <a href="https://www.rapidapi.com/">RapidAPI</a>, an API management platform, announced today that it has acquired <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a>.</p>
<p>With Paw, RapidAPI adds the ability to design your own APIs, essentially giving customers a one-stop shop for everything related to creating and managing the API environment inside a company. &#8220;The acquisition enables RapidAPI to extend its open API platform across the entire API development lifecycle, creating a connected experience for developers from API development to consumption, across multiple clouds and gateways,&#8221; the company explained in a statement.</p>
<p>RapidAPI was founded in 2015 and has raised over $67 million, according to Crunchbase data. Its most recent funding came last May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/rapidapi-api-marketplace-funding/">a $25 million round</a> from Andreessen Horowitz, DNS Capital, Green Bay Ventures, M12 (Microsoft’s Venture Fund) and Grove.</p>
<p>Each of these purchases fills an important need for the acquiring company and expands the abilities of the existing platform to offer more functionality to customers without putting out a ton of cash to do it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re wondering why Zynga issued $875 million in convertible notes at the end of 2020, CEO Frank Gibeau said the company was fundraising to build up a &#8220;war chest&#8221; for more acquisitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you know, we&#8217;ve been a consolidator inside of this business for a while, and we&#8217;re going to continue to be on offense [looking for] great companies, great cultures, great teams that we can bring into Zynga,&#8221; Gibeau told me.</p>
<p>In the last year alone, Zynga acquired two game studios based in Istanbul — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/zynga-acquires-turkeys-peak-games-for-1-8b-after-buying-its-card-games-studio-for-100m-in-2017/">Peak Games for $1.8 billion</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/zynga-completes-rollic-acquistion/">Rollic for $180 million</a> (in the latter case, it only acquired 80% of the company initially).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There are now four or five examples of us having done this successfully,&#8221; Gibeau said. &#8220;When we started, nobody was picking up our phone calls. Now when we call, we are a bit of a destination of choice for a lot of developers out there.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zmQ2SS31ZO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/goodbye-flash-goodbye-farmville/">Goodbye Flash, goodbye FarmVille</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Goodbye Flash, goodbye FarmVille&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/goodbye-flash-goodbye-farmville/embed/#?secret=zmQ2SS31ZO" data-secret="zmQ2SS31ZO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Gibeau and I were speaking about Zynga&#8217;s fourth quarter earnings, in which the company reported all-time high revenue of $616 million and a net loss of $53 million (though another measure of profitability, adjusted EBITDA, was actually positive at $90 million). Daily active users were up 77% year over year, to 36 million, while monthly active users were up 103%, to 134 million.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Zynga is forecasting revenue of $2.6 billion (a 32% year-over-year increase) and adjusted EBITDA of $450 million for 2021. And while another acquisition could significantly grow the business, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Gibeau noted that the company&#8217;s forecasts have &#8220;no acquisitions assumed,&#8221; adding, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We&#8217;re in a great position, because we would prefer to do acquisitions in 2021, but we don&#8217;t have to do any deals.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>There are new games lined up for 2021, including Puzzle Combat, Farmville 3 and a Star Wars title. The company also plans to continue developing hypercasual games, to develop more cross-platform games, to expand internationally and to continue building out its ad network — in fact, he suggested that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">Apple&#8217;s upcoming privacy changes</a> could be good for Zynga.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of traditional marketing services are not going to be able to survive very well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because we’re a first-party data company — all the data we generate is coming to our services from our games — and because we&#8217;re at scale … IDFA is an opportunity for our company.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>We’ve been having a tough time filling vacant engineering and other positions at our company and are planning to make a more concerted effort to recruit internationally. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have suggestions for attracting workers from abroad?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Proactive in Pacifica</strong></p>
<p>Dear Proactive,</p>
<p>Yes, I have many suggestions on what you can do to support international talent interested in moving to the United States. Immigration is a great benefit for attracting the best and the brightest team members from around the globe. And providing immigration security through visa practices and green card programs supports retaining these valued individuals. Consider sponsoring international students and other qualified candidates in the upcoming H-1B lottery in March.</p>
<p>As it now stands, the H-1B lottery will be random this year, not pay-to-play. We anticipate the electronic lottery process will follow these dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>March 9 at 9 a.m. PST: H-1B registration process opens.</li>
<li>March 25 at 9 a.m. PDT: H-1B registration process closes.</li>
<li>March 31: You’ll know if your H-1B beneficiaries were selected electronically in this initial round of the lottery.</li>
<li>April 1: First date to file H-1Bs selected in the lottery to request a 10/1/2021 or later start date.</li>
<li>June 30: Last anticipated day to complete filing of selected H-1B petitions in this initial round of the lottery.</li>
<li>After June 30: Possibility of a second lottery for registrations submitted in March.</li>
</ul>

<p>Through the H-1B and other proactive immigration-support measures you can take, your international team members will enjoy a greater sense of immigration security. This allows them to focus on their job rather than worrying about their immigration status. Here are my recommendations for drawing international talent from abroad and fostering productivity and loyalty.</p>
<h2>Establish your company&#8217;s immigration policy</h2>
<p>I recommend working with an experienced immigration attorney who can help your company develop an immigration policy based on your company’s core values, recruiting and immigration budget, and growth plan. Think of immigration as a benefit and a way to differentiate your company from others when recruiting top talent. Providing immigration benefits and immigration security goes a long way toward building team member loyalty and longevity.</p>
<p>For some companies, the best policy may be to have no policy, but it’s important to be deliberate about it and how that will affect your ability to make decisions and budget. For other companies, they implement a limited immigration policy to, for example, hire 40 engineers as soon as possible. Even with a decentralized workforce, a new recruit may be happy to move from Ukraine to Idaho even if your company is not based there.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the most difficult tasks in the increasingly high-fidelity world of gaming is making realistic-looking people — especially faces. Epic today <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/a-sneak-peek-at-metahuman-creator-high-fidelity-digital-humans-made-easy">showed off a new character creation tool</a> in Unreal Engine that lets you make a near-infinite variety of near-photorealistic digital people with far less effort than it might have taken before.</p>
<p>MetaHuman Creator is an application for designing characters that lets people mix and match presets then dive into the tiniest details. It&#8217;s a cloud-hosted service, since the amount of computing power and storage needed to render these characters at this resolution and level of lighting and so on is more than most people will have on hand.</p>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s used a high-quality character creator will recognize the pieces — a few dozen hairstyles, ear types, beards and lip shapes, which can be added, subtracted and adjusted like a digital Mr. Potato Head. Bet you didn&#8217;t see <em>that</em> reference coming!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2111706" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111706" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2111706" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg" alt="Close-up of CG faces showing details of skin reflectivity and wrinkles." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2111706" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Epic</p></div></p>
<p>The difference between MetaHuman and, say, a state of the art consumer-level creator like Cyberpunk 2077&#8217;s is fidelity and flexibility. As you can see in the videos, the quality of the hair, skin, eyes, teeth and so on is extremely high — the older fellow on the left has quite realistic wrinkles that shadow and deform properly when he moves his face, and the way the light interacts with the center lady&#8217;s light skin is very different from that of the dark-skinned man on the right.</p>
<p>The &#8220;center lady&#8221; also started as a middle-aged man and was sculpted piece by piece to her current look rather than just switching to a &#8220;feminine&#8221; preset, demonstrating that the faces don&#8217;t &#8220;break&#8221; if you manipulate them too much — a risk in other creators for sure. You can see the process in fast-forward in the video below:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3F1vZYpH8c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Naturally it also integrates with the usual creator tools, allowing for animation by various means, fiddling with meshes and exporting for use in other tools.</p>
<p>This level of detail isn&#8217;t exactly unprecedented, but the amount of work that goes into rendering a main character good enough for extreme close-ups and microexpressions is huge. Epic&#8217;s approach is not just to increase the potential quality of the assets and lighting and so on but to make it easy and efficient to implement. If only AAA studios can muster the resources to make characters like this, it&#8217;s not healthy for gaming as a whole.</p>
<p>Epic was humble enough to give credit right off the bat to companies like 3Lateral and Cubic Motion, both specialists in the field it has acquired. The Unreal Engine is presented as a sort of monolithic advance in computer graphics and design, but really it&#8217;s a very cleverly assembled amalgamation of dozens of improvements and advances made by individual (now acquired) companies and divisions over the years — more like an operating system with a bunch of integrated applications at this point.</p>
<p>MetaHuman Creator isn&#8217;t quite ready for use by just anyone, but Epic is running an early-access program you can sign up for, and they&#8217;ve provided a pair of models for you to play with in your existing Unreal Engine environment in the meantime (check the &#8220;Learn&#8221; tab).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile analytics and market data company App Annie <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/product-announcements/app-annie-pulse/">launched a new app today</a> that CEO Ted Krantz said is built not for the analyst who&#8217;s &#8220;immersed in the data,&#8221; but rather the executive who needs &#8220;a much more elevated, top-down view.&#8221;</p>
<p>The biggest new piece of the company&#8217;s Pulse app is something called the App Annie Performance Score, which Krantz compares to <a href="https://creditcards.usnews.com/articles/what-exactly-is-a-fico-score">a FICO score</a> for mobile apps. The idea is to take an app&#8217;s user acquisition, engagement, monetization and sentiment and boil them down into a single score that benchmarks how the app is performing relative to the competition.</p>
<p>Krantz said that eventually, the performance store could become more customizable for each customer, so that  &#8220;you can tailor it to the metrics that matter to you.&#8221; The app also highlights any shifts in key app metrics and identifies potential causes, and it includes a newsfeed showing what&#8217;s happening to the apps and markets that a user follows.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2111714" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111714" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111714" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?w=680" alt="App Annie Pulse" width="680" height="628" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?resize=300,277 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?resize=768,709 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?resize=680,628 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111714" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>The goal, Krantz added, is to provide executives with a quick overview of the data they need without requiring them to dig through it or wait for a report — especially as &#8220;mobile is becoming such an imperative.&#8221; It&#8217;s the team&#8217;s &#8220;aspiration&#8221; to create an app that executives check every day, though he&#8217;s not necessarily expecting that to happen initially.</p>
<p>The Pulse app is based on App Annie&#8217;s market-level data, so Krantz said it shouldn&#8217;t be affected by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">Apple&#8217;s upcoming privacy changes</a>. At the same time, he acknowledged that the company&#8217;s broader goals of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/app-annie-ascend/">bringing together first-party and third-party data</a> are starting too look &#8220;a little tricky.&#8221;</p>
<p>App Annie Pulse is currently available on iOS, with the company planning to launch an Android version in the second quarter of this year. And while the full features of Pulse are only available to paying App Annie customers, Krantz said there are also plans for &#8220;revamping the free side of the equation and make that a little more meaty.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA will provide 1,000 of its employees, including 150 astronauts, with Fitbit devices in a<a href="https://investor.fitbit.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/NASA-Makes-Fitbit-Ready-for-Work-Solution-Available-to-Support-Health-and-Safety-of-Astronauts-and-Other-Mission-Critical-Employees-During-COVID-19-Pandemic/default.aspx"> pilot program</a> designed to see if they can help supplement efforts to keep these mission-critical personnel healthy ahead of key space missions. The program will see NASA employees outfitted with a wearable and provided access to a daily check-in app they can use to log potential symptoms, as well as their body temperature and other key health metrics, which could potentially help spot developing cases.</p>
<p>NASA has already been taking measures to isolate astronauts and to limit or prevent the spread of COVID-19 across its facilities, which are located across the U.S. It has of course followed local guidelines and requirements regarding COVID-19 protections, but it also introduced its own level-based system last year and implemented remote work protocols for many employees wherever possible. On the astronaut side, it has also beefed up existing isolation and sequestration procedures that are already quite strict in order to guarantee that its spacefarers don&#8217;t get sick before they&#8217;re set to make a trip to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The new Fitbit program is designed to supplement those existing measures, providing tracked health metrics including resting heart rate and heart rate variability, as well as respiratory rate, changes in all of which have been linked to COVID-19. Those stats, along with the self-reported metrics logged by users themselves, including any reports of potential symptoms, will be used by the app to provide individuals in the program with guidance about whether they should go into work, or stay home and take additional measures to find out if they have COVID-19.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fitbit is already engaged in studies to determine whether its wearable devices and the metrics they log can be useful in providing early COVID-19 detection. Regardless of those results, self-reporting as well as the baseline health metrics that the app logs from its devices are already likely to be handy in providing a supplement to existing self-assessment measures regarding the level of risk you pose to others if you&#8217;re feeling off, which is the primary purpose of this program with NASA.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the second impeachment trial of his presidency unfolds, there&#8217;s another bit of bad news for the former president. In a new interview on CNBC&#8217;s Squawk Box, Twitter Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal gave the decisive word on how the company would handle Trump&#8217;s Twitter account long term.</p>
<p>Responding to a question about what would happen if Trump ran again and was elected to office, Segal didn&#8217;t mince words.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way our policies work, when you&#8217;re removed from the platform, you&#8217;re removed from the platform — whether you&#8217;re a commentator, you&#8217;re a CFO, or you are a former or current public official,&#8221; Segal said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Remember, our policies are designed to make sure that people are not inciting violence, and if anybody does that, we have to remove them from the service and our policies don&#8217;t allow people to come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Twitter banned Trump from its platform one month ago citing concerns about the &#8220;risk of further incitement of violence.&#8221; Trump&#8217;s role in instigating the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol ultimately sealed his fate on his platform of choice, where he&#8217;d spent four years rallying his followers, amplifying conspiracies and lambasting his critics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor has recommended that a ban on targeted advertising based on tracking Internet users&#8217; digital activity be included in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">major reform of digital services rules</a> which aims to increase operators&#8217; accountability, among other key goals.</p>
<p>The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), Wojciech Wiewiorówski, made the call for a ban on surveillance-based targeted ads in reference to the Commission&#8217;s Digital Services Act (DSA) &#8212; following a request for consultation from EU lawmakers.</p>
<p>The DSA legislative proposal was introduced in December, alongside the Digital Markets Act (DMA) &#8212; kicking off the EU&#8217;s (often lengthy) co-legislative process which involves debate and negotiations in the European Parliament and Council on amendments before any final text can be agreed for approval. This means <a href="https://www.eppgroup.eu/newsroom/publications/epp-group-position-on-the-digital-services-act-dsa">battle lines</a> are being drawn to try to influence the final shape of the biggest overhaul to pan-EU digital rules for decades &#8212; with everything to play for.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PgbEW0t2VE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Understanding Europe&#8217;s big push to rewrite the digital rulebook</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Understanding Europe&#8217;s big push to rewrite the digital rulebook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/embed/#?secret=PgbEW0t2VE" data-secret="PgbEW0t2VE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The intervention by Europe&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor calling for a ban on targeted ads is a powerful pre-emptive push against attempts to water down legislative protections for consumer interests.</p>
<p>The Commission had not gone so far in its proposal &#8212; but big tech lobbyists are certainly pushing in the opposite direction so the EDPS taking a strong line here looks important.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/21-02-10-opinion_on_digital_services_act_en.pdf">opinion</a> on the DSA the EDPS writes that &#8220;additional safeguards&#8221; are needed to supplement risk mitigation measures proposed by the Commission &#8212; arguing that &#8220;certain activities in the context of online platforms present increasing risks not only for the rights of individuals, but for society as a whole&#8221;.</p>
<p>Online advertising, recommender systems and content moderation are the areas the EDPS is particularly concerned about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the multitude of risks associated with online targeted advertising, the EDPS urges the co-legislators to consider additional rules going beyond transparency,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;Such measures should include a phase-out leading to a prohibition of targeted advertising on the basis of pervasive tracking, as well as restrictions in relation to the categories of data that can be processed for targeting purposes and the categories of data that may be disclosed to advertisers or third parties to enable or facilitate targeted advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest regional salvo aimed at mass-surveillance-based targeted ads after the European Parliament called for tighter rules back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">October</a> &#8212; when it suggested EU lawmakers should consider a phased in ban.</p>
<p>Again, though, the EDPS is going a bit further here in actually calling for one. (Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">Nick Clegg will be clutching his pearls</a>.)</p>
<p>More recently, the CEO of European publishing giant Axel Springer, a long time co-conspirator of adtech interests, went public with a (rather protectionist-flavored) rant about US-based data-mining tech platforms turning citizens into &#8220;the marionettes of capitalist monopolies&#8221; &#8212; calling for EU lawmakers to extend regional privacy rules by prohibiting platforms from storing personal data and using it for commercial gain <em>at all</em>.</p>

Sensitive and personal data does not belong in the hands of platforms that rule the market (so-called gatekeepers) or in the hands of states.&#8221;</span></div>
</div>
<p>Apple CEO, Tim Cook, also took to the virtual stage of a (usually) Brussels based conference <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in/">last month</a> to urge Europe to double down on enforcement of its flagship General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>In the speech Cook warned that the adtech &#8216;data complex&#8217; is fuelling a social catastrophe by driving the spread of disinformation as it works to profit off of mass manipulation. He went on to urge lawmakers on both sides of the pond to &#8220;send a universal, humanistic response to those who claim a right to users’ private information about what should not and will not be tolerated&#8221;. So it&#8217;s not just European companies (and institutions) calling for pro-privacy reform of adtech.</p>
<p>The iPhone maker is preparing to introduce stricter limits on tracking on its smartphones by making apps ask users for permission to track, instead of just grabbing their data &#8212; a move that&#8217;s naturally raised the hackles of the adtech sector, which relies on mass surveillance to power &#8216;relevant&#8217; ads.</p>
<p>Hence the adtech industry has resorted to crying &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">antitrust</a>&#8216; as a tactic to push competition regulators to block platform-level moves against its consentless surveillance. And on that front it&#8217;s notable than the EDPS&#8217; <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/21-02-10-opinion_on_digital_markets_act_en.pdf">opinion</a> on the DMA, which proposes extra rules for intermediating platforms with the most market power, reiterates the vital links between competition, consumer protection and data protection law &#8212; saying these three are &#8220;inextricably linked policy areas in the context of the online platform economy&#8221;; and that there &#8220;should be a relationship of complementarity, not a relationship where one area replaces or enters into friction with another&#8221;.</p>
<p>Wiewiorówski also takes aim at recommender systems in his DSA opinion &#8212; saying these should not be based on profiling by default to ensure compliance with regional data protection rules (where privacy by design and default is supposed to be the legal default).</p>
<p>Here too be calls for additional measures to beef up the Commission&#8217;s legislative proposal &#8212; with the aim of &#8220;further promot[ing] transparency and user control&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is necessary because such system have &#8220;significant impact&#8221;, the EDPS argues.</p>
<p>The role of content recommendation engines in driving Internet users towards hateful and extremist points of view has long been a subject of public scrutiny. Back in 2017, for example, UK parliamentarians grilled a number of tech companies on the topic &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/19/youtube-more-ai-can-fix-ai-generated-bubbles-of-hate/">raising concerns</a> that AI-driven tools, engineered to maximize platform profit by increasing user engagement, risked automating radicalization, causing damage not just to the individuals who become hooked on hateful views the algorithms feeds them but cascading knock-on harms for all of us as societal cohesion is eaten away in the name of keeping the eyeballs busy.</p>
<p>Yet years on little information is available on how such algorithmic recommender systems work because the private companies that operate and profit off these AIs shield the workings as proprietary business secrets.</p>

<p>The Commission&#8217;s DSA proposal takes aim at this sort of secrecy as a bar to accountability &#8212; with its push for transparency obligations. The proposed obligations (in the initial draft) include requirements for platforms to provide “meaningful” criteria used to target ads; and explain the “main parameters” of their recommender algorithms; as well as requirements to foreground user controls (including at least one “nonprofiling” option).</p>
<p>However the EDPS wants regional lawmakers to go further in the service of protecting individuals from exploitation (and society as a whole from the toxic byproducts that flow from an industry based on harvesting personal data to manipulate people).</p>
<p>On content moderation, Wiewiorówski&#8217;s opinion stresses that this should &#8220;take place in accordance with the rule of law&#8221;. Though the Commission draft has favored leaving it with platforms to interpret the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the already endemic monitoring of individuals’ behaviour, particularly in the context of online platforms, the DSA should delineate when efforts to combat &#8216;illegal content&#8217; legitimise the use of automated means to detect, identify and address illegal content,&#8221; he writes, in what looks like a tacit recognition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/europes-top-court-sets-new-line-on-policing-illegal-speech-online/">recent CJEU jurisprudence</a> in this area.</p>
<p>&#8220;Profiling for purposes of content moderation should be prohibited unless the provider can demonstrate that such measures are strictly necessary to address the systemic risks explicitly identified by the DSA,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>The EDPS has also suggested minimum interoperability requirements for very large platforms, and for those designated as &#8216;gatekeepers&#8217; (under the DMA), and urges lawmakers to work to promote the development of technical standards to help with this at the European level.</p>
<p>On the DMA, he also urges amendments to ensure the proposal &#8220;complements the GDPR effectively&#8221;, as he puts it, calling for &#8220;increasing protection for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the persons concerned, and avoiding frictions with current data protection rules&#8221;.</p>
<p>Among the EDPS&#8217; specific recommendations are: That the DMA makes it clear that gatekeeper platforms must provide users with easier and more accessible consent management; clarification to the scope of data portability envisaged in the draft; and rewording of a provision that requires gatekeepers to provide other businesses with access to aggregated user data &#8212; again with an eye on ensuring &#8220;full consistency with the GDPR&#8221;.</p>
<p>The opinion also raises the issue of the need for &#8220;effective anonymisation&#8221; &#8212; with the EDPS calling for &#8220;re-identification tests when sharing query, click and view data in relation to free and paid search generated by end users on online search engines of the gatekeeper&#8221;.</p>
<h2>ePrivacy reform emerges from stasis</h2>
<p>Wiewiorówski&#8217;s contributions to shaping incoming platform regulations come on the same day that the European Council has finally reached agreement on its negotiating position for a long-delayed EU reform effort around existing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/07/eprivacy-an-overview-of-europes-other-big-privacy-rule-change/">ePrivacy</a> rules.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/02/10/confidentiality-of-electronic-communications-council-agrees-its-position-on-eprivacy-rules/">press release</a> announcing the development, the Commission writes that Member States agreed on a negotiating mandate for revised rules on the protection of privacy and confidentiality in the use of electronic communications services.</p>
<p>&#8220;These updated ‘ePrivacy’ rules will define cases in which service providers are allowed to process electronic communications data or have access to data stored on end-users’ devices,&#8221; it writes, adding: &#8220;Today’s agreement allows the Portuguese presidency to start talks with the European Parliament on the final text.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reform of the ePrivacy directive has been stalled for years as conflicting interests locked horns &#8212; putting paid to the (prior) Commission&#8217;s hopes that the whole effort could be done and dusted in 2018. (The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/proposal-eprivacy-regulation">original ePrivacy reform proposal</a> came out in January 2017; four years later the Council has finally settled on its arguing mandate.)</p>
<p>The fact that the GDPR was passed first appears to have upped the stakes for data-hungry ePrivacy lobbyists &#8212; in both the adtech and telco space (the latter having a keen interest in removing existing regulatory barriers on comms data in order that it can exploit the vast troves of user data which Internet giants running rival messaging and VoIP services have long been able to).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a concerted effort to try to use ePrivacy to undo consumer protections baked into GDPR &#8212; including attempts to water down protections provided for sensitive personal data. So the stage is set for an ugly rights battle as negotiations kick off with the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Metadata and cookie consent rules are also bound up with ePrivacy so there&#8217;s all sorts of messy and contested issues on the table here.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">An update of the ePrivacy rules are very much necessary to protect confidentiality of our communications: in 2002, it still took 5 years until the first iPhone, and there was hardly any instant messaging, video calls, and no inescapable commercial tracking practices</p>
<p>&mdash; Sophie in &#39;t Veld (@SophieintVeld) <a href="https://twitter.com/SophieintVeld/status/1359489227608719363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Digital rights advocacy group <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/after-four-years-of-talks-eu-states-reach-underwhelming-agreement-on-eprivacy-reform/">Access Now</a> summed up the ePrivacy development by slamming the Council for &#8220;hugely&#8221; missing the mark.</p>
<p>“The reform is supposed to strengthen privacy rights in the EU [but] States poked so many holes into the proposal that it now looks like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/16/swiss-win-the-gruyere-cheese-war">French Gruyère</a>,&#8221; said Estelle Massé, senior policy analyst at Access Now, in a statement. “The text adopted today is below par when compared to the Parliament’s text and previous versions of government positions. We lost forward-looking provisions for the protection of privacy while several surveillance measures have been added.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group said it will be pushing to restore requirements for service providers to protect online users’ privacy by default and for the establishment of clear rules against online tracking beyond cookies, among other policy preferences.</p>
<p>The Council, meanwhile, appears to be advocating for a highly dilute (and so probably useless) flavor of &#8216;do not track&#8217; &#8212; by suggesting users should be able to give consent to the use of &#8220;certain types of cookies by whitelisting one or several providers in their browser settings&#8221;, per the Commission.</p>
<p>&#8220;Software providers will be encouraged to make it easy for users to set up and amend whitelists on their browsers and withdraw consent at any moment,&#8221; it adds in its <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/02/10/confidentiality-of-electronic-communications-council-agrees-its-position-on-eprivacy-rules/">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly the devil will be in the detail of the Council&#8217;s position there. (The European Parliament has, by contrast, previously clearly endorsed a &#8220;<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2017-0324_EN.pdf?redirect">legally binding and enforceable</a>&#8221; Do Not Track mechanism for ePrivacy so, again, the stage is set for clashes.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech-publisher coalition backs new push for browser-level privacy controls&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/tech-publisher-coalition-backs-new-push-for-browser-level-privacy-controls/embed/#?secret=BZ1BnDlvRG" data-secret="BZ1BnDlvRG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Encryption is another likely bone of ePrivacy contention.</p>
<p>As security and privacy researcher, Dr Lukasz Olejnik, <a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/proposed-amendments-to-eprivacy-regulation-are-great/">noted</a> back in mid 2017, the parliament strongly backed end-to-end encryption as a means of protecting the confidentiality of comms data &#8212; saying then that Member States should not impose any obligations on service providers to weaken strong encryption.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s notable that the Council does not have much to say about e2e encryption &#8212; at least in the PR version of its public position. (A line in this that runs: &#8220;As a main rule, electronic communications data will be confidential. Any interference, including listening to, monitoring and processing of data by anyone other than the end-user will be prohibited, except when permitted by the ePrivacy regulation&#8221; is hardly reassuring, either.)</p>
<p>It certainly looks like a worrying omission given recent efforts at the Council level to advocate for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/eu-council-wants-secure-encryption-and-lawful-data-access/">&#8216;lawful&#8217; access to encrypted data</a>. Digital and humans rights groups will be buckling up for a fight.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What we learn today will hopefully bear on other insurtech startups that want liquidity during the current cycle.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last night, MetroMile and SPAC INSU Acquisition Corp. II <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/09/2172551/0/en/METROMILE-COMPLETES-BUSINESS-COMBINATION-WILL-BEGIN-TRADING-ON-NASDAQ-AS-MILE.html">completed</a> their combination, putting the <a href="https://www.metromile.com/">per-mile auto insurance startup</a> up for regular trading today for the first time.</p>
<p>In the wake of last year&#8217;s debuts by neoinsurance companies Lemonade and Root, it&#8217;s not surprising to see others test the public markets. For example, Oscar Health recently announced its intention to go public via a traditional IPO.</p>
<p>How the new entrants will fare, however, is not clear.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>There is something of a tale of two companies in Lemonade and Root, with the pair valued at divergent multiples and sporting very different post-IPO trajectories, at least concerning their value.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />While Lemonade has appreciated greatly from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/understanding-hippos-valuation-in-a-post-lemonade-ipo-world/">its IPO price</a> ($29) to its current value ($155.33), Root&#8217;s share price dropped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/3-lessons-from-roots-ipo-pricing">from its debut</a> ($27) to today ($21.75).</p>
<p>This morning, as MetroMile starts its life as a public company, Oscar Health preps its own run at an IPO and other neoinsurance players <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201124005400/en/Hippo-Secures-350-Million-Capital-Investment">like Hippo wait in the wings</a>, let&#8217;s quickly check the difference between how Root and Lemonade have fared, and then ask what we can learn from their different valuation multiples and what they might mean for the next startup insurance players hoping to go public while the IPO window is wide open.</p>
<h2>Root, Lemonade</h2>
<p>Lemonade&#8217;s path to the public markets was one that started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/lemonade-targets-down-round-pricing-in-impending-ipo/">modestly with its first IPO pricing</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/insurtech-unicorn-lemonade-raises-ipo-range-ahead-of-debut/">improved</a>, and then, after technically going public at a down-round valuation, took off like a rocket. Root&#8217;s IPO pricing run involved what we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/root-targets-6b-valuation-in-pending-ipo-a-boon-for-insurtech-startups/">thought of as a strong IPO range</a> and then an above-target pricing.</p>
<p>But since then, Lemonade shares have rallied to several times their original price, while Root has dropped around 20%. Lemonade, for reference, sells rental insurance with an eye on going up-market in time to other forms of home-focused insurance. Root is in the auto insurance market, where MetroMile also works.</p>
<p>Both Lemonade and Root have yet to announce Q4 2020 results, so we&#8217;ll look at their Q3 details instead. We want to get a handle for how divergently their insurance incomes are being treated. This should give us a better understanding of how Wall Street values each, then we&#8217;ll apply what we learn to our two new companies. What we learn today will hopefully bear on other insurtech startups that want liquidity during the current cycle.</p>
<p>Results via <a href="https://ir.joinroot.com/static-files/2bbfd172-5dd2-470a-a3c9-654bffc10e14">the company</a>, comparisons are Q3 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root Q3 2020 revenue: $50.5 million (impaired from $75.8 million).</li>
<li>Root Q3 2020 gross profit: $0.7 million (improved from -$36 million).</li>
<li>Root Q3 2020 net loss: $85.2 million (improved from -$100.1 million).</li>
<li>Premiums in force: $600.1 million.</li>
<li>Valuation: $5.45 billion (Google Finance).</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives us Root revenue run rate multiple of around 27x, and a premium in force multiple of just over 9x. Now let&#8217;s observe Lemonade&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>Results via <a href="https://s24.q4cdn.com/139015699/files/doc_downloads/2020/11/Q3-2020-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">the company</a>, comparisons are Q3 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lemonade Q3 2020 revenue: $10.5 million (impaired from $17.8 million).</li>
<li>Lemonade Q3 2020 gross profit: $7.3 million (improved from $4 million).</li>
<li>Lemonade Q3 2020 net loss: $30.9 million (improved from $31.1 million).</li>
<li>Premiums in force: $188.9 million.</li>
<li>Valuation: $9.33 billion (Google Finance).</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the same two metrics, Lemonade has a run rate multiple of 222x, and a premium in force multiple of more than 49x.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexavontobel/">Alexa von Tobel</a> has a unique vantage point on the world of startups. She debuted in the tech space with the launch of LearnVest in 2009. The company raised nearly $70 million and sold to Northwestern Mutual in 2015 for an <a href="https://www.inc.com/video/how-alexa-von-tobel-took-learnvest-from-startup-to-a-375-million-exit.html?cid=sf01001">estimated $375 million</a>, according to reports.</p>
<p>Since, von Tobel has founded her own venture firm called Inspired Capital. Portfolio companies include Finix, Chief, Orum, Habi and more.</p>
<p>But before she was an entrepreneur, <em>or</em> the chief digital officer of a major financial services company (and then chief innovation officer, overseeing the Northwestern Mutual&#8217;s venture arm), <em>or</em> the founding partner of a venture capital firm, she was a certified financial planner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At TechCrunch Early Stage in April, von Tobel will lead a breakout on financial planning targeted specifically at early-stage startups.</p>
<p>Take a look:</p>
<h2><strong>Finance for Founders </strong></h2>
<blockquote><p>As a founder, you not only have to master your company&#8217;s finances, you also have to tackle your own personal finances. Managing your money as a founder comes with a unique set of questions. Leveraging her expertise from LearnVest and as a certified financial planner, Alexa will share financial planning best practices so founders can remove this layer of stress from the pressure of building a business.</p></blockquote>
<p>Early Stage is back in 2021 and better than ever. The event is centered around all the startup core competencies that founders will need in their tool chest to build successful businesses, from marketing to operations to fundraising.</p>

<p>Von Tobel joins an all-star lineup, which includes experts in the fields of sales, seed and Series A fundraising, recruiting and much much more. These experts will give presentations across a variety of topics, and then answer questions live from the audience.</p>
<p>The event is split across two days: On April 1 we&#8217;ll be hearing from experts in fundraising and operations, and on July 8 we&#8217;ll learn more from experts in fundraising and marketing. At both events, the TechCrunch pitch-off will be center stage, giving early-stage companies the chance to pitch to and get feedback from seasoned investors. Early Stage is entirely virtual, so folks from anywhere in the world can pick up a ticket and show up from the comfort of their couch.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope you&#8217;ll join us!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer genomics company Ancestry has confirmed it fought two U.S. law enforcement requests to access its DNA database in the past six months, but that neither request resulted in turning over customer or DNA data.</p>
<p>The Utah-based company disclosed the two requests in <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/cs/transparency?=cddc0d8327858468ebef3980bb17b283">its latest transparency report</a> covering the latter half of 2020. The report said Ancestry &#8220;challenged both of these requests, which were withdrawn,&#8221; and that the company &#8220;provided no data&#8221; at the time of the report, published Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ancestry did not say which agencies or police departments requested the DNA data or for what reason the company challenged the request. Ancestry spokesperson Gina Spatafore confirmed the search warrants were to obtain DNA data but declined to comment beyond what was in the report.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also said in its most recent report that it &#8220;refused numerous inquiries&#8221; from U.S. law enforcement for failing to obtain the proper legal process. The report also said the company received four valid law enforcement requests, but that it did not provide any data in response.</p>
<p>Ancestry has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/facebook-executive-deborah-liu-named-ceo-of-ancestry-com">more than 3.6 million subscribers</a> and has more than 18 million customer DNA profiles in its database, making it the largest in the world.</p>
<p>DNA profiling companies like Ancestry are increasingly popular with customers wanting to learn more about their family heritage, their genetic markers and to understand their cultural and ethnic backgrounds. But as these DNA databases become larger, they are also attracting attention from law enforcement who want access to help solve crimes.</p>
<p>On its website, Ancestry says: &#8220;We believe that the nature of our members&#8217; DNA data is particularly sensitive, so we insist on a court order or search warrant as the minimum level of due process before we will review our ability to comply with the request. We also seek to put our members&#8217; privacy first, so we also will try to minimize the scope or even invalidate the warrant before complying.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time Ancestry has pushed back against a legal demand. Last year the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/ancestry-warrant-dna-records/">said it rejected</a> an out-of-state search warrant, ordered by a court in Pennsylvania, to &#8220;seek access&#8221; to its DNA database on the grounds that the warrant was &#8220;improperly served.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ancestry has only complied <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/cs/transparency-2015">with one search warrant</a> for DNA data from a database it acquired and later made public, not realizing that police would <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/10/familial-dna-evidence-turns-innocent-people-into-crime-suspects/">use the database</a> to search for leads.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for companies with large amounts of customer data to frequently receive law enforcement demands for user data — or for companies to publish periodic transparency reports that detail the number of legal demands they receive.</p>
<p>To its credit, Ancestry is one of only two DNA profiling sites that publishes a transparency report. 23andMe <a href="https://www.23andme.com/transparency-report/">also publishes</a> the number of data demands it receives each quarter, but to date has not released any customer data to law enforcement. FamilyDNA said <a href="https://www.familytreedna.com/legal/law-enforcement-guide">over a year ago</a> that it was &#8220;working on publishing&#8221; a transparency report.</p>
<p>The move by Ancestry and 23andMe came shortly after police used DNA profiling site GEDmatch to identify the DNA of a suspected serial killer, a breakthrough that later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/hlavka-murder-gedmatch-dna/">led to the arrest</a> of the so-called Golden State Killer in 2018. GEDmatch said it was &#8220;not approached by law enforcement&#8221; prior to the search. GEDmatch soon after allowed its users to opt-in for their DNA to be included in police searches.</p>
<p>Last year, GEDmatch confirmed it was hit by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/gedmatch-investigating-dna-profile-law-enforcement/">two data breaches</a> that made user profiles visible to other users, including law enforcement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Maps is inching into more Waze-like territory with an update that will give drivers the ability to report road hazards, accidents or even speed traps. The new features are live in the iOS 14.5 beta, which is now open to public beta testers as well as developers, but won&#8217;t roll out to the general public until later this spring, Apple says.</p>
<p>To use the new features, drivers will be able to report road issues and incidents by using Siri on their iPhone or through Apple&#8217;s CarPlay. For example, during navigation, they&#8217;ll be able to tell Siri things like &#8220;there&#8217;s a crash up head,&#8221; &#8220;there&#8217;s something on the road,&#8221; or &#8220;there&#8217;s a speed trap here.&#8221; They&#8217;ll also be able to correct stale accident or hazard alert information by saying things like &#8220;the hazard is gone&#8221; or the &#8220;incident is no longer here.&#8221;</p>
<p>While using Siri makes the reporting experience safer, the updated app will also allow users to swipe up on the map to tap a report button to alert others to accidents, hazards or speed traps, as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The update could present a challenge to Google-owned navigation app Waze, which has long been a popular tool for staying alerted to road conditions, hazards, accidents and police presence. In Waze, users can interact by touching the screen or issuing commands <a href="https://support.google.com/waze/answer/9332876?hl=en">through Google Assistant</a>, but voice support for iOS users, naturally, is more limited. Today, Waze supports the use of Siri Shortcuts, which have to be manually configured and added to Siri, for example.</p>
<p>The new Apple Maps features could also make Apple&#8217;s app more appealing to users who feel their user data is safer within Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, thanks to the work Apple has done to position itself as the company that cares more about consumer privacy.</p>
<p>Notable, too, is the addition of speed traps, which represents a shift in direction for Apple Maps. Historically, Apple has been opposed to including police warnings in its product. But that lack of support has contributed to Google&#8217;s ability to dominate the navigation and mapping market on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s decision here also follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/google-maps-adds-more-waze-like-features-including-driving-incident-reports/">an expansion of Waze-like features</a> to Google Maps, blurring the distinctions between Google&#8217;s two navigation products even further. And as Google continued to roll out the ability to report accidents, traffic, speed traps and more to Google Maps users on iOS, it made it even harder for anyone who would have otherwise considered switching to Apple Maps to make the jump.</p>
<p>Apple, belatedly, has seemed to realize this as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The founders of <a href="https://inaccord.com/">Accord</a>, an early-stage startup focused on bringing order to B2B sales, are not your typical engineer founders. Instead, the two brothers, Ross and Ryan Rich, worked as sales reps seeing the problems unique to this kind of sale firsthand.</p>
<p>In November 2019, they decided to leave the comfort of their high-paying jobs at Google and Stripe to launch Accord and build what they believe is a missing platform for B2B sales, one that takes into account the needs of both the sales person and the buyer.</p>
<p>Today the company is launching with a $6 million seed round from former employer Stripe and Y Combinator. It should be noted that the founders applied to YC after leaving their jobs and impressed the incubator with their insight and industry experience, even though they didn&#8217;t really have a product yet. In fact, they literally drew their original idea on a piece of paper.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2111480" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111480" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111480" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="Original prototype of Accord sketched on a piece of paper." width="680" height="507" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg 1106w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?resize=768,572 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?resize=680,507 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111480" class="wp-caption-text">The original prototype was just a drawing of their idea. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Accord</p></div></p>
<p>Recognizing they had the sales skills, but lacked programming chops, they quickly brought in a third partner, Wayne Pan, to bring their idea to life. Today, they have an actual working program with paying customers. They&#8217;ve created a kind of online hub for B2B salespeople and buyers to interact.</p>
<p>As co-founder Ross Rich points out, these kinds of sales are very different from the consumer variety, often involving as many as 14 people on average on the buyer side. With so many people involved in the decision-making process, it can become unwieldy pretty quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We provide within the application shared next steps and milestones to align on and that the buyer can track asynchronously, a resource hub to avoid sorting through those hundreds of emails and threads for a single document or presentation and stakeholder management to make sure the right people are looped in at the right time,&#8221; Rich explained.</p>
<p>Accord also integrates with the company CRM like Salesforce to make sure all of that juicy data is being tracked properly in the sales database. At the same time, Rich says the startup wants this platform to be a place for human interaction. Instead of an automated email or text, this provides a place where humans can actually interact with one another, and he believes that human element is important to help reduce the complexity inherent in these kinds of deals.</p>
<p>With $6 million in runway and a stint at Y Combinator under their belts, the founders are ready to make a more concerted go-to-market push. They are currently at nine people, mostly engineers aside from the two sales-focused founders. He figures to be bringing in some new employees this year, but doesn&#8217;t really have a sense of how many they will bring on just yet, saying that is something that they will figure out in the coming months.</p>
<p>As they do that, they are already thinking about being inclusive with several women on the engineering team, recognizing if they don&#8217;t start diversity early, it will be more difficult later on. &#8220;[Hiring a diverse group early] only compounds when you get to nine or 10 people and then when you&#8217;re talking to someone and they are wondering, &#8216;Do I trust this team and is that a culture where I want to work?&#8217; He says if you want to build a diverse and inclusive workplace, you have to start making that investment early.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s early days for this team, but they are building a product to help B2B sales teams work more closely and effectively with customers, and with their background and understanding of the space, they seem well-positioned to succeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lang.ai, which has developed a no-code platform for businesses, closed on a $2 million seed funding round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s SaaS platform aims to allow business users to structure any free-text data with custom categories built through a drag &amp; drop interface, based on AI-extracted concepts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Village Global led the financing, which included participation from new and existing backers including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acceleprise, Oceans Ventures, Alumni Ventures Group, 2.12 Angels, GTMFund and Lorimer Ventures.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spain-born Jorge Peñalva founded <a href="https://lang.ai/">Lang.ai</a> in 2018 with the goal of giving any business user the ability “to build enterprise-ready natural language processing models in just minutes.” It was built to give non-engineers a way to automate repetitive tasks in use cases such as customer service and claims processing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It can be installed in our cloud or theirs,” Peñalva said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lang.ai saw its revenue double from the last quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021 and the seed funding was motivated mainly to continue that momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re getting demand in the form of projects with our larger customers, so we needed the funding to be able to support that demand,” Peñalva told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his previous role of CEO of Séntisis, Peñalva realized that processes driven by free-text data remained a blind spot for many companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Today, millions of dollars and hours are invested by companies to manually read and process textual information captured from disparate areas of their business,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His mission with Lang.ai is to “empower businesses to put AI to work for them, without the technical complexities of building and training custom algorithms.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Peñalva said that Lang.ai’s product analyzes a customer’s historical data “in minutes” and suggests AI-extracted concepts to build </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">custom categories through a drag &amp; drop interface. The custom categories are applied in real time to automate “tedious” tasks such as the manual tagging and routing of support tickets, the processing of insurance claims and the dispatching of field engineers to incoming work order requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Lang.ai’s goal is to remove the technical burden of implementing AI for a business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lang.ai’s community of users (called “Citizen NLP Builders”) consists of mostly non-technical business roles, ranging from customer service operations to marketers, business analysts and UX designers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers include Freshly, Userzoom, Playvox, Spain’s CaixaBank, Yalo Chat and Bancolombia, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Segal, director of infrastructural efficiency at Freshly, described the platform as “so nimble.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Out of the box, it took us two days to make automated tagging 15% more reliable than a previous platform that we had had in production for two years, with the added benefit that now all of our teams can tap into and exploit our support data,” Segal said. “The marketing team has built workflows to understand key customer moments. Our data and analytics team is super excited about having all these new tags in Snowflake, and it’s crazy how easy it is to use.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peñalva is proud of the fact that Lang.ai’s engineering team is primarily based in Spain and that he has been able to grow the 10-person company outside of his native country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With very few resources, it took us a little over two years to build an enterprise-grade product and find the right set of early customers and investors who are aligned with our vision,” he said. “I moved to the U.S. from Spain to build a global company and this is just the beginning&#8230;Lang has always been powered by immigrant hustle, and it has been core to our values since day 1.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei spoke rather diplomatically about the company’s hopes of holding talks with the new U.S. administration. The hardware giant is also taking a less conciliatory route, challenging its FCC designation as a national security threat.</p>
<p>The company this week filed a suit with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, calling the FCC ruling, “arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion and not supported by substantial evidence.”</p>
<p>Questions have swirled for years around the smartphone maker’s ties to the Chinese government, but the U.S. greatly ramped up actions against Huawei during the Trump years. The federal government has taken a number of routes to essentially kneecap the company, including, notably, its addition to the Department of Commerce’s “entity list,” which effectively barred it from working with U.S. companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Huawei likely sees a change in U.S. governance as an opportunity to be reevaluated by the powers that be. The company has long denied spying and other security charges. &#8220;I would welcome such phone calls and the message is around joint development and shared success.” Ren earlier this week told the media that he was eager to speak with Biden. “The U.S. wants to have economic growth and China wants to have economic growth as well.”</p>
<p>In a statement offered to<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-files-u-s-lawsuit-disputing-it-is-a-security-threat-11612880705"> The Wall Street Journal</a>, however, an FCC spokesperson stayed firm to the 2020 decision, stating, “Last year the FCC issued a final designation identifying Huawei as a national security threat based on a substantial body of evidence developed by the FCC and numerous U.S. national security agencies. We will continue to defend that decision.”</p>

<p>Thus far, the Biden administration hasn’t indicated any plans to soften restrictions on Huawei. Facing opposition from Republican lawmakers, Commerce Secretary nominee Gina Raimondo noted, “I currently have no reason to believe that entities on those lists should not be there. If confirmed, I look forward to a briefing on these entities and others of concern.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration does appear to be reviewing other actions against Chinese companies taken during the Trump administration. Notably, a planned forced sale of TikTok’s U.S. wing has been put on hold while the White House reassesses security concerns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The era of social audio 1.0 is in full swing, and while podcasts and Clubhouse have led the way, there are many other audio startups joining the fold. <a href="https://www.beta.wearequilt.com/">Quilt</a>, an audio social network that focuses on wellness and community, has raised a $3.5 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.mayfield.com/">Mayfield Fund</a>, with partner Rishi Garg joining the board, to do just that.</p>
<p>Quilt started as a community platform founded by Ashley Sumner, which let local folks meet up with one another in their own homes. Sumner was on the founding team at NeueHouse and has spent her career building community through physical space. Thousands of Quilt conversations were happening out of peoples&#8217; homes until the pandemic struck in March, resulting in an existential crisis for the startup.</p>
<p>Sumner quickly moved Quilt over to Zoom but soon realized that video chat didn&#8217;t quite capture the magic that was happening in person, nor did it prove the right medium to foster the type of conversations that had made Quilt so special.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She worked to develop an audio app that would become the new Quilt 2.0, which went live in the App Store at the end of January.</p>
<p>Quilt allows anyone to start a room for a conversation, dropping a line or two of text to describe what they want to talk about. The app is focused on wellness, breaking rooms into three different categories: spiritual and personal development (with conversations around meditation, astrology, human design, etc.), career and purpose (&#8220;it was very important to link purpose to it,&#8221; said Sumner, &#8220;these aren&#8217;t networking events&#8221;), and relationships, sex and family.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111506" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111506" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111506" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?w=680" alt="Quilt" width="680" height="368" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png 2960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=768,415 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=680,368 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=1536,830 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=2048,1107 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111506" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Quilt</p></div></p>
<p>The platform has put specific focus on balancing the engagement levels of content creators and consumers. According to Quilt, 98% of hosts attend other hosts&#8217; conversations and more than 50% of Quilters talk during any given conversation.</p>
<p>Garg, who has spent nearly two decades in the emerging media space, talked about how the engagement ratio among creators, consumers and &#8220;bystanders&#8221; is different for each social platform based on the medium and product choices.</p>
<p>&#8220;With YouTube, the famous number was 1% create, 9% engage and 90% sit back,&#8221; said Garg. &#8220;At Twitter, interestingly, it was 10%, 30%, 60%. If you look at something like Clubhouse, you&#8217;re seeing that parallel already happen. It&#8217;s like celebrity central. Part of what got us excited about Quilt was that anyone could just start a room. We really focused in on the pathway between being a consumer to being a creator. Starting or hosting a room is shorter than on any other social media platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that the norms within the Quilt community are a big part of what makes that possible, saying there is a hurdle associated with platforms that are more celebrity-driven or top-heavy. Consumers look at the bar that is set by the community and feel they&#8217;re not famous enough, or don&#8217;t have a big enough community to contribute, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of the magic of Quilt is that everyone can feel like they have something to offer,&#8221; Garg explained. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a lot more scalable and a lot less fragile than an ecosystem built entirely on celebrity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Retention also seems to be strong in Quilt&#8217;s early days, with 80% of sign-ups coming back for conversations every week. The company also said that around 60% of conversations are started spontaneously, rather than being a planned and promoted &#8220;event.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sumner says that Quilt will never generate revenue through advertising, but rather employ a freemium model.</p>
<p>Existing investors such as Freestyle VC&#8217;s Jenny Lefcourt and Upside Partnership&#8217;s Kent Goldman and Christina Hunt also participated in this latest round, alongside new investors, including Houseparty CEO Sima Sistani, The Mini Fund&#8217;s Eros Resmini, former Discord CMO Allison Stoloff and others.</p>
<p>The Quilt team is currently made up of eight people, 50% of whom are female and 25% of whom are non-Black people of color. Twenty percent are LGBT and 10% are non-binary.</p>
