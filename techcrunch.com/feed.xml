										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.swellenergy.com/">Swell Energy</a>, an installer and manager of residential renewable energy, energy efficiency and storage technologies, is raising $450 million to finance the construction of four virtual power plants representing a massive amount of energy storage capacity paired with solar power generation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a sign of the distributed nature of renewable energy development and a transition from large scale power generation projects feeding into utility grids at their edge to smaller, point solutions distributed at the actual points of consumption.</p>
<p>The project will pair 200 megawatt hours of distributed energy storage with 100 megawatts of solar photovoltaic capacity, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Los Angeles-based Swell was commissioned by utilities across three states to establish the dispatchable energy storage capacity, which will be made available through the construction and aggregation of approximately 14,000 solar energy generation and storage systems. The goal is to make local grids more efficient.</p>
<p>To finance these projects &#8212; and others the company expects to land &#8212; Swell has cut a deal with Ares Management Corp and Aligned Climate Capital to create a virtual power plant financing vehicle with a target of $450 million.</p>
<p>That financing entity will support the development of power projects like the combined solar and battery agreement nationwide.</p>
<p>Over the next twenty years, Swell is targeting the development of over 3,000 gigawatt hours of clean solar energy production, with customers storing 1,000 gigawatt hours for later use, and dispatching 200 gigawatt hours of this stored energy back to the utility grid.</p>
<p>It has the potential to create a more resilient grid less susceptible to the kinds of power outages and rolling blackouts that have plagued states like California.</p>
<p>“Utilities are increasingly looking to distributed energy resources as valuable ‘grid edge’ assets,” said Suleman Khan, CEO of Swell Energy, in a statement. “By networking these individual homes and businesses into virtual power plants, Swell is able to bring down the cost of ownership for its customers and help utilities manage demand across their electric grids,” said Khan. “By receiving <i>GridRevenue</i> from Swell, customers participating in our VPP programs pay less for their solar energy generation and storage systems, while potentially reducing the risk of a local power outage, and keeping their homes and businesses securely powered through any outages.”</p>
<p>Along with the launch of the virtual power plant financing vehicle, Swell is also giving homeowners a way to finance their home energy systems through Swell. They need the buy-in from homeowners to get these power plants off the ground, and for homeowners, there&#8217;s a way to get some money back by feeding power into the grid.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a win-win for the company, customers, and early investors like Urban.us, which was seed investor in the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disney just wrapped up the first segment of an investor day in which it laid out its plans for its direct-to-consumer streaming business, including Disney+, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hulu" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hulu">Hulu, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> ESPN+ and Hotstar/Star.</p>
<p>The company kicked off the presentation with some new subscriber numbers — 86.8 million for Disney+ (roughly 30% of those are subscribers to Disney+ Hotstar, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/disney-plus-india-launched-netflix-amazon-prime-video/"> leveraged an existing streaming service in India</a>), 38.8 million for Hulu and 11.5 million for ESPN+, adding up to more than 137 million subscribers across the company&#8217;s streaming business.</p>
<p>The rest of the event is expected to focus on content announcements and previews, but Chairman of Media and Entertainment Distribution Kareem Daniels has already hinted at big plans for the next &#8220;few years.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While high-profile Disney+&#8217;s originals have largely been limited to &#8220;The Mandalorian&#8221; and &#8220;Hamilton&#8221; in year one, Daniels said the company has plans to launch 10 Marvel series, 10 Star Wars series, 15 Disney Animation/Disney live action/Pixar series and 15 Disney Animation/Disney live action/Pixar feature films exclusively on Disney+.</p>
<p>At the same time, Daniels said that Disney remains committed to a variety of distribution strategies, particularly &#8220;theatrical exhibition’s ability to establish major franchises.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FhrWdi4jZu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/disney-73-million-subscribers/">Disney+ has more than 73M subscribers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Disney+ has more than 73M subscribers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/disney-73-million-subscribers/embed/#?secret=FhrWdi4jZu" data-secret="FhrWdi4jZu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He also announced that the Disney Animation film &#8220;Raya and the Dragon&#8221; will follow the same distribution strategy as &#8220;Mulan&#8221; this fall, with the film launching simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ as a Premier Access release that subscribers will need to pay extra to see.</p>
<p>The presentation also made it clear that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/disney-plus-india-launched-netflix-amazon-prime-video/">the Hotstar/Star brand will be key to Disney&#8217;s international growth plans</a>. In Latin America, the company plans to launch a standalone Star+ service, while a new Star section in the Disney+ app will become the home to &#8220;general entertainment&#8221; content (basically, the kinds of content that U.S. viewers will find on Hulu) in other markets like Europe.</p>
<p>Adding a Star section will mean introducing mature content to Disney+, which was previously limited to family-friendly content. So Disney also offered a quick demonstration of new parental controls that will allow subscribers to turn access to more mature content on and off — that should also introduce new content to other parts of Disney+, for example bringing the R-rated film &#8220;Logan&#8221; to the Marvel section.</p>
<p>You can also expect to see more integrations between different Disney streaming services. For example, Star+ will include content from ESPN, while Hulu will introduce the ability to subscribe and watch ESPN+ content directly in the app.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re a subscriber to the Disney bundle, which combines Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for $12.99 per month, the company plans to add a new tier in January that offers ad-free Hulu for an extra $6 per month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">[The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">stunning</a> debut of the food delivery company <a href="https://www.doordash.com/en-US">DoorDash</a> on the public market this week has plenty of people puzzled. While undeniably <a href="https://secondmeasure.com/datapoints/food-delivery-services-grubhub-uber-eats-doordash-postmates/">fast-growing</a>, the unprofitable delivery company that has come <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doordash-still-be-pocketing-tips-despite-pay-model-change-2019-8">under fire</a> numerous times over its <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/01/19/doordash-drivers-make-an-average-of-145-an-hour-analysis-finds/">employment practices</a>, and its IPO, like that of other gig-economy companies, leaves a lot of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d75f4dd3-6f48-4fea-93e8-4f60172aa9cf">economic issues unresolved</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">So why is a company that lost $667 million in 2019 and $149 million in the first nine months of 2020 &#8212; during a period of hypergrowth because of the pandemic &#8212;  being valued at $55.8 billion by public market investors? Have they lost their minds?</p>
<p class="p1"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/saar-gur" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="saar-gur">Saar Gur <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> thinks he has answers to such questions. Gur, a longtime general partner with the early-stage venture firm <a href="https://crv.com/">CRV</a>, was able to write a check to DoorDash in its earliest rounds, including its seed, Series A and Series B financings, and he suggests the firm&#8217;s stake in the business will return multitudes of the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/crvvc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="crvvc">CRV <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> fund from which those checks came. In short, he&#8217;s very far from biased. However, in a call earlier today, he painted a picture of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="doordash">DoorDash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wherein it not only becomes profitable but is 10 times larger than it is today based on how it evolves from here. Our conversation has been edited lightly for length and clarity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>TC: You wrote a seed check to DoorDash. Did you seek out the company or did the team pitch CRV?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">SG: I went on this hunt, looking for Tony. [Rival delivery service] Postmates had started two-and-a-half to three years earlier, and I thought the founder was great [but I wasn&#8217;t sure about investing]. Another company, Fluc, was run by this very scrappy entrepreneur, Adam, who was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/27/fluc-a-lyft-for-food-launches-in-san-francisco-and-mountain-view/">getting some buzz</a> in Palo Alto, and I was quite curious and met the team because we were in the food business and knew a lot of restaurant owners; my wife was a food entrepreneur and built this chain of homemade yogurt stores called Fraiche,</p>
<p class="p1">So I emailed my friend Misty, who was the general manager at the time of <a href="https://orenshummus.com/">Oren&#8217;s Hummus</a> on University Avenue [in Palo Alto[ and said, &#8216;We&#8217;re looking this company, Fluc, and we&#8217;d love to get your thoughts.&#8217; And she said, &#8216;The team is Fluc is okay; their technology is better [than some others], but they don&#8217;t understand our problems in a way that&#8217;s truly helpful to us. You should talk to these kids out of Stanford at DoorDash.&#8217;</p>
<p class="p1">If there&#8217;s any skill in investing, it&#8217;s not just confirmation bias of investing in Fluc [whose founders later moved on] but we did like a hard pivot and chased down the DoorDash team. We met them at Fraiche in Palo Alto,  and from that moment, it&#8217;s like we were finishing each other&#8217;s sentences.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>TC: What did you talk about?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">SG: The team from day one just talked about building a logistics company. For example, they understood Oren&#8217;s Hummus, which at that time was quite popular but had limited front-of-house seating and a big kitchen in the back. And [cofounder and CEO] Tony [Xu] and [cofounder turned VC] <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-doordash-fourth-cofounder-evan-moore-2020-12">Evan Moore</a> said at the time said, we want to target customers of popular concepts that have limited [seating] and extra kitchen capacity, and to integrate directly with the kitchen so we don&#8217;t have to interact with front-of-the-house staff.</p>
<p>At the time, Postmates had pivoted from waiting in line to get you a iPhone to delivering food, including from Fraiche, but they would send someone to your store, place the order and wait. DoorDash instead put an iPad</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve said that CRV missed out on Uber, that Travis Kalanick left your offices and headed over to Benchmark, where he told you right afterward that they wouldn&#8217;t let him leave until he signed a term sheet. Do you think Uber could or should have been DoorDash? I met with Travis in 2011, before DoorDash was founded, and he called Uber a logistics company that <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:N2vBq1zyuWMJ:https://www.venturecapitaljournal.com/on-a-ride-with-uber/+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">would deliver food and a lot of other things</a>. Given DoorDash&#8217;s dominant market share, do you think Uber waited too long to jump into deliveries? </strong></p>
<p>SG:  The<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> original Uber was not at all about food; it was that ride hailing hadn&#8217;t changed [over time]. Its Series A deck was a picture of a guy holding his hand up and trying to hail a taxi, with no real vision about food &#8212; at least at least that&#8217;s my recollection. Over time, it became Uber for everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But in terms what happened, DoorDash launched in Palo Alto. A number of other companies were in San Francisco, and Tony and the team had to decide whether to launch in San Francisco as its next major city or whether to launch somewhere else. And after a number of discussions that I was a part of, they focused on San Jose. Most people don&#8217;t know, but San Jose is something like the 10th largest city in the United States and its layout is much more similar to other mid-tier cities and suburban America than it is to San Francisco. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I think that was one key strategic decision. At the time, [larger rivals] GrubHub and Seamless had been proven [the model] in dense cities. It was really <em>not</em> obvious that it would work in San Jose or any suburb.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Clearly, investors are excited about what DoorDash has built &#8212; so excited that its stock went crazy yesterday. Are you, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gurley-doordash-ipo-pop-2020-12">like Bill Gurley</a>, frustrated that money was left on the table by its underwriters? Do you think traditional IPOs are broken?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">SG: I actually started my career at Lehman Brothers on the investment banking team, and so having seen the IPO process, while I can appreciate [frustration that a] company left some money on the table based on the pricing, the tactical challenge [is that] it&#8217;s very hard to predict. You know what the market will bear once it moves to retail investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">What&#8217;s exciting to me is [that] DoorDash is raising money because they are just getting started. I do think this could be a $500 billion-plus company. There&#8217;s so much to be excited about. As for the capital-raising event, I think it&#8217;s hard for the bankers to know where it will land with the broader market, so I&#8217;m not as negative as maybe some others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TC: Five-hundred billion dollars is a big number. How do you get there?</span></strong></p>
<p>SG: Let&#8217;s just start with food delivery. DoorDash&#8217;s suburban market share has grown to more than 60% and its overall U.S. market share is over 52%, so they&#8217;ve won the market in food delivery. And if you look at the [Chinese shopping platform] Meituan and other global food delivery businesses, that alone paints a path where DoorDash should be [valued at] $100 billion, assuming they continue to execute on the path that they&#8217;re on.</p>
<p>But the bigger story to me that I think many folks don&#8217;t understand is, if you go back to U.S. Postal Service, it used to take two weeks to get a letter. Then FedEx launches and all of a sudden the, the mail seems slow. The [net promoter score] was really high for the USPS until FedEx launched, or [think of] dial-up [internet access] which was great until [we had] broadband.</p>

<p>What we&#8217;re seeing is that consumers prefer immediacy and this magic ability to press a button and have ice cream delivered in under 25 minutes or milk, and you start to layer [items on] from there. We&#8217;ve partnered with Macy&#8217;s in December, for example, so if you buy a shirt or a dress, you can now have it at your house in an hour. When you look at the infrastructure that DoorDash has built to deliver on that vision, that&#8217;s where this company looks more like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s dreaming the dream, and that&#8217;s a very different business than ride-sharing and Uber&#8217;s core business.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re comparing DoorDash to Amazon, which is a much more capital-intensive business with lots of hard assets. Do you see DoorDash moving in that direction? Relatedly, what kinds of acquisitions would DoorDash be potentially interested in making?</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">SG: The company is always focused on technology first. <a href="https://www.doordash.com/drive/portal/discover">DoorDash Drive</a> is a product that many people don&#8217;t understand but it powers merchants that don&#8217;t want to roll out their own delivery network. Say you go to Walmart.com and order a bunch of groceries. DoorDash is powering those deliveries. Macy&#8217;s wants to roll out one-hour delivery. DoorDash Drive is allowing them to do that. DoorDash also now has a product that&#8217;s purely like a SaaS business that enables larger chains that want to control the whole experience of delivery with their own drivers to do that. Jimmy Johns [a sandwich chain] is ow running its entire order and deliver business with their own drivers, using DoorDash software.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">There are parts of DoorDash that are a true software business, just like AWS, and there are parts of it that are capital-intensive, like <a href="https://blog.doordash.com/introducing-dashmart-1891ecc0257d">Dashmart</a> [that rolled out this summer and which are convenience stores are owned and operated by DoorDash]. Will they buy 7-Eleven or something like that? We saw [deliver startup] goPuff <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/gopuff-acquires-bevmo/">acquire BevMo</a> last month; it&#8217;s not out of the question that there might be a reason to do that. With Dashmart, they already can see a lot of stuff based on data that people want to have immediately.</span></p>
<p class="p1">You know, I guess related to the answer question, and I don&#8217;t even know what it stands for but I know Uber at some point was looking into ghost kitchens, maybe like hadn&#8217;t had a stake in one in France. Is that something that doordash would potentially get into the business of like owning and running these so that it can also just, and I apologize that I&#8217;m not better versed in this but I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s got sort of like close relationships or owns anything like that already.</p>
<p><strong>TC: DoorDash has also ventured into the ghost kitchen market, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doordash-ghost-kitchen-silicon-valley-chick-fil-a-photos-2019-11">opening a facility</a> in Redwood City, south of San Francisco. Could this become a bigger initiative?</strong></p>
<p>SG: I think it&#8217;s definitely in the zone. DoorDash can use data and say, you know, you don&#8217;t need to build another Long John Silver or Taco Bell [to get closer to some of your customers]; you use our Redwood City Kitchen.We can already show you the data that [highlights how] deliveries that might take an hour could be turned into 15 minutes. They&#8217;re really facilitating the revenue growth of these concepts.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another set of entrepreneurs where they can use the data to say, for example, &#8216;Hey, there is no pizza restaurant in Palo Alto, so we&#8217;re just going to launch Saar&#8217;s Pizza Company to fill that hole and do it cost effectively because we don&#8217;t need to build a location out with seating and all the building codes involved serving customers in person.</p>
<p><strong>TC: In the meantime, one reads stories of restaurateurs who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/technology/delivery-apps-restaurants-fees-virus.html">complain about the fees</a> involved in working with DoorDash. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">SG: Having been a restaurant owner, I can tell you, even for my wife, who has a Wharton MBA, it&#8217;s very hard to keep track of all the numbers. You feel like everyone is screwing you; it&#8217;s just it&#8217;s really hard to run a small business. So it&#8217;s not based on great data or even if it is, if you view that DoorDash is adding incremental revenue, and if you understand the concept of marginal profit, then you should continue to sell things as you can make money on the margins of the food and you have the excess kitchen capacity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> If you look, that&#8217;s why DoorDash has signed [roughly] 45 of the top 50 quick-service restaurants. Those are quantitative groups and they wouldn&#8217;t do it do it for as long as they have and invest in these partnerships if it wasn&#8217;t working. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But there&#8217;s always going to be a sticker shock. </span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Regarding these quick-service restaurants and ghost kitchens, these systems are so efficient that the concern is that these mom-and-pop restaurants get wiped out. How do you think about that concern?</strong></p>
<p>SG: I think we are<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> social beings and we look for experiences [and] breaking bread with someone is not going away. I think smarter brands will &#8212; just like what we see in retail with physical locations and online locations &#8212; [be both offline and online]. Smarter concepts will understand how to build those brands across channels. And then I you know I still think that the Saisons of the world and the French Laundry will only continue to to do well post COVID as people look for these experiences of how to be together and share food, which is a passion of many folks.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: How does DoorDash itself become profitable? </strong></p>
<p>SG: If you check the facts, this summer the company was actually profitable. Not only that, they gave $120 million dollars, or they give credit, to other small businesses, in support of COVID, so had they not done that, they actually would have produced quite a bit of cash.</p>
<p>With run a company like DoorDash, you have to sell a big vision and be able to recruit, but you also need to be highly quantitative, and Tony has always been able to spit out numbers that are like accurate and set goals that are very quantitative. And while they they&#8217;re not profitable in the newer markets [because they are growing], they&#8217;ve got the cohorts to show you not only how they&#8217;re profitable in older markets but how their profitability expands over timein those markets. At any point, they could kind of slow their growth and become more profitable, but that&#8217;s not the playbook.</p>

This means that it&#8217;s one step closer to beginning to be administered to people in special circumstances – including for front-line healthcare workers dealing with healthcare facilities stressed to the breaking point due to the ongoing and rising pandemic crisis in the U.S., which continues to break grim records for single death counts among afflicted patients.</p>

<p>The Pfizer/BionNTech vaccine is an mRNA vaccine, which means that it provides a set of instructions to a person&#8217;s cells to prompt them to begin creating antibodies that are effective against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that leads to COVID-19. So far, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/pfizer-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-is-95-effective-in-final-clinical-trial-results-analysis/">vaccine has been shown to be 95% effective according to Pfizer&#8217;s own final trial data</a>. Based on the strength of those Phase 3 results, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/pfizer-and-biontech-to-submit-request-for-emergency-use-approval-of-their-covid-19-vaccine-today/">Pfizer applied for an EUA from the FDA towards the end of November</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Already, Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine has been approved for use in other countries, including Canada, where the national health regulator granted cleared it earlier this week. The FDA&#8217;s EUA process involves reviewing key information about efficacy and safety, and the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-holds-advisory-committee-meeting-discuss-authorization-covid-19?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">agency says that it has &#8220;reviewed thousands of pages of technical information&#8221;</a> about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, including materials related to its development and manufacturing, as well as the results of its clinical trials to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disney+, the on-demand streaming service that launched a year ago and has already courted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/disney-investor-day/">over 86 million subscribers</a>, is ready to expand to more international markets.</p>
<p>At its annual investor day Thursday, the American entertainment giant announced a new streaming brand called “Star” that will feature content from ABC, FX, and 20th Century Studios.</p>
<p>In some markets, such <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/with-lower-bandwidth-disney-opens-streaming-service-in-uk-ireland-5-other-european-countries-france-to-come-online-april-7/">as Europe</a>, Canada, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand, Star will be unveiled to customers as a new hub within Disney+ app beginning February 20 next year, the company said. It will expand Star to more markets next year, the company said, but it did not identify those markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Star will come at a price: The company said it will be increasing the monthly subscription price of Disney+ from £5.99 to £8.99 in Europe. The tariff will be similarly adjusted (raised) in every other market where Disney+ subscribers get access to Star, the company said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2085892" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/star-brand.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/star-brand.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/star-brand.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/star-brand.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/star-brand.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/star-brand.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/star-brand.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In Latin America, Star will be a standalone streaming service and offered under the brand name “Star+.” Star+ will launch in Latin America in June 2021, and will feature general entertainment movies and television shows as well as a lineup of live sports &#8212; thanks to ESPN &#8212; including soccer and tennis.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement appears to be an admission that Hulu, a streaming service also owned by Disney that has amassed about 39 million subscribers, will never go international.</p>
<p>Disney also hinted that it plans to expand Disney+ Hotstar, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/08/disney-plus-hotstar-subscribers-india/">on-demand streaming service it currently offers in India and Indonesia</a>, to more markets, but it did not name those markets. The company said today that Disney+ Hotstar account for roughly 30% of Disney+’s subscriber base, which roughly translates to 26 million. Disney+ Hotstar had about 18 million subscribers at the end of September, Disney revealed last month.</p>
<p>Until now, Disney has largely relied on its existing regional properties and industry collaborations to expand to several international markets. In France, for instance, the service is available as Canal+. In Spain, as Moviestar+.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever had a Father&#8217;s Day ad offering great deals for your dead dad sail into your inbox, you know that online advertising can be disturbing sometimes. Children&#8217;s gifts for people struggling to get pregnant, pet toys for your deceased doggo, the list goes on.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is taking a small but helpful step to help people control what ads they run into. Starting with YouTube in the U.S., users will be able to toggle off ads for alcohol and gambling — two subjects that are very sensitive for a big swath of people. The new option will roll out to Google Ads and non-U.S. YouTube early next year.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ads/greater-controls-sensitive-ad-topics-your-ad-settings">blog post Thursday</a>, the company said that it would add the option to its ad settings controls, which already allow people to turn off targeted advertising altogether. Technically Google says that uses who opt to limit gambling and booze ads will see &#8220;fewer&#8221; of them, but that language is likely allowing for anything that slips through accidentally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a sober person, this is a helpful decision for a lot of people I know who&#8217;d rather not run into booze deals online out of the blue. More of this please!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.gorgias.com">Gorgias</a> announced today that it has raised $25 million in Series B funding, bringing the startup&#8217;s pre-money valuation to $300 million.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/26/gorgias-series-a/">the company raised its Series A</a> just over a year ago, CEO Romain Lapeyre (who founded Gorgias with CTO Alex Plugaru) told me that it works with e-commerce businesses to automate responses to their most common customer service questions, while also providing tools that help the support team respond more quickly and even convince customers to buy additional products and services.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gorgias" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gorgias">Gorgias <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says it now supports more than 4,500 stores, including Steve Madden, Timbuk2, Fjällräven, Marine Layer, Ellana, Electrolux and Sergio Tacchini. And revenue has grown 200% this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That may not be surprising, given the overall growth in e-commerce during the pandemic. As Lapeyre put it, merchants saw &#8220;a huge boost&#8221; in online orders, which resulted in a similar rise in customer service requests — so they&#8217;re increasingly turning to Gorgias for help.</p>
<p>Initially, Lapeyre said merchants are just eager to respond to their customers more quickly and to make their support team more efficient. But over time, they become more interested in using customer support &#8220;as way to drive sales.&#8221; In fact, he recalled talking to one business that used to compensate its support team based on response time and now offers them a sales commission.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1916983" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1916983" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1916983" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?w=680" alt="Gorgias screenshot" width="680" height="517" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?resize=300,228 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?resize=768,584 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?resize=680,517 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1916983" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gorgias</p></div></p>
<p>He said he expects these trends to continue after the pandemic ends: &#8220;We just jumped five years into the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gorgias has now raised a total of $40 million. The new round was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sapphire-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sapphire-ventures">Sapphire Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from SaaStr, Alven, Amplify Partners, CRV and Greycroft.</p>
<p>Lapeyere said the money will allow Gorgias to continue hiring (it went from a team of 30 people to more 100 people this year), particularly on the engineering side, where it can develop even more automation for the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;As consumers increasingly shop online, the Gorgias platform powers a new breed of customer support for high-growth e-commerce brands,” said Sapphire Ventures Managing Director Rajeev Dham in a statement. “Co-founder and CEO Romain Lapeyre and team have built an incredible product that provides e-commerce merchants with a single app to manage all of their customer communications — ultimately delivering a far better customer experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>A Dremel is always practical to have around the home for DIY projects. Plus, there are tons of attachments and carving bits available for a huge range of uses. Lighter and more ergonomic than regular Dremels, the Dremel 2050 15 Stylo+ kit includes accessories to get started with wood carving, glass etching, leather burnishing and several other crafts so your recipient can customize almost anything.</p>

<p>Making cold process soap is fun and rewarding, but as a newbie, it can be daunting to stare at an ingredient list that includes lye, oils, fragrances and pigments. Bramble Berry&#8217;s beginners kits are the perfect way to get started and include everything your recipient needs, including safety googles (EXTREMELY important when handling lye) and a digital scale. Beginner kits include <a href="https://www.brambleberry.com/shop-by-product/kits/soap-making/natural-soap-kit-for-beginners---relaxing-lavender/V700027.html">lavender</a> and <a href="https://www.brambleberry.com/shop-by-product/kits/soap-making/natural-soap-kit-for-beginners---energizing-orange/V700041.html">orange</a> or, for soap makers with a bit more experience, <a href="https://www.brambleberry.com/shop-by-product/kits/soap-making/swirl-handmade-soap-kit---complete-kit/V700024.html">marble-like swirls</a>.</p>

<h2>Cricut Explore Air 2</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2085766" style="width: 1035px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085766" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2085766 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cricut.jpg" alt="" width="1025" height="456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cricut.jpg 1025w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cricut.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cricut.jpg?resize=300,133 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cricut.jpg?resize=768,342 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cricut.jpg?resize=680,303 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cricut.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085766" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cricut</p></div></p>
<p>Anyone who dabbles in crafting and DIY probably already knows what a Cricut is, but if not: it&#8217;s a robot with a friggin&#8217; knife attached to it.</p>
<p>That oversimplifies things a bit, but the Cricut is a device capable of cutting incredibly intricate designs with high precision, fast. It can handle cuts in a few minutes that would take <em>hours</em> to do by hand (and would totally leave your hand cramping.)</p>
<p>Tired of cutting things out? Swap out the blade for a pen, and have it draw or write, instead, or a scoring tool to prep paper projects for any folding they might need. It&#8217;ll help you make greeting cards, or gift boxes, or custom t-shirts, or stickers, or a mountain of other things. Cricut loaned me (Greg) a machine to check out a few weeks ago and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s been turned off for a full day since.</p>
<p>The Explore Air 2 is the company&#8217;s latest midrange device and can handle cutting paper, vinyl, cardstock, poster board, various fabrics and loads of other thin materials. The free design software that comes with it is way more capable than I expected, and they&#8217;ve got an add-on subscription service that can help you source ready-to-use art until you&#8217;re ready to bring your own. It&#8217;s got built-in Bluetooth for when you want to control it from your iOS or Android device, and can handle materials up to 12&#8243; wide. If you know anyone who already has a Cricut up and running, mats (sticky sheets that hold your material in place while the machine is cutting) and things like vinyl/cardstock are probably welcome stocking stuffers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><em>(And for anyone who&#8217;s ever thought about getting into laser cutting, the fundamentals are incredibly similar. While I hesitate to recommend anyone randomly buy a laser cutter as a gift because they require training to use safely, a lot of the core knowledge you pick up here — working with vector art, efficiently arranging things on your cutting surface, dealing with different materials, etc — will translate quite easily.)</em></p>
<p><b>Price: </b>$180 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078WFWM1F/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B078WFWM1F&amp;linkId=31a863b81c71bbb161857aed4e78307f">from Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Electric Eel Wheel Nano</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2081552" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081552" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2081552" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg" alt="Electric Eel Wheel Nano spinning wheel" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_EEWNano.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2081552" class="wp-caption-text">Electric Eel Wheel Nano spinning wheel. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dreaming Robots</p></div></p>
<p>Do you know someone who loves knitting, crocheting or weaving? Chances are if they love working with yarn, they might want to level up to spinning their own yarn. If you have a friend who is curious about spinning, but not ready to commit to a full-sized spinning wheel yet, consider gifting them the compact Electric Eel Wheel Nano. Of course, they’ll need fiber to spin. The Woolery’s hand spinner bundle includes five different kinds of wool so they can decide which one they like best.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $110 for the <a href="https://www.dreamingrobots.com/product/eew-nano">Electric Eel Wheel Nano</a> | $70 for <a href="https://woolery.com/hand-spinner-wool-bundle.html">the wool bundle</a></p>
<h2>Caran D’Ache Neocolor II</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2081553" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081553" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2081553" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg" alt="Caran D'Ache Neocolor II water soluble pastels" width="1024" height="876" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg?resize=300,257 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg?resize=768,657 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg?resize=680,582 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GG2020_Neocolor.jpg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2081553" class="wp-caption-text">Caran D&#8217;Ache Neocolor II water soluble pastels. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Caran D&#8217;Ache</p></div></p>
<p>Caran D’Ache Neocolor II water-soluble pastels are extremely satisfying to work with. First, you lay down a light or thick layer of pigment. Then you can smush it around, like with oil pastels. And <em>then</em> you can brush water over everything to turn it into a vibrant painting. Depending on how Neocolor II is used, it works on many different materials in addition to paper, including glass and textiles (cover designs with a piece of scrap fabric and then heat set it with an iron).</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Starts at $14.99 for a box of 10 colors<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009I8LEU/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0009I8LEU&amp;linkId=5e77356554a5b1dcac0aa686a6e1e7c9"> on Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Apple Pencil</h2>
<p><div style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/appleevent_2015_62.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>This one really only works if they&#8217;ve already got a relatively recent iPad (or you&#8217;re looking to buy them one of those, too). But if they do, an Apple Pencil can really help them take things to the next level. From sketching out ideas in Procreate (also a great gift, if they don&#8217;t have it!), to jotting down measurements in the Notes app, to creating vector art for cutting/etching/t-shirt making, a really good stylus is<em> leagues </em>ahead of just poking at the screen with your finger. It can be a<em> little </em>tricky to determine which Pencil is compatible with which iPad, so you might have to do some sleuthing there.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$99 to $129 <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/select-apple-pencil">from Apple</a>, depending on which one you want.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast (<a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">now on Twitter!</a>), where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>What a week, yeah? Instead of the news cycle slowing as the year races to a close, things are still as hot as ever. We have funding rounds big and small, IPOs, first-day extravaganza and more.</p>
<p>Luckily we had the whole crew around &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">me</a>. Here’s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Career Karma <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/career-karma-series-a/">raised $10 million</a>, and we have thoughts and concerns.</li>
<li>Skyflow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">raised $17.5 million</a> in an effort to try to get the Equity team to understand the nuances of different encryption types.</li>
<li>Calm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/">raised $75 million</a>, which felt pretty reasonable given reports and its fundraising history.</li>
<li>Squire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/squire-series-c/">tripled its valuation</a> in a new round that included $45 million in equity capital along with some debt.</li>
<li>We also talked about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">DoorDash and C3.ai IPO pops</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/airbnb-said-to-price-ipo-between-67-and-68/">where Airbnb priced</a>, and who is coming next.</li>
<li>We rounded off with what&#8217;s up with TikTok stars investing in tech startups. Danny was not a fan.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s that! If you aren&#8217;t tired, have you even been paying attention?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After pricing above its raised range last night, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="airbnb">Airbnb <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> opened this morning at $146 per share, up around 115% to kick off its life as a public company.</p>
<p>The company is now worth $158 per share. Using its IPO share count inclusive of shares reserved for underwriters, the company is worth $95.1 billion, but on a fully diluted basis, including shares that could be exercised or awarded in the future, Airbnb is worth much more.</p>
<p>The home-sharing unicorn initially targeted $44 to $50 per share in its debut, later raising that range to $56 to $60 before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/airbnb-said-to-price-ipo-between-67-and-68/">pricing at at $68 per share</a>. To open at such a premium is not shocking given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">how the debuts of DoorDash and C3.ai performed earlier in the week</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Taken as a trio, the companies&#8217; amped public debut are stoking concerns of mispriced IPOs.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>However, taken as a trio, the companies&#8217; amped public debut are stoking concerns of mispriced IPOs and, at least in my head, public markets that are more enthusiastic than reasonable.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The explosive debuts of the enterprise AI company, the home-sharing giant and the food-delivery leader were not the first IPOs of 2020 to set off fireworks when trading began. Snowflake, another megadebut, gained more than 100% in its first trading day, despite pricing above its own raised IPO price range.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on? Let&#8217;s use Snowflake as a prism through which we can figure it out. Lemonade, the summer insurtech IPO, will also provide some useful guidance.</p>
<h2>Was Snowflake underpriced?</h2>
<p>When Snowflake&#8217;s IPO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/go-public-now-while-software-valuations-make-no-sense-part-ii/">went out with a thunderclap</a>, it was more ammunition for critics of the traditional public offering. <em>The company and its private investors had done so much work to get Snowflake to the public markets,</em> complaints seemed to go, <em>and then some idiot bankers mispriced its debut by 100%, rewarding their clients and screwing the company? Awful!</em></p>
<p>So went the argument. However, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/19/was-snowflakes-ipo-mispriced-or-just-misunderstood/">as I wrote at the time</a>, leaning on the work of Forbes&#8217; excellent reporting, Snowflake&#8217;s CEO was not fully bought into the concept:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alex Konrad at Forbes — a good chap, follow him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/alexrkonrad">here</a> — caught up <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/09/17/snowflake-ceo-frank-slootman-talks-ipo-pop-narrative-of-lost-billions-is-nonsense-talk/#79e69e937d1d">with Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman about the matter</a>. He called the “chatter” that his company left money on the table “nonsense,” adding that he could have priced higher but that he “wanted to bring along the group of investors that [Snowflake] wanted, and [he] didn’t want to push them past the point where they really started to squeal.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the &#8220;long-term investor&#8221; argument that you will hear on any call with a CEO on their IPO day. It goes like this: If you want long-term holders of the stock, you have to find a price that they will accept; that price may be different than what retail investors will pay when the company begins to trade. So, the gap, or pop, is fine as you are trading one thing for another.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

			The coronavirus pandemic accelerated America’s addiction to technology, and it’s making us sad, anxious and unproductive.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>My perspective is as a former tech CEO and technology addict. The marketing platform I founded raised over $100 million, grew to 350 employees and sold to a private equity firm last year. Along the way I picked up some terrible tech habits; I checked email constantly and allowed push notifications to interrupt every in-person interaction.</p>
<p>My tech use hit rock bottom last year on a visit with family. I resolved to put down my phone and garden with my mom, who has advanced Parkinson&#8217;s and moves slowly and with intention.</p>
<p>I felt like an addict in withdrawal. My phone was like a magnet pulling me to check for missed work emails or breaking news. Tech overuse had rewired my brain, lowered the quality of everyday consciousness and prevented me from being present.</p>
<p>I stepped down as CEO of my company earlier this year. I’ve spent my time off learning about mindfulness, neuroplasticity and technology addiction. Most importantly, I developed a strategy for managing my tech use that’s made me happier and more productive.</p>
<p>Here’s what I learned.</p>
<h2>Tech firms exploit our brains to capture our attention</h2>
<p>In their quest for our attention, some tech firms target the oldest parts of our brain, what UCLA psychiatrist Daniel Siegel calls the <em>downstairs brain</em>. The <em>downstairs brain </em>includes your brainstem and limbic regions, which control innate reactions and impulses (fight or flight) and strong emotion (like anger and fear). In contrast, your <em>upstairs brain</em>, including your cerebral cortex, is where intricate mental processes take place, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mindsight-New-Science-Personal-Transformation/dp/0553386395">thinking, imagining and planning</a>.</p>
<p>The downstairs brain is reactive. It’s designed to protect us in emergencies; it can make quick judgements, hijack our consciousness and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4678200/">drive action through strong emotion.</a> The downstairs brain is what is targeted by attention-seeking products. Headlines that make us feel outraged and TikTok notifications that make us feel reactive appeal to our downstairs brain.</p>
<h2>Spending time in a reactive state rewires our brains</h2>
<p>Our brains change with training. Research has shown that our brains are reprogrammed with the firing patterns of neurons. Our nervous system can be rewired and transformed through repetitive, focused attention or activity in a process called <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01657/full">neuroplasticity</a>.</p>
<p>Repetitive device usage is a perfect example of neuroplasticity at work. The more time we spend responding to push notifications, watching videos in infinite scroll or looking for social validation from social media, the more our brains will rewire to want the same.</p>
<h2>Our addiction will get worse as firms get better at capturing attention</h2>
<p>While many tech firms acknowledge problems from overusing their products, none will make radical changes needed to decrease their share of the attention profit pool. If they did, someone else would eat their lunch.</p>
<p>These firms are selling us sugary drinks. The taste is improving exponentially and the sweetest drinks haven’t been invented yet. The more we drink, the harder it gets to stop. We need to take control of our consumption and habits — we need to follow a technology diet — or we will suffer the mental equivalent of morbid obesity.</p>
<h2>We can can rewire our brains to be more productive and happier by changing our habits</h2>
<p>If we think of technology consumption as an analog to food consumption, tech products fall into four food groups based on the quality of information and method of delivery. Content quality is important: Some content is valuable (e.g., MIT’s online courseware) or critical (work email), while most is not useful (<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tiktok">TikTok) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The delivery model is also important. Healthy platforms give agency to the user and allow us to pull content that’s useful when we need it. Conversely, harmful platforms often rely on push, sending us information that’s often not useful at a time when we’re doing something else. Based on my experience, here are three steps we can take to implement a tech diet:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Eliminate products that reinforce your downstairs brain (low-quality content pushed to you)</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion">Willpower is finite</a>. If we don’t want sugary drinks, don’t keep them in the house. We keep the most distracting applications ever developed within arms reach at all times. These applications prey on our downstairs brain, which hijacks our better intentions <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/its-official-more-you-use-facebook-worse-you-will-feel-about-yourself.html">and delivers negative value for most people</a>. I believe our best defense is abstinence; we shouldn’t use these apps.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>I use Apple’s Content Restrictions on the iPhone and MacBook. I added the obvious offenders: TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and some specific to me, which includes <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zillow" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zillow">Zillow, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> StreetEasy and NYPost. My spouse has the override code. I can break it if needed, but the process is hard enough that it doesn’t enter everyday consciousness.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Consume more products that reinforce your upstairs brain (high-quality content that’s available when we need it)</strong></h3>
<p>Good content expands our knowledge and skills and may contribute to rewiring our upstairs brain in a way that adds to our empathy, imagination and mindfulness.</p>
<p>Consuming good content is rewarding but effortful. It requires <a href="http://www.theinvisiblegorilla.com/gorilla_experiment.html">uninterrupted focus</a>. Unlike sugary beverages, which we’re wired to consume subconsciously, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555">leafy greens have to be consumed intentionally</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Make a list of your favorite leafy greens. For me, this includes Kindle, Feedly, tech periodicals and my favorite curation platforms: HackerNews and Product Hunt. Calm, one of several booming mindfulness apps, also makes the list. These are the only apps on my home screen, which encourages me to use them more often. Like a food diet, I set attainable goals for “good” consumption and monitor my progress.</p>
<p>I recommend fasting on technology periodically; I leave my phone at home for walks with my son and dinner with friends. I also recommend nontech activities that promote upstairs brain rewiring like an outdoor hike or learning to play an instrument.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Redesign consumption patterns for productivity tools</strong></h3>
<p>Email is required for most people. It has the potential to make us productive. But the average message quality is low, and the always-on, high frequency, push-by-default design <a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/context-switching/">prevents us from doing our best work</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>I’ve turned off notifications on everything that’s not meant for urgent or timely messages (e.g., texts, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lyft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lyft">Lyft, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Tovala oven). <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/boomerang-for-gmail/mdanidgdpmkimeiiojknlnekblgmpdll?hl=en">Boomerang’s Chrome Extension</a><sup> </sup>can be set up to deliver all of your emails every hour on the hour. Batch processing email every hour dramatically reduces the volume of interruption without impacting my responsiveness.</p>
<p>We live in relative abundance, with food, goods and security that would make even our recent ancestors envious. But abundance doesn’t make us happy; <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/the-sad-state-of-happiness-in-the-united-states-and-the-role-of-digital-media/">we’re the least happy on record</a>. We seem to be living in a collective state of <em>downstairs brain</em>, a continuous adult temper tantrum focused on strong feelings, emotion and impulsiveness.</p>
<p>But there’s hope.</p>
<p>As individuals, I found that even a few months of technology dieting helped me become less impulsive and more mindful. As employees, we can stop working for companies that profit from the attention economy. As managers, we can insist that our teams turn off their devices at night, turn off their Slack notifications and take real vacations. As parents, we can help our children develop healthy consumption patterns.</p>
<p>Collective action — and rewiring of our brains — could change the course of our politics and our ability to collaborate and solve the most important challenges of the 21st century.</p>
<p>American innovation dominates the attention economy. It’s time for American innovation to dominate the way we use technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A group of industry heavyweights, including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Box, Citrix, Dell, Imprivata, Intel, Okta, RingCentral, Slack, VMware and Zoom, today announced the launch of the <a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/moderncomputing/">Modern Computing Alliance</a>.</p>
<p>The mission for this new alliance is to &#8220;drive ‘silicon-to-cloud’ innovation for the benefit of enterprise customers &#8212; fueling a differentiated modern computing platform and providing additional choice for integrated business solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Whoever wrote this mission statement was clearly trying to see how many words they could use without actually saying something.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here is what the alliance is really about: Even though the word <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/chrome-37d2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="chrome-37d2">Chrome <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> never appears on its homepage and Google&#8217;s partners never quite get to mentioning it either, it&#8217;s all about helping enterprises adopt Chrome and Chrome OS. &#8220;The focus of the alliance is to drive innovation and interoperability in the Google Chrome ecosystem, increasing options for enterprise customers and helping to address some of the biggest tech challenges facing companies today,&#8221; a Google spokesperson told me.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bh-QHw71ptg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure why it&#8217;s not called the Chrome Enterprise Alliance, but Modern Computing Alliance may just have more of a ring to it. This also explains why <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> isn&#8217;t part of it, though this is only the initial slate of members and others may follow at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Led by Google, the alliance&#8217;s focus is on bringing modern web apps to the enterprise sector, with a focus on performance, security, identity management and productivity. And all of that, of course, is meant to run well on Chrome and Chrome OS and be interoperable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The technology industry is moving toward an open, heterogeneous ecosystem that allows freedom of choice while integrating across the stack. This reality presents both a challenge and an opportunity,&#8221; Google&#8217;s Chrome OS VP John Solomon writes today.</p>
<p>As enterprises move to the cloud, building better web applications and maybe even progressive web applications that work just as well as native solutions is obviously a noble goal and it&#8217;s nice to see these companies work together. Given the pandemic, all of this has taken on a new urgency now, too. The plan is for the alliance to release products &#8212; though it&#8217;s unclear what form these will take &#8212; in the first half of 2021. Hopefully, these will play nicely with any browser. A lot of these &#8220;alliances&#8221; fizzle out quite quickly, so we&#8217;ll keep an eye on what happens here.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: The industry has a long history of alliances like these. Here&#8217;s a fun 1991 story about a CPU alliance between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/08/business/new-computer-alliance-forms.html">Intel, IBM, MIPS and others</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="spotify">Spotify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said it has reset an undisclosed number of user passwords after blaming a software vulnerability in its systems for exposing private account information to its business partners.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20422370-spotify-breach-notice-letter-californiadocx">a data breach notification</a> filed with the California attorney general&#8217;s office, the music streaming giant said the data exposed &#8220;may have included email address, your preferred display name, password, gender, and date of birth only to certain business partners of Spotify.&#8221; The company did not name the business partners, but added that Spotify &#8220;did not make this information publicly accessible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotify said the vulnerability existed as far back as April 9 but wasn&#8217;t discovered until November 12. But like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/decoding-data-breach-notice/">most data breach notices</a>, Spotify did not say what the vulnerability was or how user account data became exposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have conducted an internal investigation and have contacted all of our business partners that may have had access to your account information to ensure that any personal information that may have been inadvertently disclosed to them has been deleted,&#8221; the letter read.</p>
<p>Spotify spokesperson Adam Grossberg confirmed that a &#8220;small subset&#8221; of Spotify users are affected, but did not provide a specific figure. Spotify has more than 320 million users, and 144 million subscribers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the second time in as many months that the company has reset user passwords.</p>
<p>Last month security researchers found an unsecured database, <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/reports/2020/11/spotify-resets-some-user-logins-after-hacker-database-found-floating-online/">likely operated by hackers</a>, allegedly containing around 300,000 stolen user passwords. The database was probably used to launch credential stuffing attacks, in which lists of stolen passwords are matched against different websites that use the same password.</p>
<p>Although in that case the exposed data did not come from Spotify, the company reset the passwords on affected user accounts.</p>

<p>Cityblock works with community caregivers to work with residents to provide primary care, behavioral health and other services to address social determinants of health, in person and&#8230; increasingly&#8230; through virtual consultations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company first spun out of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/alphabet" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="alphabet">Alphabet&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Sidewalk Labs in 2017 and initially partnered with EmblemHealth. By relying primarily on licensed clinical social workers, community health partners and a network of specialized practice clinicians and doctors to provide basic primary care and supporting health services, Cityblock believes it can drive down the costs of healthcare.</p>
<p>Some 70,000 patients use Cityblock services in four major U.S. cities, the company said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To date, Cityblock has raised $300 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company said in a statement that the new funding will be used to support Cityblock’s national expansion in caring for Medicaid and dually-eligible communities, to attract and onboard talent across its product, engineering, data science, clinical and business operations, to launch new service lines and to continue investing in its proprietary technology platform, Commons.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is partnering with Snap to bring tweets into Snapchat with a native integration that both companies hope will push users away from screenshots and toward more interactive embeds.</p>
<p>Twitter users who are also logged into the Snapchat app on their phone will be able to access the functionality by tapping share on a particular tweet and navigating to the Snapchat icon where they&#8217;ll be able to share and react or comment on a Twitter post and send it to a friend or share on their story. The functionality will notably only work for tweets from public accounts, not protected ones.</p>
<p>The feature is rolling out on iOS for now, with Android integration &#8220;coming soon.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2085315" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085315" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2085315 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="258" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png 3531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?resize=150,57 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?resize=300,114 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?resize=768,291 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?resize=680,258 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?resize=1536,582 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?resize=2048,777 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085315" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/snapchat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="snapchat">Snap</p></div></p> <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>
<p>Given how much content across Snapchat, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Facebook and Reddit originates from Twitter, it&#8217;s surprising that this functionality is arriving so deep into Twitter&#8217;s life as a company. They&#8217;ve long had a web embed integration which has allowed reporters to embed tweets into stories, but when it came to sharing on social media, Twitter&#8217;s strategy has deferred to the un-trackable and un-monetizable screenshot.</p>
<p>This has been low-hanging product rollout for Twitter, which will likely be able to coax some non-Twitter users to enjoy content straight from the source, something the company has been vaguely alluding to in marketing campaigns over the years but is just now approaching with a direct integration into another company&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>With Twitter now starting to roll out its Stories product Fleets to users, the company likely feels as though they have more feature familiarity to bring new users onboard from Snap who might not have experimented with the platform previously.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wPoYjxTdVn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">Twitter rolls out Stories, aka &#8216;Fleets,&#8217; to all users; will also test a Clubhouse rival</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The truth is there aren&#8217;t a ton of integrations across social media channels; screen recordings and screen shots tell one platform&#8217;s story in an imperfect way on another&#8217;s. This integration comes as a result of updates made to Snap&#8217;s Snap Kit API and a particular feature called Creative Kit. Snap says that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="spotify">Spotify, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Reddit, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/soundcloud" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="soundcloud">SoundCloud, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Sendit, YOLO and GOAT have also created integrations that allow content from those apps to be shared across Snapchat.</p>
<p>Twitter didn&#8217;t rule out the expansion of this feature to other platforms in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;This agreement with Snap was focused on this feature,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We would love to partner with other platforms to enable people to share Tweets more widely. We hope this will be the first of many integrations of its kind.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/donotpay" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="donotpay">DoNotPay, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the consumer advice company that started out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/donotpay-launches-1000-new-bots-to-help-you-with-your-legal-problems/">helping people easily challenge parking tickets</a>, has come a long way since it launched. It&#8217;s expanded to help consumers cancel memberships, claim compensation for missed flights and even sue companies for small claims. In the early days of the pandemic, the startup helped its users file for unemployment, where many state benefit sites crashed.</p>
<p>Now the so-called &#8220;robot lawyer&#8221; has a new trick. The startup now lets you request information from U.S. federal and state government agencies under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>FOIA allows anyone to request information from the government, with some exceptions. But ask anyone with experience in filing FOIAs (hello!) and they can tell you that requesting data requires skill and practice to avoid having the request thrown out for being too broad, or not being specific enough. And when you do eventually get something back, it might <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/15/green-card-immigration/">not be what you expect</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where DoNotPay wants to help. The new feature guides you through how to file a request for information, as well as wrangle the fee waivers and option to expedite processing — which is up to you to convince the government department why you should get the information for free and faster than regular FOIA requests. (In reality, the FOIA system is massively under-resourced, and responses can take months or years to get back.) After asking you a series of questions and what you want to request, DoNotPay generates a formal FOIA request letter using your answers and files it to the government agency on your behalf.</p>

(Screenshot: TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>DoNotPay&#8217;s founder and chief executive Joshua Browder said he&#8217;s hoping the new feature can help consumers &#8220;beat bureaucracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hundreds of users have requested a FOIA product, because the government makes it deliberately difficult and bureaucratic to exercise these rights,&#8221; Browder told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Browder said that DoNotPay &#8220;would not exist&#8221; without FOIA laws. &#8220;When we got started appealing parking tickets, we used previous requests to see the top reasons why parking tickets were dismissed,&#8221; he said. Browder said he&#8217;s hoping the feature will help consumers uncover more injustices — just like with parking tickets — to feed his product with more features. &#8220;The overall strategy is to use any interesting FOIA data to build great new DoNotPay products,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>DoNotPay raised $12 million in its Series A earlier this year, led by investment firm Coatue Management, with participation from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="andreessen-horowitz">Andreessen Horowitz, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Founders Fund and and Felicis Ventures. The startup has 10 employees, including Browder, and is valued at about $80 million, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>The FOIA filing feature is free for academics and journalists, and is included as part of the company&#8217;s subscription service of $3 per month for everyone else.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In North America, shoppers are increasingly turning to online orders to buy their products.</p>
<p>National postal services have seen a significant uptick in parcel volumes; so many that the <a href="https://www.canadapost.ca/web/en/kb/details.page?article=coronavirus_faq&amp;cat=generalinquiries&amp;cattype=kb&amp;subcat=generalinformation">number matches those sent during the Christmas surge</a> — minus the wrapping paper. But although the pandemic has acted as a catalyst for online shopping, it’s part of a continuing trend.</p>
<p>The online sector has slowly been eating up the percentage of sales from retail stores. Virtual shopping’s total share of the global market <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/534123/e-commerce-share-of-retail-sales-worldwide/">has doubled between 2015 and 2019</a>, with the U.S. Department of Commerce reporting that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/02/online-shopping-officially-overtakes-brick-and-mortar-retail-for-the-first-time-ever.html">online retail sales overtook general merchandise stores</a> in the country for the first time in February 2019.</p>
<p>As customers have turned to their web browsers, shop vacancies are on the rise around the world, with big brands <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4e5e1022-8df3-11e9-a1c1-51bf8f989972">deserting even New York’s Fifth Avenue</a>.</p>

		<blockquote>
			&#8220;Within the next five years, I think we&#8217;re going to see that having AR and 3D on your dot-com and beyond will be mandatory.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The high street has been forced into a period of transformation. Now, forward-thinking companies are finding ways to adapt.</p>
<h2>New realities in retail</h2>
<p>In 2019, Charles Bergh, the CEO of Levi’s, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/emerging-technologies/augmented-shopping-3d-technology-retail.html">proclaimed</a> that stock sizes for clothes would be gone within a decade. Body scanning and made-to-order items would replace the letters and numbers found on the labels of clothes, and products would no longer be found by scrolling through images or browsing shop floors. Instead, customers would select their products — a pair of shoes, a new coffee table, a snapback hat — and customize it to their own specifications. These clothes or items would be tried on or placed within a virtual scan of their room, all without leaving the couch.</p>
<p>Using 3D modeling and augmented reality (AR) — a technology that places computer-generated images onto the real world — Bergh’s vision is already possible.</p>
<p>One of the first sectors to take advantage of the nascent technology was the furniture industry. Leading retailers like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wayfair" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wayfair">Wayfair <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and IKEA invested early into 3D and AR, allowing customers to physically visualize their products inside their spaces. For Shrenik Sadalgi, the director of Research and Development at Wayfair Next — the arm of the furniture giant that uses technology to make shopping more seamless — adding the two technologies to its sales arsenal was an obvious choice for the company.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wayfair" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wayfair">Wayfair’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> customers can take advantage of two AR experiences. The first, View in Room 3D, lets users place an accurately sized piece of furniture into their room, twist and move it in the space, and even walk around it in real time. Room Planner 3D goes further, allowing customers to visualize the piece of furniture in their home even when they’re on the go.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re letting customers capture the space first,” Sadalgi says of Room Planner 3D. “So you take a photo, and that photo is a very piece of rich information about your room. At a later point in time — maybe you&#8217;re on the subway, or maybe you&#8217;re at a friend&#8217;s house or whatever — you can pull up your room, and then you can add furniture as if you were there. So you don&#8217;t have to actually be in the space to plan your space.”</p>
<p>It’s not just homeware companies that have embraced the digital option. Augmented reality has found a natural fit in the beauty industry, and like major furniture retailers, bigger brands have been using the tech for several years. The experiences they offer continue to be refined as the technology improves. Leading players like L’Oréal, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sephora" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sephora">Sephora, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Procter &amp; Gamble, and more have been honing their version of the AR over time, offering customers a more interactive shopping experience.</p>
<p>For Lynda Pak, senior vice president at beauty powerhouse Estée Lauder, AR lets shoppers gain a familiarity with many of the products within its portfolio of 29 brands.</p>
<p>“AR is becoming a way for a consumer to be able to engage with a beauty advisor or makeup artist,” she says. “It may be tied in with, let&#8217;s say, a digital consultation. But if the consumer wants no live consultation whatsoever, [they] can just try the various shades on their own as well.</p>
<p>“The AR experiences that we have right now are really around virtual try-on for makeup,” she continues. “That encompasses eye, it encompasses foundation, it encompasses lip, and we also have skin diagnostic capabilities. The calibration that we&#8217;ve done is able to note if you&#8217;ve got some dry patches or red flares, or if you&#8217;re looking a little tired — it will highlight some of those skin concerns. When we go into haircare, we&#8217;re able to view the scalp and the condition of the hair close to the scalp, as well as further down to the ends. You&#8217;re able to see what you look like as a blonde, of what you may look like with an ombre. It&#8217;s a great way to get a sense of what the shade will look like.”</p>
<p>In both of these industries, as well as a number of others that rely on customization or fit, consumers are beginning to shop differently. Companies like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> have invested heavily in online transactions, encouraging more purchases in the digital realm.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> now boasts its Shopping and Checkout options to allow businesses to advertise and complete transactions through the app, offering an alternative to website- or brand app-based shopping platforms — all with a potential customer base of over a billion. As buyers continue to explore new ways to make their shopping decisions, brands are increasingly focusing on how they present their products digitally.</p>
<h2>Making the digital feel physical</h2>
<p>Changes in retail have always been tied to developments in technology. The advent of the postal service inspired mail-order catalogs. Televisions created shopping channels. The internet ushered in the possibility of online shopping, and mobile phones — with their cameras — have been the launchpad for AR and 3D. Each leap creates more opportunity for shoppers to see the product how it really is — as if it was already on their body or in their homes.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Given how reliant many people have become on rideshare drivers and especially delivery workers during the pandemic, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is pushing for them to get priority access to the COVID-19 vaccine. Today, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi sent a letter to all 50 governors asking them to prioritize giving drivers and delivery workers the vaccine as essential workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last nine months, these workers have been a lifeline to their communities,&#8221; Khosrowshahi wrote in the letter. &#8220;They have transported healthcare workers to hospitals, delivered food to people socially distancing at home, and helped local restaurants stay in business.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the letter, Khosrowshahi argues that the work of drivers and delivery people has become essential. That&#8217;s why Uber wants them to get the vaccine &#8220;quickly, easily and for free,&#8221; he wrote in the letter. Additionally, Uber has offered to help share information about the vaccine and encourage those who are eligible to get vaccinated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;After nine months on the frontlines keeping their communities running, we are asking governors in all 50 states to prioritize drivers and delivery people for early vaccine access,&#8221; Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;Uber stands ready to do everything we can—leveraging our technology, our logistical expertise and our resources—to help protect the people working on our platform and bring vaccines to the public as quickly and efficiently as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khosrowshahi&#8217;s letter to governors is an addition to the one <a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/comment/CDC-2020-0121-0238">Uber sent</a> to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that advocated for the inclusion of non-health essential workers in the priority phase of distribution for the vaccine.</p>
<p>Uber&#8217;s advocating on behalf of workers comes amid an ongoing battle around how to classify rideshare drivers and delivery workers. Uber has long argued that its workers are not employees, while many gig workers have argued they are misclassified as independent contractors and should be entitled to the many labor rights that come with the employee classification.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/accurate-timely-information-covid-19-vaccines/">announced</a> today it&#8217;s introducing a new search feature that will surface a list of authorized vaccines in users&#8217; locations, as well as informational panels about each individual vaccine. The feature is first being launched in the U.K., which earlier this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/the-uk-approves-the-biontech-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-for-emergency-use/">gave emergency authorization</a> to the BioNTech/Pfizer coronavirus vaccine. The company says the feature will roll out to other countries as their local health authorities authorize vaccines.</p>
<p>The feature itself will appear at the top of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.com searches for COVID-19 vaccines and will present the authoritative information in a box above the search results, linking to the health authority as the source. The panel will also have two tabs. One will be the overview of the vaccine, which appears above Top Stories and links to Local and National resources, like government websites. The other will organize news related to the vaccine under a separate section.</p>

<p>Google positioned the new search panels as one way it&#8217;s helping to address vaccine misinformation and hesitance at scale.</p>
<p>However, another arm of the company, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/youtube" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="youtube">YouTube, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> allowed COVID-19 misinformation and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/plandemic-video-judy-mikovits/">conspiracies</a> to spread during the pandemic. While YouTube in April <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52388586">banned &#8220;medically unsubstantiated&#8221; content</a> after earlier <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52198946">banning conspiracies</a> that linked COVID-19 to 5G networks, it didn&#8217;t <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/14/youtube-bans-misinformation-about-covid-vaccinations">ban misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines until October</a>. In other words, it didn&#8217;t proactively create a policy to ban all aspects of COVID-19 misinformation, but waited to address the spread of COVID-19 antivax content until vaccine approvals appeared imminent. This meant that any clips <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-14/youtube-to-pull-clips-questioning-authorities-on-covid-vaccines">making false claims</a> &#8212; like saying vaccines would kill their recipients, cause infertility or implant microchips &#8212; were not officially covered by YouTube&#8217;s policies until October.</p>

<p>And even after the ban, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/youtube" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="youtube">YouTube&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> moderation policies <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/antivaccine-videos-slip-through-youtube-s-advertising-policies-new-study-finds">were found to miss many</a> anti-vaccination videos, studies found.</p>
<p>This is not a new challenge for the video platform. YouTube has struggled to address antivax content for years, even <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/youtube-removes-ads-from-anti-vaccination-video-channels/">allowing videos with prohibited antivax content to be monetized</a>, at times.</p>

<p>Today, Google downplayed YouTube&#8217;s issues in its fight against misinformation, saying that its COVID-19 information panels on YouTube which offer authoritative information have been viewed over 400 billion times.</p>
<p>However, this figure provides provides at look into the scale at which YouTube creators are publishing videos about the pandemic, often with just their opinions.</p>
<p>Google said, to date, it has removed more than 700,000 videos related to dangerous or misleading COVID-19 health information. If the platform was regulated, however, it would not be entirely up to Google to decide when a video with dangerous information should be removed, what constitutes misinformation or what the penalty against the creator should be.</p>
<p>The company also noted that it&#8217;s now helping YouTube creators by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbpi6ZahtOH71a6AQn1p3XGQ2CQSlfPIU">connecting</a> them with health experts to make engaging and accurate content for their viewers, and <a href="https://www.google.com/grants/">donated</a> $250 million in Ad Grants to help over 100 government agencies run PSAs about COVID-19 on the video platform. In April, Google <a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/covid-19-65-million-help-fight-coronavirus-misinformation/">donated</a> $6.5 million to support COVID-19 related fact-checking initiatives, as well, and is now donating $1.5 million more to fund the creation of a <a href="https://health-desk.org/vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://health-desk.org/vaccines/&quot;}">COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub.</a></p>
