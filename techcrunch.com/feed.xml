										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last we heard from Luther.ai, the startup was participating in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/luther-ai-is-a-new-ai-tool-that-acts-like-google-for-personal-conversations/">TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield</a> in September. The company got a lot of attention from that appearance, which culminated in a $3.2 million seed round it announced today. While they were at it, the founders decided to change the company name to <a href="https://www.hu.man.ai/">Human.ai</a>, which they believe better reflects their mission.</p>
<p>Differential VC led the round joined by Village Global VC, Good Friends VC, Beni VC and Keshif Ventures. David Magerman from Differential will join the startup&#8217;s Board.</p>
<p>The investors were attracted to Human.ai&#8217;s personalized kind of artificial intelligence, and co-founder and CEO Suman Kanuganti says that the Battlefield appearance led directly to investor interest, which quickly resulted in a deal four weeks later.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think overall the messaging of what we delivered at TechCrunch Disrupt regarding an individual personal AI that is secured by blockchain to retain and recall [information] really set the stage for what the company is all about, both from a user standpoint as well as from an investor standpoint,&#8221; Kanuganti told me.</p>
<p>As for the name change, he reported that there was some confusion in the market that Luther was an AI assistant like Alexa or a chatbot, and the founders wanted the name to better reflect the personalized nature of the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are creating AI for the individual and there is so much emphasis on the authenticity and the voice and the thoughts of an individual, and how we also use blockchain to secure ownership of the data. So most of the principle lies in creating this AI for an individual human. So we thought, let&#8217;s call it Human.ai,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>As Kanuganti <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/luther-ai-is-a-new-ai-tool-that-acts-like-google-for-personal-conversations/">described it in September,</a> the tool allows individuals to search for nuggets of information from past events using a variety of AI technologies:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s made possible through a convergence of neuroscience, NLP and blockchain to deliver seamless in-the-moment recall. GPT-3 is built on the memories of the public internet, while Luther is built on the memories of your private self.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The company is still in the process of refining the product and finding its audience, but reports that so far they have found interest from creative people such as writers, professionals such as therapists, high tech workers interested in AI, students looking to track school work and seniors looking for a way to track their memories for memoir purposes. All of these groups have the common theme of having to find nuggets of information from a ton of signals and that&#8217;s where Human.ai&#8217;s strength lies.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s diverse founding team includes two women, CTO Sharon Zhang and designer Kristie Kaiser, along with Kanuganti, who is himself an immigrant. The founders want to continue building a diverse organization as they add employees. &#8220;I think in general we just want to attract a diverse kind of talent, especially because we are also Human.ai and we believe that everyone should have the same opportunity,&#8221; Zhang told me.</p>
<p>The company currently has 7 full time employees and a dozen consultants, but with the new funding is looking to hire engineers and AI talent and a head of marketing to push the notion of consumer AI. While the company is remote today and has employees around the world, it will look to build a headquarters at some point post-COVID where some percentage of the employees can work in the same space together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin is set to launch one of its New Shepard rockets as early as tomorrow, January 14 at 9:45 AM CST (10:45 AM EST) for its first mission of 2021. This is a big one for the Jeff Bezos-founded space company, too – it includes upgrades to the crew capsule atop the rocket that are designed to improve the astronaut experience, a key preparatory step as the company approaches its first actual human spaceflight missions.</p>
<p>New Shepard has flown 13 times previously, and carried a number of different payloads to suborbital space before returning to Earth. The reusable launch vehicle aims to ultimately provide rides to space for people, too – and while there&#8217;s no stated timeline for this actually happening, tomorrow&#8217;s mission is a strong sign that it could be taking place sometime relatively soon.</p>
<p>Crew-focused upgrades flying on this New Shepard launch for the first time include acoustic and temperature regulation equipment, display panels that provide information to anyone who would be on board, and push-to-talk communications systems installed in each of the crew capsule&#8217;s six seats. One of those seats will have a life-size test article on board, a humanoid flight dummy named Mannequin Skywalker that Blue Origin uses to measure various aspects of the vehicle&#8217;s performance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;ll test astronaut safety alert systems that Blue Origin intends to include on the final flight system, and it&#8217;ll also carry a payload with a very different purpose – 50,000 postcards provided by school kids around the world to the Blue Origin non-profit Club for the Future.</p>
<p>The mission will be broadcast live by Blue Origin via its website and YouTube channel (embedded below) and you can expect the stream to begin around 30 minutes prior to launch time, so at around 10:15 AM EST (7:15 AM PST).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We could be looking at a 2021 IPO market that resembles last year's heated results.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">And we&#8217;re off to the races!</p>
<p>Last night, Affirm priced its IPO above its raised range <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112006165/en/Affirm-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering">at $49 per share</a>, a sign that the public markets remain hungry for new listings. Provided that Affirm today trades similarly to how it priced, we could be looking at a 2021 IPO market that resembles last year&#8217;s heated results.</p>

<hr />
<p>That&#8217;s good news for a host of companies looking to follow in the financial technology unicorn&#8217;s footsteps.</p>
<p>Poshmark prices tonight and trades tomorrow. And with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/unpacking-qualtrics-brand-new-s-1-filing/">Qualtrics in the wings</a> along <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">with Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">Roblox set to direct list</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/bumble-reportedly-filed-confidentially-for-an-ipo/">Bumble said to file as well</a>, we&#8217;re heading into another busy IPO quarter. Affirm&#8217;s first-day trading results will therefore hold extra importance, even if its pricing augurs well for IPOs more generally.</p>

Pricing at $49 is a victory. Briefly, why, and then a thought about what&#8217;s next for the IPO market.</p>
<h2>Affirm</h2>
<p>What does Affirm sell? First, per <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465921002724/tm2026663-17_s1a.htm">its S-1 filings</a>, it charges merchants a fee to &#8220;convert a sale and power a payment.&#8221; That sounds like software revenues, albeit not in the recurring manner of a SaaS company.</p>
<p>Second, Affirm earns from &#8220;interest income [from] the simple interest loans that we purchase from our originating bank partners.&#8221; And, it offers virtual cards to consumers via its app, allowing it to generate interchange revenues.</p>
<p>We care about all of that as it&#8217;s important to realize that Affirm is <em>not </em>a software company in the context that we usually think about them, namely software as a service, or SaaS.</p>
<p>This matters when we consider how the market values Affirm; the more richly Affirm is valued in revenue-multiple terms by its new, $39 per-share IPO price, the more bullish we can presume the IPO market is.</p>
<p>What are Affirm&#8217;s gross margins? A great question, and one that is surprisingly hard to answer. If you read its final S-1 filing, you&#8217;ll find that all its chatter concerning &#8220;contribution profit&#8221; has been removed. This is a shame to some degree as contribution profit — and margin — were Affirm&#8217;s closest shared cognate to gross margin.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s estimated that there were some <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8326056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">50 billion connected devices</a> globally in 2020, and while that really says a lot about how far we&#8217;ve come in tech, for many it also speaks to a big issue: security vulnerabilities, with the devices themselves, plus all the components and services running on them, all potential targets for anything from malicious hackers to not-so-intentional data leaks.</p>
<p>Today, an Israeli startup Vdoo &#8212; which has been developing AI-based services to detect and fix those kinds of vulnerabilities in IoT devices &#8212; is announcing $25 million in funding, money that it plans to use to help it better address the wider issue as it applies to <em>all</em> connected objects. With its initial focus on large industrial deployments, medical systems, communications infrastructure and automotive, Vdoo also looking more deeply now at the wider network of devices that use communications chips, providing quick (as in minutes) assessments to identify and remediate or directly fix various issues: it cites zero-day vulnerabilities, CVEs, configuration and hardening issues, and standard incompliances among them.</p>
<p>The funding &#8212; an extension to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/vdoo-secures-32m-for-a-platform-that-detects-and-fixes-vulnerabilities-on-iot-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$32 million round</a> that Vdoo announced in April 2019 &#8212; is coming from two investors, Israel&#8217;s Qumra Capital and Verizon Ventures (the investing arm of Verizon, which &#8212; by way of its acquisition of Aol many years ago &#8212; also owns TechCrunch).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Verizon&#8217;s interest in Vdoo is strategic and speaks to the opportunity in the market. As CEO Netanel Davidi (who co-founded the company with Uri Alter and Asaf Karas) describes it, operators like Verizon are interested because of their role as a distributer and reseller of hardware as part of their wider services play, be it for broadband access, or a telematics service, or something for the connected home or connected office.</p>
<p>&#8220;T<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">hey sell connected devices to enterprises and home users that are not made by them, yet the carriers are responsible for the security,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so the solution is to bake that into devices&#8221; to make it work more seamlessly, he said. </span></p>
<p>Verizon is not the startup&#8217;s only strategic backer. Others in the first tranche of this round included another carrier, Japan&#8217;s NTT Docomo, MS&amp;AD Ventures (the venture arm of the global cyber insurance firm) and Dell Technology Capital, the VC arm of Dell.</p>
<p>The company has now raised around $70 million, and while it&#8217;s not disclosing valuation, Davidi confirmed that it has more than doubled this year.</p>
<p>(In April 2019, <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/224127-37/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PitchBook estimated</a> that it was just under $100 million, which would make it now at over $200 million if that figure is accurate.)</p>
<p>Davidi said that the decision to raise this money as an extension to the previous round rather than a new round was strategic: it gave the company the chance to raise funding more quickly, and to take more time to prepare for a bigger funding round in the near future.</p>
<p>And the reason for raising quickly was to address what was a quickly moving target: one of the by-products of the Covid-19 pandemic has been a dramatic shift to people working from home, buying new devices to enable that and in general using their communications networks much more heavily than before.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Connected device security typically focuses on monitoring activity on the hardware, how data is moving in and out of them. Vdoo&#8217;s approach has been to build a platform that monitors the behavior of the devices themselves, using AI to compare that behavior to identify when something is not working as it should. </span></p>
<p>“For any kind of vulnerability, using deep binary analysis capabilities, we try to understand the broader idea, to figure out how a similar vulnerability can emerge,” is how Davidi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/vdoo-secures-32m-for-a-platform-that-detects-and-fixes-vulnerabilities-on-iot-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">described</a> the process when we talked about the first part of this round back in 2019.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Vdoo generates specific “tailor-made on-device micro-agents” to continue the detection and repair process, which Davidi likens to a modern approach to some cancer care: preventive measures such as periodic monitoring checks, followed by a “tailored immunotherapy” based on prior analysis of DNA.</span></p>
<p>Vdoo is a play on the Hebrew word that sounds like “vee-doo” and means “making sure”, and points to the basic idea of how it approaches the verification around its device monitoring. It also feels somewhat like the next step in endpoint security, which was the focus of Davidi and Alter&#8217;s previous startup, Cyvera, which was eventually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/palo-alto-networks-buys-cyber-security-company-cyvera-for-200m/">acquired by Palo Alto Networks</a>.</p>
<p>The focus on devices, in some ways, is a significantly more complex approach given that it&#8217;s not just about the device, but the many components that go into them. As we have seen with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/03/kernel-panic-what-are-meltdown-and-spectre-the-bugs-affecting-nearly-every-computer-and-device/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meltdown and Spectre</a>, vulnerabilities might exist at the processor level.</p>
<p>And as Davidi pointed out to me this week, at times those issues aren&#8217;t even intentional but still mean data can leak out, and at worst that can be exploitable by bad actors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Backdoors are being built into many devices, and some are not even intentional,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It may be that the developer wanted to create a shortcut to make something else easier in the future. Some will see that as a back door, and some will not.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fractal-like nature of the issue what Vdoo is digging into with its widening approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Initially we wanted to serve the ecosystem of manufacturers, since they are the cause of the problem and the origin of the security issues,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We started there with Fortune 500 customers in areas like automotive and industrial and medical and telco and aviation. The idea was to make a platform that could serve and product security stakeholders. But then we saw that this was a big unserved market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, Vdoo quotes figures from research firm Markets and Markets that forecast that the global device security market will grow to $36.6 billion by 2025 from $12.5 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of connected IoT devices is rapidly growing, creating greater opportunities for security breaches,&#8221; said Boaz Dinte, Managing Partner of Qumra Capital, in a statement. &#8220;Vdoo&#8217;s unique device-centric, deep technology automated approach has already brought immediate value to vendors in a very short period of time. We believe the market opportunity is huge, and with newly infused growth capital, Vdoo is well-positioned to become the leading global player for securing connected devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>“With the expansion of 5G networks and mobile edge compute, there’s a need for an end-to-end, device-centric security approach to IoT,” added Verizon Ventures MD Tammy Mahn in a statement. &#8220;As the venture arm of a leading telco, Verizon Ventures is proud to invest in  Vdoo and its world-class team on their journey to solve this global need, while ushering in a new era of security by design in our increasingly connected world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The first commercial lunar landers are set to start making their trips to the Moon as early as this year, and now another one has a confirmed ride booked: Intuitive Machines is sending its second lander aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9, with a projected launch timeframe happening sometime around 2022 at the earliest. Intuitive Machines has already booked a first lander mission via SpaceX, which is also hosting payloads for other private companies seeking to make lunar landfall under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/nasa-reveals-the-payloads-for-the-first-commercial-moon-cargo-deliveries/">NASA&#8217;s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program</a>.</p>
<p>Intuitive Machines&#8217; Nova-C lander can carry up to 100 kg (around 222 lbs) of cargo to the Moon&#8217;s surface, and can communicate back to Earth for transmitting the results of its missions. It has both internal and surface mounting capacity, and will carry science experiments for a variety of customers to the lunar surface through NASA&#8217;s commercial partnership program, partly to support future NASA missions including its planned Artemis human Moon landings.</p>
<p>The first Intuitive Machines lunar lander mission, which will also use a Nova-C lander, is set to take place sometime in the fourth quarter of 2021 based on current timelines. It&#8217;ll include a lunar imaging suite, which will seek to &#8220;capture some of the first images of the Milky Way Galaxy Center from the surface of the Moon,&#8221; and the second mission will include delivering a polar resource mining drill and a mass spectrometer to the Moon&#8217;s South Pole on behalf of NASA, in addition to other payloads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m a grad student currently working on F-1 STEM OPT. The company I work for has indicated it will sponsor me for an H-1B visa this year. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I hear the random H-1B lottery will be replaced with a new system that selects H-1B candidates based on their salaries. How will this new process work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Positive in Palo Alto</strong></p>
<p>Dear Positive:</p>
<p>Thanks for your timely question! The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), finalized <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/08/2021-00183/modification-of-registration-requirement-for-petitioners-seeking-to-file-cap-subject-h-1b-petitions">a new rule</a> last week (Jan. 8), that replaces the random H-1B lottery with a pay-to-play system. There may be litigation that could change things before this year’s selection process, but interestingly, removing the randomness from the H-1B lottery is one point on which both Biden and Trump agree.</p>
<p>To find out more about all the changes that will impact this year’s H-1B process and how to prepare, register for our upcoming webinar on Jan. 20, on how to <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/1816063397370/WN_Wwy7TgrtQRyv7GkXeC-CgA">Get Ready for the H-1B FY2022 Lottery</a>. In the meantime, listen to my recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/046-get-ready-for-h-1b-fy2022-lottery/">H-1B podcast</a> in which I discuss what the 2021 lottery will look like, and download our <a href="https://witty-author-184.ck.page/321063598c">free H-1B guide</a>. Also, check out the podcast episode on <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-09-what-makes-a-strong-h-1b-petition/">What Makes a Strong H-1B Petition</a>.</p>
<p>Under this new wage-based H-1B allocation system, which is slated to go into effect on March 9, USCIS will select H-1B registrants based on the highest relative wages paid, taking into account the job, where it will be done and the job level (think of it like a career stage). This change is aimed at encouraging employers to offer higher salaries and higher-skilled positions to H-1B candidates to better protect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers and increase the likelihood that H-1B visas will be awarded to the best and the brightest individuals. In a nutshell, this is great news for Silicon Valley companies that have cash and need to remove risk.</p>
<p>While the new rule substantially increases predictability in the “lottery” process, it may make it more difficult for companies that are unfunded, pre-revenue early-stage startups to get H-1B visas for founders or employees, particularly since other forms of compensation, such as equity or stock options, are not considered wages. So the lesson here is to get some predictable revenue or runway prior to Q2 when you need to submit the I-129 petition so you can demonstrate the “ability to pay” at a higher wage level.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You know what’s great? Becoming a unicorn in two years. You know what’s even better? Exiting at unicorn status in two years.</p>
<p>This morning, Qualcomm announced that it was buying high-performance computing startup NUVIA for $1.4 billion, minus some coverage of working capital and debt.</p>
<p>The startup, which we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/15/three-of-apple-and-googles-former-star-chip-designers-launch-nuvia-with-53m-in-series-a-funding/">extensively profiled on its launch after raising $53 million in a Series A</a> in late 2019 and again a few months ago when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/nuvia-series-b/">it raised $240 million in its Series B from Mithril</a>, was the brainchild of a number of star Apple chip engineers who had worked on the computing giant’s A series of chips that powered the company’s iPhones and iPads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Much like how Apple’s new M series of chips for its laptop computers (so far) have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/apple-announces-the-m1-the-first-member-of-its-apple-silicon-family/">dazzled with an almost revolutionary mix of energy efficiency and performance</a>, NUVIA’s founders were hoping to use their experience in managing the power envelope while eking out high performance and bring that to the data center. Given the sheer scale of power required by data centers to function, which is only going up with the demand for AI applications in the cloud, the hope was that NUVIA could have its cake and eat it too: offering high performance while cutting power and saving costs for cloud computing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qualcomm-to-acquire-nuvia-301207370.html">According to Qualcomm’s press release</a>, NUVIA’s technology will be incorporated across the company’s line of chips, with its leadership centered around its 5G-focused Snapdragon chip. The company’s founders and employees are expected to join, and the deal must be approved by U.S. regulators.</p>
<p>NUVIA was one of the most compelling companies of the new crop of next-generation silicon startups, but it was also mired in a legal battle between one of its founders and famed former Apple engineer Gerald Williams III and his former employer. Apple filed a civil lawsuit against Williams in 2019 (California Superior Court of Santa Clara, 19-cv-352866), arguing that he attempted to recruit his former colleagues to join NUVIA in breach of his contractual obligations with Apple. Williams fought back through his own motions, and the two have been legal discovery ever since, with the latest updates happening just last month with Apple and Williams demanding each other hand over certain documents as the case has proceeded.</p>
<p>We don’t know how the timing of that lawsuit played into the company’s quick exit, or whether Qualcomm’s significantly deeper relationship with Apple as a supplier might help the parties reach a quicker settlement. We’ve reached out to a NUVIA spokesperson for comment.</p>
<p>While that lawsuit was a cloud over the company, the end result is a unicorn exit at $1.4 billion on just shy of $300 million of venture capital fundraised in roughly two years. Mithril is probably not terribly thrilled given the quick turnaround, but earlier investors like Capricorn Investment Group, Dell Technologies Capital (DTC), Mayfield, and WRVI Capital are probably doing a bit better on the multiples on invested capital front. And of course, the founders likely came out well ahead as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://gainful.com">Gainful</a>, a startup offering personalized subscriptions to protein powders and hydration products, is announcing that it has raised $7.5 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>COO Eric Wu, who founded the company with CTO Jahaan Ansari, told me that Gainful began with his own experience experimenting different protein powders and eventually finding the combination that worked best for his goals and dietary needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my personal experience, trying to find a protein powder can be a very overwhelming experience,&#8221; Wu said. &#8220;There are a million ingredients, and you just want somebody to talk to who can cut through all that noise.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So when when you first sign up for Gainful, you take a quiz about things like your height, weight, exercise patterns, fitness goals and how often you plan to consume the protein product. The company will then recommend a powder for you, as well as providing ongoing access to a registered dietitian who can answer any additional questions.</p>
<p>Wu said that behind the scenes, Gainful developed &#8220;hundreds and hundreds of different [protein] blends,&#8221; then worked with its <a href="https://www.gainful.com/science/">science advisory board</a> (which includes nutrition experts who have worked with the Golden State Warriors and Sacramento Kings) to &#8220;hone in on a set number of blends.&#8221; When asked for more details about how many products the company is actually selling, Wu said it&#8217;s &#8220;more than handful&#8221; and they&#8217;re &#8220;constantly being iterated on.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095778" style="width: 463px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095778" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2095778" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GAINFUL1042_RT.jpg?w=453" alt="Gainful hydration" width="453" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GAINFUL1042_RT.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GAINFUL1042_RT.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GAINFUL1042_RT.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GAINFUL1042_RT.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GAINFUL1042_RT.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GAINFUL1042_RT.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095778" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gainful</p></div></p>
<p>All Gainful products are made without artificial colors, flavors or sweeteners, and they&#8217;re gluten-free and soy-free as well. With the new electrolyte drink mixes (which I&#8217;ve tried and enjoyed), the startup is moving beyond protein, and Wu said it will continue to add new products and new flavors. At the same time, you still need a subscription to the protein powder (pricing starts at $39) to get access to additional products.</p>
<p>To explain this relatively high commitment approach, Wu said, &#8220;We really believe that we&#8217;ve created a system of products that all have complementary benefits and work really synergistically. If you’re hydrating properly, you can work harder during your exercise, and your personalized protein powder is working harder for you. All of these are offered &#8230; not as a magic bullet, not as a lose-weight-fast solution, but as a way of being healthy. It&#8217;s not supposed to be a flash in the pan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Series A round was co-led by BrandProject and Courtside Ventures, with participation from AF Ventures, Round13 Capital, Barrel Ventures and the founder of Polaris Sports.</p>
<p>Gainful was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/these-are-the-64-startups-unveiled-at-y-combinator-w18-demo-day-2/">part of Y Combinator&#8217;s winter 2018 batch</a>. It also had a leadership transition early last year, with Wu shifting from CEO to COO (where he said he could focus more on product development), while Dean Kelly joined as chief executive.</p>
<p>Wu added that the company has seen significant growth during the pandemic, due to the general shift towards e-commerce, as well as &#8220;people reflecting on what it means to lead a full, healthy, happy life in a time when it was really difficult.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dell&#8217;s kicking off 2021 with a new addition to its monitor lineup that aims to hit a variety of sweet spots. The Dell UltraSharp 40 Curved WUHD monitor offers 39.7&#8243; of screen real estate, with a 5120 x 2160 resolution that matches the pixel density of 4K resolution on a 32-inch conventional widescreen display. It comes equipped with Thunderbolt 3 for display and data connectivity, as well as 90W of charging for compatible computers, and a 10Gbps Ethernet connection for networking. In short, Dell&#8217;s latest (which is available beginning January 28) looks to be a true &#8216;one display to rule them all&#8217; contender, particularly for those searching for a way to optimize their home offices.</p>
<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>Dell&#8217;s UltraSharp 40 has a 60Hz, 39.7&#8243; diagonal display in 21:9 aspect ratio with WUHD resolution (not quite true 5K, but exceptional for a curved monitor this size). It offers 100% sRGB and 98% P3 color reproduction, and comes with a stand that has height adjustability, tilt and swivel, and that features a hidden cable channel for cable management. Built-in speakers provide 9W each of sound reproduction so you don&#8217;t need to worry about adding externals.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095764" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095764" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2095764" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00816.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00816.jpg 2160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00816.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00816.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00816.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00816.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00816.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00816.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00816.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095764" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Darrell Etherington</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of wired connections, it offers Thunderbolt 3, RJ45 Ethernet, and USB 10Gps ports (three on the rear, and one in front) as well as one USB-C port for easy access on the front. There&#8217;s also 3.5mm audio line out (though it&#8217;s worth noting that this doesn&#8217;t work with headphones), and two HDMI ports plus one DisplayPort for more traditional display connectivity if you&#8217;re not going the Thunderbolt route. Finally, a standard security lock slot allows you to anchor the display in any shared environment.</p>
<p>The display itself is bright, clear and viewable at a wide range of angles, with a more matte finish that provides excellent viewing in a wide range of lighting conditions. A joystick control button provides easy navigation and operation of the built-in on-screen menu and integrated features, including picture-in-picture.</p>
<h2>Design and features</h2>
<p>First and foremost, the Dell UltraSharp 40 delivered excellent visual quality. Especially for a display this size, in a curved form factor, at this resolution, it&#8217;s going to be something that satisfies everyone from telecommuters mostly handling meetings and spreadsheets, to photographers and video professionals looking for image quality that is highly color-accurate and provides crystal clear detail.</p>
<p>The WUHD resolution means that you can run the display in a range of different configurations, depending on how much screen real estate you want or need. For instance, I&#8217;ve been using it at the 5160 x 2160 res, and it provides ample workspace for arranging multiple windows side-by-side, and tiled vertically. I typically use three displays at once in my day job (there&#8217;s a lot of tab and browser windows involved) and the Dell UltraSharp 40 makes it so that I can comfortably work with just a single monitor instead. It&#8217;ll work with Apple&#8217;s HiDPI modes on its modern Macs for clear and crisp visuals with larger on-screen elements, too, however, if you don&#8217;t need all that room.</p>
<p>Dell&#8217;s integrated stand is simple and effective, providing a range of maneuverability options that allow for significant travel in height adjustment. You won&#8217;t get a portrait mode full swivel in this display – but that&#8217;s not surprising given how long it is on its longest edge, compared to the vertical. You do get tilt if you need it, and the ability to angle back and forwards depending on how you have it positioned. The end result is a display that&#8217;s very large, but easy enough to adjust for your comfortable use.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095767" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095767" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2095767" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00818.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00818.jpg 2160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00818.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00818.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00818.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00818.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00818.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00818.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00818.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095767" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Darrell Etherington</p></div></p>
<p>The display comes calibrated out of the box, but also includes plenty of options for adjusting things like contrast and brightness using the built-in menus. This also including a very useful multi-device display setup, including both picture-in-picture features for multiple sources, and a picture-by-picture mode that splits the display into two equal side-by-side sections for multiple inputs. Another useful feature for working with the display with multiple computers: keyboards and mice connected via the monitor will automatically detect and switch between controlling both connected PCs.</p>
<p>Besides the display size and resolution, the other thing that makes the UltraSharp 40 a fantastic option for a home workstation is its range of ports and added bonuses like built-in speakers. The speakers aren&#8217;t going to win any audiophile awards, but they&#8217;re better than the ones that come built into your laptop and they obviate the need for additional equipment if you&#8217;re looking to spare your desk surface space. With any modern Thunderbolt-equipped Mac, the Dell UltraSharp 40 really is a one-cable wonder that offers very little in the way of compromises.</p>
<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2095763" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095763" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2095763" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00817.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00817.jpg 2160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00817.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00817.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00817.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00817.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00817.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00817.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC00817.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095763" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Darrell Etherington</p></div></p>
<p>With the Dell UltraSharp 40, the company continues its tradition of delivering extremely high-quality display products at a reasonable price. The $2,100 price tag may seem steep, but for what you&#8217;re getting it&#8217;s a very fair price point, and Dell&#8217;s displays also have very high reliability that means an investment in their monitors is likely to keep you satisfied for many years to come (two of my home office displays are some of Dell&#8217;s very first 4K monitors, which have served me reliably for over half a decade).</p>
<p>Because of its wide aspect ratio and curve, this display really does replace two smaller 4K screens for most uses, and so the cost framed that way actually makes even more sense. In short, Dell&#8217;s UltraSharp 40 is a home office beast, which fills a sweet spot for a wide range of remote professionals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix has <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-inclusion-report-2021">released its first-ever diversity and inclusion report</a>. Though, it&#8217;s not the first time Netflix has shared this type of data. Netflix has shared representation numbers since 2013, but the company had not put a bow on it until now.</p>
<p>Worldwide, women make up 47.1% of Netflix&#8217;s workforce. Since 2017, representation of white and Asian employees has been on a slow decline, while representation of Hispanic or Latinx, Black, mixed race and folks from native populations has been on the rise. In the U.S., Netflix is 8.1% Hispanic or Latinx, 8% Black, and 5.1% of its employees are mixed race, while 1.3% of employees are either Native American, Native Alaskan, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and/or from the Middle East or North Africa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Netflix&#8217;s representation of people of color at the leadership level is not perfect but it&#8217;s certainly better than that of its <a href="https://diversity.fb.com/read-report/">counterparts</a> in the <a href="https://kstatic.googleusercontent.com/files/25badfc6b6d1b33f3b87372ff7545d79261520d821e6ee9a82c4ab2de42a01216be2156bc5a60ae3337ffe7176d90b8b2b3000891ac6e516a650ecebf0e3f866">tech industry</a>. The company&#8217;s leadership team is 15.7% Asian, 9.5% Black, 4.9% Hispanic and 4.1% of Netflix&#8217;s higher-ups are mixed race.</p>
<p>Netflix has not laid out any concrete goals, but says it&#8217;s generally wanting to increase representation by hiring more inclusively and building out its recruiting networks, its VP of inclusion and diversity, Vernā Myers, said in the report. Additionally, Netflix says it wants to focus more on increasing inclusion and representation of folks outside of the U.S., as well as find a way to measure what the company called &#8220;inclusion health.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://stacklet.io/">Stacklet</a>, a startup that is commercializing the <a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/">Cloud Custodian</a> open-source cloud governance project, today announced that it has raised an $18 million Series A funding round. The round was led by Addition, with participation from <a href="https://foundationcapital.com/">Foundation Capital</a> and new individual investor<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hectaman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/hectaman/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610580428738000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGn4sCfj_8h2vzcRotBDOUAR5VYRA"> Liam Randall</a>, who is joining the company as VP of business development. Addition and Foundation Capital also invested in Stacklet&#8217;s seed round, which the company announced last August. This new round brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $22 million.</p>
<p>Stacklet helps enterprises manage their data governance stance across different clouds, accounts, policies and regions, with a focus on security, cost optimization and regulatory compliance. The service offers its users a set of pre-defined policy packs that encode best practices for access to cloud resources, though users can obviously also specify their own rules. In addition, Stacklet offers a number of analytics functions around policy health and resource auditing, as well as a real-time inventory and change management logs for a company&#8217;s cloud assets.</p>
<p>The company was co-founded by Travis Stanfield (CEO) and Kapil Thangavelu (CTO). Both bring a lot of industry expertise to the table. Stanfield spent time as an engineer at Microsoft and leading DealerTrack Technologies, while Thangavelu worked at Canonical and most recently in Amazon&#8217;s AWSOpen team. Thangavelu is also one of the co-creators of the Cloud Custodian project, which was first incubated at Capital One, where the two co-founders met during their time there, and is now a <a href="http://cloudcustodian.io/">sandbox project</a> under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation&#8217;s umbrella.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When I joined Capital One, they had made the executive decision to go all-in on cloud and close their data centers,&#8221; Thangavelu told me. &#8220;I got to join on the ground floor of that movement and Custodian was born as a side project, looking at some of the governance and security needs that large regulated enterprises have as they move into the cloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>As companies have sped up their move to the cloud during the pandemic, the need for products like Stacklets has also increased. The company isn&#8217;t naming most of its customers, but one of them is FICO, among a number of other larger enterprises. Stacklet isn&#8217;t purely focused on the enterprise, though. &#8220;Once the cloud infrastructure becomes &#8212; for a particular organization &#8212; large enough that it&#8217;s not knowable in a single person&#8217;s head, we can deliver value for you at that time and certainly, whether it&#8217;s through the open source or through Stacklet, we will have a story there.&#8221; The Cloud Custodian open-source project is already seeing serious use among large enterprises, though, and Stacklet obviously benefits from that as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;In just 8 months, Travis and Kapil have gone from an idea to a functioning team with 15 employees, signed early Fortune 2000 design partners and are well on their way to building the <span class="il">Stacklet</span> commercial platform,&#8221; Foundation Capital&#8217;s Sid Trivedi said. &#8220;They’ve done all this while sheltered in place at home during a once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic. This is the type of velocity that investors look for from an early-stage company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the team plans to use the new funding to continue to developed the product, which should be generally available later this year, expand both its engineering and its go-to-market teams and continue to grow the open-source community around Cloud Custodian.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has agreed to swiftly finalize a long-standing complaint against Facebook&#8217;s international data transfers which could force the tech giant to suspend data flows from the European Union to the US within in a matter of months.</p>
<p>The complaint, which was filed in 2013 by privacy campaigner Max Schrems, relates to the clash between EU privacy rights and US government intelligent agencies&#8217; access to Facebook users&#8217; data under surveillance programs that were revealed in high resolution detail by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p>
<p>The DPC has made the commitment to a swift resolution of Schrems&#8217; complaint now in order to settle a judicial review of its processes which noyb, his privacy campaign group, filed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/facebook-eu-us-data-transfer-complaint-schrems-gets-a-judicial-review-of-the-irish-dpcs-procedure/">last year</a> in response to its decision to pause his complaint and opt to open a new case procedure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Under the terms of the settlement Schrems will also be heard in the DPC&#8217;s &#8220;own volition&#8221; procedure, as well as getting access to all submissions made by Facebook &#8212; assuming the Irish courts allow that investigation to go ahead, <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/irish-dpc-settles-judicial-review-and-agrees-decide-swiftly-facebooks-eu-us-transfers">noyb</a> said today.</p>
<p>And while noyb acknowledged there may (yet) be a further pause, as/if the DPC waits on a High Court judgement of Facebook&#8217;s own Judicial Review of its processes before revisiting the original complaint, Schrems suggests his 7.5 year old complaint could at long last be headed for a final decision within a matter of months&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;The courts in Ireland would be reluctant to give a deadline and the DPC played that card and said they can&#8217;t provide a timeline&#8230; So we got the maximum that&#8217;s possible under Irish law. Which is &#8216;swift&#8217;,&#8221; he told TechCrunch, describing this as &#8220;frustrating but the maximum possible&#8221;.</p>
<p>Asked for his estimate of when a final decision will at last close out the complaint, he suggested it could be as soon as this summer &#8212; but said that more &#8220;realistically&#8221; it would be fall.</p>
<p>Schrems has been a vocal critic of how the DPC has handled his complaint &#8212; and more widely of the slow pace of enforcement of the bloc&#8217;s data protection rules vs fast-moving tech giants &#8212; with Ireland&#8217;s regulator choosing to raise wider concerns about the legality of mechanisms for transferring data from the EU to the US, rather than ordering Facebook to suspend data flows as Schrems had asked in the complaint.</p>
<p>The saga has already had major ramifications &#8212; leading to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">landmark ruling by Europe&#8217;s top court </a>last summer when the CJEU struck down a flagship EU-US data transfer arrangement after it found the US does not provide the same high standards of protection for personal data as the EU does.</p>
<p>The CJEU also made it clear that EU data protection regulators have a duty to step in and suspend transfers to third countries when data is at risk &#8212; putting the ball squarely back in Ireland&#8217;s court.</p>

<p>Reached for comment on the latest development the DPC told us it would have a response later today. So we&#8217;ll update this report when we have it.</p>
<p>The DPC, which is Facebook&#8217;s lead data regulator in the EU under the bloc&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), sent the tech giant a preliminary order to suspend data transfers back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">September</a> &#8212; following the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">landmark ruling by the CJEU</a>.</p>
<p>However Facebook immediately filed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/facebook-seeks-fresh-legal-delay-to-block-order-to-suspend-its-transatlantic-data-transfers/">legal challenge</a> &#8212; couching the DPC&#8217;s order as premature, despite the complaint itself being more than seven years old.</p>
<p>noyb said today that it&#8217;s expecting Facebook to continue to try to use the Irish courts to delay enforcement of EU law. And the tech giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">admitted last year</a> that it&#8217;s using the courts to &#8216;send a signal&#8217; to lawmakers to come up with a political resolution for an issue that affects scores of businesses which also transfer data between the EU and the US, as well as to buy time for a new US administration to be in a position to grapple with the issue.</p>
<p>But the clock is now ticking on how much longer Zuckerberg can play this game of regulatory whack-a-mole. And a final reckoning for Facebook&#8217;s EU data flows could come within half a year.</p>
<p>This sets a fairly tight deadline for any negotiations between EU and US lawmakers over a replacement for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/eu-us-privacy-shield-is-dead-long-live-privacy-shield/">defunct EU-US Privacy Shield</a>.</p>
<p>European commissioners <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/no-quick-fix-for-transatlantic-data-transfers-says-ec/">said last fall</a> that no replacement would be possible without reform of US surveillance law. And whether such radical retooling of US law could come as soon as the summer, or even fall, seems doubtful &#8212; unless there&#8217;s a major effort among US companies to lobby their own lawmakers to make the necessary changes.</p>
<p>In court documents Facebook filed last year, linked to its challenge of the DPC&#8217;s preliminary order, the tech giant suggested it might have to close service in Europe if EU law is enforced against its data transfers.</p>
<p>However its PR chief, Nick Clegg, swiftly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">denied Facebook would ever pull service</a> &#8212; instead urging EU lawmakers to look favorably on its data-dependent business model by claiming that &#8220;personalized advertising&#8221; is vital to the EU&#8217;s post-COVID-19 economic recovery.</p>
<p>The consensus among the bloc&#8217;s digital lawmakers, however, is that tech giants <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">need more regulation</a>, not less.</p>

<p>Separately today, an <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-01/cp210001en.pdf">opinion</a> by an influential advisor to the CJEU could have implications for how swiftly GDPR is enforced in Europe in the future if the court aligns with Advocate General Bobek&#8217;s opinion &#8212; as he appears to be taking aim at<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> bottlenecks that have formed in key jurisdictions like Ireland as a result of the GDPR&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism for handling cross-border cases.</span></p>
<p>So while Bobek confirms the general competence of a lead regulator to investigate in cross-border cases, he also writes that &#8220;the lead data protection authority cannot be deemed as the sole enforcer of the GDPR in cross-border situations and must, in compliance with the relevant rules and time limits provided for by the GDPR, closely cooperate with the other data protection authorities concerned, the input of which is crucial in this area&#8221;.</p>
<p>He also sets out specific conditions where national DPAs could bring their own proceedings, in his view, including for the purpose of adopting &#8220;urgent measures&#8221; or to intervene &#8220;following the lead data protection authority having decided not to handle a case&#8221;, among other delineated reasons.</p>
<p>Responding to the AG&#8217;s opinion, the DPC&#8217;s deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told us: “We, along with our colleague EU DPAs, note the opinion of the Advocate General and await the final judgment of the Court in terms of its interpretation of any relevant One Stop Shop rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked for a view on the AG&#8217;s remarks, Jef Ausloos, a postdoc researcher in data privacy at the University of Amsterdam, said the opinion conveys &#8220;a clear recognition that ACTUAL protection and enforcement might be crippled by the [one-stop-shop] mechanism&#8221;.</p>
<p>However he suggested any new openings for DPAs to bypass a lead regulator that could flow from the opinion aren&#8217;t likely to shake things up in the short term. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I think the door is open for some changes/bypassing DPC. BUT, only in the long run,&#8221; he said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://webflow.com/">Webflow</a>, a software company that helps businesses build no-code websites, announced that it has raised a $140 million Series B. The round, led by returning investors Accel and Silversmith, comes after the startup raised $72 million in an August, 2019 Series A.</p>
<p>The new funding values Webflow at more than $2.1 billion it said in a blog post that TechCrunch viewed before publication. Capital G, an Alphabet venture capital group, joined the Series B as well, with its investor <a href="https://twitter.com/lsturdy1?lang=en-us">Laela Sturdy</a> joining the startup&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Webflows offers a software that helps customers build websites without the need to write code; the company also offers hosting, and content-related capabilities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Webflow&#8217;s product fits into a category of companies arguing that building software for the Internet should get easier over time, not harder. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/tracking-the-growth-of-low-code-no-code-startups/">explored the no-code, low-code space 2020</a>, including asking investors bullish on its market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/22/five-vcs-talk-about-how-no-code-is-going-horizontal-across-the-worlds-industries/">about their views concerning its future</a>.</p>
<p>Webflow CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/callmevlad?lang=en">Vlad Magdalin</a> described the round as &#8220;opportunistic&#8221; for the company, telling TechCrunch that his company was not low on cash when the deal came together. Indeed, Magdalin said that his company ended 2020 cash-flow positive.</p>
<p>So why raise more money, let alone such a huge round? The CEO described the funds as &#8220;courage capital,&#8221; funds that will allow it to make investments into its business that may not have short-term revenue impacts. Magdalin said that the money may be spent on its enterprise products, support team, platform, and recruiting.</p>
<p>In an email, Accel investor, and Webflow board member <a href="https://twitter.com/ammathew?lang=en">Arun Mathew</a> echoed the CEO&#8217;s comments, adding that the company doubled its customer base in 2020.</p>
<p>That Webflow managed to break into the realm of startup profitability is less surprising when we recall that the no-code software company bootstrapped for more than a half-decade before taking external funds; it&#8217;s done this before.</p>
<p>Raising capital has other impacts on a business than the ability to raise spend. New capital, a higher valuation, and noise about a business can bolster recruiting efforts, and assuage customers concerned that the startup in question could either evaporate due to a lack of cash, or wind up bought, and either stripped by a private-equity firm, or subsumed by a tech giant.</p>
<p>Big companies don&#8217;t want to tie themselves to a product that could disappear. Webflow, now valued at $2.1 billion after its Series B closed, may have allayed those concerns for the time being.</p>
<p>Asked how 2020 went for the company, Magdalin said that its business doubled, which he described as an acceleration of its previous results.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear from our vantage point if the company is in the eight, or nine-figure revenue range, so it&#8217;s hard to vet how strong a roughly 100% growth rate is for Webflow; that it appears to have bested its 2019 growth rate in 2020 is encouraging for its future IPO prospects.</p>
<p>The company could see strong growth in 2021. Webflow&#8217;s CEO told TechCrunch that his company&#8217;s move up-market is starting to bear fruit. After noting that average contract values, or ACV, for its larger accounts were several orders of magnitude bigger than its sales agreements with SMBs, Magdalin said that its enterprise customers only account for around 5% of its present-day business today.</p>
<p>However, the CEO said that his firm had only begun to target the enterprise cohort last year, and expects to grow its larger-account business by a factor of ten this year.</p>
<p>And the company has big product plans, including building out its service to support richer and more powerful website creation. In the CEO&#8217;s view, websites are merely part of the software world, and he expects no-code tooling to take on more and more complex software tasks over time.</p>
<p>That could expand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/whats-ahead-for-no-code-and-low-code-startups/">the broader no-code market</a>, in our view, perhaps creating more space for startups to build services that allow for non-developers to depend less on engineering teams over time.</p>
<p>Mathew shares Magdalin&#8217;s bullish view on the no-code market, saying in an email that &#8220;the market is moving very quickly to being bullish on no-code tooling,&#8221; adding that we are &#8220;still very early in the adoption curve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that take, it&#8217;s not hard to see why Accel would want to double-down on Webflow. Accel has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/05/how-one-vc-firm-wound-up-with-no-code-startups-as-part-of-its-investing-thesis/">history of making large-dollar bets into companies that bootstrapped to scale</a>, including Webflow and Qualtrics. In the Qualtrics example, Accel <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/qualtrics/company_financials">led</a> its Series A, B, and C, rounds worth a combined total of $400 million.</p>
<p>To see Accel lead another round for Webflow, then, is in-keeping with prior investing patterns from the firm.</p>
<p>Capital G&#8217;s Sturdy, Webflow&#8217;s new board member, told TechCrunch in an email that her firm has been &#8220;bullish on the massive potential of no code for years,&#8221; leading it to hunt for &#8220;the most promising companies utilizing no code to transform sectors and democratize access to key tools.&#8221; Let&#8217;s see what it can do with another huge check and some time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Copy and paste the converted output. --></p>
<p>Car auto-insurance from legacy providers has structural bias built into it. It uses metrics such as credit score, income, marital status and education to figure out insurance rates, which eventually disproportionately hurts low-income individuals through high rates and low protection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.loopinsure.co/">Loop, </a>co-founded by John Henry and Carey Anne Nadeau, hopes to launch an alternative model that is equitable for all communities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Structural bias is baked into financial services and institutions that perpetuate and reinforce [it],” said Nadeau, who has worked at Brookings Institute and studied at MIT around topics of mobility. “We can&#8217;t just focus on banking, [and] insurance is sort of the overlooked ugly stepchild in the world view of financial services.”</p>
<h2>How to rewrite the rules</h2>
<p>Loop is a managing general agent (MGA) business so it can act as a broker and a vendor in the insurance space. It markets, acquires and services customers, instead of serving simply as a vendor built atop an existing insurance provider. The startup, also a B corp, is prioritizing profit alongside the environment and social dynamics.</p>
<p>The startup is trying to rewrite the rules of auto insurance by using two key metrics to track, create and charge insurance rates: state of roads and driver behavior. Loop bases rates off of usage, while a legacy provider might base rates off of demographics.</p>
<p>Loop is a mobile-only product that vertically integrates with insurance carriers.</p>
<p>Once a user downloads an app, Loop will find a quote for the user based on their location. The secret sauce is Loop’s tech: Using a database of over 100 million car crashes in 27 states, Loop creates a quote for a user based on their location. Henry, who co-founded Harlem Capital, describes Loop’s data is “almost a God-level understanding of crashes that have occurred on each, individual road.”</p>
<p>The startup also uses data around traffic volume, roadway infrastructure and weather data to set rates. The artificial intelligence capabilities could allow Loop to, say, steer a driver off of a road that has high-risk for crashes. Or it could simply reward them for clearing the road without a bumper scratch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095520" style="width: 863px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095520" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095520" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/medium_post_phone_mockup.png" alt="" width="853" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/medium_post_phone_mockup.png 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/medium_post_phone_mockup.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/medium_post_phone_mockup.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/medium_post_phone_mockup.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/medium_post_phone_mockup.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/medium_post_phone_mockup.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/medium_post_phone_mockup.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/medium_post_phone_mockup.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095520" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Loop</p></div></p>
<p>The other part of its business is based on telematics technology, which allows Loop to understand how and where a driver is going at all times. While legacy carriers might use lack of accidents to incentivize lower rates, Loop is using data to both set the rate and lower it.</p>
<p>Exchanging data for more flexibility could raise some eyebrows, but the co-founders think their customer-base, largely millennials and Gen Z, are comfortable with the model as it promises fairer prices. Loop makes a gross commission on every policy it sells.</p>
<p>Loop also pointed to Ohio-based Root Insurance as an example of how consumers are growing more comfortable with sharing location data. The car insurance startup went public <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/3-lessons-from-roots-ipo-pricing/">in what many saw as a successful IPO </a>for a midwestern high-growth tech company. Root similarly uses metrics like driver performance and history with telematics technology.</p>

<p>“They use telematics but they still are largely using legacy insurance models,” says Henry. “We&#8217;re kind of replacing that with our own AI based approach.”</p>
<p>Root might be the most obvious competitor, but usage-based pricing has been a rising dynamic in insurance <a href="https://content.naic.org/cipr_topics/topic_telematicsusage_based_insurance.htm">for over a decade</a> through various forms. Flexible insurtech has been on a tear recently, with MetroMile’s SPAC, Lemonade’s IPO and, on the early-stage front, Marshmallow,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/uks-marshmallow-raises-30m-on-a-310m-valuation-for-more-inclusive-car-insurance/"> a U.K. based auto insurance startup</a> last valued at $130 million.</p>
<p>The co-founders are confident that their technology is differentiated enough to survive the hot competition.</p>
<h2>A racial reckoning and a tweet</h2>
<p>The idea for the startup began in July 2020, when George Floyd, a Black man, was murdered by police. Protests erupted across the world, rallying for change and solutions to address systemic racism. VC firms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/">rushed to support Black founders</a>, and Henry saw a gap in solutions committed to change.</p>

<p>&#8220;It occurred to me that the change that we&#8217;re looking for was not gonna just bring itself about,&#8221; Henry said. &#8220;It takes intentional tackling of systemic issues.&#8221; He knew Nadeau had focused on transportation and mobility, and the duo eventually decided that they would &#8220;swing big.&#8221;</p>

Image Credits: Loop</p></div></p>
<p>While the co-founders admit the goal is ambitious, they have secured investors that think Loop could be a big business one day. The startup tells TechCrunch that it has raised a $3.25 million seed round led by Freestyle VC, with participation from Blue Fog Capital, Fontinalis Capital Partners, Concrete Rose, Uprising Ventures and Backstage Capital. Participating angel investors include Kristen Dickey, Steve Schlafman, Songe LaRon, Craig J. Lewis, Gerard Adams and Joshua Dorkin.</p>
<p>The money will be used for hiring and developing its data science infrastructure. It’s not live in the market yet, but is launching in Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania and New York (pending regulatory approval, of course).</p>
<p>The team met up with 77 investors, 25% of which were female investors, to get the funding needed to start Loop.</p>
<p>“It was more difficult than we thought,” said Henry. “We knew from the jump that we wanted to raise a larger seed round to signal to the market that we were looking to grow big.”</p>
<p>Loop eventually closed the goal round and valuation. As for the tipping point that got investors to back a company disrupting a $256 million industry with around $3 million in seed financing?</p>
<p>Mission, Henry says.</p>
<p>“I literally have goosebumps right now because the mission will open doors that profit cannot,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rho.co/">Rho Technologies</a>, the NYC-based fintech behind Rho Business Banking, has raised a $15 million Series A round led by M13 Ventures with participation from Torch Capital, and Inspired Capital. The company will use the proceeds to further expand their commercial banking platform aimed at high-growth businesses, starting with today’s launch of Rho AP. The platform is oriented towards companies that need more autonomy in business banking and will map quite well to the current distributed nature of work, post-pandemic.</p>
<p>After raising capital and launching in December 2020, the platform now claims to be handling over $2 billion per year in annualized transaction volume for its clients.  Rho AP expands on the core banking platform, by enabling companies to run full accounts payable lifecycles right within Rho, meaning invoices are uploaded, approved, coded, and paid &#8211; all within Rho. Companies no longer need another payables solution in addition to their bank account.</p>
<p>Rho’s platform approach consists of a single solution that encompasses both collaborative finance software and commercial-grade banking. It was founded by former Point72 and Deutsche Bank alum Everett Cook (CEO) and British-Canadian serial entrepreneur Alex Wheldon. Banking services are provided by Evolve Bank and Trust, member FDIC.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, Cook said: “At Rho, we are dedicated to empowering the teams that run today’s growing companies. We’ve developed the modern commercial banking platform built around the way companies operate today: distributed, team-oriented, transparent and built for scale. Rho AP is the next step on our mission to help teams work better together with money.”</p>
<p>Latif Peracha, General Partner at M13 and board member at Rho said: “We knew Rho had product-market fit when we discovered that several of our portfolio companies which span different sectors and sizes chose Rho for their banking needs. We believe there is an opportunity to build a powerful brand in business banking that treats the enterprise &#8211; and specifically, the CFO &#8211; as a consumer, and Rho has done that with a fully integrated product that makes managing a business much easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheldon said: “Having built and scaled multiple businesses, I&#8217;d always found that commercial banking was a major point of friction. Rho is empowering the whole organization to work better together by removing the silos and bottlenecks associated with finance.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bryte.com">Bryte</a> today announced $24M in Series A funding led by ARCHina Capital. This comes as the company moves away from selling its $8,000 mattress direct to consumers and instead is working with partners who would utilize Bryte&#8217;s technology in their mattresses.</p>
<p>Bryte says several deals are in the works.</p>
<p>According to the company, this pivot has always been part of the plan. They feel that through licensing, they can better accomplish the company&#8217;s goal of improving people&#8217;s sleep experience. Bryte doesn&#8217;t want to become another direct to consumer brand, but rather the underlying technology in some of the best mattresses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s original product is still available to consumers. Called the Restorative Bed, the mattress has built-in sensors and 100 computer-controlled pneumatic coils that work with the platform as it learns the owners&#8217; sleeping patterns and adjusts to best suit them &#8212; for both sleepers. Bryte says its technology enables better sleep patterns by adjusting the mattress through monitoring temperature, pressure points, and room environment.</p>
<p>The user selects several starting points for the mattress system. The system uses micro-adjustments to fine-tune the system to the sleeper. Each night&#8217;s sleep provides the mattress with more data points, which it uses to continually adjust the settings. The company says the greatest gains happen within 2-4 weeks and tend to reach an optimal level within 90 days.</p>
<p>With this funding round, the company is adding serious cash to its mission.</p>
<p>ARCHina Capital lead the $24M Series A funding round, with ARCHina&#8217;s Co-Founder Amy Huang joining Bryte&#8217;s board. The round also included investors John Warnock, co-founder of Adobe, and Dave Mooring, former President of Rambus.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last June, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/apple-commits-100m-to-its-new-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative/">committed $100 million</a> to a Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI). Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, is leading the initiative. Today, Apple is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/apple-launches-major-new-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative-projects-to-challenge-systemic-racism-advance-racial-equity-nationwide/">sharing</a> some of its work as part of the initiative.</p>
<p>“We’re launching REJI’s latest initiatives with partners across a broad range of industries and backgrounds — from students to teachers, developers to entrepreneurs, and community organizers to justice advocates — working together to empower communities that have borne the brunt of racism and discrimination for far too long. We are honored to help bring this vision to bear, and to match our words and actions to the values of equity and inclusion we have always prized at Apple,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company will contribute $25 million to the <a href="https://propelcenter.org">Propel Center</a>, an innovation and learning hub for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. It is going to be both a virtual platform and a physical campus in the Atlanta University Center. Apple is sharing some early renderings of the new building (see above and below).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Students will be able to follow different educational tracks focused on artificial intelligence, agricultural technologies, social justice, entertainment, app development, augmented reality, design and create arts and entrepreneurship. This isn’t just a monetary investment for Apple as employees will help develop curricula and provide mentorship as well. There will be internship opportunities for students.</p>
<p>In Downtown Detroit, the company will also open an Apple Developer Academy focused on young Black entrepreneurs. This is a collaborative effort with Michigan State University. It’ll be open to all learners across Detroit and teach valuable skills for entrepreneurs, creators and coders.</p>
<p>There will be two programs. A 30-day introductory program will help you learn more about app economy careers. And if you’re willing to dive deeper, there’s an intensive 10- to 12-month program. Apple is trying to reach 1,000 students per year with these two programs.</p>
<p>The third effort is focused on investment opportunities for Black and Brown entrepreneurs. Apple will invest $10 million with <a href="https://harlem.capital">Harlem Capital</a>, a VC firm based in New York. There will be more collaboration between Harlem Capital and Apple down the road.</p>
<p>Apple is also investing $25 million in Siebert Williams Shank’s Clear Vision Impact Fund. Finally, Apple is making a contribution to The King Center.</p>
<p>As you can see, Apple’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative is an on-going effort that requires evaluating new opportunities constantly. The company isn’t just trying to give money to everyone. It is evaluating each opportunity individually to find the best collaboration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A wave of organizations &#8212; propelled by global Covid-19 pandemic circumstances &#8212; are moving their commercial and financial interactions online, and today one of the big players helping to enable that shift is announcing a significant round of growth funding to expand the tools and services that it provides to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rapyd.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapyd</a>, which provides an API-based &#8220;fintech-as-a-service&#8221; platform covering payments, banking services, fraud protection and more, has raised $300 million, funding that CEO and co-founder Arik Shtilman said in an interview will be used to expand its team, build out more technology (next up: expanded fraud ID services and a wider marketplace), and to make selected acquisitions.</p>
<p>Rapyd&#8217;s customer base now numbers about 5,000 businesses, which includes marketplaces (labor marketplaces, and marketplaces for goods), e-commerce businesses, other kinds of lenders, and any business that might want to incorporate transactions or new financial services into their wider offerings. Shtilman said that at the moment, Rapyd is seeing its strongest growth yet, onboarding about 500 new customers each week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is coming at a $2.5 billion post-money valuation, Shtilman confirmed. (For some context on that, Rapyd was last valued at $1.2 billion in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/rapyd-which-offers-fintech-as-a-service-via-a-single-api-adds-20m-more-to-its-coffers-at-a-1-2b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 2019</a>.)</p>
<p>The round is a Series D and is being led by prolific growth-round VC Coatue, with Spark Capital, Avid Ventures, FJ Labs, and Latitude (all new backers) and General Catalyst, Oak FT, Tiger Global, Target Global, Durable Capital, Tal Capital, and Entrée Capital (all previous backers) also participating. Other past investors, notably, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/13/rapyd-nabs-40m-led-by-stripe-and-gc-for-fintech-as-a-service-a-single-api-for-payments-money-transfer-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">include another major player in the world of API-based financial services, Stripe</a>.</p>
<p>As with other companies in categories that have seen a huge surge of demand in the last year, financial services &#8212; and in particular those providing services to be able to carry out transactions online via the internet or phone &#8212; have proven to be some of the most mandatory and most used. (And no wonder, since bills still need paying, food and other items still need to be purchased, loans very much still need to be made, and so on.)</p>
<p>This was what many would call an &#8220;opportunistic&#8221; raise, made not to keep the lights on or to extend runway, but because the money was being offered to Rapyd at good terms, and there were smart places where it could be put to use to grow the business.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn’t plan to raise money when we raised this round, but when the pandemic came in our business started to boom,&#8221; Shtilman said. &#8220;We were approached by existing investors to scale beyond our original business plans after we completed our 2021 growth plans in three months in 2020. So we thought the timing was probably right for world domination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shtilman was partly (only partly) joking &#8212; he has a sort of deadpan delivery that I can&#8217;t quite capture here &#8212; but it&#8217;s a far cry from the startup&#8217;s early days, when &#8220;no one wanted to invest because e<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">veryone thought it would be too hard to execute. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Even our early investors advised us to focus on a smaller concept. But we thought building globally doesn’t work. To start small is against the idea. Over the last several years, the need to explain what we do [has] almost vanished.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The challenge (and opportunity) that Rapyd identified back in 2017 when it first opened for business (having been hatched in Israel originally) is that the global commerce and financial markets are very highly fragmented. Consumers and businesses in individual markets have their own preferred payment methods and demands, regulations differ, and the key companies involved vary from country to country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, APIs have long been a great instrument for integration and connection: using a few lines of code &#8212; and presuming your own services are built on code too &#8212; you can knit together services, and bring in commoditized functionality that would take ages to build from the ground up, cutting down the effort and work needed, to focus on making your core business more unique.</p>
<p>While companies like Stripe, Twilio and many others had identified the opportunity of leveraging APIs to scale out a world of functionality to a wider set of would-be customers, what Rapyd really identified and built out was the idea of loading not just one, two, or three services, but hundreds (even thousands) of features into that proposition. In fintech, where those services are complex, there is a big array of them from which to choose what to build, and also a big pool of would-be customers to use them, if you are aiming wide.</p>
<p>The idea is smart and, as Shtilman noted, very much in keeping with the economies of scale that exist in e-commerce and fintech: individual transactions are at the end of the day very incremental, so services that bring many together can finally start to conceive of interesting returns.</p>
<p>That, of course, is not just something Rapyd has identified and run with. That is to say, the company has a number of competitors now in the market.</p>
<p>Just last week, Germany-based Mambu, which also provides an API-based suite of services (7,000 at last count) under the idea of &#8220;banking as a service&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mambu-raises-135m-at-a-2b-valuation-for-an-saas-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised $135 million at a valuation of over $2 billion</a>. <a href="http://stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe</a>, a backer of Rapyd, also has continued to expand and add in a number of services well beyond payments. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/thought-machine-nabs-83m-for-a-cloud-based-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thought Machine</a> also raised a big round last year; <a href="https://www.temenos.com/">Temenos</a> and Italy’s <a href="http://www.ederabs.com/">Edera</a> are also strong players here.</p>
<p>And the field has so much opportunity that it&#8217;s even attracting a lot of newer entrants: witness <a href="http://unit.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unit</a>, another interesting player that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/unit-raises-18-6m-to-offer-banking-features-as-a-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">came out of stealth in the U.S. in December</a> with an interesting list of backers of its own.</p>
<p>&#8220;To build financial infrastructure, it doesn’t matter whether you are a small mom and pop or something bigger, you need many things, and if you want to sell in more than one jurisdiction you need a lot of those services,&#8221; Shtilman noted about the need for scale and breadth in a fintech platform proposition. He&#8217;s also very sanguine about competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have emerged like mushrooms after the rain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But if you don’t have competition it means you don’t have a business, so this is good. It means there is a lot of demand. But for now we are the market leader. We think we will become the AWS of this space.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where investors like Coatue are also landing for now.</p>
<p>“The payment landscape varies dramatically across countries. A company doing business globally might need to accept hundreds of local payment methods. Rapyd’s API, which abstracts away this complexity, is currently powering what we think are many of the world’s most exciting companies,” said Kris Fredrickson, Managing Partner at Coatue, in a statement. “We are honored to partner with Arik and team for the next phase of the Rapyd journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube has been the slowest of the big social media platforms to react to the threat of letting president Trump continue to use its platform as a megaphone to whip up insurrection in the wake of the attack on the US capital last week. But it&#8217;s now applied a temporary upload ban.</p>
<p>In a short <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1349205689395245056">Twitter thread</a> today, the Google-owned service said it had removed new content uploaded to Trump&#8217;s YouTube channel &#8220;in light of concerns about the ongoing potential violence&#8221;.</p>
<p>It also said it&#8217;s applied a first strike &#8212; triggering a temporary upload ban for at least seven days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the time of writing the verified Donald J Trump YouTube channel has some 2.78M subscribers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the ongoing concerns about violence, we will also be indefinitely disabling comments on President Trump&#8217;s channel, as we&#8217;ve done to other channels where there are safety concerns found in the comments section,&#8221; YouTube adds.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/ Given the ongoing concerns about violence, we will also be indefinitely disabling comments on President Trump’s channel, as we’ve done to other channels where there are safety concerns found in the comments section. <a href="https://t.co/1aBENHGU5z">https://t.co/1aBENHGU5z</a></p>
<p>&mdash; YouTubeInsider (@YouTubeInsider) <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1349205689395245056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>We reached out to YouTube with questions about the content that was removed and how it will determine whether to extend the ban on Trump&#8217;s ability to post to its platform beyond seven days.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman confirmed content that was uploaded to the channel on January 12 had been taken down for violating its policies on inciting violence, with the platform saying it perceiving an increased risk of violence in light of recent events and due to earlier remarks by Trump.</p>
<p>She did not confirm the specific content of the video that triggered the takedown and strike.</p>
<p>According to YouTube, platform is applying its standard &#8216;three strikes&#8217; policy &#8212; whereby, within a 90 day period, if a channel receives three strikes it gets permanently suspended. Under this policy a first strike earns around a week&#8217;s suspension, a second strike earns around two weeks and a third strike triggers a termination of the channel.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAql2DyGU2un1Ei2nMYsqOA">Trump&#8217;s official YouTube channel</a> has a series of recent uploads &#8212; including five clips from a speech he gave at the Mexican border wall, where he lauded &#8220;successful&#8221; completion of the pledge during the 2016 election campaign to &#8216;build the wall&#8217;.</p>
<p>In one of these videos, entitled &#8220;President Trump addresses the events of last week&#8221;, Trump characterizes supporters who attacked the US capital as a &#8220;mob&#8221; &#8212; and claims his administration &#8220;believes in the rule of law, not in violence or rioting&#8221; &#8212; before segueing into a series of rambling comments about the pandemic and vaccine development.</p>
<p>The clip ends with an entreaty by Trump for &#8220;our nation to heal&#8221;, for &#8220;peace and for calm&#8221;, and for respect for law enforcement &#8212; with the president claiming people who work in law enforcement form the backbone of the &#8220;MAGA agenda&#8221;.</p>
<p>An earlier clip of Trump speaking to reporters before he left for the tour of the border wall is also still viewable on the channel.</p>
<p>In it the president attacks the process to impeach him a second time as &#8220;a continuation of the greatest witch-hunt in the history of politics&#8221;. Here Trump name-checks Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer &#8212; in what sounds like a veiled but targeted threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;[For them] to continue on this path, I think it&#8217;s causing tremendous danger to our country and it&#8217;s causing tremendous anger,&#8221; he says, before tossing a final caveat at reporters that &#8220;I want no violence&#8221;. (But, well, if you have to add such a disclaimer what does that say about the sentiments you know you&#8217;re whipping up?)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The deplatforming of President Trump&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/embed/#?secret=RIeJkQjE1W" data-secret="RIeJkQjE1W" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While YouTube has opted for a temporary freeze on Trump&#8217;s megaphone, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">Twitter banned the president for good</a> last week after one too many violations of its civic integrity policy.</p>
<p>Facebook has also imposed what it describes as an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">&#8220;indefinite&#8221; suspension</a> &#8212; leaving open the possibility that it could in future restore Trump&#8217;s ability to use its tools to raise hell.</p>
<p>Up to now, YouTube has managed to avoid being the primary target of ire for those criticizing social media platforms for providing Trump with a carve out from their rules of conduct and a mainstream platform to abuse, bully, lie and (most recently) whip up insurrection.</p>
<p>However the temporary freeze on his account comes after civil rights groups had threatened to organize an advertiser boycott of its platform.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-google/exclusive-civil-rights-groups-demand-google-remove-trumps-youtube-channel-idUSL1N2JN3A3">Reuters</a>, the Stop Hate for Profit (SHP) campaign &#8212; which previously led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/facebook-instagram-rei-patagonia-north-face-brands-join-stophateforprofit-boycott/">major advertisers boycott of Facebook last summer</a> &#8212; had demanded that YouTube take down Trump’s verified channel.</p>
<p>“If YouTube does not agree with us and join the other platforms in banning Trump, we’re going to go to the advertisers,&#8221; one of SHP&#8217;s organizers, Jim Steyer, told the news agency.</p>
<p>In its official comments about the enforcement action against president Trump, YouTube makes no mention of any concern about ramifications from its own advertisers. Though, in recent years, it has faced some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/att-verizon-boycott-google-ads/">earlier boycotts</a> from advertisers over hateful and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/21/after-youtube-boycott-google-pulls-ads-from-more-types-of-offensive-content/">offensive content</a>.</p>
<p>In background remarks to reporters, YouTube also claims it consistently enforces its policies, regardless of who owns the channel &#8212; and says it makes no exceptions for public figures. However the platform has<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> been known to reverse a three strike termination &#8212; recently </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/youtube-reverses-ban-on-uks-talkradio-for-covid-19-policy-breaches/">reinstating the channel of UK broadcaster TalkRadio</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, for example, after it received a third strike related to coronavirus misinformation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In that case the channel&#8217;s reinstatement was reported to have followed an intervention by TalkRadio&#8217;s owner News Corp&#8217;s chairman, Rupert Murdoch. UK ministers had also defended the channel&#8217;s right to debate the merits of government policy.</span></p>
<p>In Trump&#8217;s case there are a dwindling number of (GOP) politicians willing to ride to his defense in light of the shocking events in Washington last week and continued violent threats being made online by his supporters.</p>
<p>However concern about the massive market power of tech platforms &#8212; meaning they are in a position to be able to take unilateral action and shut down the US president&#8217;s ability to broadcast to millions of people &#8212; is far more widespread.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Germany&#8217;s chancellor, Angela Merkel, called Twitter&#8217;s ban on Trump &#8220;problematic&#8221;, while lawmakers elsewhere in Europe have said it must lead to regulatory consequences for big tech.</p>
<p>So whatever his wider legacy, Trump certainly looks set to have a lasting policy impact on the tech giants he is now busy railing at for putting him on mute.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok announced today it&#8217;s making changes to its app to make the experience safer for younger users. The company will now set the accounts for users ages 13 to 15 to private by default, as well as tighten other controls for all users under 18, in terms of how they can interact with other users and TikTok content itself. TikTok is also announcing a partnership with <a href="https://www.commonsensenetworks.com/">Common Sense Networks</a>, a media company focused on creating and curating age-appropriate and engaging media experiences for kids and families.</p>
<p>The partnership will see Common Sense Networks working with TikTok to provide additional guidance on the appropriateness of its content for users under 13.</p>
<p>The social video app in 2019 had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/musical-ly-tiktok-fined-5-7m-by-ftc-for-violating-childrens-privacy-laws-will-update-app-with-age-gate/">fined $5.7 million by the Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) for violating U.S. children&#8217;s privacy laws. The FTC had begun looking into the app back when it was known as Musical.ly. The earlier version, prior to its acquisition by ByteDance, had collected personal information for children under 13 without parents&#8217; consent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a result of that ruling, TikTok created a new, legally compliant experience for younger users in the U.S. with age-appropriate content and no ability to publish videos.</p>
<p>Now, TikTok will restrict the experience for other minors using the app who are over 13, too.</p>
<p>For children ages 13 to 15, accounts will be set to private by default and TikTok will turn the setting &#8220;Suggest your account to others&#8221; to Off. This will allow users&#8217; videos to only be seen by those they approve as a follower and limits their account from being recommended to others elsewhere in the app.</p>
<p>Commenting controls are also being locked down for these users.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll now be able to choose between &#8220;Friends&#8221; or &#8220;No One&#8221; in terms of who can comment on their videos, and the &#8220;Everyone&#8221; option will be removed. The Dueting and Stitching features will also be removed, which limits how these younger users can engage with other TikTok users and their content. They won&#8217;t be able to make their videos downloadable either.</p>
<p>For those ages 16 to 17, the default setting for Duet and Stitch will be set to &#8220;Friends,&#8221; and they&#8217;ll only be able to download videos created by users 16 and over as a result of the lockdowns for younger users. Downloads for their own videos will also be set to Off by default, but they can enable this, if they choose.</p>
<p>TiTok had already restricted younger users&#8217; accounts before today in various ways, including not only through the under-13 age gated experience, but also by <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-introduces-family-pairing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-introduces-family-pairing&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610579819115000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRgT1gRjbUAcP9h_PQply7b0LdrQ">restricting direct messaging</a> and hosting live streams to accounts 16 and over, and restricting<a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/updating-our-gifting-policies"> virtual gifts</a> to users over 18. Parents additionally have had the option to control their child&#8217;s experience through the <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/supporting-youth-and-families-on-tiktok">Family Pairing</a> feature, which offers parental controls and screen time limits, among other things.</p>
<p>Of course, any of these restrictions can be worked around for those who lie about their age upon sign-up. But it&#8217;s still fairly unusual for a large social network to do more than look the other way when it knows that minors are on its app.</p>
<p>In TikTok&#8217;s case, however, it has a large underage user base &#8212; some <a href="https://blog.globalwebindex.com/trends/tiktok-music-social-media/">estimates</a> had said that 41% of TikTok is between ages 16 and 24. But in the U.S., TikTok has attracted a particularly large teenage userbase. The company <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiktok-cfius-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-opens-national-security-investigation-into-tiktok-sources-idUSKBN1XB4IL">said in 2020 that 60%</a> of its 26.5 million monthly active users in the U.S. were between 16 and 24. Even some of TikTok&#8217;s biggest stars, like Charli D&#8217;Amelio, are still just teenagers.</p>
<p>The attention to minor safety and parental controls gathered TikTok praise from notable youth safety experts, which the company also shared.</p>
<p>Today, TikTok is <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/">touting praise</a> it&#8217;s received from the National PTA, ConnectSafely, NCMEC, Family Online Safety Institute, and WeProtect Global Alliance. The groups believe the changes will help teens be able to use the app more safely, responsibility, and without the further risk of exploitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn’t be more pleased about partnering with TikTok to develop better content experiences for users under the age of 13,&#8221; added Eric Berger, CEO of Common Sense Networks, in reference to his organization&#8217;s partnership with the social video platform. &#8220;At Common Sense Networks, we see this engagement as an opportunity to double down on our commitment to elevate the quality of children’s digital media so that age-appropriate content is the rule in our industry and not the exception,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The changes will roll out starting today.</p>
