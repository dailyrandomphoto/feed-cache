										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://paddle.com/">Paddle</a>, a solutions provider subscription-based businesses, is betting on a future where App Store developers are able to use third-party payment systems &#8212; and it wants to be among the first to market with an alternative once such a system is permitted. The company today announced a new in-app purchasing (IAP) system aimed at iOS developers that&#8217;s designed to be a drop-in replacement for Apple&#8217;s own IAP. And it&#8217;s one where developers get to keep more of the revenue they earn, Paddle says.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big bet and not one that&#8217;s clear to pay off.</p>
<p>Paddle says its system will provide developers with access to customer data throughout their lifecycle; will offer a combination of direct subscription management and tools to pause subscriptions; and will support other payment mechanisms, like PayPal. It will also allow developers to manage their own refunds, which is something many developers have wanted for some time. Its fees would be 10% on transactions under $10 and 5% on transactions over $10. That&#8217;s less than Apple&#8217;s fees of 30% (which drop to 15% for year two of subscription-based apps, and for small businesses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">program</a> and Apple News Partner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/">program</a> participants.)</p>
<p>But Paddle&#8217;s entire product&#8217;s product hinges on its belief that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">court&#8217;s ruling</a> in the Epic v. Apple lawsuit will be held up upon appeal, and that the way Apple will interpret the ruling will allow payment system alternatives such as Paddle&#8217;s to operate. That&#8217;s not something Paddle at this point could definitively know.</p>
<p>In September, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">sided with Fortnite maker Epic Games</a> on the topic of third-party payments in the App Store in the landmark decision, though she found that Apple was not engaging in antitrust conduct. Epic, which wants to be able to also distribute its games directly to iOS users in addition to using its own payment mechanisms, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">said it would be appealing</a> the court&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the ruling was that Apple could no longer prohibit developers from including buttons, external links, and other calls to action inside their apps that could direct users to alternative payment mechanisms.</p>
<p>Even if this part of the judgment is not adjusted following the appeal, the judge&#8217;s wording on the matter of third-party payments is still open to interpretation by Apple. And currently, the thinking here is that it simply blocks Apple from rejecting apps pointing to other means of payment outside its store &#8212; not that Apple would have to go so far as to support a competitive payment system that&#8217;s built into the apps themselves. <a href="https://www.imore.com/app-purchase-alternative-paddle-will-see-apps-rejected-says-expert">Experts have already pushed back</a> on the idea this system could make it through App Review.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paddle, however, believes it has a shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our understanding, and that of our legal advisors, is that Paddle In-App Purchase is permissible within the Apple vs Epic legal ruling,&#8221; said Paddle CEO Christian Owens. &#8220;We would welcome Apple sharing its own interpretation on this to bring further clarity to an issue that will have a significant impact on iOS developers and the wider market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company plans to make its system available from Dec. 7, 2021, in line with the court&#8217;s ruling.</p>
<p>Paddle today has over 3,000 software clients (sellers) using its platform for other services today, and processes billions of dollars in payment volume per year. It will be interesting to see if any developers actually go so far as to implement this Apple IAP alternative, which could risk having their apps rejected from the App Store.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Increasingly, conversations about big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence are going hand-in-hand with conversations about privacy and data protection. Now, a startup that is building tools to make it easier for engineers to implement the two simultaneously is announcing a round of growth funding to continue expanding its operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://gretel.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gretel AI</a>, which lets engineers create anonymized, synthetic, datasets based on their actual datasets to use in their analytics and to train machine learning models has closed $50 million in funding, a Series B that it will be using to get the company to the next stage of development. The product &#8212; which is built as a SaaS product but can also be accessed via APIs &#8212; is still in beta but aims to be open to general availability later this year.</p>
<p>Anthos Capital is leading the round with Section 32 also participating alongside Greylock and Moonshots Capital. Greylock led the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/gretel-announces-12m-series-a-to-make-it-easier-to-anonymize-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s previous round in 2020</a>, and the startup has raised $65.5 million to date.</p>
<p>From what we understand, this latest round puts the company&#8217;s valuation at between $320-$350 million.</p>
<p>The idea behind using synthetic datasets is that it lets an organization remove the risk of data leaking that might contain personal information or other kinds of sensitive data. There are other solutions to address the same issue involving data encryption, although this can be a costly, time-consuming and resource intensive approach that faces scaling challenges.</p>
<p>The germination for Gretel.ai came out of the direct experiences of the three co-founders in work they did as cybersecurity specialists at a range of organizations including IBM, AWS, Netscout and the U.S. military and over the years.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&#8220;We always found that using the right permissions with data was always the bottleneck,&#8221; said Ali Golshan, the CEO who co-founded the company with Alex Watson (CPO) and John Myers (CTO). The could see that the longer-term issue wold be a growing need and priority for data privacy. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As the world moves from the web to the immersive world of sensors and IOT we are transitioning into a world where people will share their data unconsciously or unknowingly. But humans are not meant to be mined.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">As data engineers, their priority is to be able to work with data easily and quickly, but as citizens of the world, they were unhappy with data protection implications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Removing the bottleneck of compute is the problem we’ve solved, and we have created high velocity development,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But now we are running into the bottleneck of the data. AI is on a collision course with privacy. At this collision course, we should create tools&#8221; to fix that.</p>
<p class="p1">Gretel&#8217;s opportunity is one that many companies targeting the enterprise market have taken in the world of digital transformation: many organizations now have large engineering operations working on applications to run their businesses, but they still do not have the firepower of the world&#8217;s largest technology companies. So Gretel set out to build a toolkit that would let any company build anonymized datasets for themselves, similar to what big tech companies use in their own data work.</p>
<p>The advantage of anonymized data goes beyond simply replacing a synthetic dataset for an actual one; they can also be used to augment a dataset, or to fill in the gaps where the real-world data might be lacking. Both of these are critical components especially in cases where the data is needed to train systems, such as in the case of autonomous services, where you seemingly can never have enough teaching data.</p>
<p>Watson had previously worked at AWS (fun fact: we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/amazon-aws-harvest-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scooped</a> when Amazon acquired his previous startup, harvest.ai), and he says that to date Gretel.ai <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has secured early customers in areas like </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">life sciences, financial services and gaming. In more basic use cases, it can take as little as 10 minutes to create a synthetic dataset. In more complex applications &#8212; for example in a genomic database, it could take several days. </span></p>
<p>Relatively speaking, this represents &#8220;very low friction&#8221; for engineers, Watson said, both compared to other approaches such as data encryption using techniques like homomorphic encryption, or indeed the analogue approach of contacting third parties and getting permissions to use datasets. The latter can take six months or longer, too long in cases where time is of the essence;</p>

<p>“This significant Series B investment is a direct reflection of Gretel’s ambitious vision, swift growth, and strength of position in the AI industry as the standard-bearer of tools that enable privacy by design,” said Emily White, President of Anthos Capital, in a statement. “Gretel’s ease of use, the extendability of its services, and the superior accuracy and quality of its synthetic data are much-needed solutions to simplify the exceedingly complex legal and technical barriers companies face due to data privacy concerns.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Gretel gives data teams working in any framework or language the tools they need to build privacy by design into their existing workflows and data pipelines, greatly simplifying this process,&#8221; added Sridhar Ramaswamy, partner at Greylock. &#8220;Time and time again I hear from software engineers and data scientists about the value Gretel offers. Its developer-first, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">tech-agnostic approach to solving privacy issues is incredibly valuable to every business sector.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I work in talent acquisition for a rapidly scaling startup, and I’m looking for an edge to onboard top engineers. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m seeing many stellar candidates who are about to graduate from a U.S. university and who mention programs like CPT, OPT and STEM OPT. How do we recruit and retain them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Rigorous Recruiter</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dear Rigorous,</p>
<p>Many startups overlook the pool of talented international students or those who recently graduated or will soon graduate from U.S. colleges or universities &#8212; many of whom want to remain here to work &#8212; because the companies might feel intimidated by what they know they don’t know about the U.S. immigration process.</p>
<p>Early-stage startups often assume that offering a job to an international student or recent graduate on an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/f-1-visa-students/">F-1 student visa</a> might be too complicated, or they worry if it’s too hard for an early-stage startup to secure them an H-1B. I recently dove into <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/091-what-you-need-to-know-about-hiring-student-on-opt/">What You Need to Know About Hiring Students on OPT</a> on my podcast. Fortunately, international students and grads provide a rich talent pool full of highly motivated individuals, and managing their immigration is totally possible.</p>
<p>The two main types of training programs available to most international students who hold an F-1 visa to work in their field of study include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curricular Practical Training (CPT), which is available at some colleges and universities to currently enrolled students. Not every university or degree program offers it.</li>
<li><a href="http://alcorn.law/opt-optional-practical-training/">Optional Practical Training</a> (OPT), which is available during coursework (Pre-Completion OPT) or after graduation (Post-Completion OPT) and in some cases can be extended through the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/stem-opt-extension/">STEM OPT</a> extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike work visas, employers do not have to directly “petition” F-1 students for CPT and OPT (for example, the Form I-129, which is used for H-1Bs and O-1As, is not involved). However, CPT and OPT require the student to work in an area directly related to their field of study, and the employer may need to provide information or other documents such as a training plan for the student to qualify or apply. I’ll go into these in more depth below.</p>
<p>For an H-1B in the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/002-2020-h-1b-lottery-update/">lottery</a>, a startup only needs to meet some basic <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B sponsorship requirements</a> to have a shot. These can include being incorporated, offering a specialty occupation job, and having the ability to pay the H-1B candidate’s salary for the term of the requested H-1B petition (usually up to three years). Then a startup’s candidate has the same chance of being selected in the annual lottery as a candidate with the same education level who is sponsored by a tech giant. (Big Tech and tech consulting companies may tend to sponsor a lot of people in the lottery, but their candidates are not given extra weight in the government’s process!) In addition, a proposal to shift from a random H-1B lottery to a wage-based lottery was thrown out by a federal court judge in September, so next year’s lottery will be random with a slight preference for candidates with advanced U.S. degrees, but no preference based on salary.</p>
<p>I recommend that you consult with an experienced immigration attorney to guide you, your startup and the student or graduate through this process. An immigration attorney can also help you strategize the best course of action for the students and graduates that you decide to sponsor for a work visa or green card.</p>

<h2>How does CPT work?</h2>
<p><a href="https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/sevis-help-hub/student-records/fm-student-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training-cpt">Curricular Practical Training (CPT)</a> is available at somes universities where training is already an integral part of the school’s established curriculum. Some graduate programs allow or even require students to apply for CPT at the very beginning of the program, dubbed “Day 1 CPT.”</p>
<p>Students must get approval for CPT from the Designated School Official (DSO) at their university or college. If you want to hire an international student on CPT, the student will need to provide information about the job to the DSO, such as the position, duties, wage, time commitment and any other information the DSO may request to decide whether the job qualifies.</p>
<p>One year of full-time (more than 20 hours per week) CPT eliminates a student’s eligibility for OPT. However, part-time (20 hours per week or less) CPT will not impact a student’s eligibility.</p>
<h2>How does OPT work?</h2>
<p>Like CPT, Optional Practical Training (OPT) is limited to 12 months. OPT is available to international students at each education level: bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral.</p>
<p>There are two types of OPT: pre-completion (before graduation) and post-completion. Most F-1 students choose to start OPT after graduation so that they can work full time. Under pre-completion OPT, students can only work part time. Every two months of part-time, pre-completion OPT will reduce by one month the amount of OPT that can be done after graduation.</p>
<p>If a student wants to work while taking courses, I often recommend pursuing CPT if available and work part time to preserve post-completion OPT.</p>
<p>For OPT, the student must apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a work permit. How do they do it? The student must obtain the DSO’s authorization and signature on Form I-20 (Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status). That form, along with Form I-765 (Application for Employment Authorization Document) and the filing fee, must be submitted to USCIS within 30 days of the DSO’s endorsement.</p>
<p>For post-completion OPT, Form I-765 can be filed as early as 90 days before the student graduates, but no later than 60 days after graduation. If a student is applying on or before October 31, 2021, then the application can be filed as early as 120 days before graduation. That temporary change resulted from a settlement in a class-action lawsuit. The student or graduate can begin working once the work authorization card is received.</p>
<h2>How does the STEM OPT extension work?</h2>
<p>Students or graduates on OPT can qualify for a 24-month extension if they earned a <a href="https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/stem-list.pdf">STEM degree</a>. To be eligible to hire an individual on STEM OPT, your startup must:</p>
<p>Be enrolled and in good standing in the government’s <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/e-verify">E-Verify</a> program; provide a formal training program in the individual’s field of study and complete <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/i983.pdf">Form I-983</a> (Training Plan for STEM OPT Students); and offer a position that is equivalent to others in duties, hours and compensation, among other legal requirements.</p>
<p>STEM OPT also requires a new work permit. Form I-765, an updated Form I-20 that is signed by the DSO can be filed as early as 90 days before OPT ends (or 120 days if filing on or before October 31, 2021), but no later than 60 days after the DSO signs off on the I-20. Candidates seeking a STEM OPT extension can still <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/complete-correct-form-i-9/completing-section-1-employee-information-and-attestation/foreign-academic-students">continue to work</a> for I-9 purposes for up to 180 days while they are waiting for the approval.</p>
<h2>What happens next?</h2>
<p>Graduates have a 60-day grace period following their OPT or STEM OPT expiration date to either leave the U.S., change to another status or start a new degree program on an F-1 visa.</p>
<p>Any students your startup wants to retain should be registered in the annual H-1B lottery in March of each year. You can enter students in the H-1B lottery even before they graduate. If they don’t get selected, you can register them the following year, and so on until they’re selected or their time on OPT or STEM OPT runs out.</p>
<p>Some students might be eligible to stay working in the U.S. while their H-1B is pending in a status called “Cap Gap.” Your immigration attorney can help you determine alternatives to the H-1B for students and graduates based on their situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you think about service meshes, a somewhat esoteric cloud native tool designed to stitch different microservices together, you might not think it&#8217;s the most lucrative side of the Kubernetes led cloud native market, but you would be wrong. Today, <a href="http://solo.io">Solo.io</a>, a Cambridge, Massachusetts service mesh startup, announced a $135 million Series C at a fat $1 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Altimeter Capital led today&#8217;s round with participation from existing investors Redpoint Ventures and True Ventures. By the way, that valuation is a 10x increase over their previous valuation at the time of their $23 million Series B round in October 2020 and brings the total raised to $171.5 million.</p>
<p>While founder and CEO Idit Levine says the company she started in 2017 anticipated the rise of the service mesh market in general, she doesn&#8217;t see her company strictly focusing on that particular technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;We predicted everything that will happen in the market and honestly service mesh is catching on like crazy. But I will say that saying Solo is [strictly] a service mesh company, to me it&#8217;s like saying that Amazon only sells books. That&#8217;s where we started, and we&#8217;ll do whatever we need to do and go with the market,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company made some early bets on the open source Envoy proxy and Istio service mesh, Both projects have grown to be leaders in this space, and the company has been a major contributor to both from the very beginning, which puts it in a good position to build commercial products on top of these projects.</p>
<p>Just recently, Solo released <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/solo-io-integrates-a-cloud-native-api-gateway-and-service-mesh-into-its-enterprise-platform/">an updated version of Gloo Mesh technology</a>. The startup was able to combine an API gateway and service mesh into a single control plane, vastly simplifying the management of these technologies.</p>
<p>As they grow, as you would expect, the team is growing too with around 70 employees. She said her strategy has been to hire young people and teach them the business and it&#8217;s been working well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of diversity, she says that as a woman with a highly technical background, she has sometimes been frustrated by tokenism. &#8220;I never asked for anybody to give me this discount because I&#8217;m a woman. Actually, sometimes it has been irritating. Oh, we want to give you a talk because you&#8217;re a woman. It pissed me off. You need me to give a talk because I am damn good,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As she builds her company, she is making the effort to find more diverse candidates. Her current group of engineers is 30% women, which is high by tech company standards, and she continually looks for historically underrepresented groups as she hires.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of diversity in the company. [&#8230;] I think that it&#8217;s contributing to [our success]. We are reaching out to women in tech and people of color in tech, so we are definitely trying. We are going to meetups [and other places] and looking out for [diverse] people. And so we are trying and it&#8217;s definitely what we want to achieve,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>While Levine didn&#8217;t want to share specific revenue numbers, she said that the company&#8217;s goal for FY2021, which runs February to February, was to triple their ARR from the previous year, and they were able to do that by the end of Q2 of the fiscal year, putting them on track for some explosive growth. And she says, part of the reason for that is that companies are signing up for Solo&#8217;s products for multiple years. In fact, 35% of their contracts are for 2-3 years, accounting for over 100 contracts so far.</p>
<p>That could explain why investors were willing to pour so much money into this company and value it so highly. Levine says that she wasn&#8217;t looking for funding, but customer demand has been growing so quickly, and the funds will enable them to accelerate and keep the growth they&#8217;ve been experiencing going.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically there wasn&#8217;t any reason to take the money. I think that the reason I took this on is because we want to take over [the entire] market, and we need to grow. There&#8217;s so many demands and we need to scale dramatically, and that&#8217;s the main reason that we took this round,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rise of privacy-oriented financial blockchain projects are going to be crucial if “DeFi” (decentralized finance) is to have any kind of future. We have come to expect privacy in our “normal” financial lives, so we will expect it in the blockchain and Crypto world, whatever some might claim.<br />
We saw murmurs of that starting to happen back in May, when the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/in-the-race-towards-web-3-financial-privacy-secret-network-attracts-backing-from-key-players/">Secret Network blockchain</a>, a privacy-first smart contract platform, attracted investment from Arrington Capital, and Blocktower Capital. Furthermore, it was apparent when decentralized finance company Sienna Network <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/signalling-that-privacy-is-coming-to-defi-sienna-network-raises-11-2m-for-its-platform/">raised $11.2 million</a> from institutional investors and public supporters.</p>
<p>It was no coincidence that Sienna is built on the aforementioned Secret Network. Thus today Sienna is launching its &#8216;Automated Market Maker’ SiennaSwap, which works on its platform. Sienna token holders can now convert tokens into their private equivalent and then swap or place them in liquidity pools to gain yield.</p>
<p>It means users can avoid the lack of privacy on exchanges that allow others to see what users are doing and arbitrage on those transactions with “<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp">front-running</a>” &#8211; a key weakness of Crypto transactions today.</p>
<p>Also playing in this privacy space are Uniswap, PancakseSwap and other DEXs in the crypto ecosystem. However, where SiennaSwap differentiates, it says, is its privacy-preserving features, which, it claims, address the front-running issue. Sienna is also part of the Cøsmos Ecosystem, where plenty of new projects are launching, virtually every day, further enhancing its broader offering.</p>
<p>The SiennaSwap launch follows the organization’s $11.2 million private and public sale of its tokens in May when the organization raised $10 million in the private sale from investors such as Magnus NGC, Inclusion Capital, Lotus Capital, FBG, Skyvision Capital, and others.</p>
<p>It’s perhaps also worth noting that Sienna Network is a ‘carbon-friendly’ Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, requiring vastly less energy Proof-Of-Work chains like Bitcoin which require miners to use large amounts of power.</p>
<p>Tor Bair, Founder, Secret Foundation said: “Sienna’s launch marks a massive turning point both for Secret’s DeFi ecosystem and for DeFi in general. Providing privacy by design to users is critical to securing and scaling these new financial platforms, meaning Sienna is primed to create a new explosion of growth.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Sequoia partner Stephanie Zhan and Nick Fajt, founder and CEO of social gaming platform Rec Room, explained what the venture capital firm looks for in consumer-facing startups.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sequoia is one of the most sought-after VC firms in the world, and predictably, it sees plenty of startups competing for its attention.</p>
<p>In a recent episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/extra-crunch-live/">TechCrunch Live (formerly Extra Crunch Live)</a>, Sequoia partner Stephanie Zhan and Nick Fajt, founder and CEO of social gaming platform <a href="https://recroom.com/">Rec Room</a>, explained what the venture capital firm looks for in consumer-facing startups. We even took a look at Rec Room&#8217;s earliest pitch deck, the seed that ultimately grew into a business that has raised nearly $150 million.</p>
<p>This episode also featured the ECL Pitch-off, where founders in the audience pitched their products and services to our expert guests to get their live feedback. You can check out the whole episode as well as the Rec Room pitch deck below.</p>
<h2>Love is the answer</h2>
<p>Sequoia, alongside almost every other VC firm, prizes one factor when deciding to investing in a consumer-facing company: User love.</p>
<p>There are a handful of ways to measure user love, from NPS scores to retention and engagement metrics to reviews of the product.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks after it launched, Rec Room was seeing users average 26 minutes per session, and around 90 minutes per user every day, which meant that many users were coming back for multiple sessions.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that we aren&#8217;t talking about tens of thousands of users. But in small numbers, the product was resonating, so it stood to reason that it would also resonate with more people. Sequoia was very drawn to this, and Zhan noted that in consumer companies, user love is the most important thing she looks for.</p>
<p>&#8220;This wasn&#8217;t just people coming in, saying hi, and popping out,&#8221; said Zhan. &#8220;There was real engagement here, even in relatively small numbers. That&#8217;s what stood out most. That was the real magic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside time per session, Sequoia used Rec Room&#8217;s &#8216;high five&#8217; metrics to evaluate user love.</p>
<p>High fives don&#8217;t actually have any value in Rec Room games themselves. You don&#8217;t win or earn anything by giving a high five. But the metrics around high fives continued to go up as more people played.</p>
<p>Zhan elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nick had been thinking a lot about what forms of communication and interaction matter. One of the things that I forgotten about, but I remembered re-reading some of our internal communication at Sequoia from while we were evaluating Rec Room at the time, was that we kept talking about this notion of high fives. It&#8217;s interesting. I literally had a count of the number of high fives that the current user base had at the time. And I wondered why do high fives matter?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cord.com">Cord</a>, a startup that offers a single API to add Slack-like collaboration features to any app, has bagged $17.5 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The round &#8212; which is pegged to fund product development, including by hiring engineers, designers and product managers &#8212; was led by European VC Index. Other investors participating include NFX and Stride, along with angel investors Elad Gil, Jeff Morris Jr., Charlie Songhurst, Guy Podjarni and Matt Robinson.</p>
<p>The London based startup was only founded last year. It&#8217;s not disclosing customers numbers yet but has today revealed a partnership with the &#8216;conversational data collection&#8217; platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/typeform-a-platform-for-conversational-data-collection-raises-35m/">Typeform</a> &#8212; which is using Cord&#8217;s API to offer its customers the ability to collaborate as they design online forms.</p>
<p>Cord says a private beta it was running, which ended in August when it opened up for general access, has involved &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of clients &#8212; including other undisclosed SaaS makers, startups and scale-ups.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our best markets are really B2B SaaS that&#8217;s used by teams, so we see everything from people using it in CRMs like HubSpot, CMSs like Webflow or WordPress, marketing tools like Mailchimp, BI tools like Amplitude, no-code tools like Retool and everywhere else you work with other people you need approval, or help, or feedback from,&#8221; the startup tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now it&#8217;s more heavily taken up by teams that are from early stage startups to scale up, we do see use amongst Typeform&#8217;s enterprise clients so some very big multi-billion dollar tech companies and consumer brands that are Typeform users<b> </b>or a big motion picture studio who uses <span class="il">Cord</span> in their BI tools.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cord&#8217;s API &#8212; which it touts as a single line of Javascript &#8212; enables paying customers to quickly add a range of collaborative features to their own products, taking the strain out of developing social add-ons like real-time chat, presence, annotations, integrations with task managers and Slack, screen recordings, audio messages, live co-browsing and video chat.</p>

<p>Information workers of the world who already find themselves struggling to stay on top of all the channels they need to check for Slack-style notifications, pings and other digital chatter should prepare for this kinda of social noise to get exponentially worse; essentially it could end up like omnipresent background radiation &#8212; spread across every piece of business software.</p>
<p>Commenting on Cord&#8217;s raise in a statement, Jan Hammer, partner at Index Ventures, predicted resistance to this trend will nonetheless be futile.</p>
<p>“The growth of remote working, combined with a proliferation of software-as-a-service tools, means that teams lose time moving back and forth between productivity and communications applications, such as Slack. Cord allows users to stay within the app that best supports their workflow but still get the benefits of collaboration,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;We like that Cord adds to existing apps – it’s not yet another solution customers will have to adopt, it’s a solution inside what they’re already used to. Eventually, we believe SaaS tools will ship with Cord straight out of the box.”</p>
<p><span class="il">Cord&#8217;s pitch is that its API </span>saves companies &#8220;years&#8221; of development time by making it super simple for them to add a social dimension &#8212; and thereby steal a competitive march on more siloed peers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Most web products will become a multiplayer experience in the coming years,” suggests Nimrod Priell, <span class="il">Cord</span>’s CEO and co-founder, in a statement. “We already see it happening: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/figma-raises-50-million-series-d-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">Figma</a> reached 4 million users in 4 years and decimated Adobe, Invision and Sketch to become the dominant prototyping design app &#8212; in major part thanks to its built-in collaboration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;If Figma is the ‘Google Docs of design,’ we empower every product to become the Google Docs of their respective industries.”</p>
<p>Priell is a former Facebook product manager. While another Cord co-founder, Jackson Gabbard, who is also its CTO, was an early Facebook engineer who worked on some formative features of its platform and am internal suite of tools used by tens of thousands of Facebook employees.</p>
<p>On the competitive front, Cord is not the only startup trying to sell other companies a easy route to adding real-time collaborative features &#8212; it points to <a href="http://roomservice.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://roomservice.dev/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633611719004000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcNpzuLuTkVE6cLEhEmdIt_ksPfw">roomservice.dev</a> as another team building similar APIs, for example.</p>
<p>There are other startup too, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/liveblocks-is-an-api-that-lets-you-add-real-time-collaboration-to-your-product/">Liveblocks</a> &#8212; or, at the lower level of the collaboration pipe, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/ably-raises-70-million-for-its-developer-platform-that-enables-realtime-features/">Ably</a>.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/19/google-launches-drive-realtime-api-to-let-developers-build-apps-with-real-time-collaboration/">Google has been offering an API</a> for devs to add Google Docs-style collaboration to their own apps for the best part of a decade.</p>
<p>But Cord also argues its main competition is internal dev efforts to build collaboration tools in-house &#8212; making a SaaS-style pitch to other businesses not to bother investing precious time and money away from their &#8220;core experience and mission&#8221;, and instead outsource the building of a &#8220;high quality communication experience&#8221;, which integrates with core services like Slack and Teams and is kept up to date by a dedicated team of API builders, to yet another third party provider.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Since its launch a year ago, the company has grown 32% month over month, has approximately 1,000 brand clients and processed over 500,000 orders.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://pidedirecto.mx/">PideDirecto</a>, a Mexico-based company, is developing a platform that enables local businesses in Latin America to sell directly to their consumers and deliver orders in less than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Hussein Fawzi and Ronni Samir launched the company with Anders Steiner and Antonio Nacoud in September 2020. Fawzi, Samir and Nacoud knew each other from Iraq and studied together in college in Sweden, which is where they met Steiner.</p>
<p>After going their separate ways for a bit, they met up in Mexico and launched a corporate wellness program in 2018 that connected people with restaurants to order lunch or snacks. During the pandemic, many of their customers were working from home, and the demand for home deliveries went from 10% to 80%.</p>
<p>At the same time, customers were telling Fawzi and Samir that 25 to 30% of every sale was going to delivery marketplaces, something that was difficult to sustain. They were also at the mercy of the drivers and reliant on the marketplaces for their deliveries.</p>
<p>“That is when we started PideDirecto, to enable local businesses to scale their direct-to-consumer sales channels,” Fawzi said. “We build the online storefronts for the brands and operate logistics for businesses, like pharmacies, local retailers, restaurants and CPG brands. Think of us as Shopify with 30-minute deliveries.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Latin America’s second wave of digital transformation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/latin-americas-second-wave-of-digital-transformation/embed/#?secret=xuOXYL6epf" data-secret="xuOXYL6epf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today, the company announced an oversubscribed $5.25 million round of seed funding, led by JAM FUND, with participation from Soma Capital, Acacia Ventures, Kube VC, Flexport, Y Combinator and a group of individual investors from companies including Grubhub, Jeeves, Par Technologies, Uber and Google.</p>
<p>“PideDirecto is making it simple and cost effective for brands to build a scalable direct to consumer sales channel within minutes,” Justin Mateen, founder of JAM FUND, said via email. “I am excited to support the team’s mission to empower brands to expand their reach and own their customer relationship.“</p>
<p>Since its launch a year ago, the company has grown 32% month over month, has approximately 1,000 brand clients and has processed more than 500,000 orders.</p>
<p>PideDirecto charges customers like a SaaS model, with pricing starting at $1,900 a month, which includes delivery service and marketing tools. Other levels include a website, unlimited ordering and advanced marketing tools. Delivery fees are paid by the consumer, Fawzi said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While there are delivery services and ordering apps in Latin America, Samir added that very few third-party companies are offering a complete suite of products. This enables companies to be on marketplaces, but to own every sales channel and provide the same level of customer service no matter what communication method is being used.</p>
<p>“Their business is to sell, but many people don’t realize that logistics and e-commerce are two different businesses,” Samir added.</p>
<p>The new capital will be used to build out a technology team for future product features. PideDirecto will also look into marketing and to scale its presence in Mexico as well as expanding into new countries, like Colombia and Costa Rica, by the end of next year.</p>
<p>As it now gears up to raise a Series A round, Fawzi said the company’s aim is to build an all-in-one platform for businesses to manage and scale online sales. It is focusing on direct integration with marketplaces and onboarding brands into its operating system.</p>
<p>“The future of commerce is a hybrid one where you will have to service the client on every sales channel,” he added. “We are building out the necessary infrastructure that merchants need to do this and leveraging technology for the online storefront, the payment solutions, CRM data and marketing and logistics.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is launching a new website and app this fall with about 200 luxury retailers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Luxury wholesale marketplace <a href="https://themaintab.com/tmt-landing/index.html">The Main Tab</a> is redesigning its platform following a $1 million pre-seed raise earlier this year from serial entrepreneur Jason Bright, who is now the company’s CTO.</p>
<p>The New York-based company is poised to launch the new website and app this fall with about 200 retailers, but has a waiting list of approximately 1,000 retailers, Liseda Shelegu, The Main Tab’s founder, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We have deployed a significant amount of the funding to the technology side to completely replatform our website from scratch,” she said. “We are the only marketplace that is sales rep-friendly. Sales reps write all of the orders and were initially one of our biggest roadblocks because of contracts, so we brought them on board and made them part of the company.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213711" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213711" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2213711" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg" alt="The Main Tab" width="1024" height="717" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg 3543w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg?resize=768,538 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg?resize=680,476 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg?resize=1536,1075 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg?resize=2048,1434 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Main-Tab-Landing-Page-Image.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213711" class="wp-caption-text">The Main Tab landing page. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Main Tab</p></div></p>
<p>Additional funding will go toward adding to its team of three, and sales and marketing, something Shelegu, who has a background in sales, was cautious about — not wanting to throw a bunch of money into advertising, so she connected with retailers, brands and sales reps the “old-school way” by reaching out directly.</p>
<p>One of the challenges the company is anticipating is inventory, she added. Inventory shortages and supply chain slowdowns that are plaguing e-commerce right now are affecting her retailers. For example, one owner said inventory of candles would be about 20% of the normal units due to not being able to source glass.</p>
<p>“When you are running a business, this will hugely impact us if we normally do $20,000 a month in October, but may do $5,000 because they don’t have the stock,” Shelegu said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shelegu jokes that much of The Main Tab’s product sourcing comes from her being a “shopaholic” and her background in brands. She also gets many targeted ads on social media and will connect with the owners, but she looks for retail price point, packaging and owner story.</p>
<p>Though there are 1,000 retailers vying to get on The Main Tab, the company approves about 30% of them, saving retail buyers time from sifting through thousands of SKUs. Brands are charged a commission when they receive orders from retailers and pay zero commission on any retailers they refer and currently work with. Retailers can also buy now and pay later and take advantage of other rewards based on their business status, Shelegu said.</p>
<p>The website features curated luxury brands, like Agraria and Bodewell Living, and enables them, independent sales reps and retailers to connect and conduct business from one website, Bright said via email.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way retail stores discover their products has changed in response to the global health crisis,” he added. “I am always looking to invest in companies that solve issues and was thrilled to invest and join the team as CTO.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Freelance marketplace Fiverr announced this morning that it’s acquiring Seattle-based online learning company CreativeLive for an undisclosed amount. CreativeLive is an entrepreneurial learning platform where users can attend courses on video, photography, design, business, marketing and more.</p>
<p>Fiverr, which is an online marketplace that connects businesses with on-demand freelancers, says that the ability to gain new skills in a changing work environment is part of its role in leading transformation for buyers and sellers on its platform.</p>
<p>​​“Fiverr is more than just a work platform, we fundamentally believe in supporting the entire freelance lifestyle, and that includes professional education and training,” said Fiverr founder and CEO Micha Kaufman in a statement. “The acquisition of CreativeLive is part of this broader strategy. The depth and caliber of the courses that CreativeLive offers are exceptional and we look forward to offering them to our entire community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company notes that CreativeLive’s instructors include a diverse group of Pulitzer Prize, Grammy and Oscar winners, along with New York Times best-selling authors and notable entrepreneurs. Fiverr states that CreativeLive’s expertise in creating compelling learning experiences is a natural fit for its platform.</p>
<p>CreativeLive will remain a standalone service and grow its team from its current headquarters in Seattle. Fiverr’s current online learning platform, Fiverr Learn, will be folded into CreativeLive as it works to expand its offerings following the acquisition.</p>
<p>“The future favors people and companies that can create, innovate and adapt to a fast-paced, work environment,” said CreativeLive founder and CEO Chase Jarvis in a statement. “We are excited to be part of the Fiverr family and to grow our inventory of compelling courses that increase economic opportunity for our community, the Fiverr community and today’s modern workforce.”</p>
<p>CreativeLive was founded in 2010 with the aim to “sit at the intersection of the future of creativity, learning, and of work” and to fill the gap that exists in online courses for creative professionals. Since then, the company has offered over 2,000 classes that have reached over 10 million users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fiverr, which was also founded in 2010, says four million customers bought services from freelancers on its platform across more than 160 countries in its latest fiscal year. Additionally, the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/fiverr-files-to-go-public/"> company filed to go public</a> on the NYSE in 2019.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Fiverr expanded<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/fiverr-subscriptions/"> beyond project-based payments</a> with the launch of three- or six-month subscriptions. Through this feature, sellers on Fiverr can offer to provide a defined set of work each month. The buyer or seller can cancel at any time without having to pay fees on the remaining months of the subscription</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.ridezum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ridezum.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633609606207000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-VSxGduL1Si65T9JDcEUO2CiIhg">Zūm</a>, a startup that provides optimized transportation services for school-age children, has announced the close of a $130 million Series D raise, bringing its total funding to more than $200 million. The company intends to use the funds to add 10,000 new electric vehicles to its platform with the end goal of achieving 100% EVs by 2025.</p>
<p>In anticipation of having a large number of batteries parked during off-peak hours, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/zum-ceo-ritu-narayan-explains-why-equity-and-accessibility-works-for-mobility-services/">Zūm recently partnered with AutoGrid</a>, which provides energy management and distribution software, to transform its fleet into a giant virtual power plant that gives energy back to the grid.</p>
<p>The Series D funding, which is led by Softbank Vision Fund 2 with participation from existing investors including Sequoia and BMW i Ventures, comes just a few months after Zūm was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/zum-wins-150m-from-san-francisco-schools-to-modernize-and-electrify-student-transport/">awarded a $150 million contract</a> to modernize the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) transportation service. Zūm also hopes to use the capital to further expand into new markets and districts, according to the company.</p>
<p>School transportation hasn&#8217;t changed much in the last century, despite the fact that it&#8217;s often referred to as the nation&#8217;s largest mass transit system. More than <a href="http://www.ncbussafety.org/lovethebusnc/documents/LovetheBusFacts_ae.pdf">26 million children</a> in the U.S. ride the bus every day, and it&#8217;s likely still an outdated yellow bus that coughs out diesel fuel as it travels on inefficient, untracked routes. Zūm&#8217;s service aims to bring that system to 2021 and beyond by distributing buses, vans and cars around school districts in ways that save transit time and address students with special needs, as well as using its advanced fleet management program to optimize logistics.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started out as a company for parents to directly schedule rides for their kids, yet we knew there was an opportunity to build on our success and expand our services to the entire system,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Ritu Narayan said in a statement. &#8220;Today, we are taking a huge step forward in solving the systemic issues that have plagued school transportation. We’re modernizing the entire system because we believe schools, parents, kids and drivers all deserve better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Transportation is one of a school district&#8217;s biggest costs. By correcting inefficiencies like circuitous routes and rigid schedules, Zūm has been able to save school districts like SFUSD $3 million per year on average, according to the company. It has already worked with 4,000 schools throughout California, Seattle, Chicago and Dallas, and is planning to expand its service to 12 states over the coming years, with an eye on Washington, D.C., as its next target.</p>
<p>“Using data and technology, we believe Zūm is modernizing school transportation by offering better services, efficiency and sustainability — while increasing safety for children,” Andrew Straub, investment director at Softbank Investment Advisers, said in a statement. “We are impressed with the immediate impact that Zūm has made for school districts who have deployed its service across their entire network of schools over the past year, including significant cost savings.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four search engine rivals to Google have called on European Union lawmakers to address the tech giant&#8217;s continued dominance of the market by setting rules for search engine preference menus, arguing that the tech giant&#8217;s ability to set damaging defaults is continuing to limit how easily consumers can switch to a non-Google alternatives.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://ddg-staticcdn.s3.amazonaws.com/press/2110_Search_coalition_letter_calling_on_a_default_ban_in_DMA.pdf">open letter</a> today, the non-tracking search engines <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?va=b&amp;t=hc">DuckDuckGo </a>and <a href="https://www.qwant.com/?l=en">Qwant</a>, along with tech-for-good focused <a href="https://www.lilo.org">Lilo</a> and tree-planting not-for-profit <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/?c=en">Ecosia</a>, urge the region&#8217;s lawmakers to go further to tackle platform giants&#8217; market power.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DMA [Digital Markets Act] urgently needs to be adapted to prevent gatekeepers from suppressing search engine competition,&#8221; they write. &#8220;Specifically, the DMA should enshrine in law a requirement for a search engine preference menu that would effectively ban Google from acquiring default search access points of the operating systems and the browsers of gatekeepers. Moreover, the DMA should ensure that, in addition to selecting their preferred search default in initial onboarding, consumers are able to one-click switch at any time via prompts from competing search engine apps or websites. These actions would finally lead to significant implications for competition in the search engine market and ensure there is real consumer choice online.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission presented the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Digital Markets Act</a> at the end of last year &#8212; proposing a fixed set of ex ante rules for so-called Internet &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; with the aim of ensuring that these intermediating Internet giants cannot abuse their power to crush competitors and squeeze consumers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out its plan to reboot digital rules and tame tech giants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/embed/#?secret=Yw4USB9tqe" data-secret="Yw4USB9tqe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However the four Google search rivals say the proposed legislation doesn&#8217;t currently contain any measured that will help break the tech giant&#8217;s continued dominance of search in Europe (where it has <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/all/europe">around 93%</a>) &#8212; hence their call for<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> EU lawmakers to make amendments to add binding rules for search preference screens so that consumers always have an effortless ability to switch their default search engine choice, whether on mobile or desktop.</span></p>
<p>While the Commission was responsible for the original draft of the DMA, the EU&#8217;s other core institutions &#8212; the European Parliament and Member States, via the EU Council &#8212; have to agree on the details so negotiations over the exact shape of the regulation are continuing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We welcome the Commission’s goals with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) but t</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he DMA fails to address the most acute barrier in search: Google’s hoarding of default positions,&#8221; the four search rivals also write. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Google would not have become the overall market gatekeeper they are today without years of locking up these defaults. If the DMA fails to address this fundamental issue, we believe the status quo will continue, leaving the root cause of this problem unchanged.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Google has been contacted for comment on the claims.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, the EU&#8217;s competition commission fined Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">$5BN </a>over antitrust abuses in how it operates its Android smartphone platform.</p>
<p>Following that intervention the tech giant introduced a regional search preference screen that was shown on set-up of a new Android smartphone in Europe. However Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-to-auction-slots-on-android-default-search-choice-screen-in-europe-next-year-rivals-cry-pay-to-play-foul/">quickly implemented a sealed bids auction model</a> that required rivals to pay it (and outbid each other) to appear in one of the available slots which competitors immediately decried it as unfair and non-transparent.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Some three years later, following another intervention by the Commission &#8212; and after absolutely no dent in Google&#8217;s search marketshare in Europe &#8212; the tech giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/google-ditches-pay-to-play-android-search-choice-auction-for-free-version-after-eu-pressure/">finally announced</a> it would drop the auction model, replacing it with a choice screen that displays eligible search rivals without requiring a fee.</p>
<p>But, again, rivals quickly pointed out continuing limitations with Google&#8217;s &#8216;remedy&#8217; &#8212; such as the fact it only applies to mobile devices, not to users of Google&#8217;s browser Chrome on desktop devices; and the fact that Android users are only shown the choice screen on set-up or at a factory reset, so most of the time they use a device they do not see it.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/duckduckgo-presses-the-case-for-true-one-click-search-competition-on-android/">DuckDuckGo</a>, for example, has been loudly pressing the case for a &#8216;truly fair&#8217; search choice that only requires one click for consumers to switch &#8212; not the <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/one-click-away/">15+ clicks</a> it says it takes to switch default search engine on an Android device currently at any other point after initial set up (or a factory reset).</p>
<p>Using such dark patterns to lock in self-preferencing defaults is something that should be proscribed by EU law, the search rivals argue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google-imposed limitations make it hard for consumers to adopt other search engines, despite the Commission’s antitrust decision,&#8221; they argue. &#8220;Like MEP Yon-Courtin proposed in her <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/ECON-PA-693930_EN.pdf">draft report</a> for the Economic Affairs committee, we believe a properly-designed preference menu should be mandated more broadly.&#8221;</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the Commission for comment on the call for dedicated search preference screen rules to be baked into the DMA and will update this report with any response.</p>
<h2>Where&#8217;s the remedy?</h2>
<p>The European Commission has &#8212; for years &#8212; shied away from imposing specific remedies on Google, despite a string of antitrust enforcements. Instead EU lawmakers have typically said it is up to Google to figure out exactly how to comply with its various orders to cease infringements in areas like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/">product search</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/google-fined-1-49bn-in-europe-for-antitrust-violations-in-search-ad-brokering/">search ad brokering</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">Android</a>.</p>
<p>The result of such a hands-off approach by the EU&#8217;s executive is that Google has been able to find ways to maintain its dominance of key strategic markets like search &#8212; <em>in spite of</em> a string of high profile antitrust enforcements in Europe.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an uncomfortable record for the EU&#8217;s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, who has carved out a reputation as the &#8216;iron lady&#8217; willing to take on Big Tech &#8212; yet whose enforcements in the digital sphere haven&#8217;t actually moved the needle on platform giants&#8217; market share. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/">Nor blocked Google from continued consolidation</a>.)</p>
<p>However some EU Member States are starting to take a much more hands on approach to reigning in big tech&#8217;s market abuse which looks like it will have an impact.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s competition authority, for example, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">extracted a series of interoperability requirements</a> from Google in a case related to self-preferencing of its adtech.</p>
<p>While Germany&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office started this year armed with beefed-up powers to impose ex ante remedies on digital giants that are deemed to have substantial market power. It&#8217;s now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/">in the process of assessing whether Google</a> &#8212; and a number of other tech giants &#8212; meet that bar. If it finds they do it looks eager to get to work setting pre-emptive rules for how they can operate in Germany.</p>
<p>Outside the EU, the UK is also reforming domestic competition rules to clip Big Tech&#8217;s wings. It&#8217;s in the process of shaping an ex ante regime for digital giants with what it describes as &#8220;strategic market status&#8221; &#8212; that, unlike the Commission&#8217;s approach with the DMA, won&#8217;t be one-sized fits all.</p>
<p>Instead the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">UK has said it wants to tailor rules to the specific business</a> &#8212; which would give its regulators more leeway to, for example, impose a search preference menu remedy on a firm like Google if they decide such a step is necessary.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s centralized single set of rules for Big Tech does, therefore, look like it could end up being a weak tool in the face of extremely well resourced &#8216;innovators&#8217; who have years of experience building and iterating services that are designed to eliminate friction and topple barriers to greater scale.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s executive risks being caught flat-footed on the issue of tech antitrust at a time when lawmakers all around the world are fired up and active on the issue &#8212; from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/global-antitrust-gaining-serious-momentum/">China to the US</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to note how, in the wake of a very bad week for (another tech giant:) Facebook, including Congressional testimony by the latest tech whistleblower, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">Francis Haugen</a>, EU commissioners were falling over themselves to tweet about their &#8220;urgency&#8221; to tackle Big Tech&#8230;</p>

<p>Antitrust chief Vestager also tweeted in the wake of the global <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">Facebook outage</a> &#8212; which was also an Instagram and a WhatsApp outage, since all three social services run on the same infrastructure, all being owned by Facebook &#8212; with the EU&#8217;s EVP saying the episode demonstrated the need for &#8220;alternatives and choices in the tech market&#8221;.</p>
<p>Given that headline anti-consolidation message, EU citizens might be forgiven for asking why Vestager&#8217;s department hasn&#8217;t blocked a single tech acquisition &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/europe-urged-to-block-google-fitbit-ahead-of-major-digital-policy-overhaul/">Google&#8217;s recent gobbling of health tech company Fitbit</a>?</p>

<p>As for Google, the tech giant has been busy fighting the Commission&#8217;s existing antitrust enforcements against it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The adoption of cryptocurrency in Africa varies regionally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While countries with currently unstable currencies like the naira are seeing immense usage, other regions using the CFA franc have sparse adoption</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A region of more than 200 million people using the CFA franc, Francophone Africa is one of the most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto-friendly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> markets in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But only a few players are taking advantage of the market, which can make a case as the next frontier for mobile money and investment apps in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, <a href="https://www.ejara.io/">Ejara</a>, a one-year-old company founded by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chatue-Diop, has raised $2 million to pioneer the usage of crypto and investment services in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinShares Ventures and Anthemis Group led the round. They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are joined by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mercy Corps Ventures, Lateral Capital, LoftyInc Capital and NetX Fund. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two angel investors &#8212; Pascal Gauthier of Ledger and Jason Yanowitz of Blockworks &#8212; and a syndicate social fund also participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While founder and CEO <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/nelly-chatue-diop">Chatue-Diop</a> studied and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later held a couple of high executive roles in Europe in the space of 10 years, she had</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> a nudge to come back to Francophone Africa to start a company. That nudge was a culmination of past events mixed with present opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up in Douala, Cameroon, Chatue-Diop&#8217;s family experienced a life-changing experience when France devalued the CFA franc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1994</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to her, this plunged her family (and millions of others) into financial crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> young and we were part of the middle class. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overnight all our savings </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dwindled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the aftermath was that the government couldn&#8217;t even pay salaries,&#8221; she said to TechCrunch over a call</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;So even at that tender age, I asked myself how we managed to do everything right and still end up in that zone. So it stayed on my mind.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, she got acquainted with blockchain and thought it was the perfect technology to solve the problems she faced while growing up. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It helped me understand that people could regain full control over their savings, income and they could protect and grow their wealth,&#8221; she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, she partnered with a long-time friend and serial entrepreneur, Baptiste Andrieux, to start Ejara in Cameroon and the larger Francophone region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cryptocurrencies in Francophone Africa are reserved for a few elites who wish to diversify their assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ejara wants to level this playing field for the average French-speaking African so they can invest as little as 5,000 CFA (~$9).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The built-in transparency and security of the blockchain combined with the popularity of mobile banking in Africa made it clear to me that a blockchain-based mobile investment platform was the key to expanding financial inclusion,&#8221; said the CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;But as all these crypto companies were popping up left and right, I felt very few were speaking to Francophone Africans like myself.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She says crypto was ideal to launch because of what it represents in terms of having full control of one&#8217;s assets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recurrent theme that arises when general discussions around cryptocurrencies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is wallets to use regarding the custody of private keys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With custodial wallets, third-party companies hold private keys but non-custodial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wallets let users own and store their keys. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">though the discourse around crypto investing and retail is one of control, custodial wallets, which most crypto platforms in Africa provide, do not provide that much control to users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ejara said it is big on security, privacy and ownership, which is why it is taking measures to give non-custodial wallets to its users so they can securely buy, sell, exchange and store their crypto investments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, the company plans to also diversify into providing other assets, including fractional shares, stocks and commodities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ejara has more than 8,000 users from Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Mali, Guinea and Senegal, as well as French-speaking Africans in the diaspora (Europe, Asia and the U.S.), and caters to them via a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partnership with crypto payment infrastructure company MoonPay so they can remit money to friends and family in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ll these were done with zero marketing budget, the CEO said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about the users, Chatue-Diop classifies them into two groups: the majority who buy crypto to save for future plans and business owners who make frequent transactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Africa, most people don&#8217;t have the safety net called retirement fund and some customers use Ejara for that. There are users, moms in particular, that use the platform to invest in their kids&#8217; college education. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we have a tiny </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the customer base that are wholesalers and do a lot of volumes; they use crypto to finance and buy their goods from overseas suppliers via this method</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seed investment will see Ejara focus </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extensively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on growth, deployment of features in the company&#8217;s roadmap and expanding the product and tech team</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meltem Demirors from CoinShares spoke of the opportunity in Francophone Africa and the dearth of funding in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Francophone Africa accounting for about 25% of the continent’s population, she says startups in the region have attracted less than 1% of the venture capital &#8212; b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ut holds that Ejara&#8217;s funding round offers a glimmer of hope, especially in a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> untapped space as fintech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to work with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the Ejara team to deliver financial services via non-custodial wallets and offers a new level of trust and transparency to Francophone savers and investors,” Demirors said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Anthemis and why they invested, Ruth Foxe Blader, partner at Anthemis, said the firm was particular about how Ejara educates people in Francophone Africa on digital assets and democratizes wealth creation opportunities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Women have made great inroads into the tech world in recent years, but there remains a long way to go before we reach a truly equitable state of affairs in workforce numbers, remuneration and product development. An edtech startup called <a href="https://www.entityacademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entity Academy</a> &#8212; which provides women with training, in areas like data science and software development; mentoring; and ultimately job coaching &#8212; has raised $100 million on the heels of strong growth of its business, and an ambition to improve that ratio.</p>
<p>The financing will be used to help students finance their Entity Academy tuition, which typically costs $15,000. It&#8217;s coming from <a href="https://leif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leif</a>, itself a startup that provides financing services to edtech platforms so that they can offer their students income share agreements (otherwise known as ISAs, arrangements where students are not required to pay back tuition loans until they find jobs).</p>
<p>Jennifer Schwab, the founder and CEO of Entity, has built the business since 2016 on virtually no outside funding, but said that this latest financing is a precursor to the company working on its first, more traditional VC-led equity round.</p>
<p>Entity does not build e-learning content itself but aggregates online courses in data science, software development, fintech engineering and technology sales in &#8220;bootcamp&#8221; style courses that range from 24 to 33 weeks in length, from providers that range from Springboard and Lambda School through to Columbia University (courses from the universities tend to be presented as created by the institutions, while the others are tailored by Entity itself to its students).</p>
<p>Its technology play is not just related to Entity&#8217;s curriculum being focused on tech; as you might expect in an edtech startup, Entity also leans heavily on the data that it has amassed to build its strategy and its business.</p>
<p>That data is based not just on feedback from past and current students and student outcomes, but also other channels. Its &#8220;content arm&#8221; Entity Mag has quite interestingly gone viral on social media and has more than 1.1 million followers across Instagram and Facebook, which becomes another major channel for engagement (not to mention future students).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Entity uses all this to curate not just what courses it provides and what goes into the curriculum, but also how best to supplement that learning. Today, Entity courses also include targeted mentoring from people working in the tech industry, as well as career coaching en route to finding a job.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Entity&#8217;s sweet spot is a bifurcated one, Schwab said in an interview.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s women who are either new (typically aged 19-23); or those newly-returning or rethinking their careers (typically aged 30-39, Schwab said). Women in both categories are coming to Entity because they would like to consider tech jobs or more technical promotions, but have found their expertise lacking to do so. Mostly likely, they studied humanities or other non-technical subjects in college, and typically they don&#8217;t have the support in their work environments to simply retrain to open the door to those more technical roles.</p>
<p>Added to this is the diversity mix among those women, which also poses a different kind of challenge for that cohort, but also a great boost for Entity for helping them address that. Some 55% of the 19-23 group are women of color; as are 62% of the 30-39 group. Entity aims to provide its tools to address all of these women with all of their different challenges around breaking into tech jobs, in what it describes as a &#8220;wraparound&#8221; strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of our students would not have pursued STEM programs in the past,&#8221; said Schwab, &#8220;so we are building skillsets from the ground up.&#8221;</p>
<p>With some 80% of students on the courses taking some financing to pay for them, you can see why Entity is now ramping up the means to help them do that.</p>
<p>Since 2016, some 400 students, almost all women, have completed the course. But originally it started as a much shorter (six-week) program, was all in-person and cost $5,000. Now with a number of the courses lasting eight months and all virtual, that spells more costs and more people. Schwab said there are another 300 students going through the course, and it&#8217;s on track to have 1,500 next year.</p>
<p>Entity&#8217;s growth has dovetailed with bigger edtech and &#8220;future of work&#8221; trends. Covid-19 foisted a hefty set of expectations on the e-learning industry, with companies building tools to help teach people remotely suddenly finding themselves in unprecedented demand. That was not only because traditional learning environments needed to go virtual, but also because the pandemic led so many &#8212; willingly or by force &#8212; to rethink what they were doing with their lives, and online education was one key route for doing something about it, at a time when little else could be done.</p>
<p>Entity&#8217;s own story fits into both of those story lines.</p>
<p>The company was started originally in Los Angeles by Schwab on the back of her own experiences when she was an advisor at Ernst &amp; Young early in her own career.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;My original goal was to change how women approach careers globally. How to mentor women better was the impetus because I did not have female mentors when I started at Ernst &amp; Young,&#8221; she recalled. Feeling &#8220;like you are on an island&#8221; is bad in itself, she said, but it was a quick evolution into education and job placement alongside that mentoring because &#8220;we identified these [as other reasons] why women don’t pursue tech careers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first incarnation of the company in 2016 was as a brick-and-mortar learning center housed in a 1920s building in LA &#8212; appropriately enough, formerly a men&#8217;s club. That was a compelling sell, with a shorter learning period and being in-person, it saw completion rates of 96% with jobs for more than 90% of the cohorts by the end. &#8220;There is a lot more accountability in person,&#8221; Schwab said.</p>
<p>The pandemic, of course, forced Entity out of that model, but also became the lever for how it would scale. When it relaunched as a virtual program in 2020, from a new company HQ in Las Vegas, the numbers grew, the company extended the length of the courses, and it increased the tuition to reflect the longer engagements.</p>
<p>And yet that has had a downside, too, with completion rates dipping, something that Schwab said is a priority for the company to work on improving.</p>
<p>The mentors on the program are another aspect of the business that has scaled with the move to virtual. Originally, all mentors were unpaid volunteers who either just wanted to help more women get a leg up in the industry, or more opportunistically use their exposure to the students as a hiring funnel. That, too, is evolving with online engagement.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Now we pay mentors, and we bring in professional moderators to keep mentor-led discussions at a decent pace,&#8221; Schwab said. Often speakers will donate their fees to scholarship and childcare funds, she added. There are some 250 mentors in the Entity network now, with some focused on lectures to groups of students while others work individually with them, usually in connection to the technical subjects they are studying. That number is expected to double to 500 next year, Schwab said.</p>
<p>The job-finding aspect of the role is perhaps the least developed up to now &#8212; you can find, in small print, that &#8220;job placement is not guaranteed&#8221; at the bottom of Entity&#8217;s website, alongside the admonition that Entity Academy is a complement to, not a replacement for, traditional education.</p>
<p>But that also speaks to potential opportunities. In that vein, there are others, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/the-mom-project-raises-25m-for-its-job-site-aimed-at-women-returning-to-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Mom Project</a>, that are eyeing up the opportunity of specifically targeting the female demographic, speaking not just to the huge female gap in the job market, but also the fact that there just hasn&#8217;t been much built to address that. Thankfully, now that appears to be changing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rebel Foods, which operates a large network of dark kitchens in nearly a dozen markets, is the latest Indian startup to attain the unicorn status.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old Indian startup said on Thursday it has raised $175 million in its Series F financing round that valued it at $1.4 billion, up from about $800 million last year. Qatar Investment Authority, sovereign wealth fund of the State of Qatar, led the financing round with participation from existing investors Coatue and Evolvence. Rebel Foods also counts Sequoia Capital India and Goldman Sachs among its investors.</p>
<p>Rebel Foods is the third Indian startup to become a unicorn this week, and 31st to become a unicorn this year as scores of high-profile investors including Tiger Global, SoftBank, Sequoia, Temasek aggressively double down on their bets to back young firms in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. (And many more are beginning to explore India. A16z made its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a16z-coinbase-coinswitch-kuber-first-india-investment/">first investment in an Indian startup</a> this week.)</p>
<p><a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/10/cloud-kitchen-roll-ups-rebels-unicorn-round/">Rebel Foods</a> operates the world&#8217;s largest number of what it calls “internet restaurants” in 10 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Over 45 brands, many of which Rebel Foods owns and also several from partner firms such as Wendy’s and Mad Over Donuts, prepare food exclusively for delivery rather than serving dine-in or takeaway customers. The startup says it operates over 4,000 of these internet restaurants.</p>
<p>The idea behind dark kitchens &#8212; also known as ghost and cloud kitchens &#8212; is to make food serving operations more economical. Setting up and operating a restaurant is expensive as they are also, after all, pieces of real estate. Setting up cloud kitchens allows partner restaurants and brands to move away from pricey retail locations and also streamlines the business by focusing on just producing food.</p>
<p>“The big disruption that the cloud kitchen model brought about is that you don’t have to put up five real estates to run five different restaurants,” said Jaydeep Barman, founder and chief executive of Rebel Foods, in a virtual conference earlier this year. As carmakers produce dozens of models from one factory, “using technology, supply chain and workflows, you can actually have one kitchen for five restaurants,” he explained.</p>
<p>Many investors say that the cloud kitchen model is also crucial for food delivery firms, restaurants, and brands to reach the larger market. In many developing markets including India, the ticket size for a lunch or dinner order is $3 to $5, which makes the existing business models unviable for firms to turn a profit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This would explain why both Swiggy and Zomato &#8212; the two top food delivery firms in India &#8212; have made several efforts to explore setting up their own cloud kitchens.</p>
<p>Swiggy, for instance, announced in late 2019 that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/swiggy-cloud-kitchen-india/">invested in more than a million square feet of real estate space</a> across 14 cities in the country to help restaurant partners of all sizes expand to more locations both within their city and across new cities through cloud kitchens. The firm, which invested over $25 million into its cloud kitchen business, significantly scaled it down last year after the pandemic hit. Like Swiggy, Zomato has also struggled to make inroads with its cloud kitchen efforts.</p>
<p>But the model is here to stay &#8212; and investors are buying. “Working in Rebel’s favor is the loss of investor interest in single-brand entities given that these brands don’t have the ability to drive profitable unit economics from just operating one brand. Scaling a single brand across cities requires capital investments far higher than for brands that are part of a larger portfolio, where fixed costs are controlled,” <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/10/cloud-kitchen-roll-ups-rebels-unicorn-round/">reported</a> Indian news and analysis publication CapTable, which also scooped the fundraise talks last week.</p>
<p>Why have big firms struggled to make inroads with cloud kitchen? TechCrunch spoke with Ravi Golani, the chief strategy officer at Rebel Foods, who said, a challenge that he sees with cloud kitchen model is that there are several different strategies at play and they are yielding different results.</p>
<p>“We are combining the best of both worlds &#8212; digital and physical &#8212; to understand how to expand a particular brand, to make unit economics work, and to ensure adequate supply chain and leveraging technology. It’s a different ballgame altogether,” he said, adding that some of the other firms have only succeeded to achieve some of these. Rebel Foods works with food delivery firms as its delivery distributing partners.</p>
<p>“If you think about cloud kitchens generally, you would imagine five or more different booths in a kitchen. They have their own staff, production material and delivery tie-ups. In our kitchens, what we have done is organize the entire layout by workflows rather than restaurants,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup said it plans to deploy the fresh funds to expand its international footprint and also explore acquisition opportunities. It’s also eyeing to become a public company within two years, said Piyush Kakkad, the startup’s chief financial officer. Rebel Foods&#8217; current annual run-rate is $150 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Making sure mental wellness is part of your routine can be difficult, especially if you are already busy and stressed. <a href="https://wearemindlabs.com/">MindLabs</a> wants to make it easier with a combination of on-demand or live video classes and community features. The company announced today it has raised a $3.5 million seed round, almost <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/mindlabs-raises-1-4-million-for-its-new-platform-a-peloton-for-mental-health/">eleven months after its pre-seed funding</a>.</p>
<p>The seed round was led by PROFounders Capital, with participation from Slack Fund; Sky executive chairman and former chief executive officer Jeremy Darroch; and returning investors Passion Capital and Seedcamp. The timing of the announcement comes three days before<a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-mental-health-day"> World Mental Health Day on October 10</a>, to raise awareness of mental health issues and increase access to care.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to hire for MindLabs’ product and engineering, content and market as it prepares for its public launch next year.</p>
<p>MindLabs was founded last year by Adnan Ebrahim and Gabor Szedlak, who previously launched and ran CarThrottle, an automotive site and community that was <a href="https://digiday.com/media/track-make-120m-car-sales-dennis-taps-younger-car-buyers-car-throttle-purchase/">acquired by Dennis Publishing in 2019</a>. When TechCrunch first talked to the founders last year, they said they decided to focus on mental health for their next startup because of the rapid increase in depression, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Over the past year, MindLabs has hired leaders for its engineering, production and marketing teams, and built out its beta app, which now has 16 instructors. The startup’s platform is slated for a public launch in the first quarter of 2022. Ebrahim told TechCrunch that MindLabs currently has thousands of users on its waitlist, thanks in part to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wearemindlabs/">growth of its Instagram account</a>, which has almost 60,000 followers.</p>
<p>MindLabs will be available first in the United Kingdom, before launching in the United States. Ebrahim says it plans to expand into non-English speaking countries, since the team believes the platform is easily translatable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its app now has over 100 on-demand videos created by mental wellness, psychology and neuroscience professionals, and will also host daily live videos classes from its studio in West London. One of its instructors is <a href="https://www.thebreathguy.com/">Richie Bostock</a>, AKA The Breath Guy, who is a meditation and breathwork expert. Community features were built in, partially in response to the isolation people have experienced during the pandemic.</p>
<p>MindLabs also eventually plans to release hardware, like an EEG headband, to track health indicators. Ebrahim said MindLabs is launching with an app-first strategy before moving into wearables, with affordable subscription plans for classes so they can reach as many people as possible.</p>
<p>“We’re still extremely excited about tracking biomarkers of the mind, such as EEG, heart rate and breathing patterns, through existing and our own wearables,” he said. “We believe this will help us build a more accurate, real-time picture of how our users feel, and therefore be able to serve them with the most relevant video classes to help improve their mood.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts say the value of e-commerce in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach $29 billion next year, yet Africans still find it difficult to make international payments for products online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cards, M-Pesa, bank transfer and mobile money, are the most common methods Africans use to make payments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while various payment gateways have provided better experiences than how things were, say, a decade ago, there&#8217;s more work to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.klasha.com/">Klasha</a>, a Lagos and San Francisco-based startup, sees a niche in cross-border commerce and provides multiple integrations and APIs to facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transactions in that space. Today, it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised $2.4 million in seed to scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/jessicaanuna">Jessica Anuna</a> founded Klasha in 2018. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, the company&#8217;s focus was to make it easier for African consumers to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from global fashion retailers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Klasha is more than that now, she tells me. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has several features and a new business model </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">centred</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around helping Africans make payments and get the goods they want (as long as they aren&#8217;t perishable), regardless of their location</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Klasha Checkout, which works a lot like </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/checkout-com-raises-450-million-and-reaches-15-billion-valuation/">Checkout</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">, allows international merchants to collect payments from Africa in local currencies. And unlike Checkout or Fast that only works with international payments methods, Klasha uses what Africans are accustomed to &#8212; bank account, card, USSD, M-Pesa and mobile money. </span><br />
</span></p>
<p>The checkout solution can be integrated into any e-commerce platform, the company said. It has plugins for big-name e-commerce sites WooCommerce, OpenCart and BigCommerce and is set to sign an official partnership with BigCommerce, extending its reach to more merchants globally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With KlashaWire, consumers can pay with African currencies: naira, cedis, shillings &#8212; via </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payments methods, which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Klasha then remits to merchants in dominant currencies like the U.S. dollar or euros in two business days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its payment links feature supports merchants that don&#8217;t have storefronts to accept payments by sharing links with customers via email or social media</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next is its mobile application which lets users in Nigeria, Ghana or Kenya send and receive money. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can also create virtual cards and fund them with their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respective currencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to its payments play, Klasha is into logistics too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anuna asserts that as Klasha combines both worlds of payments and logistics, it is opening up the global e-commerce economy to consumers in Africa and merchants looking to scale into Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamlessly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of our merchants have said to us, if we&#8217;re going to be able to accept payments from Africa, we need a way to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamlessly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ship to Africa in a short amount of time and provide the best end to end logistics experience for our consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done,&#8221; remarked the CEO.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the logistics service helps African customers get their products from Europe or the U.S. in five to nine days, handled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via partnerships with third-party logistics providers. On a lighter note, Klasha&#8217;s time frame is quite laudable compared to industry numbers of up to two weeks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Klasha relaunched in May following some iterations, it has processed more than 20,000 transactions and claims to be growing 366% month-on-month. Klasha makes revenue via sales commissions and subscriptions r</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">etailers pay to use the platform for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">analytics to gauge how their products are faring in different markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For a lot of these retailers, this is the first time they&#8217;ve ever sold into Africa before. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we offer a complete end to end e-commerce suite for them as opposed to having to use disjointed services that aren&#8217;t interconnected with technology,&#8221; she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klasha’s technology allows for seamless cross-border transactions at a time when Africa is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growing and needs both payment and logistics solutions for online commerce, Alison Lange Engel, a partner at Greycroft, said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the third significant investment the venture capital firm has made in Africa after placing bets on unicorn company Flutterwave and AZA Group &#8212; a fintech company founded and led by Elizabeth Rossiello. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Rossiello, Anuna, 29, had industry experience before starting the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Techstars-backed Klasha. The chief executive worked at Amazon and Shopify in London and subsequently started a logistics company in China. It was t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here, while running FMCG exports to the U.K. and U.S. for large wholesalers and suppliers, she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">figured that merchants in China (Africa&#8217;s biggest trading partner) needed more efficient ways to receive payments from Nigerian merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">opened Anuna&#8217;s eyes to the world of cross-border trade and payments and this has proved vital in how she has been able to raise venture capital as a solo female founder</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black female founders get 0.6% of global venture funding. There&#8217;s no data to depict the situation with African female founders, but if you could paint a picture, it wouldn’t be a pretty one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Anuna believes investors are starting to back more female founders, particularly in fintech where recent startup and VC activity have been eye-popping</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asides from Greycroft, other investors include Seedcamp, Practical VC, Plug and Play, First Round VC, 2.12 Angels, MiLA Capital, Berrywood Capital, AVG Basecamp Fund, and Expert Dojo. Angel investors like Joe Cross of Wise and Michael Pennington of Gumtree also invested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klasha hopes to use the funds to help retailers such as ASOS, Zara and H&amp;M receive payments from African consumers. With a customer base of 10,000 p</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">resent in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya, Klasha plans to expand into three more African countries before the year runs out.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Webrazzi.com">Webrazzi</a>, the main tech startup media title in Turkey, has acquired <a href="http://Tech.eu">Tech.eu</a>, the long-time tech startup site in Europe. The pooled entity of Webrazzi and Tech.eu will now offer combined editorial, data, and research platforms offering news and market intelligence. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Launched in 2006 by <a href="https://twitter.com/ardakutsal?lang=en">Arda Kutsal</a>, Webrazzi reaches 1.25 million readers a month (15 million a year) and will now expand its European and English language reach with the Tech.eu acquisition.</p>
<p>Tech.eu was launched in 2013 by former TechCrunch writer <a href="https://twitter.com/robinwauters">Robin Wauters</a>, and has since become one of, now several, destinations for European tech startup and innovation news. It has, however, faced increasing competition from a number of other European-oriented outlets such as <a href="https://www.eu-startups.com/">EU Startups</a>, <a href="https://siliconcanals.com/">Silicon Canals</a>, and the Financial Times-backed <a href="http://Sifted.eu">Sifted.eu</a>. (TechCrunch&#8217;s European bureau started its coverage in 2006).</p>
<p>Tech.eu&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/23/tech-eu/">investors included</a> 500 Startups, Adeo Ressi (The Founder Institute), Roxanne Varza (Station F), Daniel Waterhouse (Balderton) and Carlos Eduardo Espinal (Seedcamp).</p>
<p>Wauters explained that part of the motivation for the sale came from a desire to have its own tech stack, custom CMS, bespoke software for managing native advertising campaigns, and an events platform, which Webrazzi has.</p>
<p>Arda Kutsal, founder and CEO of Webrazzi, said: “We are excited to expand further into Europe by acquiring Tech.eu, which we have considered the best source of technology news and market data for many years. We are impressed with the team’s accomplishments to date, as well as its solid plans for the future, and can’t wait to work together with them to turn those into reality.”</p>
<p>Robin Wauters, founding editor and managing director of Tech.eu, said: “I have long admired what Arda and his team have built, and I’m excited to bring the knowledge and experience we’ve gained from building Tech.eu as a team to the Webrazzi family and see how far and wide we can take our combined editorial platforms next. The European technology ecosystems are evolving at an incredible pace, and we can’t wait to continue covering and analysing their future ins and outs under the Webrazzi umbrella. I fully expect it to be more hard work and good fun!&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On a call with me, he added: “We weren&#8217;t really looking for anyone to sell to, but Arda was in touch with us from 2014 when he wanted to invest in our Seed round. That didn’t happen, but we stayed in touch, chatting about each other&#8217;s business, and one thing led to another, as they say.”</p>
<p>“We didn&#8217;t have a big sales team so it&#8217;s always very difficult for us to compete. What they bring to the table is, of course, a team of 25 people that we can immediately tap into, so that was music to my ears because it&#8217;s very, very heavy competition not just on the media side but also on data and events side. This acquisition means more ability to accelerate what we want to do,” he added.</p>
<p>Had he found the European media landscape increasingly competitive?</p>
<p>“I think the competition is just normal. If you look at the way that the European tech ecosystem itself has grown and matured, then there are going to be multiple publications. I think we were early, maybe even a bit too early. But we did make it in the first few years when it was still relatively small. But it’s matured to a point now where a single publication I think cannot do it justice anymore, so it&#8217;s normal that there are multiple ones,” he said.</p>
<p>I asked if his investors pushed for an exit: “We raised around seven years ago, right, so it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re in constant touch with our investors in the same way that a VC would be with their portfolio companies. It was more like a group of angels that supported us in the beginning. Nobody was really pushing for a sale because it&#8217;s not like we were looking to sell. Not even myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>On a call, Kutsal told me: “It’s exciting. We&#8217;ve been working on this for the last eight or nine months and the pandemic made this hard, but we managed to sign everything. I always wanted to expand to different regions into Europe and at the end of 2020 I called Robin.”</p>
<p>He said Webrazzi&#8217;s technology stack was a major factor in the deal: “We have so many technologies. We have our own CMS content management system, online event platform, our own native advertising solutions, and everything. At one point I realized Robin had a great team but no technology of his own, so this was a major factor in the deal.”</p>
<p>He said the merged entity now plans to expand further in Europe, possibly Russia, and the MENA region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hellogetsafe.com">Getsafe</a> has extended its Series B round that it previously announced in December 2020. In addition to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/getsafe-b/">original Series B round of $30 million</a>, the company is adding another $63 million in fresh capital. Overall, Getsafe has raised a $93 million Series B round.</p>
<p>Investors in today’s funding round include unnamed family offices as well as Earlybird and Abacon Capital. Some of the company’s existing investors, such as CommerzVentures and Swiss Re, are also investing in the company once again.</p>
<p>The German company originally started with a digital-first home contents insurance product. It sells its products directly to end customers through its website and app. Over time, Getsafe expanded to new products, such as personal liability, dog liability, drone liability, bike theft protection and car insurance.</p>
<p>The service is now active in two markets — Germany as well as the U.K. While Getsafe still has more customers in its home market, the company’s metrics are going up. Getsafe currently has around 225,000 customers in Germany and 25,000 customers in the U.K. In December 2020, TechCrunch’s Steve O’Hear <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/getsafe-b/">reported</a> that Getsafe only had 150,000 customers overall.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that Getsafe truly believes the best way to sell insurance products is through a direct relationship with its end customers. The mobile app acts as a key part of the company’s product offering as you can buy new insurance products, manage your existing contracts and file claims directly through the app.</p>
<p>This is a completely different strategy when you compare it to <a href="https://www.wefox.com/en-de">Wefox</a>, another big German insurtech company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/european-insurtech-startup-wefox-grabs-650-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">raised $650 million</a> earlier this year. Wefox partners with 700 agents and 5,000 associate brokers — they distribute Wefox products to their own customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Getsafe’s direct-to-consumer approach, the startup manages to sell its products to a lot first-time insurance buyers. And Getsafe has a lot of engagement with its app. 30% of the company’s customers open the app at least once per month, which leads to a lot of upselling opportunities.</p>
<p>With the additional funding, Getsafe plans to finally get its own insurance license. It has been working on this process for a while as it doesn’t want to act as a broker going forward. Getsafe’s fully licensed insurer should go live soon, at some point in 2021.</p>
<p>The company is also going to invest in its product, expand to new categories and new markets. Up next, Getsafe is thinking about expanding to France, Spain, Italy and Austria.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The adoption of telehealth services has boomed in the pandemic &#8212; with usage up 38-fold since January 2020, according to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a report by McKinsey</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. While a lot of the attention has been on companies that are building the communications layer between consumers and clinicians, there are also a wave of companies building <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/cta-8-signs-growth-connected-health-device-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devices</a> to expand what can be monitored and addressed in a telehealth environment. </span></p>
<p>In one of the latest developments, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bisu.bio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bisu</span></a> &#8212;<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a Tokyo-headquartered healthcare startup that has built a lab-grade testing device that can be used at home for diagnostics that translate into actionable health data &#8212; has</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> raised $3.2 million. The seed round will be used to launch a portable home health lab, Bisu Body Coach, which provides personalized nutrition and lifestyle advice through easy, accurate urine and saliva testing. The seed funding brings its total raised to $4.3 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest funding was led by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="http://www.quad-im.com/index.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">QUAD</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, with participation from </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://corp.asics.com/en/ventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ASICS Ventures Corporation</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, 15th Rock Ventures, Pacifico Investments and SOSV. Athletic shoe giant ASICS is a strategic backer, and it plans to collaborate with Bisu on health and fitness service initiatives. Bisu is in discussions with other companies in the fitness, pet care and bathroom sectors for additional partnerships, co-founder and CEO Daniel Maggs told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bisu was founded in 2015 and started business in 2017 when it entered the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://hax.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">HAX accelerator program</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bisu Body Coach works around disposable test sticks and a reader that syncs with a smartphone application. The disposable test sticks enable users to measure a range of biomarkers in just two minutes, using microfluidic “lab-on-a-chip” technology.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The microfluidic “lab-on-a-chip” technology uses spectrometry and real-time end-to-end measurement to eliminate the measurement timing issue of conventional test strips. It also manipulates a sample such as blood, urine, saliva or sweat inside a tiny channel to perform a chemical or biological process.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When asked about its differentiation from other competitors that use the lab-on-a-chip technology, Bisu said it focuses on simultaneous testing of multiple biomarkers that enable the user to understand and make a positive change to their diet and lifestyle without seeing a doctor. Others typically detect individual biomarkers of high significance such as COVID-19 and influenza that may guide the user to seek help from a physician.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bisu&#8217;s app provides feedback on key nutrition indicators such as hydration, minerals, vitamins, pH, uric acid and ketones. Based on users’ goals, preferences, activity, sleep and weight, Bisu Body Coach provides personalized recommendations. Bisu plans to add zinc and Vitamin B measurements in the future and expects to release a pet health test kit for cats and dogs.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bisu Body Coach is currently in beta testing in the U.S. and European Union. The company aims to commercialize it in these markets in 2022, Maggs said, adding that it is also laying the groundwork to enter Asian markets such as Japan and Korea in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its core R&amp;D and production team are based in Tokyo, and Bisu’s software and marketing team is based in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Maggs said that the conventional at-home diagnostics market, dominated mainly by patients, is estimated at </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://askwonder.com/research/at-home-wellness-testing-r4bqjry68" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">approximately $5 billion and growing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But Bisu’s at-home test has a potential market also with non-patients &#8212; people who are not under the care of physicians or others for anything specific, but are interested in knowing more about what is going on inside their bodies. The market for non-patient, at-home diagnostics is currently estimated to be around $10 billion, Maggs said.</span></p>
