										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Trucking tends to be associated with highways, but it’s not uncommon to find large delivery vehicles trundling down the tightly packed streets of the world’s most populated cities. According to EV startup Volta Trucks, that’s far from ideal: in London, large commercial vehicles cause around 26% of pedestrian fatalities and around 80% of cyclist fatalities, and account for an outsized portion of carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Volta’s solution is to electrify and redesign the large cargo vehicle &#8212; called Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) in Europe &#8212; for middle- and last-mile delivery in urban centers. “The traditional design of trucks and city centers really don&#8217;t work together, but you can&#8217;t just ban trucks from city centers,” a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Volta Trucks has raised a €37 million ($44 million) funding round to accelerate its plans, starting with a fleet of pilot vehicles in London and Paris.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The debut of electric pickups signals a new EV era&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/the-debut-of-electric-pickups-signals-a-new-ev-era/embed/#?secret=k99YUWlb5N" data-secret="k99YUWlb5N" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The round was led by New York-based Luxor Capital Group and returning investor Byggmästare Anders J Ahlström Holding of Stockholm. New investors included U.S. electric truck and battery manufacturer Proterra and supply chain management company Agility.</p>
<p>The idea for the company came to Volta co-founder and Swedish serial entrepreneur Carl-Magnus Norden when Elon Musk revealed the Tesla Model 3. Norden realized that there was very little equivalent movement to electrify the world of commercial vehicles, despite the fact that they produce a large share of carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Four years later, Volta (not to be confused with Volta Charging, the European EV charging station company) has come up with a truck that gives the driver a 220-degree view, similar to what one might see on a city bus. The driver’s seat is also in the center of the cab. On the inside of the 16-ton truck, called Volta Zero, will sit a single unit containing an electric motor, transmission and rear axle supplied by OEM supplier Meritor. This unit, called an eAxle, leaves more space between the chassis rails for the battery.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l0N6FgmPODk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Those batteries will have a 95- to 120-mile range and will be designed by Proterra, a supplier (and now investor) that Volta says will be able to furnish batteries into the longer term and at higher production levels. Volta is imagining that it will produce up to 5,000 trucks by the end of 2023, 14,000 to 15,000 by 2024, and 27,000 trucks by 2025.</p>
<p>Volta plans to also offer a “truck as a service” model, which is a leasing agreement including insurance, charging infrastructure, service repair and maintenance. While Volta also plans on selling trucks outright, the spokesperson said the company anticipates the leasing model will make up 50%, and as high as 80%, of its business.</p>
<p>Volta is gearing up to launch a fleet of six R&amp;D vehicles in London and Paris at the beginning of the year. These trucks will be used for internal validation. The company plans to start about a 33-vehicle pilot program with customers in two major European cities by the middle of next year.</p>
<p>The plan is that this will allow Volta to start full-scale production by the end of 2022. All of the vehicles, with the exception of the six beta trucks, will be manufactured by Steyr Automotive in Austria. The two announced the manufacturing agreement last week.</p>
<p>Volta says it has letters of intent for 2,500 trucks. The goal is to convert these to binding deposit-led orders as Volta moves closer to series production. This round now brings its total funding to date to around €60 million ($71 million).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.gogoro.com/">Gogoro</a> is going public. The company, which is best known for its electric Smartscooters and swappable battery infrastructure, announced today it will list on Nasdaq through a merger with <a href="https://www.poema-global.com/">Poema Global</a>, a SPAC affiliated with Princeville Capital. The deal sets Gogoro’s enterprise valuation at $2.35 billion and is targeted to close in the first quarter of 2022. The combined company will be known as Gogoro Inc and trade under the symbol GGR.</p>
<p>Assuming no redemptions, Gogoro anticipates making $550 million in proceeds, including an oversubscribed PIPE (private investment in public equity) of over $250 million and $345 million held in trust by Poema Global. Investors in the PIPE include strategic partners like Hon Hai (Foxconn) Technology Group and GoTo, the Indonesian tech giant created through the merger of Gojek and Tokopedia, and new and existing investors like Generation Investment Management, Taiwan’s National Development Fund, Temasek and Dr. Samuel Yin of Ruentex Group, Gogoro’s founding investor.</p>
<p>The capital will be used on Gogoro’s expansion in China, India and Southeast Asia and further development of its tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>Founded ten years ago in Taiwan, Gogoro’s technology includes smart swappable batteries and their charging infrastructure and cloud software that monitors the condition and performance of vehicles and batteries. Apart from its own brands, including Smartscooters and Eeyo electric bikes, Gogoro also makes its platform available through its Powered by Gogoro Network (PBGN) program, which enables partners to create vehicles that use Gogoro’s batteries and swapping stations.</p>
<p>Gogoro’s SPAC deal comes a few months after it announced major partnerships in China and India. In China, it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/gogoros-electric-vehicle-technology-will-make-its-china-debut-through-a-deal-with-yadea-and-dcj/">working with Yadea and DCJ to build a battery-swapping network</a>, and in India, Hero MotoCorp, one of the world’s largest two-wheel vehicle makers,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/gogoro-partners-with-indias-hero-motocorp-one-of-the-worlds-largest-two-wheel-vehicle-makers/"> will launch scooters based on Gogoro’s tech</a>. It also has deals with manufacturers like Yamaha, Suzuki, AeonMotor, PGO and CMC eMOVING.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gogoro strikes deal with Yadea and DCJ to build a battery-swapping network in China&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/gogoros-electric-vehicle-technology-will-make-its-china-debut-through-a-deal-with-yadea-and-dcj/embed/#?secret=QRoLKQ4YWU" data-secret="QRoLKQ4YWU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With these partnerships in place, “we really now need to take our company to the next level,” founder and chief executive officer Horace Luke told TechCrunch. Gogoro decided to go the SPAC route because “you can talk a lot deeper about what the business opportunity is, what the structure is, what the partnerships are, so you can properly value a company rather than a quick roadshow. Given our business plans, it gives us a great opportunity to focus on the expansion,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One of the reasons Gogoro decided to work with Poema is because “their thesis is quite aligned with ours,” said Bruce Aitken, Gogoro’s chief financial officer. “They have, for example, a sustainability fund, so our passion for green and sustainability merges well with that.”</p>
<p>Gogoro says that in less than five years, it has accumulated more than $1 billion in revenue and more than 400,000 subscribers for its battery swapping infrastructure. The company will launch its China pilot program in Hangzhou in the fourth-quarter of this year, followed by about six more cities next year. In India, Hero MotoCorp is currently developing its first Gogoro-powered vehicle and will begin deploying its battery-swapping infrastructure in New Delhi in 2022.</p>

<p>“We see the demand in China as a lot bigger than we first anticipated, so that’s all good news for us, and that’s one of the fundamental reasons why we need to go public because we need to raise the capital and resources needed for us to actually contribute in a big way to these markets,” said Luke.</p>
<p>When asked if Gogoro is planning to strike a similar partnership with GoTo to expand into Southeast Asia, Luke said the “important thing is to recognize that Southeast Asia is the third-largest market outside of China and India for two-wheelers. Gogoro has always had the vision to go after these big markets. GoTo, being a great success in Indonesia, their investment in Gogoro will start conversations, but there isn’t anything to announce at this point other than that they’re joining the PIPE.”</p>
<p>In a press statement, Poema Global CEO Homer Sun said, “We believe the technology differentiation Gogoro has developed in combination with the world-class partnerships it has forged will drive significant growth opportunities in the two largest two-wheeler markets in the world. We are committed with working alongside Gogoro’s outstanding management team to support its geographic expansion plans and its transition to a Nasdaq-listed company.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than 3% of genetic material used in global pharmaceutical research is from Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The staggering gap is quite surprising because Africans and people of African descent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are reported </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to be more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">genetically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> diverse than any other population</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching in 2019, African genomics startup <a href="https://54gene.com/">54gene</a> has been at the forefront of bridging this divide in the global genomics market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, the company has secured $25 million in Series B funding to bolster its efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round comes a year after the company, founded by Dr Abasi Ene-Obong, raised $15 million in Series A and two years after closing a $4.5 million seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, 54gene has raised more than $45 million since its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the world&#8217;s analyzed genomes coming mostly from anywhere that isn&#8217;t Africa, the continent remains a valuable source of new genetic information for health and drug discovery research</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where 54gene&#8217;s work is relevant. The company conducts and leverages this research to ensure Africans are recipients of upcoming drug and medical discoveries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year when we covered the company last year, CEO Ene-Obong disclosed that for 54gene to conduct this research, it recruits voluntary participants who donate genetic samples via swab or blood tests</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It still very much works this way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, instead of depending on third-party health centres like hospitals and sending the samples abroad for analysis, 54gene <a href="https://www.illumina.com/company/news-center/feature-articles/54gene-Uses-Illumina-Sequencing-to-Create-World-Class-Facility.html">launched its own genetics sequencing and microarray lab</a> in Lagos last September</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company did this in partnership with U.S.-based biotech company Illumina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with TechCrunch, Ene-Obong says </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the genotyping capabilities offered, the lab also provides whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to bore you with the jargon but here&#8217;s why this is important. Genotyping tends to show only 0.02% of an individual&#8217;s DNA; however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, WGS can show almost 100% of the same person&#8217;s DNA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For WES, although it represents only 1.5% of the human genome, it shows approximately 85% of known disease-related variants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these three in place, the company can advance genomics research and expand its ability to help scientists and researchers in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike fintech and other fast-moving sectors like e-commerce, innovation in healthtech takes some time to take shape finally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. 54gene is one of the few startups in the sector and even in Africa to have moved from seed stage to Series B in under two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s this sort of frightening speed that makes one wonder what the company is doing right. So I ask the CEO whether the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is indeed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seeing significant progress in advancing African genomics; he answers in the affirmative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Though the arc of conducting early research through drug approval can be long in biotech, we have taken the approach to building the backbone that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is needed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for short-term successes to long-term gains that provide better healthcare delivery and treatment outcomes from diseases,&#8221; he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to setting its first lab, the CEO says the company increasing its biobanking capacity by 5x and is counts that as a major success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During its last raise, 54gene had a biobank capacity for 60,000 samples. If Ene-Obong comments are anything to go by, the two-year-old company currently has a biobank capacity for 300,000 samples, close to its longer-term aim to manage up to 500,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another one is the recruitment and training of talent to generate and process data needed to produce insights for the company&#8217;s drug discovery efforts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a dearth of experienced clinicians and with the remaining few leaving in droves, it is not hard to see why it is a win for the company. Knowing this, 54gene plans to use part of the new funding to recruit and train more professionals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other use of funding will be to expand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its capabilities in sequencing, target identification and validation, and precision medicine clinical trials</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also of great importance is its expansion across the African continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">54gene will have to sign off partnerships to aid this expansion. A recent partnership was made between the company and the Tanzania Human Genetics Organization and Ene-Obong says </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">54gene is in varying stages of conversations with more partners. However, he was tight-lipped on who they might be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about our Africa-first approach which will see us expand to countries within East and West Africa in the coming year,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">54gene made some hires to this end: Michelle Ephraim, Colm O&#8217;Dushlaine, Peter Fekkes, Teresia Bost, Jude Uzonwanne &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who have decades of experience working with companies like Leica Biosystems, Regeneron Genetic Center, Novartis, Celgene, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African venture capital firm Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund led this round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead investor from the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/african-genomics-startup-54gene-raises-15m-led-by-adjuvant-capital/">Series A funding</a>, Adjuvant Capital invested once again with participation from other VCs including KdT Ventures, Plexo Capital, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Catalyst, and Ingressive Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The climate crisis is creating massive demand for data capture as industries grapple with how to decarbonize. Put simply, you can&#8217;t cut your carbon emissions if don&#8217;t know what they are in the first place.</p>
<p>This need to gather data is a big opportunity for startups &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/a-growing-number-of-startups-are-creating-apis-to-assess-and-offset-corporate-carbon-emissions/">a wave of early companies</a> have already been founded to try to plug the sustainability data gap, through things like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/a-growing-number-of-startups-are-creating-apis-to-assess-and-offset-corporate-carbon-emissions/">APIs </a>to assess emissions for carbon offsetting (which in turn has led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/sylvera-grabs-seed-backing-from-index-to-help-close-the-accountability-gap-around-carbon-offsetting/">other startups trying to tackle the data gap around offsetting projects</a>&#8230;).</p>
<p>One thing is clear: Requirements for sustainability reporting are only going to get broader and deeper from here on in.</p>
<p>Munich-based <a href="https://www.tanso.io">Tanso</a> is an early stage startup (founded this year) that&#8217;s building software to support sustainability reporting for a particular sector (industrial manufacturers) &#8212; with the goal of creating a data management system that can automate data capture and sustainability reporting geared towards the specific needs of the sector.</p>
<p>The startup says it decided to focus on industrial manufacturing because it&#8217;s both an emissions-heavy sector and underserved with supportive digital tech vs many other industries.</p>
<p>The founders met during their studies at universities in Munich and Zurich &#8212; where they&#8217;d been researching the assessment of organizational climate impact. Their collective expertise crystalized into the realization of a business opportunity to build a data management system for a notoriously polluting sector that&#8217;s facing a mandate to change.</p>
<p>In the coming years, European regulations will expand sustainability reporting requirements &#8212; with the EU&#8217;s &#8216;Green Deal&#8217; plan setting an overarching goal of Europe becoming the first &#8220;climate-neutral&#8221; continent by 2050.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Specific (existing) reporting requirements within the bloc include the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which will apply to more than 50,000 companies &#8212; requiring they report on their sustainability metrics, starting in 2023.</p>
<p>The UK (now outside the EU) already introduced some reporting requirements for domestic companies, under the Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) regulation, which has applied since 2019 and applies to over 12,000 businesses in the UK in varying degrees of detail depending on the size of the company.</p>
<p>So there is a clear direction of travel in the region requiring businesses to gather and report sustainability data.</p>
<p>Tanso has just closed a $1.9 million pre-seed raise with the aim of getting its data management support software to market in time for an expected surge in demand as sustainability regulations like CSRD start to bite.</p>
<p>The raise is led by German early stage b2b fund UVC Partners, with participation from Picus Capital, Possible Ventures, and a number of business angels.</p>
<p>Tanso is still in the R&amp;D/product development phase, with co-founder Gyri Reiersen telling TechCrunch it&#8217;s currently working with a number of manufacturers to &#8220;figure out the sweet spot&#8221; for automating data gathering so it can come to market with a scalable product offering. She says the team raised a relatively large pre-seed exactly to see it through until it&#8217;s got something fit to launch (it&#8217;s hoping to have something &#8220;solid, verified and scalable&#8221; by the end of 2022, per Reiersen).</p>
<p>The goal for the product is a single platform that gathers and holds all the customer&#8217;s sustainability data and can automate the generation of reports to meet regulatory requirements &#8212; including auditing.</p>
<p>From 2025, Reiersen points out that CSRD reporting needs to be &#8220;auditable&#8221;, meaning that you have to have &#8220;some form of transparency and traceability&#8221;; and also that the &#8220;correctness&#8221; of sustainability reporting will be a C-Suite responsibility. So that must concentrate boardroom minds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going beyond that it&#8217;s all about how can you use this data and the insights that the data gives you to make predictions and models going forward for how should we develop our products? What makes sense to do going forward to make?&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re prototyping currently is to streamline the workflow of information gathering,&#8221; Reiersen also tells us, discussing the product dev process. &#8220;Also to have really good, fundamental user-flow for the users to use our product. And then doing the deep dives on integrations over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>She says the challenge is finding the trade-off between usability and &#8220;digging into the data&#8221;. &#8220;For us it&#8217;s very important to have a scalable product, especially having it fully scalable from 2023 when the CSRD are started because then there will be desperation on the market. Companies will need to have something,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to have these solutions&#8230; that take one step in the right direction for all companies and not just have a couple of carbon neutral companies&#8230; So for us it&#8217;s more about finding the productizable use-cases in the beginning to make this a scalable product.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she also warns over a proliferation of overly &#8220;shallow&#8221; offerings in the space &#8212; driven by marketing-led &#8216;greenwashing&#8217; (and bogus carbon offsetting) rather than a genuine desire to correctly identify the problem and course-correct which is what&#8217;s actually needed for humanity to avert climate disaster.</p>
<p>Reiersen adds that she got really interested in this space through her university work researching the overestimation of carbon offsets through deep learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is such a need for accountability and making sure that the product that is being developed actually do their job correctly. Because it&#8217;s so easy to just have a black box and trust it. We can&#8217;t afford having systems that overestimate or underestimate. It needs to be accurate and it needs to be validated,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going forward accuracy will mean more and more and then you need to access the &#8216;real data&#8217; and not just &#8216;guestimations&#8217;,&#8221; she predicts. &#8220;And that&#8217;s where we see that of course we need to be very front-end/UX-friendly, and making it easy for people to enter the right data and have a very user-friendly, usable product and that people are guided through the process of gathering the right data&#8230; but also over time really focusing on how do you integrate and get access to the data at the data-base level?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A16z is inching closer to making its first investment in a startup in India, the world&#8217;s second largest internet market that has produced over two dozen unicorns this year.</p>
<p>The Menlo Park-headquartered firm is in final stages of conversations to invest in Indian crypto trading startup CoinSwitch Kuber, three sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The proposed deal values the Bangalore-based firm at $1.9 billion, two sources said. Coinbase is also investing in the new round, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>CoinSwitch Kuber was valued at over $500 million in a round in April this year when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/tiger-global-backs-indian-crypto-startup-coinswitch-kuber-at-over-500m-valuation/">raised $25 million from Tiger Global</a>. If the deal with A16z materializes, it will be CoinSwitch Kuber&#8217;s third financing round this year.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/indian-crypto-exchange-coinswitch-kuber-in-talks-to-raise-funds-at-unicorn-valuation/">reported last week</a> that CoinSwitch Kuber was in talks to raise its Series C funding at up to $2 billion valuation. The report, which didn&#8217;t identify a lead investor, noted that the Indian startup had engaged with Andreessen Horowitz and Coinbase in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Usual caveats apply: terms of the proposed deal may change or the talks may not result in a deal. The author <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc/status/1438057488205561861">reported</a> some details about the deal on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The startup declined to comment. Coinbase and A16z as well as existing investors Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital India did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>The investment talks come at a time when CoinSwitch Kuber has more than doubled its user base in recent months — even as local authorities push back against crypto assets. Its eponymous app had over 10 million users in India last month, up from about 4 million in April this year, the startup said in a newspaper advertisement over the weekend.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A handful of crypto startups in India have demonstrated fast-pace growth in recent years &#8212; while impressively keeping their CAC very low &#8212; as millions of millennials in the South Asian nation kickstart their investment journeys. Several funds including those with big presence in India such as Accel, Lightspeed, WEH and Kalaari recently began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">working on their thesis to back crypto startups</a>, TechCrunch reported earlier.</p>
<p>B Capital backed CoinDCX, a rival of CoinSwitch Kuber that has amassed 3.5 million users, last month in a $90 million round that valued CoinDCX at about $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Policymakers in India have been debating on the status of digital currencies in the South Asian market for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/">several years</a>. India’s central bank, Reserve Bank of India, has expressed concerns about private virtual currencies though it is planning to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/india-considering-phased-roll-out-of-central-bank-digital-currency/">run trial programs of its first digital currency</a> as soon as December.</p>
<p>About 27 Indian startups have become a unicorn this year, up from 11 last year, as several high-profile investors &#8212; and global peers of Andreessen Horowitz &#8212; such as Tiger Global and Coatue have increased the pace of their investments in the South Asian market. Apna announced earlier on Thursday that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/tiger-global-led-100m-investment-makes-apna-indias-fastest-unicorn/">raised $100 million in a round led by Tiger Global</a> at $1.1 billion valuation, becoming the youngest Indian firm to attain the unicorn status.</p>
<p>Groww, an investment app for millennials, is in talks to raise a new financing round that would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/indias-groww-in-talks-to-raise-funds-at-a-3-billion-valuation/">value it at $3 billion</a>, TechCrunch reported on Wednesday. The startup has engaged with Coatue in recent days, the report said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://liveblocks.io">Liveblocks</a>, a startup that has been working on a set of APIs so that it’s easier to build a collaborative product. Essentially, it lets you create multiplayer experiences on the web or in your app.</p>
<p>The company started with a live presence state API. If you integrate this API in your product, it means that you can show when somebody joins a page, a project or a document by displaying an avatar in a corner. You can also share the position of everyone’s cursor, text selection or content selection in real time.</p>
<p>Liveblocks is currently testing in private beta a live storage API. This is going to be a key feature as it is going to let multiple people view and edit the same data in real-time. For example, you can use it to develop a Google Docs competitor or if you want to add a whiteboard tool to your service.</p>
<p>The service works across multiple browsers and devices. Behind the scenes, the company uses a WebSocket connection for real-time communication. Pricing depends on the number of simultaneous connections that you expect around the same room, document, experience.</p>
<p>“Guillaume Salles and I decided to work together on a browser-based collaborative presentation/video tool. After months of iteration, we realized that we were spending a majority of our time figuring out how to handle the real‑time collaboration aspect of things, instead of focusing on the core mechanics of the tool,” co-founder and CEO Steven Fabre told me.</p>
<p>“We tried existing solutions, but none really stacked up for what we were trying to do so we decided to build our own. That&#39;s when it clicked and we decided to drop the presentation/video tool to ‘productify’ the APIs we had built for ourselves so any team could use them to build performant real-time collaborative products,” he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company raised a $1.4 million pre-seed round during the summer. Investors include Boldstart, Seedcamp, Meta fund, Logic &amp; Rhythm, Ian Storm Taylor, Max Stoiber, Moritz Plassnig, Badrul Farooqi and Anthony DiMare.</p>
<p>Right now, the Liveblocks team is just the two founders. With this funding round, the company plans to hire some engineers and launch its live storage API.</p>
<p>Liveblocks’ main advantage is that it’s a high-level API. <a href="https://ably.com">Ably</a>, a startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/ably-raises-70-million-for-its-developer-platform-that-enables-realtime-features/">I&#8217;ve covered recently</a>, focuses more on the low-level aspect of the problem. A React front-end developer can read the documentation and integrate Liveblocks in its product. You don’t have to understand how the infrastructure layer actually works to get started.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://en.skello.io">Skello</a> has raised a $47.3 million funding round (€40 million). The company has been working on a software-as-a-service tool that lets you manage the work schedule of your company. What makes it special is that Skello automatically takes into account local labor laws and collective agreements.</p>
<p>Partech is leading today’s funding round. Existing investors XAnge and Aglaé Ventures are also participating. The startup had previously raised a €300,000 seed round and a €6 million Series A round in 2018.</p>
<p>Skello works with companies across many industries, such as retail, hospitality, pharmacies, bakeries, gyms, escape games and more. And many of them were simply using Microsoft Excel to manage their schedule.</p>
<p>By using Skello, you get an online service that works for both managers and employees. On the manager side, you can view who is working and when. You can assign employees to fill some gaps.</p>
<p>For employees, they can also connect to the platform to see their own schedule. Employees can also say when they are unavailable and request time off. And when something unexpected comes up, employees can trade shifts.</p>
<p>“We really want to put employees at the center of the product,” co-founder and CEO Quitterie Mathelin-Moreaux told me. “They have a mobile app and the idea is to make the work schedule as collaborative as possible in order to allocate resources as efficiently as possible and increase team retention.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At every step of the scheduling process, Skello manages legal requirements. For instance, Skello remembers mandatory weekly rest periods. The platform knows that your employees can’t work across a long time range. And Skello can count overtime hours, holiday hours, Sunday shifts, etc.</p>
<p>When you’re approaching the end of the month, Skello can generate a report with everyone’s timesheet. You can integrate Skello directly with your payroll tool to make this process a bit less tedious as well.</p>
<p>Skello is currently used across 7,000 points of sale. Now, the company wants to expand to more European countries and increase the size of the team from 150 employees to 300 employees by 2022.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.delegateconnect.co/">Delegate Connect</a> is the latest virtual/hybrid events platform to land funding. The Melbourne-based startup announced today it has raised $10 million AUD (about $7.3 million USD) in seed funding led by AirTree Ventures, which wrote Delegate Connect the biggest seed check in the fund’s history so far. Other participants included Skip Capital, TEN13 and Australian startup founders like LinkTree’s Alex Zaccaria and Go1’s Andrew Barnes.</p>
<p>The capital will be used to build Delegate Connect’s teams in Melbourne, London and Norway, which enable it to handle events around the world, increasing headcount from 45 to more than 100 by December. It also plans to open a United States-based office soon.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 and bootstrapped until its seed round, Delegate Connect’s business grew during the COVID-19 pandemic, like many other virtual event platforms. Its clients have included the Edinburgh TV Festival, Sportsbet, the World Dental Congress and the World Library and Information Congress. Some of the sectors Delegate Connect focuses on include medical, pharmaceutical and industry associations.</p>
<p>Delegate Connect was created after co-founders Jordan Walsh and Jacob Thomas started a technical production and events business, and looked for a “technology platform that could do everything we needed at a large-scale event, including registration, live-streaming, hosting video-on-demand and integrate seamlessly with the venues.” They decided to build their own, initially as an internal tool. Then during a trip to India in 2019 to work on a symposium, the two realized that there was a wider need for their platform.</p>
<p>“[We] had a lightbulb moment where we thought ‘we are solving a genuine problem here.’ One of the world’s biggest technology companies was flying us to Mumbai to use our system (which wasn’t even built properly) to deliver the technical assets of their event!” Walsh told TechCrunch in an email.</p>
<p>The two finished building the platform at the end of 2019 and launched it in January 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Walsh and Thomas were interested in hybrid events even before COVID-19.</p>
<p>“Hybrid events have been around for along time, especially in the medical, pharmaceutical and associations sectors,” said Walsh. “Before COVID, they typically involved someone broadcasting a live stream from the venue, recording it and then hosting it on-demand after the event. These are all fundamentals of the platform we’ve built, and we’re obsessed with creating a platform that expands the hybrid event experience to do so much more than live streaming and video on demand.”</p>
<p>Some features created for the medical and pharmaceutical sectors include the ability to log hours spent viewing educational or scientific content, which is useful for delegates who are attending events to earn professional development points (CPD), abstract submissions, content-restricted registrations and the ability to run concurrent streams.</p>
<p>Tracking professional development points is a major selling point in particular, since “this is typically super complex technically for clients, and we solve this for them by working out how they accredit, build it in, track it and then process the accreditation,” said Walsh.</p>
<p>If you’ve attended a lot of online events over the past year and a half, you are probably wondering how Delegate Connect is different from platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/hopin-confirms-400m-raise-at-5-65b-valuation/">Hopin</a> (which was used for TechCrunch Disrupt last year), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/bizzabo-raises-138m-for-a-platform-that-helps-you-build-and-run-virtual-conferences/">Bizzabo</a>, MeetingPlay or Cvent.</p>
<p>One of its main differentiators is that it was built with specific target audiences (medical, pharmaceutical, associations and international congresses) in mind, and plans to launch a self-service platform for them. Delegate Connect is also completely customizable, so events can use it as a white-label solution.</p>
<p>“Ease of use is central to the UX,” Walsh said. “For example, we have full content restrictions through our registration portal, allowing people to register for sessions, days, themes and streams. We can restrict sponsors form seeing other sponsor booths and ensure that content can’t be shared (e.g. if a pharmaceutical company can’t share info with non-pharmacists, we can restrict this) as well as allow certain delegates to view only some content if needed.”</p>

<p>The delta variant and resurgence of COVID-19 has forced many organizers to turn in-person events into online ones. Walsh said Delegate Connect has handled many last-minute requests and can do so in a matter of hours. For example, in August, the startup was working on a medical conference originally slated to run as a hybrid event from a venue in Japan with thousands of delegates. Just before it was supposed to start, however, the organizers told Delegate Connect that they needed to switch to fully virtual event.</p>
<p>“We can do this easily because the platform doesn’t change. It’s versatile, no matter the delivery method,” said Walsh. “Delegates just need to log in on the day and engage with the content just like they would if they were at the event.”</p>

<p>Most of us count the golden age of Michael Jackson&#8217;s career with the Quincy Jones produced global smashes of Thriller and Bad. Fueled by the stream of videos and multi-single releases (5 on Bad), the records dominated the charts, radio, and MTV. But the real breakthrough came just before with Jackson&#8217;s first solo record Off the Wall.</p>
<p>Born in the thrall of the Disco Era, it wasn&#8217;t hip, a surrender to the feel of funk meets MGM. But in the mountains around Woodstock, we couldn&#8217;t pry this record off the turntable. Today, with a simple voice command to Siri, the mists evaporate and with them the pandemic, working, working, working day and night, the melting years. And the bass. My God but it drives us to Living Life off the wall.</p>
<p>Permission is what we&#8217;re given. We need it. No matter what lies in store for us, the grooves capture the essence of our future, unlock our hopes and dreams, our intuition. Can we dare to think this way, the blend of vocals, horns, percussion, and the coursing basses? A Stevie Wonder track recharges the battery. The record fades out quietly, priming the pump for Side One.</p>
<p>Today we lost a nightclub comedian, as Norm MacDonald called himself in a YouTube clip. Like the best of them, his comedy spooled out of him like a 50&#8217;s cop show, methodical and faux stupid. You could see his genius in the faces of the funny people who had him on their shows — Letterman, Leno, Conan, an agonizingly hilarious Dennis Miller on his foul-mouthed HBO cable show. Talk about off the wall.</p>
<p>Miller defined this most selfish of dark arts, the joy of being funnier in the presence of funny. In a time of excruciating not funny, these strange warriors tilt with the vagaries of the laugh. MacDonald&#8217;s careful construction of his sleight of word was all the richer for his seemingly aimless pursuit of the sweet spot, where the punchline is so McGuffin-like for its inevitability.</p>
<p>As the world slowly recovers its focus, Apple has released a new iPhone that can adjust reality after the fact, Knowing this feat is not possible to recover what and who we&#8217;ve lost, I&#8217;m so grateful for the time we&#8217;ve had with these greats and their great moments. When the traveler reached the top of the mountain and asked the wise man for the secret of life, he replied, &#8220;Could you give me a sec, I&#8217;m on the phone.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">CoderSchool, a Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam-based online coding school startup, announced today $2.6 million in pre-Series A funding to scale up its online coding school platform.</p>
<p>This round was led by Monk’s Hill Ventures, with participation from returning seed investors Iterative, XA Network and iSeed Ventures. CoderSchool raised a seed round led by TRIVE Ventures in 2018.</p>
<p>CoderSchool will use the funding to accelerate its online teaching platform growth and technology infrastructure expansion for the company’s technical education programs that guarantee employment upon graduation.</p>
<p>The company, founded in 2015 by Charles Lee and Harley Trung, who previously worked as software engineers, pivoted from offline to online in early 2020 to bring high-quality technical training to everyone, everywhere. After switching to a fully online learning program, the company recorded 100% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) growth in fully online enrollment, it said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coding is the future. At CoderSchool, we believe everyone in Southeast Asia deserves a chance to be part of that future,&#8221; the company co-founder and CEO Lee said.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, the demand for IT talent is dramatically increasing by 47% a year, while supply is only increasing by 8% year-on-year.</p>
<p>“The need for strong engineers and developers in Southeast Asia has never been as <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">pertinent </span>as it is today with the growth of tech companies and digital businesses,” said Michele Daoud, partner of Monk’s Hill Ventures. “We have been impressed by the team’s focus on setting the standard for coding education in the region. We are excited to partner with CoderSchool to provide both opportunity and access to the millions of aspiring students in Vietnam.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Given the strong engineer demand in Vietnam, the domestic market size is estimated between $100 million &#8211; $200 million, and still increasing every year, according to Lee. CoderSchool has been focusing on Vietnam for the last six years, but plans to enter the global market following the next round, Lee said, without providing exact timetable.</p>
<p>CoderSchool, which offers full-stack web development, machine learning and data sciences courses at a lower cost, has trained more than 2,000 alumni up to date, and recorded over 80% job placement rate for full-time graduates, getting jobs at companies such as BOSCHE, Microsoft, Lazada, Shopee, FE Credit, FPT Software, Sendo, Tiki and Momo.</p>
<p>&#8220;After having taught over 2,000 students, we&#8217;ve been able to refine our [coding education] content. We rewrote our full-stack web development course &#8212; from Ruby, Python to JavaScript &#8212; in two years, and added new machine learning and data science courses to our program,&#8221; Lee told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>CorderSchool&#8217;s online program enables students to interact with instructors and classmates before, during and after scheduled class sessions with its human-driven learning strategy. CoderSchool currently has 15 instructional staff, and plans to hire 35 additional instructors by Q4 2022.</p>
<p>CoderSchool&#8217;s data analytics has improved individual student performance while also allowing CoderSchool to increase its classroom size at scale, reaching a peak of 107 enrollments in a data science class.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s back to school season and on TikTok, that means students are inexplicably stealing everything that isn&#8217;t bolted down.</p>
<p>The latest TikTok trend to generally wreak social havoc sees students pulling off &#8220;devious licks&#8221; — small-scale heists of everything from soap dispensers, Covid test kits and hand sanitizer to high value items like classroom tech.</p>
<p>The videos are set to an edited version of Lil B&#8217;s &#8220;Ski Ski BasedGod,&#8221; which had appeared in around 100,000 videos on TikTok by Monday, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-devious-lick-trend-school">according to Mashable</a>, with the tag #deviouslick collecting more than 175 million views.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WgzwSuAOIm4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>TikTok cracked down on Wednesday, limiting search results for the viral stunt, removing videos with the tag and encouraging users to &#8220;please be kind&#8221; to teachers.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s hard to know which videos are staged and which are legitimate, the trend is real enough to have teachers and parents across the country stressed out. At a <a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/destructive-devious-licks-tiktok-challenge-a-problem-at-some-valley-schools/">middle school in Las Vegas</a>, school administrators report students swiping speed limit signs, fire alarms, soap dispensers and classroom projectors. And in Portland, Oregon at least one high school saw an entire building&#8217;s worth of soap dispensers go missing — not a great start to another school year in the throes of a global pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The first all-civilian crew in history has made it to space.</p>
<p>The Inspiration4 crew took off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 8:04 EST PM, commencing the first space mission in human history featuring zero trained astronauts.</p>
<p>The reusable first-stage of the Falcon 9 rocket executed two burns in its journey back to Earth, landing vertically on the SpaceX droneship &#8220;Just Read the Instructions&#8221; around 9-and-a-half minutes after launch. Dragon separated from the second stage at 8:16 EST PM.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203520" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203520" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2203520" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stage2-separation-inspiration4.gif" alt="" width="990" height="559" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203520" class="wp-caption-text">Second stage separation. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://spacex.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpaceX <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The four-person crew will be spending time in orbit in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which was affixed to a Falcon 9 rocket. (It&#8217;s the second journey for this particular Dragon and the third journey for the Falcon 9 first stage.) They’ll ascend to an altitude of around 575 kilometers – the highest that any humans have gone since the last Hubble telescope servicing mission in 2009. That altitude is above the current orbit of the Hubble and the International Space Station, so they’ll be flying over every other human in space, too.</p>
<p>The crew will be going around the earth around 15 times each day they’re in space. While they’re up there, they’ll be able to view outer space from a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spacex-is-outfitting-it-dragon-spacecraft-with-an-observation-down-for-space-tourists/">transparent observation dome</a> &#8220;cupola&#8221; that was affixed to Crew Dragon’s the nose cone especially for this flight. It&#8217;s the largest continuous window to ever be in space. It won’t all be space tourism, however; the Inspiration4 is also ferrying a number of science experiments to orbit, including research to learn more about the impact of spaceflight on the human body. The research subjects will be themselves: the crew collect biomedical data and biological samples from themselves before, during and after the flight.</p>
<p>Nowadays, no private space mission is complete without a requisite billionaire, and Inspiration4 has one of those, too: the mission commander and man who fronted the bill, Jared Isaacman, who earned his fortune from his payment processing company Shift4 Payments. It must be said, however, that the remaining crew members, while clearly extremely talented and uncommonly brave, are refreshingly normal. They include physician assistant Hayley Arceneaux; geoscientist and science education doctorate Sian Proctor; and Lockheed Martin engineer Chris Sembroski.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2203485" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203485" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2203485" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/inspo4.gif" alt="" width="640" height="304" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203485" class="wp-caption-text">The Inspiration4 crew admiring the Falcon 9 rocket on Launch Pad 39A.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://spacex.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpaceX <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The mission will be raising money for St. Jude Research Hospital (Sembroski was selected from nearly 72,000 donations to the St. Jude fundraising campaign). The crew aimed to raise $200 million in total; $100 million was donated by Isaacman and the mission far exceeded its goal prior to launch, hitting nearly $300 million at the time of launch.</p>
<p>To prepare for the mission, which is significantly longer than any other recent spaceflight featuring civilians, the crew undertook hundreds of hours of training, including 12- and 30-hour flight simulations in a replica Dragon capsule and climbing Washington State’s Mount Rainier in May.</p>
<p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was at Kennedy Space Center to see the crew off, and in true Muskian style the crew also travelled to the launch tower in two Model Xs (wearing custom SpaceX spacesuits). While NASA’s involvement in the mission was relatively nominal, beyond providing some services and equipment worth around $1 million, the agency has played a key role in bringing SpaceX to the place of supremacy it is today. SpaceX was awarded $2.6 billion from NASA in 2014 to develop Crew Dragon, under its Commercial Crew program.</p>
<p>It’s a major milestone for SpaceX, the largest and most profitable launch company in the world. This launch is also notably different than those undertaken by Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson in recent months – though I know the similarities are compelling – because the crew will be going higher and for longer than the Blue Origin or Virgin Galactic missions. But all three companies have a goal of making spaceflight “evolve toward an airline-like model,” as SpaceX senior director of human spaceflight Benji Reed put it yesterday.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, we want to we want to make life multiplanetary, and that means putting millions of people in space,” he said. “The long-term vision is that spaceflight becomes airline-like like you buy a ticket and you go.”</p>
<p>Even this year, SpaceX will be conducting more crewed missions (though none with an all-civilian crew). A Falcon 9 will be ferrying astronauts to ISS later this year, and at the beginning of next year will be the first commercial Axiom mission, also to the space station. “The Dragon manifest is getting busier by the moment,” he added.</p>
<p>If all goes as planned, we’ll be seeing the Inspiration4 crew in three days, when they’ll splash down back to Earth in either the Gulf or the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida. Weather is critical here, too: “We look at not only the launch weather but we have to look at the return weather […] when we come home in just three or four days from now,” Reed explained during a starry-eyed (no pun intended) press briefing Tuesday.</p>
<p>While the crew is in orbit, you can listen to a curated playlist by Inspiration4’s very own Sembroski (who plans to play a ukulele in space).</p>

<p>After months of publicity, an NFT auction and even a Netflix docuseries, it’s finally here: the four-person crew of Inspiration4 will be heading to space today (weather permitting).</p>
<p>What makes this launch different from any that came before it? None of the four people onboard are astronauts. The mission marks the first time that an all-civilian crew will fly to space. Let’s meet them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire whose fortune comes from the payment processing company Shift4 Payments, which went public in the summer of last year. He is the mission commander.</li>
<li>Sian Proctor, a community college professor with a PhD in science education. Proctor was among 47 finalists chosen by NASA for a 2009 astronaut class, though she was not one of the nine eventually chosen to join the agency. She will be Inspiration4’s pilot, the first Black woman to pilot a spacecraft. She’s 51.</li>
<li>Hayley Arceneaux, a 29-year-old physician assistant at St. Jude’s Research Hospital and a survivor of childhood cancer. She’ll be the crew’s health officer.</li>
<li>Christopher Sembroski, a data engineer for Lockheed Martin, also a former camp counselor at none other than Space Camp. The 42-year-old will be acting as mission specialist.</li>
</ul>
<p>The crew will be cruising to orbit inside a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which will launch from a Falcon 9 rocket. They’ll spend three days flying around the Earth before splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida.</p>
<p>SpaceX’s YouTube channel is hosting a live launch webcast starting from 3:45 PM EST, with the five-hour launch window opening at <strong>8:02 PM EST</strong>. As of Sunday, Inspiration4 said weather conditions at Kennedy Space Center looked 70% favorable. There’s also a back-up launch window opening at the same time the following day.</p>

		<title>Goldman says $2.2B purchase of BNPL provider GreenSky will help expand Marcus</title>

					<description><![CDATA[The acquisition is positioned to bolster the firm's consumer business and offer new products and new ways to attract consumers to its Marcus by Goldman Sachs brand of finance products.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning, Goldman Sachs announced plans to acquire B2B2C lender <a href="https://www.greensky.com/">GreenSky</a> in a <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/media-relations/press-releases/2021/goldman-sachs-to-acquire-greensky.html">deal worth $2.24 billion</a>. The acquisition, which is still subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020 or the first quarter of 2021, is positioned to bolster the firm&#8217;s consumer business and offer new products and new ways to attract consumers to its <a href="https://www.marcus.com/">Marcus by Goldman Sachs</a> brand of finance products.</p>
<p>Goldman launched Marcus five years ago as a consumer-focused brand in part to compete with a growing set of fintech startups, neobanks, and online trading platforms that have sprung up over the last decade. While it has attracted 8 million users since launch &#8212; putting it ahead of many <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2021/02/01/challenger-bank-chime-hits-12-million-customer-mark/?sh=6a44317d23f5">so-called challenger banks</a> &#8212; Marcus still trails Chime and Robinhood among banking and trading apps (at least among number of users).</p>
<p>But with the purchase of GreenSky, it&#8217;s hoping to add another way to pull consumers into its Marcus funnel.</p>
<p>GreenSky operates a platform that facilitates loans for big-ticket items like <a href="https://www.greensky.com/home-improvement/">home improvement projects</a> or <a href="https://www.greensky.com/healthcare/">elective dental or medical procedures</a>. It enables brands like Home Depot, as well as medical and dental practices, to offer installment loans to customers at the point of sale, thereby increasing sales and conversions for its clients. GreenSky then sells off those loans to a number of banks and other lending partners.</p>
<p>The deal could be seen as a way for Goldman to buy its way into the &#8220;buy now, pay later&#8221; trend, offering Marcus users additional ways to finance their purchases. That market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/11/2201091/">has taken off lately</a>, as evidenced by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/">Square&#8217;s acquisition of Afterpay</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/">PayPal&#8217;s acquisition of Paidy</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/business/amazon-affirm.html">Amazon striking a deal to offer BNPL financing through Affirm</a>.</p>
<p>But according to Stephanie Cohen, the global co-head of Consumer &amp; Wealth Management at Goldman Sachs, the acquisition is as much about bringing GreenSky&#8217;s customers into the Marcus ecosystem. She also believes that by bringing GreenSky into Goldman Sachs and lending off its balance sheet, there&#8217;s no limit to the scale at which it can grow.</p>
<p>That said, don&#8217;t expect Goldman or Marcus to begin offering BNPL lending for everyday shopping anytime soon, as Cohen says GreenSky is attractive in part due to the big-ticket nature of home improvement lending.</p>
<p>To learn more about the firm&#8217;s plans, we spoke with Cohen about the deal and asked how GreenSky fits in with Marcus and the rest of Goldman&#8217;s business. The full interview, slightly edited for length and clarity, is below.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for September 15, 2021. Today we have everything in the newsletter. Bad behavior in the crypto world? Yep. Why the Mailchimp deal might make good sense? You bet.</p>
<p>But before we get into the mix, a few TechCrunch notes. First, Jordan Crook’s regular series of streamed chats with investors and founders is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/check-out-the-amazing-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-cru-ahem-techcrunch-live/">now called TechCrunch Live</a>.

And NFT marketplace OpenSea <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/opensea-admits-incident-as-top-exec-is-accused-of-trading-nfts-on-insider-information/">ate a buffet of crow earlier today</a> when it admitted that an executive at the concern was front-running NFT sales. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f611.png" alt="😑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/intuits-12b-mailchimp-acquisition-is-about-expanding-its-small-business-focus/"><strong>Maybe the Intuit-Mailchimp deal is not dumb?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, TechCrunch’s first reaction to the news that TurboTax parent company Intuit wants to spend $12 billion on Mailchimp was skeptical. But Ron Miller hit up a bunch of smart folks, and there was more positive sentiment to be recorded than we might have guessed.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/forges-spac-deal-is-a-bet-on-unicorn-illiquidity/"><strong>Tech companies are still going public:</strong></a><strong> </strong>We’re waiting for Toast and Freshworks and Warby Parker to get their debuts launched, but other companies aren’t waiting for a clear news cycle. Secondary share marketplace Forge is going public via a SPAC, so we <em>had</em> to take a look.</li>

<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>First things first, more news from the BNPL beat. Yes, the method of paying for a transaction in installments is still making news. This time it’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/ascend-raises-5-5m-to-provide-a-bnpl-option-for-commercial-insurance/">Ascend raising $5.5 million to bring BNPL services to the commercial insurance world</a>. Recent liquidity in the fintech market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/heres-what-your-bnpl-startup-could-be-worth/">could help drive fresh venture interest in coming quarters</a>.</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/sendcloud-nabs-177m-led-by-softbank-to-double-down-on-saas-shipping-as-a-service/">Sendcloud raises $177M for SaaS:</a> </strong>No, not <i data-stringify-type="italic">that </i>SaaS<i data-stringify-type="italic">.</i> <i data-stringify-type="italic">Shipping</i> as a service, in Sendcloud’s space. The Dutch startup now flush with SoftBank cash “has built a service [that provides] a cloud-based platform to easily organize and carry out shipping services by choosing from a wide range of carriers and other options.” It sounds <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/shippo-raises-45m-more-at-495m-valuation-as-ecommerce-booms/">a bit like a European Shippo</a></strong>?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/rivians-first-production-r1t-electric-pickup-truck-rolls-off-the-line/"><strong>Rivian proves it’s not vaporware:</strong></a><strong> </strong>After raising dump trucks worth of capital, Rivian’s first <em>production</em> R1T electric pickup has rolled off the line. It’s a big moment for the company and sets Rivian apart from a host of other EV companies that hope to match its new milestone. Also apparently there is a color called Rivian Blue, and I am here for it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/clubhouse-head-of-news/"><strong>Clubhouse hires head of news:</strong></a><strong> </strong>NPR vet Nina Gregory has taken on the role of Clubhouse’s head of News and Media Publishers, TechCrunch reports. Her role will be to work with both the social platform and news orgs. Perhaps her job would be a smidgen easier if Clubhouse backer a16z wasn’t so antagonistic toward the media. But, hey, the hire still makes good sense.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/news-aggregator-smartnews-raises-230-million-valuing-its-business-at-2-billion/">Speaking of news, SmartNews is now worth $2 billion:</a></strong> Sure, <em>media</em> is a trash business &#8212; mostly &#8212; but perhaps media aggregation is the golden ticket. Investors just put $230 million into news aggregator SmartNews, giving it a shiny new valuation. I have a soft spot for SmartNews as we partnered with them back in the Crunchbase News days, but past that, I am impressed and <em>curious</em> how it is going to generate the revenue needed to surpass its new price tag.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/airbase-adds-spend-support-for-international-subsidiaries/"><strong>Airbase further differentiates itself from Brex, Ramp:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The corporate spend wars are good fun because there are a number of startups in the space that are growing quickly, raising money and making deals. And they are increasingly carving up their market. Airbase just built some new capabilities that may help it attack larger customers than what some of its rivals appear to have their eyes on.</li>
<li><strong>Finally today, Inspired Capital</strong> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/two-years-after-launching-inspired-capital-has-finished-raising-its-second-fund/">raised a second fund</a> just two years after its first.</li>

<h2>5 things you need to win your first customer</h2>
<p>Congratulations on shipping your product, but how much do you know about your target customers?</p>
<p>Companies that haven&#8217;t created an ideal customer profile and performed a SWOT analysis are making big bets on guesswork and intuition. Sometimes that works out, but more frequently, it leads to tears.</p>
<p>In a guest post that walks readers through the fundamentals of creating customer personals that map to your company&#8217;s goals, Grammarly product marketing lead Bryan Dsouza shares five basic requirements for customer acquisition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understanding and executing on these things can guarantee you that first customer win, provided you do them well and with sincerity,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Your investors will also see the fruits of your labor and be comforted knowing their dollars are at good work.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Investors in AI-first technology companies serving the defense industry, such as Palantir, Primer and Anduril, are doing well. Anduril, for one, reached a valuation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/anduril-funding-series-d-valuation/">over $4 billion in less than four years</a>. Many other companies that build general-purpose, AI-first technologies — such as image labeling — receive large (undisclosed) portions of their revenue from the defense industry.</p>
<p>Investors in AI-first technology companies that aren’t even intended to serve the defense industry often find that these firms eventually (and sometimes inadvertently) help other powerful institutions, such as police forces, municipal agencies and media companies, prosecute their duties.</p>
<p>Most do a lot of good work, such as <a href="https://www.datarobot.com/covid/">DataRobot helping agencies understand</a> the spread of COVID, <a href="https://hash.ai/blog/vaccine-distribution-scenario-modeling">HASH running simulations</a> of vaccine distribution or <a href="https://lilt.com/press">Lilt</a> making school communications available to immigrant parents in a U.S. school district.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The first step in taking responsibility is knowing what on earth is going on. It&#8217;s easy for startup investors to shrug off the need to know what’s going on inside AI-based models.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>However, there are also some less positive examples — technology made by Israeli cyber-intelligence firm NSO was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/">used to hack 37 smartphones</a> belonging to journalists, human-rights activists, business executives and the fiancée of murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to a report by The Washington Post and 16 media partners. The report claims the phones were on a list of over 50,000 numbers based in countries that surveil their citizens and are known to have hired the services of the Israeli firm.</p>
<p>Investors in these companies may now be asked challenging questions by other founders, limited partners and governments about whether the technology is too powerful, enables too much or is applied too broadly. These are questions of degree, but are sometimes not even asked upon making an investment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the privilege of talking to a lot of people with lots of perspectives — CEOs of big companies, founders of (currently!) small companies and politicians — since publishing <a href="http://theaifirstcompany.com">&#8220;The AI-First Company&#8221;</a> and investing in such firms for the better part of a decade. I&#8217;ve been getting one important question over and over again: How do investors ensure that the startups in which they invest responsibly apply AI?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be frank: It&#8217;s easy for startup investors to hand-wave away such an important question by saying something like, &#8220;It&#8217;s so hard to tell when we invest.” Startups are nascent forms of something to come. However, AI-first startups are working with something powerful from day one: Tools that allow leverage far beyond our physical, intellectual and temporal reach.</p>
<p>AI not only gives people the ability to put their hands around heavier objects (robots) or get their heads around more data (analytics), it also gives them the ability to bend their minds around time (predictions). When people can make predictions and learn as they play out, they can learn fast. When people can learn fast, they can act fast.</p>
<p>Like any tool, one can use these tools for good or for bad. You can use a rock to build a house or you can throw it at someone. You can use gunpowder for beautiful fireworks or firing bullets.</p>
<p>Substantially similar, AI-based computer vision models can be used to figure out the moves of a dance group or a terrorist group. AI-powered drones can aim a camera at us while going off ski jumps, but they can also aim a gun at us.</p>
<p>This article covers the basics, metrics and politics of responsibly investing in AI-first companies.</p>
<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>Investors in and board members of AI-first companies must take at least partial responsibility for the decisions of the companies in which they invest.</p>
<p>Investors influence founders, whether they intend to or not. Founders constantly ask investors about what products to build, which customers to approach and which deals to execute. They do this to learn and improve their chances of winning. They also do this, in part, to keep investors engaged and informed because they may be a valuable source of capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.reachcapital.com/">Reach Capital,</a> a San Francisco-based venture firm co-founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/jencarolan">Jennifer Carolan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SLP_EDU">Shauntel Garvey</a>, focused exclusively on edtech for years before the sector ballooned with unicorns. The rare, female-led partnership closed its third fund in February, a $165 million vehicle <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/reach-capital-fund-3/">and its largest to date.</a> That said, returns from its previous funds show that the early bet on a now-revitalized sector is paying off.</p>
<p>Reach Capital’s second fund, an $82 million vehicle closed in 2017, posted a net internal return rate of 72.1% as of Q2 2021, according to data intended for LPs and obtained by TechCrunch. The fund, which put investments into Paper, Winnie and now-unicorns Handshake and Outschool, ranks multiple percentage points above the top quartile of funds of that vintage. According to Cambridge Associates data, the top quartile of funds of that vintage had a net IRR of 47.64% the same quarter.</p>
<p>By comparison, Reach Capital’s first fund was multiple percentage points below the top quartile of fund performers of its vintage year, 2015.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Reach Capital’s returns for its second fund are mostly paper gains, meaning that the net IRR is based on an uptick in valuations. Given the fact that the firm is heavily concentrated in follow-on rounds, the IRR is thus a snapshot of a single moment of its performance in time. Reach recently had its first cash exit, seeing portfolio company <a href="https://ellevationeducation.com/news/ellevation-merges-curriculum-associates">Ellevation</a> merge with Curriculum Associates, but that is not represented in the data.</p>
<p>A number of blooming startups may explain what’s driving the improved performance between Reach I and Reach II. Per an impact report, Reach II invested $32 million into 14 core investments, including Newsela, Handshake and Outschool, all companies that have now gone to pass the billion-dollar valuation mark, making them unicorns. It also put money into Paper, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/paper-series-c-ivp/">recently landed a nine-figure round led by IVP</a>. By getting into those companies early, and then watching them get marked up as edtech booms as a category, Reach’s positions get validated.</p>

About 74% of investments are founded by men, while 26% are founded by women, the report states. About 62% of founders identify as white, 20% identify as Asian, 14% identify as LatinX and 4% identify as Middle Eastern. There are no Black founders in Reach Capital II’s portfolio.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reach’s impressive returns come at a time when venture more broadly is booming. A number of investors and founders spoke on background to offer context about whether the returns are impressive for a seed-stage fund of that vintage. One investment strategist said that, while it’s not unheard of in this environment, the return percentage is “crazy good.”</p>
<p>“Easily upper quartile and probably upper decile,” they said. “Unless we are talking crypto, in which case it&#8217;s pretty ordinary.” A separate seed-stage investor pointed to Fred Wilson’s recent blogpost &#8220;<a href="https://avc.com/2021/07/cash-on-cash-vs-irr/">Cash on Cash vs IRR</a>,&#8221; alluding to the idea that holding periods can skew fund performance data.</p>
<p>Still, Reach&#8217;s returns offer an impressive window into how one of the most diverse partnerships in venture capital is performing within one of the most revitalized sectors in startupland. The momentum isn&#8217;t going unnoticed. Filings show that Reach is raising money for a $50 million opportunity fund. The company has been on a hiring spree as of late, too, bringing on <a href="https://twitter.com/jomayra_herrera">Jomayra Herrera</a> from Cowboy Ventures as a partner and<a href="https://twitter.com/tonywan"> Tony Wan</a> from EdSurge as head of investor content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A 22-month-old startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/apple-alums-jobs-app-for-indias-workers-secures-8-million/">helping millions of blue- and gray-collar workers in India</a> learn new skills and find jobs has become the youngest firm to join the coveted unicorn status in the world’s second-largest internet market.</p>
<p><a href="http://apna.co/">Apna</a> announced on Thursday that it has raised $100 million in a round led by Tiger Global. The new round &#8212; a Series C &#8212; valued Apna at $1.1 billion. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/tiger-global-in-talks-to-make-apna-indias-fastest-unicorn/">reported</a> last month that Tiger Global, an existing investor in Apna, was in talks to lead a $100 million financing round in the startup at the unicorn valuation.</p>
<p>Owl Ventures, Insight Partners, Sequoia Capital India, Maverick Ventures and GSV Ventures also participated in the new round, which is the third investment secured by Apna this year. Apna was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/tiger-global-in-talks-to-make-apna-indias-fastest-unicorn/">valued at $570 million</a> in its Series B round in June this year.</p>
<p>The investors’ excitement comes as Apna has demonstrated an impressive growth in recent months. The startup has amassed over 16 million users on its 15-month-old eponymous Android app, up from 10 million in June this year.</p>
<p>Indian cities are home to hundreds of millions of low-skilled workers who hail from villages in search of work. Many of them have lost their jobs amid the coronavirus pandemic that has slowed several economic activities in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Apna has built a platform that provides a community to these workers. In the community, they engage with each other, exchange notes to perform better at interviews and share tips to negotiate better compensation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203355" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203355" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2203355 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apna-app.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="560" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apna-app.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apna-app.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apna-app.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apna-app.jpg?resize=768,538 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apna-app.jpg?resize=680,476 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apna-app.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203355" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apna</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On top of this, Apna connects these workers to potential employers. In an interview with TechCrunch, Apna founder and chief executive Nirmit Parikh said more than 150,000 employers &#8212; including Zomato, Bharti AXA, Urban Company, BYJU’S, PhonePe, Burger King, Delhivery, Teamlease and G4S Global &#8212; are on the platform, and over 5 million jobs are active.</p>
<p>The startup, whose name is inspired from a cheerful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGKJBPFdUA">2019 Bollywood song</a>, has facilitated over 18 million job interviews in the past 30 days, he said. Apna is currently operational in 28 Indian cities.</p>
<p>The idea for Apna came, Parikh has said, after he was puzzled to find that even as there are hundreds of millions of blue- and gray-collar workers in India, locating them when you need assistance with a task often proves very difficult.</p>
<p>Prior to starting Apna, Parikh, who previously worked at Apple, met these workers and went undercover as an electrician and floor manager to understand the problems they were facing. The problem, he found, was the disconnect. Workers had no means to find who needed them for jobs, and they were also not connected with one another. The community aspect of Apna, which now has over 70 such groups, is aimed at addressing this challenge.</p>
<p>The Apna app allows these workers to learn new skills to become eligible for more work opportunities. Apna has emerged as one of the fastest growing upskilling platforms &#8212; and that would explain why GSV Ventures and Owl Ventures, two high-profile firms known to back edtech startups, are investing in the Bangalore-based firm.</p>
<p>“Apna’s viral adoption is driven by a novel social and interactive approach to connecting employers with job seekers. We expect job seekers in search of meaningful connections and vetted opportunities to drive Apna’s continued explosive growth across India &#8212; and the world,&#8221; said Griffin Schroeder, partner at Tiger Global, in a statement.</p>
<p>Now the startup, which has started to monetize the platform, is ready to aggressively expand. Parikh said Apna will continue to expand to more cities in India and by early next year, Apna will begin its global expansion. Parikh said the startup is eyeing expansion in the USA, South East Asia and Middle East and Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have already created a dent. Now we want to impact the lives of 2.3 billion,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We will require crazy amounts of resources and a world-class team to deliver. It&#8217;s a herculean task, and is going to take a village. But somebody has to solve it.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A startup is a beautiful thing. It’s the tangible outcome of an idea birthed in a garage or on the back of a napkin. But ask any founder what really proves their startup has taken off, and they will almost instantly say it’s when they win their first customer.</p>
<p>That’s easier said than done, though, because winning that first customer will take a lot more than an Ivy-educated founder and/or a celebrity investor pool.</p>
<p>To begin with, you’ll have to craft a strong ideal customer profile to know your customer’s pain points, while developing a competitive SWOT analysis to scope out alternatives your customers can go to.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Your target customer will pick a solution that will help them achieve their goals. In other words, your goals should align with your customer’s goals.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>You’ll also need to create a shortlist of influencers who have your customer’s trust, identify their decision-makers who make the call to buy (or not), and create a mapped list of goals that align your customer’s goals to yours.</p>
<p>Understanding and executing on these things can guarantee you that first customer win, provided you do them well and with sincerity. Your investors will also see the fruits of your labor and be comforted knowing their dollars are at good work.</p>
<p>Let’s see how:</p>
<h2>1. Craft the ideal customer profile (ICP)</h2>
<p>The ICP is a great framework for figuring out who your target customer is, how big they are, where they operate, and why they exist. As you write up your ICP, you will soon see the pain points you assumed about them start to become more real.</p>
<p>To create an ICP, you will need to have a strong articulation of the problem you are trying to solve and the customers that experience this problem the most. This will be your baseline hypothesis. Then, as you develop your ICP, keep testing your baseline hypothesis to weed out inaccurate assumptions.</p>
<p>Getting crystal clear here will set you up with the proper launchpad. No shortcuts.</p>
<h3>Here’s how to get started:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Develop an <a href="https://about.crunchbase.com/blog/what-is-an-ideal-customer-profile-and-how-do-you-create-one/">ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)</a> framework.</li>
<li>Identify three target customers that fit your defined ICP.</li>
<li>Write a problem statement for each identified target customer.</li>
<li>Prioritize the problem statement that resonates with your product the most.</li>
<li>Lock on the target customer of the prioritized problem statement.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Practice use case:</h3>
<p>You are the co-founder at an upcoming SaaS startup focused on simplifying the shopping experience in car showrooms so buyers enjoy the process. What would your ICP look like?</p>
<h2>2. Develop the SWOT</h2>
<p>The SWOT framework cannot be overrated. This is a great structure to articulate who your competitors are and how you show up against them. Note that your competitors can be direct or indirect (as an alternative), and it’s important to categorize these buckets correctly.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Unlike a weak phone signal solely causing a grainy sound, in growth marketing, it can mean the difference between a successful program or a massive cash bleed. As we move toward an increasingly privacy-centric world, it is even more necessary for companies to nail down signal early on.</p>
<p>So what exactly is “signal” in growth marketing? It can carry many different meanings, but holistically speaking, it’s the event data in our arsenal to help guide decisions. When it comes to paid acquisition, it’s vital to optimize and pass back the correct event data to paid channels. This is so that targeting and bidding algorithms have the most enriched data to utilize.</p>
<p>I’ve seen startups spend thousands of dollars inefficiently as a result of not having optimal signal in their paid acquisition campaigns. I’ve also spent millions at companies such as Postmates refining our signal to the best possible state. I’d like every startup to avoid the painful mistake of not having this set up correctly, instead making the most of every important ad dollar.</p>
<h2>The selection</h2>
<p>When starting out, it may seem obvious to optimize toward a north-star metric such as a purchase. If spend is very minimal, that could mean that the conversion volume will be low across campaigns. On the flip side, if the optimization event is set at a top-of-funnel event such as a landing page view, the signal strength may be very weak. The reason that the strength may be weak is due to passing back a low-intent event as successful to the paid channels. By marking a landing page view as successful, paid channels such as Facebook will continue to find users that are similar to these lower-propensity users that are converting.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example of a health-and-wellness app with a goal of driving memberships to their coaching program. They’re just starting out with exploring paid acquisition and spending $5,000 per week on Facebook. Below is a look at their events in the funnel, weekly volume and cost per event:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202596" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202596" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2202596 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM-1.png 1154w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM-1.png?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM-1.png?resize=300,118 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM-1.png?resize=768,301 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM-1.png?resize=680,266 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM-1.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202596" class="wp-caption-text">Example of a health-and-wellness app and their weekly conversion volume at $5,000 spend. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jonathan Martinez</p></div></p>
<p>In the above example, we can see that there’s significant volume for landing page views. As we go down the <em>simplified</em> flow, there is less volume as users drop off the funnel. Almost everyone’s instinct would be to optimize for either the landing page view, because there’s so much data, or the subscription event, because it’s the strongest. I would argue (after extensive testing across multiple ad accounts) that neither of these events would be the correct pick. With landing page views as an optimization event, the users have an egregiously low propensity since the landing page view to subscription conversion rate is 0.61%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The correct event to optimize for here would either be sign up or trial start because they have sufficient enough volume and are strong signals of a user converting to the north-star metric (subscription). Looking at the conversion rate between sign up and subscription, it’s a much healthier 10.21%, versus the 0.61% from landing page view.</p>
<p>I’m always a huge proponent of testing all events, as there can definitely be big surprises in what may work best for you. When testing events, make sure that there’s a stat-sig baseline that’s being followed to make decisions. Additionally, I think it’s a great practice to test events regularly early on because conversion rates can change as other channel variables are adjusted.</p>
<h2>Flow adjustments</h2>
<p>In certain cases, the current events that are set up aren’t optimal for paid acquisition campaigns. I’ve seen this happen frequently with startups that have long windows of time between conversion events. Take a startup such as Thumbtack, which provides a marketplace of providers who can help with home repairs. After someone signs up to their app, the user may place a request but not hire someone until a few weeks later. In this case, making flow adjustments could potentially improve the signal and data that you collect from users.</p>
<p>A solution that Thumbtack could implement to gather a stronger signal would be to add another step between the request being placed and hiring someone. This could potentially be a survey with propensity check questions that could ask how soon the user needs help or how important their project is from a 1–10.</p>

<p>After accumulating the data, if there’s a high correlation between survey answers and someone starting their project, we can start to explore optimizing for that event.</p>
<p>In the above example, we see that users who responded with “9” have a 7.66% likelihood to convert. Therefore, this should be the event we optimize for. Artificially adding steps that qualify users in a longer flow can help steer optimization targeting in the right direction.</p>
<h2>Enhancing signal</h2>
<p>Let’s imagine that you have the most ideal flow that captures large volumes of event signal without much of a delay to your optimization event. That’s still far from perfect. There are myriad solutions that can be implemented to further enhance the signal.</p>
<p>For Facebook specifically, there are connections such as<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2020/conversion-api-capi-overview/"> CAPI</a> that can be integrated to pass back data in a more accurate way. CAPI is a method of passing back web events server-to-server rather than relying on cookies and the Facebook pixel. This helps mitigate browsers that block cookies or users who may delete their web history. This is just one example. I won’t run through all the channels, but each has its own solution to help enhance event signal being passed back to it.</p>
<h2>iOS 14 signal</h2>
<p>This wouldn’t be a column written in 2021 without mention of iOS 14 and the strategies that can be leveraged for this growing user segment. I’ve written another <a href="https://jmstrategy.substack.com/p/impactful-strategies-amid-ios14">piece</a> about iOS-14-specific tactics, but I’ll cover it here on a broad level. If the north-star metric (i.e., purchase) event can be triggered within 24 hours of the initial app launch, then that’s golden.</p>
<p>This would bring large volumes of high-intent data that would not be at the mercy of the SKAD 24-hour event timer. For most companies, this may sound like a lofty goal, so the target should be to have an event fire within 24 hours that is a high-likelihood indicator of someone completing your north-star metric. Think of which events happen in the flow that lead to someone eventually purchasing. Maybe someone adding a payment method happens within 24 hours and historically has a 90% conversion rate to someone purchasing. An “add payment info” event would be a great conversion event to use in this case. The landscape of iOS 14 is constantly changing but this should apply for the immediate future.</p>
<h2>Incrementality and staying ahead</h2>
<p>As a rule of thumb, incrementality checks should constantly be performed in growth marketing. It gives an important read on whether advertising dollars are bringing in users that wouldn’t have converted had they not seen an ad.</p>
<p>When comparing optimization events, this rule still applies. Make sure that costs per action aren’t the only metric that’s being used as a measure of success, but instead, use the incremental lift on each conversion event as the ultimate key performance indicator. <a href="https://jmstrategy.substack.com/p/easy-incrementality-testing">In this piece,</a> I detail how to run lean incrementality tests without swarms of data scientists.</p>
<p>So how do you stay ahead and continue moving the needle on your growth marketing campaigns? First and foremost, constantly question the events you’re optimizing for. And second, leave no stone unturned.</p>
<p>If you’re using the same optimization event forever, it will be a disservice to your campaign performance potential. By experimenting with flow changes and running tests on new events, you’ll be way ahead of the curve. When iterating on the flow, think about user behavior and events from the user’s perspective. Which flow events, if added, would correlate to a high propensity conversion segment?</p>
