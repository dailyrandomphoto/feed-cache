<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for September 1, 2021. It’s a big day in TechCrunch history in that we’ve been shuffled to a new parent company. More on that in a moment. First, Disrupt attendees, you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/fire-up-crunchmatch-today-and-start-networking-with-techcrunch-disrupt-2021-attendees/">now hit up CrunchMatch to meet other cool folks</a>.

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apollo-completes-its-5b-acquisition-of-verizon-media-now-known-as-yahoo/">Hello, Apollo!</a> </strong>TechCrunch is no longer part of Verizon Media Group, a somewhat forgotten subsidiary of the U.S. telco. Instead, we are now part of Yahoo, which is owned, in turn, by Apollo, a large investing company that is publicly traded. Cue the parade. Jokes aside, the long-announced deal has finally been completed. We’ll have more notes on our new overlords as soon as we meet them.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/what-amplitudes-choice-to-direct-list-says-about-its-products-growth-and-value/">Inside Amplitude’s IPO filing:</a></strong> TechCrunch’s coverage of the accelerating IPO market continued today with notes on Amplitude’s product-analytics-focused debut. For more on Toast and Freshworks’ filings, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">head</a></strong> here or <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/inside-freshworks-ipo-filing-as-the/">here</a></strong>. Oh, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">and Warby Parker here</a></strong>, if D2C is your jam.</li>
<li>Sticking to the big-dollar news today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/vista-equity-takes-majority-stake-in-saas-startup-drift-taking-it-to-unicorn-status/"><strong>Vista Equity is buying a majority stake in Drift</strong></a>. Based in Boston, Drift focuses on what it calls “conversational” sales tools. The two parties were being coy to a silly level by not disclosing the price paid for Drift, other than that the majority sale of the company values the former startup at more than $1 billion. Why Drift sold to Vista instead of going public is not clear, but we do feel cheated out of its S-1 filing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>As we write to you today, the TechCrunch team is busy writing thousands of words about the second day of startup pitches from Y Combinator’s Demo Day. You can read about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">every startup that pitched yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>Now, to today’s news. First, Berlin Brands, which buys and hopes to scale brands that sell on Amazon, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/berlin-brands-group-now-valued-at-1b-raises-700m-to-buy-and-scale-merchants-that-sell-on-marketplaces-like-amazon/">now worth north of $1 billion</a> after raising a $700 million equity-and-debt round. There is apparently infinite capital available to finance the purchase of smaller e-commerce brands.</p>
<p>So much so that Forum Brands <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/berlin-brands-group-now-valued-at-1b-raises-700m-to-buy-and-scale-merchants-that-sell-on-marketplaces-like-amazon/"><em>also</em> announced new capital for the activity today</a>. Its $100 million in debt financing may sound small compared to what Berlin Brands just secured, but it’s still nine figures of dry powder.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/blueprint-raises-16m-series-b-to-grow-its-title-focused-insurtech-business/"><strong>Blueprint raises $16M to scale its title insurance business:</strong></a> It turns out that the title insurance business in the United States is too valuable. Blueprint wants to reduce its size by offering lower-priced coverage to customers who buy multiple properties in several states.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/insurify-a-virtual-insurance-agent-raises-100m-series-b/"><strong>Insurify raises $100M as insurtech marketplaces stay hot:</strong></a> Sure, neoinsurance providers have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/why-have-the-markets-spurned-public-neoinsurance-startups/">taken a bath in the public markets lately</a>, but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/02/why-vcs-are-dumping-money-into-insurance-marketplaces/">insurtech <em>marketplace</em> game</a> still looks healthy. Insurify, which competes with Zebra and other players, is now $100 million richer.  An indicator, we presume, that it is still finding plenty of market to attack.</li>
<li>If you want more on the insurtech venture capital market, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/">TechCrunch has your back</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/skit-raises-23m-series-b-round-led-by-westbridge-capital-to-accelerate-its-growth/"><strong>Call center automation is big business:</strong></a> At least for Skit, a startup that just closed a $23 million Series B. Per our own Kate Park, Skit’s tech helps its customers automate nearly all of their voice support calls.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/humane-a-stealthy-hardware-and-software-startup-co-founded-by-an-ex-apple-designer-and-engineer-raises-100m/"><strong>Company we know little about raises lots of money:</strong></a> Have you heard of Humane? Probably not. Born from some ex-Apple folks, the startup &#8212; “which has ambitions to build a new class of consumer devices and technologies,” TechCrunch reports &#8212; has no products in the market. And yet it has raised $100 million this week after raising $30 million last year. What will it build? I guess we’ll find out.</li>

		Mark McClain is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.sailpoint.com/">SailPoint</a>, the leader in cloud enterprise security. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">You&#8217;ve heard the phrase &#8220;leading by example,&#8221; but what about &#8220;leading with values&#8221;?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always led by example by using my values as my guide. Still, it wasn’t until I founded my first company that I fully understood the importance of embedding those values into the company, too.</p>
<p>Integrity, individuals, impact and innovation are the &#8220;<a href="https://www.sailpoint.com/company/#:~:text=SailPoint's%20success%20is%20directly%20tied,Integrity%2C%20Impact%2C%20and%20Individuals.">4 I values</a>&#8221; that drive my decisions and the actions of those at my company each day. These are not just words on a wall at our HQ or on a mousepad for our remote crew, but values that everyone in the company lives and breathes. Over the last two years, these four values became even more important and continued to guide me, my family and the leaders at our company.</p>
<p>As organizations map out their &#8220;return to the workplace&#8221; (NOT &#8220;return to work,&#8221; because we never stopped working) plans, we should not simply go back to how things were before. Instead, let’s all take a moment to redesign something that sets everyone up for success, with values as the compass. I think you’ll find this approach helps people not only survive, but thrive in the workplace.</p>
<p>Leading with values is, in my experience, the best leadership position to take, and there are three ways to accomplish this goal.</p>
<h2>Leave behind old-school mentalities on workplace hierarchy</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The tone of the company&#8217;s culture comes from the top. The culture you envision for your company will only come about if your employees believe in the practices that you are asking them to implement.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>At some point in your career — probably right out of school, a few years in or somewhere in the middle — you experienced a company where treating lower-level employees with less respect is just &#8220;a part of the job.&#8221; Companies with this type of &#8220;paying your dues&#8221; mentality tend to work these lower-level employees like grunts until they burn out and leave.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Or they eventually crawl their way up into management-level positions, and the cycle perpetuates itself as they deride the newer crop of employees, eroding any semblance of a healthy culture.</p>
<p>This is not the way.</p>
<p>As a leader, if you want your work environment to indicate inclusivity, support, collaboration and have the essence of a team mentality, <em>you</em> must set the precedent right away. This means stripping away the hierarchy that accompanies work titles and making it clear that your company values contribution based on merit, regardless of position. You are one team, united in your purpose to deliver on your mission, based on your values. This level setting ensures that everyone has skin in the game, and no one has the leeway to treat people poorly.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t get caught in an ivory tower mindset</h2>
<p>Early on in my career, I began sharing an office when I could. Those office spaces were purposely not what anyone would consider cool or nice “digs&#8221; — not the furniture and certainly not the view. Even as CEO now, I’ve had someone on the team describe my current office as a closet. But it gets the job done.</p>
<p>Simple signals like this send a powerful message, and the signal must remain consistent. Don&#8217;t take a limo; rent a cheap car. Don&#8217;t fly first class; fly coach. These may seem like minor details, but one of the biggest pitfalls any CEO can encounter is falling victim to an ivory tower mindset — when you become so out of touch with the people you manage, your employees start to notice.</p>
<p>Make a cognizant effort to know your people. Implement a &#8220;management by walking around&#8221; strategy. Don&#8217;t sit in your office all day; get out on the floor among your people. Drop by their desks and ask them how their day is going. Eat lunch in the break room. Put in the effort to attend new hire onboarding.</p>
<p>Not physically back in the office? Drop into Slack channels and Zoom meetings. I once &#8220;Zoom bombed&#8221; a baby shower for one of our crew members just to hear all the well wishes, and it made my day and theirs. Overall, just be present and humanize your workspace. It pays off in spades.</p>
<h2>Be thoughtful and consistent with workplace practices</h2>
<p>The tone of the company&#8217;s culture comes from the top. The culture you envision for your company will only come about if your employees believe in the practices that you are asking them to implement. More importantly, you will not grow a solid culture if you don’t give these initiatives and practices 100% of your own effort.</p>
<p>For example, one new initiative we rolled out last year is a campaign we call &#8220;<a href="https://www.sailpoint.com/blog/rethinking-work-in-identity/">Free2Focus</a>.&#8221; Twice a week, the SailPoint crew is asked to avoid booking meetings for a couple of hours during Free2Focus time. Not only does this address Zoom fatigue, it also gives our crew the chance to catch their breath whichever way suits them best — whether that&#8217;s taking a walk, helping with their children&#8217;s schooling or just turning off the camera for a bit.</p>
<p>If I want my team to show themselves some grace during the week, I&#8217;ve found that I need to apply the same practice. This means not setting up meetings during Free2Focus, not sending emails all hours of the day and night and not judging people for taking breaks when they need them. I trust my team to get the job done largely on their own time and own their own terms. I promise, your employees’ performance will be better because of it.</p>
<p>Being a CEO is more than building on a vision, a product or an idea. It&#8217;s about leading your people with values to accomplish mutual goals in a way that doesn&#8217;t zap them of their morale or dignity. It&#8217;s easy to get caught up in all the things that come with a job, but if you don&#8217;t put in the effort to immerse yourself and your values into the entire company, you&#8217;ll end up too big for your own good — and certainly too big for your company&#8217;s good.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t happen overnight, but remember, the smallest things are often the ones that have the biggest impact. If you’re the leader, lead by example. It’s the only way to build teams that stand the test of time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Does this sound familiar? An app goes viral on social media, often including TikTok, then immediately climbs to the top of the App Store where it gains even more new installs thanks to the heightened exposure. That&#8217;s what happened with the recent No. 1 on the U.S. App Store, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fontmaker-font-keyboard-app/id1573791613">Fontmaker</a>, a subscription-based fonts app which appeared to benefit from word-of-mouth growth thanks to TikTok videos and other social posts. But what we&#8217;re actually seeing here is a new form of App Store marketing &#8212; and one which now involves one of the oldest players in the space: <a href="https://vungle.com/">Vungle</a>.</p>
<p>Fontmaker, at first glance, seems to be just another indie app that hit it big.</p>
<p>The app, published by an entity called Mango Labs, promises users a way to create fonts using their own handwriting which they can then access from a custom keyboard for a fairly steep price of $4.99 per week. The app first launched on July 26. Nearly a month later, it was the No. 2 app on the U.S. App Store, according to Sensor Tower data. By August 26, it climbed up one more position to reach No. 1. before slowly dropping down in the top overall free app rankings in the days that followed.</p>
<p>By Aug. 27, it was No. 15, before briefly surging again to No. 4 the following day, then declining once more. Today, the app is No. 54 overall and No. 4 in the competitive Photo &amp; Video category &#8212; still, a solid position for a brand-new and somewhat niche product targeting mainly younger users. To date, it&#8217;s generated $68,000 in revenue, Sensor Tower reports.</p>
<p>But Fontmaker may not be a true organic success story, despite its Top Charts success driven by a boost in downloads coming from real users, not bots. Instead, it&#8217;s an example of how mobile marketers have figured out how to tap into the influencer community to drive app installs. It&#8217;s also an example of how it&#8217;s hard to differentiate between apps driven by influencer marketing and those that hit the top of the App Store because of true demand &#8212; like walkie-talkie app Zello, whose recent trip to No. 1 can be attributed to Hurricane Ida.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Fontmaker is not your typical &#8220;indie app.&#8221; In fact, it&#8217;s unclear who&#8217;s really behind it. Its publisher, Mango Labs, LLC, is actually an iTunes developer account owned by the mobile growth company <a href="https://jetfuel.it/">JetFuel</a>, which was <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/06/15/vungle-agrees-to-buy-influencer-marketing-platform-jetfuel/">recently acquired</a> by the mobile ad and monetization firm Vungle &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/15/vungle-series-a/">longtime</a> and sometimes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/12/zain-jaffer-sues-vungle/">controversial</a> player in this space, itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/15/blackstone-is-acquiring-mobile-ad-company-vungle/">acquired</a> by Blackstone in 2019.</p>
<p>Vungle was<a href="https://www.plugco.in/vungle-announcement"> primarily interested in</a> JetFuel&#8217;s main product, an app called <a href="https://www.plugco.in/">The Plug</a>, aimed at influencers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Through The Plug, mobile app developers and advertisers can connect to JetFuel&#8217;s network of over 15,000 verified influencers who have a combined 4 billion Instagram followers, 1.5 billion TikTok followers, and 100 million daily Snapchat views.</p>
<p>While marketers could use the built-in advertising tools on each of these networks to try to reach their target audience, JetFuel&#8217;s technology allows marketers to quickly scale their campaigns to reach high-value users in the Gen Z demographic, the company claims. This system can be less labor-intensive than traditional influencer marketing, in some cases. Advertisers pay on a cost-per-action (CPA) basis for app installs. Meanwhile, all influencers have to do is scroll through The Plug to find an app to promote, then post it to their social accounts to start making money.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197102" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197102" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2197102" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.37.49-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="368" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.37.49-PM.jpg 2930w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.37.49-PM.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.37.49-PM.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.37.49-PM.jpg?resize=768,416 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.37.49-PM.jpg?resize=680,368 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.37.49-PM.jpg?resize=1536,831 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.37.49-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1109 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.37.49-PM.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197102" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Plug&#8217;s website, showing influencers how the platform works</p></div></p>
<p>So while yes, a lot of influencers may have made TikTok videos about Fontmaker, which prompted consumers to download the app, the influencers were paid to do so. (And often, from what we saw browsing the Fontmaker hashtag, without disclosing that financial relationship in any way &#8212; an increasingly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-called-out-for-lack-of-ads-transparency-and-for-failing-to-police-political-payola/">common</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2020/06/11/tiktoks-format-offers-a-loophole-for-branded-content-disclosures/?sh=64260d421afa">problem</a> on TikTok, and area of concern for the FTC.)</p>
<p>Where things get tricky is in trying to sort out Mango Labs&#8217; relationship with JetFuel/Vungle. As a consumer browsing the App Store, it looks like Mango Labs makes a lot of fun consumer apps of which Fontmaker is simply the latest.</p>
<p>JetFuel&#8217;s website helps to promote this image, too.</p>
<p>It had showcased its influencer marketing system using a case study from an &#8220;indie developer&#8221; called Mango Labs and one of its earlier apps, Caption Pro. Caption Pro launched in Jan. 2018. (App Annie data indicates it was removed from the App Store on Aug. 31, 2021&#8230;yes, yesterday).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197070" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197070" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2197070" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-12.48.24-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="213" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-12.48.24-PM.jpg 3176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-12.48.24-PM.jpg?resize=150,47 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-12.48.24-PM.jpg?resize=300,94 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-12.48.24-PM.jpg?resize=768,241 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-12.48.24-PM.jpg?resize=680,213 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-12.48.24-PM.jpg?resize=1536,482 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-12.48.24-PM.jpg?resize=2048,642 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-12.48.24-PM.jpg?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197070" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>Vungle, however, told TechCrunch &#8220;The Caption Pro app no longer exists and has not been live on the App Store or Google Play for a long time.&#8221; (We can&#8217;t find an App Annie record of the app on Google Play).</p>
<p>They also told us that &#8220;Caption Pro was developed by Mango Labs before the entity became JetFuel,&#8221; and that the case study was used to highlight JetFuel&#8217;s advertising capabilities. (But without clearly disclosing their connection.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Prior to JetFuel becoming the influencer marketing platform that it is today, the company developed apps for the App Store. After the company pivoted to become a marketing platform, in February 2018, it stopped creating apps but continued to use the Mango Labs account on occasion to publish apps that it had third-party monetization partnerships with,&#8221; the Vungle spokesperson explained.</p>
<p>In other words, the claim being made here is that while Mango Labs, originally, were the same folks who have long since pivoted to become JetFuel, and the makers of Caption Pro, all the newer apps published under &#8220;Mango Labs, LLC&#8221; were not created by JetFuel&#8217;s team itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any apps that appear under the Mango Labs LLC name on the App Store or Google Play were in fact developed by other companies, and Mango Labs has only acted as a publisher,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>There are reasons why this statement doesn&#8217;t quite sit right &#8212; and not only because JetFuel&#8217;s partners seem happy to hide themselves behind Mango Labs&#8217; name, nor because Mango Labs was a project from the JetFuel team in the past. It&#8217;s also odd that Mango Labs and another entity, <a href="https://www.takeoff-labs.com/">Takeoff Labs</a>, claim the same set of apps. And like Mango Labs, Takeoff Labs is associated with JetFuel too.</p>
<p>Breaking this down, as of the time of writing, Mango Labs has published several consumer apps on both the App Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>On iOS, this includes the recent No. 1 app Fontmaker, as well as FontKey, Color Meme, Litstick, Vibe, Celebs, FITme Fitness, CopyPaste, and Part 2. On Google Play, it has two more: Stickered and Mango.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197196" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197196" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2197196" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-3.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-3.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-3.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-3.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-3.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-3.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-3.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-3.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-3.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197196" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mango Labs</p></div></p>
<p>Most of Mango Labs&#8217; App Store listings point to JetFuel&#8217;s website as the app&#8217;s &#8220;developer website,&#8221; which would be in line with what Vungle says about JetFuel acting as the apps&#8217; publisher.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s odd, however, is that the Mango Labs&#8217; app Part2, links to Takeoff Labs&#8217; website from its App Store listing.</p>
<p>The Vungle spokesperson initially told us that Takeoff Labs is &#8220;an independent app developer.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet, the Takeoff Labs&#8217; website shows a team which consists of JetFuel&#8217;s <a href="https://jetfuel.it/team">leadership</a>, including JetFuel co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-lenardo-2b220579/">Tim Lenardo</a> and JetFuel co-founder and CRO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jj-maxwell-753b5026/">JJ Maxwell</a>. Takeoff Labs&#8217; <a href="https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=201935710103-27397565">LLC application</a> was also signed by Lenardo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Takeoff Labs&#8217; co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhai/">Rhai Goburdhun</a>, per his LinkedIn and the Takeoff Labs website, still works there. Asked about this connection, Vungle told us they did not realize the website had not been updated, and neither JetFuel nor Vungle have an ownership stake in Takeoff Labs with this acquisition.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.takeoff-labs.com/#Case-Studies">Takeoff Labs&#8217; website</a> also shows off its &#8220;portfolio&#8221; of apps, which includes Celeb, Litstick, and FontKey &#8212; three apps that are published by Mango Labs on the App Store.</p>
<p>On Google Play, Takeoff Labs is the developer credited with Celebs, as well as two other apps, Vibe and Teal, a neobank. But on the App Store, Vibe is published by Mango Labs.</p>

<p>(Not to complicate things further, but there&#8217;s also an entity called <a href="https://reallabs.io/work/">RealLabs</a> which hosts JetFuel, The Plug and other consumer apps, including Mango &#8212; the app published by Mango Labs on Google Play. Someone sure likes naming things &#8220;Labs!&#8221;)</p>
<p>Vungle claims the confusion here has to do with how it now uses the Mango Labs iTunes account to publish apps for its partners, which is a &#8220;common practice&#8221; on the App Store. It says it intends to transfer the apps published under Mango Labs to the developers&#8217; accounts, because it agrees this is confusing.</p>
<p>Vungle also claims that JetFuel &#8220;does not make nor own any consumer apps that are currently live on the app stores. Any of the apps made by the entity when it was known as Mango Labs have long since been taken down from the app stores.&#8221;</p>
<p>JetFuel&#8217;s system is messy and confusing, but so far successful in its goals. Fontmaker did make it to No. 1, essentially growth hacked to the top by influencer marketing.</p>

<p>Fontmaker isn&#8217;t the first to growth hack its way to the top through influencer promotions.

But Poparazzi has since sunk to No. 89 in Photo &amp; Video, which shows influence can only take you so far.</p>
<p>As for Fontmaker, paid influence got it to No. 1, but its Top Chart moment was brief.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.brightcellars.com">Bright Cellars</a>, a six-year-old subscription-based wine seller has, like many upstarts, evolved over time. While it once sent its club members third-party wines that fit their particular profiles, Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Bright Cellars says it&#8217;s now amassing enough data about its customers through its &#8220;palate&#8221; quizzes that it no longer sells wines made by other brands. Instead, while some of its &#8220;original&#8221; offerings are admittedly sold by other labels under different names, it is increasingly finding success by directing its winemaker partners to tweak the recipe, so to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re optimizing wine like you might optimize a more digital product,&#8221; says co-founder and CEO, Richard Yau, a San Francisco native whose startup entered into a regional accelerator program early on and stayed, though the company is now largely decentralized.</p>
<p>We talked earlier today with Yau about that shift, which investors are supporting with $11.2 million in Series B funding, led by Cleveland Avenue, with participation from earlier backers Revolution Ventures and Northwestern Mutual. (The company has now raised roughly $20 million altogether).</p>
<p>Yau also talked about industry trends that he&#8217;s seeing because of all that data collection.</p>

<p><strong>TC: You say you&#8217;re building a portfolio of wines. What does that mean?</strong></p>
<p>RY: We don&#8217;t own any land. We&#8217;re working primarily with suppliers [as do big companies like Gallo and Constellation], but at a larger scale than before, so we now get to shape what wines taste like and look like, and we can optimize across variables like how sweet should this wine be? How acidic? What do we want its color and brand and label to look like and which segment of our customers will really enjoy this wine the most?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: What is one of your concoctions?</strong></p>
<p>RY: We have a sparkling wine that’s produced in the Champagne method — not a Champagne wine; it&#8217;s a domestic wine &#8212; using grape varietals that no one uses for sparkling wine, and it’s one of the top-rated wines on our platform. Sparkling wine has been really good for us.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How many subscribers do you have?</strong></p>
<p>RY: We can’t share that, but we saw an acceleration in not just new subscribers throughout the pandemic but also in terms of seeing a larger share of [customers&#8217;] wallets going to D2C, and that impacted us pretty positively. Even as things eased up over the summer, we saw that people were cooking and eating at home more [and drinking wine].</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s the average price of a bottle of wine on the platform?</strong></p>
<p>RY: $20 to $25.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Where are your grape suppliers?</strong></p>
<p>RY: A lot are on the West Coast, in Washington and California, but we also have grape suppliers internationally, including in South America and Europe.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How many wines do you offer, and how long do you trial a wine?</strong></p>
<p>RY: We&#8217;ve tested around 600, and at any given time, we&#8217;ll have 40 to 50 wines on the platform. We don’t stock everything forever; those that don’t do as well, we basically eliminate.</p>
<p><strong>TC: A lot of D2C brands eventually branch into real-world locations. You aren&#8217;t doing that. Why not?</strong></p>
<p>RY: It&#8217;s possible that we might at some point, but we like being D2C and it makes a lot of sense in a world where our members now work from home and are home to receive packages. It lines up with e-commerce trends in general. If you’re not buying your groceries at the store anymore, you aren’t buying wines at the store, either.</p>
<p><strong>TC: From where are these bottles shipped?</strong></p>
<p>RY: From a variety of places, but primarily from Santa Rosa [in the Bay Area].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Have you seen the impact the weather is having on California winemakers, some of whom are now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/18/climate/napa-wine-heat-hot-weather.html">spraying sunscreen</a> on their grapes to protect them?</strong></p>
<p>RY: [Climate change] has certainly affected the wine industry. One of the fortunate things about us is we have flexibility in the suppliers we’re working with, so from a business-health perspective, we haven’t been as affected by that. Because a lot of our operations are in California, we did a couple of years ago have some interruptions with distribution where we weren&#8217;t able to ship some days; we were also impacted by warm temperatures. But fortunately, so far for this year, we haven’t had any operational or supply-chain disruptions.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Have you been approached by one of legacy firms about a partnership or acquisition?</strong></p>
<p>RY: We’ve had conversations, more in terms of partnerships because we have lots of data and can help them. For example, we can launch a new wine and get feedback almost like a focus group to figure out who likes what. We can split test two different blends for a wine and figure out which does better. That’s where conversations with legacy wine companies have happened.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So they&#8217;d pay you for your data.</strong></p>
<p>RY: We&#8217;re not opposed to selling data in the future, but we’ve approached it more like, here’s an opportunity to learn about how innovation works at a larger wine company. We don&#8217;t expect to be able to do what Constellation does well &#8212; with its large salesforce and distributors in every state &#8212; but what we can do in a complementary way is understand the consumer.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What have you learned that might surprise outsiders?</strong></p>
<p>RY: Petite sirah [offerings] do as well, if not better than, cabernet and pinot noir on the platform. Cab and pinot are fully 50 times the market size of petite sirah, but we see that our members really like it.</p>
<p>People also like merlot a lot more than they think &#8212; pretty much across all demographics. People like to hate merlot, but when we look at red blends that do well . . .</p>
<p><strong>TC: What do people have against merlot?</strong></p>
<p>RY: [Laughs.] Have you ever seen &#8220;Sideways?&#8221; That has something to do with it, still. Meanwhile, pinot noir remains popular, but people don&#8217;t like it as much as [other wine sellers] think.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peter Beck hasn’t been shy about his intention to grow Rocket Lab into more than just a launch provider, but a fully vertically integrated space company that makes spacecraft in addition to sending them to orbit. The company, which he founded in 2006, has taken yet another major stride toward that goal with the news Wednesday that it will open a new production facility to manufacture satellite components at a larger scale than ever before.</p>
<p>The facility will manufacture reaction wheels, critical attitude and stability control systems on satellites. Rocket Lab says the facility, which will be operational in the fourth quarter of this year, will be capable of producing up to 2,000 reaction wheels annually. Given that spacecraft generally have between three and four reaction wheels, it’s safe to assume that Rocket Lab customers likely have around 500 individual satellites ready in the pipeline to accept these components. “These are large volumes of supply across multiple constellations,” Rocket Lab CEO Beck said in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The news is a marked expansion for Rocket Lab’s space systems business, which is already kept busy by the in-house Photon spacecraft and was boosted last year when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/rocket-lab-to-acquire-satellite-hardware-maker-sinclair-interplanetary/">the company acquired</a> major satellite hardware manufacturer Sinclair Interplanetary. Rocket Lab also offers bespoke Photons for individual use cases &#8212; it will be designing the vehicles for forthcoming launches with space manufacturing startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/space-manufacturing-startup-varda-inks-deal-with-rocket-lab-for-three-spacecraft/">Varda Space Industries</a> and two Photons that will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/rocket-labs-mars-mission-gets-green-light-from-nasa/">sent to Mars</a> on an upcoming science mission.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vzYkliltnV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/rocket-labs-mars-mission-gets-green-light-from-nasa/">Rocket Lab&#8217;s Mars mission gets green light from NASA</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rocket Lab&#8217;s Mars mission gets green light from NASA&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/rocket-labs-mars-mission-gets-green-light-from-nasa/embed/#?secret=vzYkliltnV" data-secret="vzYkliltnV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Historically, spacecraft components have generally been produced on the scale of tens or hundreds, because the barriers to get to orbit were so high. But as the cost of launch has declined (thanks in part to innovations from companies like Rocket Lab) more and more entities are able to send projects to space. That means more satellites, and more reaction wheels. Even today, there are around 200 Rocket Lab-made reaction wheels in orbit, so 2,000 in a single year is a huge jump in scale.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all part of Rocket Lab&#8217;s goal of being a fully integrated space services company. A major benefit from the vertical integration for customers, Rocket Lab says, is slashed manufacturing lead times. Beck said that when the company first started producing Photons, they quickly encountered months-long delivery times for reaction wheels, which effectively pushed back their timeline for launching one to orbit.</p>
<p>“If the space economy is to grow in the way that it&#8217;s predicted, then this has to be solved,” he said. “This is a fundamental problem that has to be solved. The whole space supply chain is characterized by small-scale operations that really lack the ability to produce volume in any scale.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rocket Lab will be hiring more than 16 roles to support the space systems division and the new production facility, which will otherwise be highly automated; the company said in a statement that the production tools and environmental testing workstations will all be automated, and the metal machining is optimized to operate unattended. Beck said these techniques are very much in line with Rocket Lab’s other manufacturing processes &#8212; he pointed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/rocket-labs-new-rosie-the-robot-speeds-up-launch-vehicle-production-by-a-lot/">Rosie the Robot</a> as a cornerstone of the company’s capacity to use automation to rapidly scale its products.</p>
<p>Beck stayed mum about whether the company is planning on scaling the production of other spacecraft components, like the star trackers navigation tool, which Rocket Lab also manufacturers. However, he did say that the company plans on introducing new products &#8212; what those will be, he declined to specify. But Beck’s stated aim when he started the space systems division is that “everything that goes to space should have a Rocket Lab logo on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That aim goes to Rocket Lab’s larger vision, which is becoming an end-to-end space company: combining launch services with spacecraft manufacturing to be able to build in-orbit infrastructure.</p>
<p>“When you combine those things together, you have an immensely powerful platform that you can use to develop infrastructure in orbit and ultimately provide services,” he said.</p>
<p>But when asked what kinds of services he was thinking of, Beck played it close to the chest, instead choosing to give a well-known example from a competitor: SpaceX’s Starlink internet satellite project, which it builds and launches itself. He stayed mum on what kinds of ventures Rocket Lab might pursue, just saying that the vertical integration gives the company the ability to try new business models.</p>
<p>“The marginal cost for us to experiment is very, very low.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few people thought of virtual events before the pandemic struck, but this format has fulfilled a unique and important need for companies and organizations large and small during the pandemic. But what will virtual events&#8217; value be as more of the world attempts to return to life before COVID-19?</p>
<p>To find out, we caught up with top executives and investors in the sector to learn about the big trends they’re seeing — as the sequel to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-remote-events/">this survey we did in March 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Certain use cases have been proven, they say. Today, you can find numerous small niche events available year-round that might have been buried in the back of a larger in-person conference before 2020. For organizations, internal virtual events can also be instrumental in helping connect and promote engagement for remote-first teams.</p>
<p>However, some respondents acknowledged that low-quality virtual events are growing ever more common, and everyone agreed that there is much more work to be done.</p>
<p><strong>We surveyed:</strong></p>

<p><strong>With the pandemic hopefully becoming more manageable soon, do you feel a return to in-person events is inevitable?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Certain types of events will go back to in person. Obviously, something to do with a President&#8217;s Club — the company rewards you with a party in Hawaii — that kind of thing will not go virtual. I think events more focused on increasing reach will continue to trend toward virtual.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;Hybrid is just another buzzword to say that both online and offline events formats will coexist. Of course they will.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We’re also seeing that many events are getting smaller, more niche. Before the pandemic, if we look at a general pediatric conference, for example, an attendee may only be interested in two topics out of the 200 offered. But now we’ve seen that there&#8217;s a rise in many niche events that focus on very specific topics, which helps streamline these events for attendees.</p>
<p>I think such events are still going to happen virtually just because they&#8217;re easier to organize and people can have more in-depth conversations. Internal virtual events for employees is another category that is getting more traction, because companies have been going remote. So many the internal events like the company happy hour — events that help employees engage better — we think that&#8217;s still going to happen virtually. So there are a number of use cases we think will continue to be virtual and are probably better virtual.</p>

<p><strong>What sort of trends do you think will emerge once in-person events are possible again?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Another important trend we&#8217;re seeing is that a lot of organizers have begun hosting events more frequently. They were doing large conferences in the past, but now they&#8217;re pivoting or they&#8217;re rethinking their strategy. They realize that hosting maybe 10 events a year is better than hosting one big event every year. A traditional conference is usually multiday, with maybe 200 different topics and 100 different speakers. Now a lot of people are thinking about spreading it out throughout the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new video from Agility Robotics showcases an increasing familiar sight: advanced, autonomous robots performing boring warehouse tasks. It’s not the sort of video that tends to be hugely viral for a company, rather, it’s the sort of meat and potatoes proof of concept that companies like Boston Dynamics wedge between flashy videos of parkour and highly choreographed dance sessions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, this is precisely the sort of tasks the robots’ creators are targeting: the well-known trio of dull, dirty and dangerous. Moving payloads back and forth certainly ticks that first box pretty well. There’s a reason warehouse and fulfillment workers often liken their work to robotics.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jycdks836bY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>“The conversation around automation has shifted a bit,” Agility CEO Damion Shelton tells TechCrunch. “It’s viewed as an enabling technology to allow you to keep the workforce that you have. There are a lot of conversations around the risks of automation and job loss, but the job loss is actually occurring now, in advance of the automated solutions.”</p>
<p>Digit, the bipedal robot the company announced back in 2020, had its most high-profile moment in the spotlight after Agility announced a partnership with auto giant Ford back at CES. The auto giant currently owns two of the robots, with long-term plans to utilize the technology for delivery.</p>
<p>Today’s video is an attempt to showcase some more short-term solutions, putting Digit to work on more menial tasks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197116" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197116" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2197116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Made-for-Work.2021-09-01-13_51_18-1.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Agility Robotics</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The value and goal of a machine like Digit is the generality,” CTO Jonathan Hurst says. “It’s a robot that can operate in human environments and spaces. It’s a relatively straightforward thing for very structured, repetitive tasks, to say, &#8216;there’s going to be boxes over there. We’re going to tell you which one from a databasing system, and we want you to move it over there.&#8217; Maybe this is something that it does for three or four hours a day and then it goes to a different space and does it three or four hours and then it unloads a tractor trailer.”</p>
<p>The company sees Digit’s value as a more plug and play solution than something like Berkshire Gray’s offerings, which builds a fully automated warehouse from the ground up. There’s still programming involved, of course. An Agility rep will appear on-site to pre-map a location and help the robot execute its repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>“In terms of where we can actually deploy and do useful work for a customer, it turns out a lot of the tasks &#8212; walk from Point A to Point B, pick up and carry a package &#8212; are portable across these environments,” says Shelton. &#8220;There’s no real core piece of technology that you develop, that’s different for an indoor environment versus outdoor. It’s just the level of maturity. I think we’ve reached that pretty quickly on the indoor stuff, so it’s a logical first place for deployment.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197117" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197117" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2197117" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Made-for-Work.2021-09-01-13_48_22.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197117" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Agility Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>Agility hasn’t announced partners beyond Ford, though it says it’s currently working with “major logistics companies.” It hasn’t revealed numbers of Digits sold, either, though it tells TechCrunch that the number is “substantially more” than the dozen Cassie units it sold prior to Digit, largely for research purposes. Sales are largely CapEx at the moment, though the company is exploring other opportunities, such as a RaaS (robotics-as-a-service model).</p>
<p>Agility’s team is currently at 56 people, primarily based in Oregon (the company got its start as part of OSU’s nascent robotics division), where the robots are primarily manufactured.</p>
<p>“We’ve grown pretty rapidly since last December,” says Shelton. “We’re expanding our Pittsburgh office by the end of the year, in addition to the Oregon office. We have a pretty rapid growth rate. As we’ve been increasing the production rate on the robots, we’ve had a fair amount of hiring for that. We just moved into a new facility that we remodeled, back in June.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After opening <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">applications</a> in June, Twitter is rolling out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">Super Follows</a>, its premium subscription option, starting today.</p>
<p>The feature, first revealed in February, will allow users to subscribe to accounts they like for a monthly subscription fee in exchange for exclusive content. For creators, Super Follows are another useful tool in the emerging patchwork of monetization options across social platforms.</p>
<p>Eligible accounts can set the price for Super Follow subscriptions, with the option of charging $2.99, $4.99 or $9.99 per month, prices fairly comparable to a paid newsletter. They can then choose to mark some tweets for subscribers only, while continuing to reach their unpaid follower base in regular tweets.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197076" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197076" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2197076 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?w=680" alt="Twitter Super Follows" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png 3788w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197076" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Paid subscribers will be marked with a special Super Follower badge, differentiating them from unpaid followers in the sea of tweets. The badge shows up in replies, elevating a follower&#8217;s ability to interact directly with accounts they opt to support. For accounts that have Super Follows turned on, the option will show up with a distinct button on the profile page.</p>
<p>Super Follows aren&#8217;t turned on for everyone. For now, the process remains application only, with a waitlist. The option lives in the Monetization options in the app&#8217;s sidebar, though users will need to be U.S.-based with 10K followers and at least 25 tweets within the last month to be eligible.</p>
<p>U.S. and Canada-based iOS Twitter users will be able to Super Follow some accounts starting today, with more users globally seeing the rollout in the coming weeks. On the creator side, Super Follows are only enabled in iOS for now, though support for Android and desktop are &#8220;coming soon.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter&#8217;s &#8216;Super Follow&#8217; creator subscription takes shots at Substack and Patreon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/embed/#?secret=tI0a228V2l" data-secret="tI0a228V2l" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Twitter says that Super Follow income will be subject to the standard, though controversial, 30% in-app purchase fees collected by Apple or Google. Twitter will only take a 3% cut of earnings for up to the first $50,000 generated through Super Follows — a boon for smaller accounts getting off the ground or anyone who uses the paid Twitter feature as a way to supplement other creator income elsewhere. After an account hits the $50,000 earnings mark, Twitter will begin taking a 20% cut.</p>
<p>Super Follows aren&#8217;t Twitter&#8217;s first monetization experiment to make it out in the wild. In May, Twitter introduced Tip Jar, a way for accounts to receive one-time payments through integration with the Cash App and other payment platforms. The test is limited to a subset of eligible accounts including &#8220;creators, journalists, experts, and nonprofits&#8221; for the time being.</p>

<p>Last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/twitter-starts-to-roll-out-paid-ticketed-spaces-on-ios/">Twitter rolled out Ticketed Spaces</a> for users who applied for the paid audio room feature back in June. Twitter&#8217;s cut from Ticketed Spaces mirrors the same fee structure it uses for Super Follows and users will be able to charge anywhere from one dollar to $999 for advanced ticketing.</p>
<p>The product is the latest in a flurry of activity from the social platform after a lengthy period of product stagnation. But Twitter has been busy in the last 12 months, from releasing and killing its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">ill-fated Fleets</a> to finally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-safety-mode-harassment/">showing signs of life</a> on the kind of anti-abuse features many people have been calling for for years.</p>
<p>Giving users the ability to charge for premium content is a pretty major departure for Twitter, which mostly stayed the course until activist shareholders <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-jack-dorsey-ouster-ceo-elliott-management-paul-singer-2020-2">threatened to oust CEO Jack Dorsey</a>. It&#8217;s also a major move for the company into the white-hot creator space, as more platforms add tools to empower their users to make a living through content creation — ideally keeping them loyal and generating revenue in the process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.berlin-brands-group.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> (BBG) &#8212; one of the new wave of e-commerce startups hoping to build lucrative economies of scale around buying up smaller brands that sell on marketplaces like Amazon and using technology to run and scale them more efficiently &#8212; has picked up a big round of funding to fill out that mission. The startup has closed a round of $700 million, comprising both equity and debt, which it will use in part to continue building its fulfillment and logistics infrastructure, as well as its tech platform, and in part to buy more companies.</p>
<p>BBG confirmed that the investment &#8212; one of the biggest to date in the space &#8212; boosts its valuation to over $1 billion.</p>
<p>Bain Capital is leading the equity portion of this round. The deal will also see it buy out a previous investor, Ardian, for an undisclosed amount that is separate to the $700 million raise.</p>
<p>This funding round is the second announced by BBG this year. In January it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced it would be investing $302 million</a> off its own balance sheet for M&amp;A, and in April it announced a debt round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of $240 million</a>. This latest $700 million is different in that it includes the equity component alongside the equity.</p>

<p>BBG got its start initially developing its own products and selling them on Amazon and other marketplaces &#8212; founder and CEO Peter Chaljawski was a DJ in a previous life and started with a focus on audio equipment he developed for himself.</p>
<p>Over time, he saw an opportunity to diversify that into a wider consolidation play, where BBG would also acquire and merge third-party brands into its business, tapping into the opportunity to provide the owners of the third-party businesses an exit route and bring those smaller brands more scale, more marketing nous and more tech to improve the efficiency of their operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today the mix totals 3,700 products and 14 own brands, including Klarstein (kitchen appliances), auna (home electronics and music equipment), Capital Sports (home fitness) and blumfeldt (garden). BBG says it has access to some 1.5 billion e-commerce customers across various marketplaces where it sells goods in Europe, the U.K., the U.S. and Asia. Notably, unlike many others in the same space as BBG, it is focused on more than Amazon, with some 100 channels in 28 countries.</p>
<p>That list of &#8220;many others in the same space&#8221; is a long one and seemingly growing by the day. Yesterday, two of them &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/uk-based-heroes-raises-200m-to-buy-up-more-amazon-merchants-for-its-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroes</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/olsam-raises-165m-to-buy-up-and-scale-consumer-and-b2b-amazon-marketplace-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olsam</a> &#8212; respectively raised $200 million and $165 million. Others leveraging the opportunity of consolidating merchants that sell via Fulfillment by Amazon include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/suma-brands-raises-150m-to-acquire-more-third-party-brands-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suma Brands</a> ($150 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/elevate-brands-banks-250m-to-roll-up-third-party-merchants-selling-on-amazons-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate Brands</a> ($250 million), <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perch</a> ($775 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/factory14-raises-200m-to-jump-into-the-amazon-marketplace-roll-up-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factory14</a> ($200 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrasio</a> (currently probably the biggest of them all in terms of reach and money raised and ambitions), <a href="https://heyday.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heyday</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Razor Group</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branded</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SellerX</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/">X2</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/benitago-group-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benitago</a>, Latin America’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valoreo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/founded-by-former-carousell-ovo-and-fave-execs-rainforest-raises-36m-to-aggregate-asia-pacific-amazon-marketplace-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainforest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/una-brands-launches-with-40m-to-acquire-brands-on-multiple-asia-pacific-e-commerce-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Una Brands</a> out of Asia.</p>
<p>As more startups enter the fray, battling to buy the best of the third-party brands will become more of a challenge, and so the backing of Bain should help BBG shore up against that competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Bain Capital&#8217;s commitment and the additional funding secured, we have set our next milestone on our path to building a global house of brands,&#8221; said Chaljawski in a statement. &#8220;This allows us to tackle strategic goals of acquiring and developing brands globally, as well as the operational and logistical expansion. Bain Capital&#8217;s experience working with founders worldwide will help us continue our evolution as a leading e-commerce company in scaling brands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;BBG is a disruptive leader in the rapidly changing consumer goods space. Their ability to develop and scale brands that meet current consumer trends through their highly efficient e-commerce platform gives the company tremendous growth potential in a fast-growing market,&#8221; added Miray Topay, MD at Bain Capital Private Equity. &#8220;We have partnered with many founder-led management teams and look forward to helping Peter and his team achieve their goal of becoming a global leader in consumer e-commerce&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the United States, a 401(k) plan is an employer-sponsored defined-contribution pension account. However, with legacy institutional investing, most of these have at least some level of fossil fuel involvement, and, let’s face it, very few of us really know. Now a startup plans to change that.</p>
<p>California-based startup <a href="http://oursphere.org">Sphere</a> wants to get employees to ask their employers for investment options that are not invested in fossil fuels. To do that it’s offering financial products that make it easier &#8212; it says &#8212; for employers to offer fossil-free investment options in their 401(k) plans. This could be quite a big movement. Sphere says there are more than $35 trillion in assets in retirement savings in the U.S. as of Q1 2021.</p>
<p>It’s now raised a $2 million funding round led by climate tech-focused VC Pale Blue Dot. Also participating were climate-focused investors including Sundeep Ahuja of Climate Capital. Sphere is also a registered &#8220;Public Benefit Corporation,&#8221; allowing it to campaign in public about climate change.</p>
<p>Alex Wright-Gladstein, CEO and founder of Sphere said: “We are proud to be partnering with Pale Blue Dot on our mission to reverse climate change by making our money talk. Heidi, Hampus, and Joel have the experience and drive to help us make big changes on the short seven-year time scale that we have to limit warming to 1.5°C.” Wright-Gladstein has also teamed up with sustainable investing veteran Jason Britton of Reflection Asset Management and BITA custom indexes.</p>
<p>Wright-Gladstein said she learned the difficulty of offering fossil-free options in 401(k) plans when running her previous startup, Ayar Labs. She tried to offer a fossil-free option for employees, but found out it took would take three years to get a single fossil-free option in the plan.</p>
<p>Heidi Lindvall, general partner at Pale Blue Dot, said: “We are big believers in Sphere&#8217;s unique approach of raising awareness through a social movement while offering a range of low-cost products that address the structural issues in fossil-free 401(k) investing.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last month, Twitch users have become increasingly concerned and frustrated with bot-driven hate raids. To protest Twitch&#8217;s lack of immediate action to prevent targeted harassment of marginalized creators, some streamers are going dark to observe #ADayOffTwitch today.</p>
<p>Per the protest, users are sharing a <a href="https://twitter.com/LuciaEverblack/status/1432749839641632775">list of demands</a> for the Amazon-owned Twitch. They want the platform to host a roundtable with creators affected by hate raids, allow streamers to approve or deny incoming raids, enable tools to only allow accounts of a certain age to chat, remove the ability to attach more than three accounts to one email address and share a timeframe for when comprehensive anti-harassment tools will be implemented.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>TechCrunch asked Twitch if it has plans to address these demands. Twitch responded with a statement: &#8220;We support our streamers’ rights to express themselves and bring attention to important issues across our service. No one should have to experience malicious and hateful attacks based on who they are or what they stand for, and we are working hard on improved channel-level ban evasion detection and additional account improvements to help make Twitch a safer place for creators.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Twitch </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/20/twitch-unveils-a-suite-of-new-tools-to-help-creators-grow-their-channels-and-make-money/">Raids</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> are a part of the streaming platform&#8217;s culture &#8212; after one creator ends their stream, they can &#8220;raid&#8221; another stream by sending their viewers over to check out someone else&#8217;s channel. This feature is supposed to help more seasoned streamers support up-and-comers, but instead, it&#8217;s been weaponized as a tool for harassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In May, Twitch launched 350 new tags related to gender, sexual orientation, race and ability, which users </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/310210-discover/suggestions/37011022-trans-tag-request">requested</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> so that they could more easily find creators that represent them. But at the same time, these tags made it easier for bad actors to harass marginalized streamers, and Twitch hasn&#8217;t yet added tools for streamers to deal with increased harassment. In the meantime, Twitch users have had to take matters into their own hands and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22633874/how-to-stop-a-hate-raid-twitch-safety-tools">build their own safety tools</a> to protect themselves while Twitch works on its updates. Twitch hasn&#8217;t shared when its promised anti-harassment tools will go live.  </span></p>
<p>As recently as December, Twitch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/twitch-updates-its-hateful-content-and-harassment-policy-after-company-called-out-for-its-ownabuses/">updated its policies</a> on hateful content and harassment, which the platform said have always been prohibited, yet vicious attacks have continued. After facing targeted, racist hate raids on their streams, a Black Twitch creator, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rekitraven">RekItRaven</a>, started the #TwitchDoBetter hashtag on Twitter in early August, calling out Twitch for its failure to prevent this abuse. While Twitch is aware of the issue and said it&#8217;s working on solutions, <a href="https://www.change.org/p/amazon-twitch-do-better-stop-hate-raids-against-people-of-color-and-marginalized-creators?recruiter=60679039&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;utm_term=share_petition&amp;recruited_by_id=cdf10ce0-f224-0130-2417-0022190c02ea">many users</a> find Twitch&#8217;s response to be too slow and lacking.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve been building channel-level ban evasion detection and account improvements to combat this malicious behavior for months. However, as we work on solutions, bad actors work in parallel to find ways around them—which is why we can&#39;t always share details.</p>
<p>&mdash; Twitch (@Twitch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1428814017779306499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Along with streamers LuciaEverblack and ShineyPen, RekItRaven organized #ADayOffTwitch to put pressure on Twitch to make its platform safer for marginalized creators.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate on the platform is not new,&#8221; Raven told <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/black-content-creators-organize-one_day-boycott-against-twitch">WYNC&#8217;s The Takeaway</a>. But bot-driven raid attacks are more difficult to combat than individual trolls. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had people come in with bots. It&#8217;s usually one or two people who program a bunch of bots, you bypass security measures that are put in place and just spam a broadcaster&#8217;s chat with very inflammatory, derogatory language.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Raven said they have since had a discussion with Twitch, they don&#8217;t feel that one conversation is enough.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>As part of #ADayOffTwitch, some streamers are encouraging their followers to support them financially on other platforms through the #SubOffTwitch tag. Twitch takes 50% of streamers&#8217; revenue, so creators are promoting their accounts on platforms like Patreon and Ko-Fi, which take a much smaller cut. Though competitor YouTube Gaming takes 30% of revenue, and Facebook Gaming <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/facebook-no-creator-revenue-split-2023-zuckerberg-1234990191/">won&#8217;t take a cut from creators</a> until 2023, Twitch remains dominant in the streaming space. According to Streamlabs and Stream Hatchet, Twitch <a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492">represented 72.3%</a> of the market share in terms of viewership Q1 2021.</p>
<p>Still, popular creators like Ben Lupo (DrLupo), Jack Dunlop (CouRage) and Rachell Hofstetter (Valkyrae) have recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal">left Twitch</a> for exclusive deals with YouTube Gaming. If Twitch remains unsafe for marginalized creators, others might be swayed to follow their lead, exclusive deals or not.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company provided me with the Ubco 2X2 Adventure Bike for nearly a month, which gave me plenty of time to put it to the test. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A recent move to Auckland, New Zealand — a city with lackluster public transit and hills that can turn a quick bike ride to the store into a sweaty workout — piqued my interest in e-bikes.</p>
<p>Strong demand and skyrocketing prices, however, made it difficult to access these coveted e-bikes here in Aotearoa, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotearoa">Land of the Long White Cloud</a>. That changed after learning about Ubco, the New Zealand-based electric utility bike startup that recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/electric-utility-bike-startup-ubco-raises-10-million-to-fund-its-global-expansion/">raised $10 million</a> from investors.</p>
<p>The company provided me with the Ubco 2X2 Adventure Bike for nearly a month, which gave me plenty of time to put it to the test.</p>
<p>I may not be Ubco’s target audience, although I did my best to use the bike as its design suggests, and packed it up with bags of books and other heavy things that might simulate the weight of delivered garlic bread, mail and other packages. The Ubco 2X2 Adventure Bike is made for city utility riding, with the option of going off-road, which I would later try with gusto.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s flagship is the Ubco 2X2 Work Bike, an electric dirt bike that was originally designed to help farmers. The fresh capital the company raised in June will be used to expand into existing verticals like food delivery, postal service and last-mile logistics, scale a commercial subscription business and target sales growth in the United States.</p>
<p>Domino’s drivers in Auckland, and I hear in the U.K., can be seen delivering hot pizzas on Ubco bikes, and the company has a range of other national clients, like the New Zealand Post, the Defense Force, the Department of Conservation, and Pāmu, or Landcorp Farming Limited, as well as other local restaurants and stores.</p>

<h2>The handoff</h2>
<p>CEO and co-founder Timothy Allan drove out from the company headquarters in Tauranga to hand off the bike personally. It was a sunny day in my neighborhood, and I listened impatiently as he described the various bits and bobs, how to work the machine and how to charge it.</p>
<p>Allan helped me download the Ubco app to pair my phone with the bike, which, among other functionalities, allowed me to select beginner mode, which would cap the vehicle speed at around 20 miles per hour. I made a mental note so that I could write about it here, but was determined to reach the top speed of 30 miles per hour right away.</p>
<p>I did, and it was … pretty sick. I’m not supposed to gush, but man! It’s a sweet ride. Here’s why:</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>The Adventure Bike comes standard in white and sits on 17&#215;2.75-inch multiuse tires with aluminum rims, both of which are DOT compliant. My version also had Maori decals on the frame, in a nod to the indigenous people of New Zealand.</p>
<p>The bike’s height is about 41 inches and the seat comes to 32 inches. From wheel to wheel, it’s about 72 inches. The payload, including the rider, is about 330 pounds, so both my partner (6’2” man) and I (5’7” female) rode this bike with ease, needing only to adjust the wide rearview mirrors sticking out of the handlebars. And no, we didn’t ride it together. This bike is designed as a one-seater.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187584" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187584" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2187584 size-full" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187584" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rebecca Bellan</p></div></p>
<p>That said, there’s a little cargo rack above the back wheel, which holds the license plate (apparently these are classified as mopeds, which require registration in many places) and any other cargo one might carry. I didn’t try, but I reckon it could hold at least five pizza boxes tied down with a bungee cord. The bike rack also allows for saddlebags to be strapped on. Ubco sells what it calls the Pannier Back Pack, a weather-resistant roll-top cargo bag, for $189 that slots in very nicely and is actually a quality bag with 5.28-gallon capacity.</p>
<p>Accessories aside, the alloy frame is lightweight and step-through, which I love in a bike &#8212; it lets me start to shift myself off before I fully park and I feel super agile and swift. Speaking of parking, the rules are different everywhere, I assume, but here, you park it on the street or in parking spaces, not on the sidewalk. It’s got a kickstand to hold it in place, and you can lock the front wheel so no one can just wheel it away. They <i>could,</i> however, probably chuck it into the back of their pickup truck if they so chose, since it’s only 145 pounds.</p>
<p>The appearance of the bike stood out, and not just to me. During my multiweek test drive, numerous tradesmen and bike folks went out of their way to compliment its design, the exact demographic that Ubco is aiming for.</p>
<h2>Rideability</h2>
<p>The lightness of the bike means that it’s easy to take off and find your balance. The battery is also in the middle of the frame, just near where your feet sit, which anchors the bike and gives you a stable center of gravity.</p>
<p>The lightweight nature of the bike is a blessing and a curse. Cutting a turn is easy, but on a windy day and an open road, there were moments I worried that I’d be knocked off it &#8212; but maybe that had more to do with riding next to a 10-wheeler on the street. Because it’s so light, it did feel a bit strange to me to be in the street lane with the other bigger, meaner cars rather than in the bike lanes.</p>
<p>The bike accelerates quickly via the fully electronic throttle control, even up steep hills, due to the high torque geared drivetrain. The drivetrain has two 1 kw Flux2 motors with sealed bearings, active heat management and active venting for residual moisture &#8212; a necessity in this moistest of cities.</p>
<p>The acceleration sound, which mimics those of a gas-powered dirt bike but with a softer electronic tone, was a surprising plus. I didn’t realize how much I relied on my sense of sound to tell how fast I was going until I rode the Ubco.</p>
<p>The braking system was a bit touchy. It felt very sensitive to me, probably because hydraulic and regenerative brakes are operating together on the vehicle. There’s also a passive regenerative braking system, which I gather is what put the brakes on for me when I was just trying to coast down one of those mammoth hills.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187588" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187588" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2187588 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187588" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rebecca Bellan</p></div></p>
<p>Both the front suspension, 130 mm, and rear suspension, 120 mm, have a coil spring with a hydraulic dampener and have preload and rebound adjustment. In other words, the shocks are awesome. Even when I actively drove myself off sidewalks and over speed bumps, I could barely feel a thing.</p>
<p>To test its off-road capabilities, I took the bike to Cornwall Park, where I ran it at full speed on the grass, swerving between trees, flying over roots and rocks, doing doughnuts in the field. It was good fun and I felt completely in control of the vehicle. I can imagine why farmers have turned to the Work Bike.</p>
<p>When it was time to test out its use as a delivery bike, I packed the two saddlebags with books and groceries and took it for a spin. Still a great ride, although I was a little wobbly turning corners until I got the hang of it.</p>
<h2>Value</h2>
<p>Since the Ubco Adventure Bike doesn’t neatly fit into a specific bike category, it’s not a simple price comparison. An electric moped, like a Lexmoto Yadea or a Vespa Elettrica, could set you back anywhere from $2,400 or $7,000, respectively. Electric dirt bikes could cost anywhere from $6,000 to $11,000 for something like a KTM or Alta Motors. That said, Swedish electric motorbike startup Cake did just come out with its latest made specifically for city riding, the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/electric-motorbike-company-cake-launches-the-makka-an-e-moped-for-city-riding-at-3500/"> Makka, at $3,500</a>. It looks a lot like the Ubco, but it&#8217;s a bit smaller.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the Ubco Adventure Bike costs $6,999 with a 2.1 kW power supply and $7,499 for a 3.1 kW power supply. Depending on what you want it for, I&#8217;d say it’s somewhere around mid-range for a bike like this. Since you&#8217;d probably use it for work-related activities, it could get a tax write-off. Plus, you want quality in a bike that’s down to do some heavy lifting, and Ubco has plenty of that. It’s not only a handy utility bike, but it’s also got some excellent tech under the proverbial hood, which we’ll get to later.</p>
<p>Ubco estimates a 10- to 15-year life expectancy, depending on use. Over-the-air software updates, replacing parts and full refurbishments can help keep the bike going for longer. The company encourages riders to send back the dead bikes because it&#8217;s committed to full product stewardship.</p>
<p>That said, if you wanted to buy a bike now, it’d be a preorder (unless your local Ubco dealer had some in stock). Ordering now could get you an Ubco by September if you live in the States. The company says it’s still feeling the effects of COVID, with high demand and a stretched supply chain causing delays. The preorder requires a $1,000 deposit.</p>
<p>Ubco also has a subscription model, which is mainly available for enterprise customers at the moment and priced on a case-by-case basis. However, it&#8217;s piloting subscriptions for individuals in Auckland and Tauranga before rolling the program out globally. Subscriptions will start at around NZD $300 per month for a 36-month term.</p>
<h2>Range</h2>
<p>The Adventure Bike comes with either the 2.1 kWh battery pack, which has around 40 to 54 miles of range, or the 3.1 kWh, with 60 to 80 miles.</p>
<p>The battery is run off a management system, called &#8220;Scotty,&#8221; to monitor real-time performance and safety. The battery, which is sealed with alloy and vented during use, is made with 18650 lithium-ion cells, which means it’s a powerful battery that can handle up to 500 charging cycles. Ubco says its batteries are designed to be disassembled at the end of life.</p>

<p>The 10 amp alloy fast charger can fuel the battery fully within four to six hours. You can charge it while it’s still in the vehicle by just connecting it to a power outlet, or you can unlock the battery and yank it out (it’s a little heavy) and charge it inside. Note: Charging is loud. Not sure if this is standard, but probably is.</p>
<p>I charged it every two to three days, but that will depend on use and where you are. It’s winter in Auckland, so a bit cold, which affects battery life, and the hills are brutal, which also use up a lot of battery life.</p>
<p>I’d ride it downtown and around my neighborhood every day, but I’d wager a delivery driver would need to charge it nightly. As I mentioned earlier, the battery can be removed for charging, so if you take it to work, you can always take it up to the office or wherever to charge while you’re doing other things.</p>
<h2>Tech features</h2>
<h3>Vehicle management system</h3>
<p>The vehicle runs off what Ubco calls its Cerebro vehicle management system, which integrates all electronic and electrical functions of the vehicles and provides control and updates via Bluetooth. Ubco builds with end of life in mind, so the CAN bus is isolated so future CAN devices can be easily integrated.</p>
<p>Now, one of my first questions, given the heftiness of this bike and the likelihood of gig economy workers who would ride it for work living in urban dwellings, was this: How can I ensure no one will steal this thing when it’s on the street, because there’s no way I’m lugging it up to my fifth-floor walkup?</p>
<p>Like I said, you can lock the wheel in place, which would make it far more difficult for someone to wheel it off. If someone did decide to capture the whole cumbersome vehicle, Ubco would be able to track it for you. Each Ubco bike has telemetry, aka a SIM card, hardwired inside, and that can help provide data that can be used for location, servicing, theft, safety, route planning, etc.</p>
<p>This VMS architecture is made for handling fleets via Ubco’s enterprise subscription vehicles, but it obviously has other uses, like providing peace of mind (personally, I’d still lock it up with chains, but I’m a New Yorker and trust no one). Obviously, if you think this telemetry is creepy, you can opt out, but it does come standard with subscriptions, allowing subscribers to track their bike&#8217;s location on the app.</p>

<p>Mounted on the handlebar is an LCD display that shows speed, power levels and more. Also on the handlebars are switch controls for high or low beams, indicators and a horn. I found the indicators to be a bit sticky and sometimes I would slip and hit the horn. What I <i>wish</i> the handlebars also had was a mount for your phone so you could follow directions. I had my headphones in and was listening to Google Maps tell me how to get around, but that felt less safe and efficient.</p>
<h3>Turning it on</h3>
<p>You can turn the power on with a keyless fob by either clicking the button on the fob or the button on the handlebars. I will note that the keyless fob button is weirdly sensitive. At multiple points, I had it in my pocket with my phone or other pocket inhabitants and it must have knocked into the button, turning the vehicle off while I was riding it. Thankfully, that never happened anywhere busy, but that’s something to be wary about.</p>
<h3>App</h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, you could pair your phone, as well as other users&#8217; phones, to the bike using the app. The app allows you to choose learner mode or restricted mode, which controls ride settings; turn the bike and lights on and off; change the metrics; and check the status of things like battery life, speed and motor temperature. It&#8217;s basically all the info on the dash, but on an app. I didn&#8217;t really feel the need to use it.</p>
<h3>Lights</h3>
<p>The LED headlights are on at all times when the vehicle is turned on, but there&#8217;s also a high and low beam, as well as peripheral parking lights, all of which are designed for disassembly at the end of life. There are also LED rear, brake and number plate lights, as well as DOT-approved indicator lights.</p>
<h2>Other stuff</h2>
<p>Among the features that don’t fit neatly into the other categories, there’s the field kit, which is fastened to the lift-up seat and contains a user manual and tools to set up and maintain the 2X2, which is really handy. Usually, when people buy an Ubco bike, it comes in a box and there are “a few simple steps to follow to get it ready to ride.” There’s also an <a href="https://www.ubcouniversity.com/courses/how-to-set-up-your-new-2x2-2021-wrk-adv-bikes">UBCO University</a> course that shows how to set it up. If you buy from one of Ubco’s dealers, they’ll unpack it and set it up when you come to collect it.</p>
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<p>Maintenance comes with the cost of a monthly subscription. Ubco has a network of technicians placed wherever the company sells its bikes if they&#8217;re in need of fixing. If there&#8217;s no authorized mechanic nearby, Ubco&#8217;s head office will work with customers to help them fix the bike. Ubco did not respond to information about how many authorized mechanics are in its network.</p>
<p>Again, being from New York, I&#8217;ve seen probably thousands of delivery riders on bikes and mopeds, oven mitts covered in a plastic bag taped onto the handlebars so drivers can keep their hands warm during the colder months. This bike can handle a hefty load for delivering goods, it&#8217;s quick and agile for weaving in and out of traffic, and it&#8217;s easy to ride and use.</p>
<p>The subscription offering, especially for enterprise, makes this a great city utility bike that can probably handle a range of weather conditions. I already know it can handle rain and mud, so all signs point to success in the sloshy, icy hell of a Northern city winter. And for the adventurer &#8212; the person who just wants to ride something sweet on- and off-road, out of the city and into the wilderness &#8212; this is also a great consumer ride that will last you quite a while.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sec/">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> has fined several brokerage firms a total of $750,000 for exposing the sensitive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/personally-identifiable-information/">personally identifiable information</a> of thousands of customers and clients after hackers took over employee email accounts.</p>
<p>A total of eight entities belonging to three companies have been sanctioned by the SEC, including Cetera (Advisor Networks, Investment Services, Financial Specialists, Advisors and Investment Advisers), Cambridge Investment Research (Investment Research and Investment Research Advisors) and KMS Financial Services.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-169">a press release</a>, the SEC announced that it had sanctioned the firms for failures in their cybersecurity policies and procedures that allowed hackers to gain unauthorized access to cloud-based email accounts, exposing the personal information of thousands of customers and clients at each firm.</p>
<p>In the case of Cetera, the SEC said that cloud-based email accounts of more than 60 employees were infiltrated by unauthorized third parties for more than three years, exposing at least 4,388 clients&#8217; personal information.</p>

<p>The order states that none of the accounts featured the protections required by Cetera’s policies, and the SEC also charged two of the Cetera entities with sending breach notifications to clients containing “misleading language suggesting that the notifications were issued much sooner than they actually were after discovery of the incidents.”</p>
<p>The SEC’s order against Cambridge concludes that the personal information exposure of at least 2,177 Cambridge customers and clients was the result of lax <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> practices at the firm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Although Cambridge discovered the first email account takeover in January 2018, it failed to adopt and implement firm-wide enhanced security measures for cloud-based email accounts of its representatives until 2021, resulting in the exposure and potential exposure of additional customer and client records and information,” the SEC said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The order against KMS is similar; the SEC&#8217;s order states that the data of almost 5,000 customers and clients were exposed as a result of the company’s failure to adopt written policies and procedures requiring additional firm-wide security measures until May 2020.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Investment advisers and broker-dealers must fulfill their obligations concerning the protection of customer information,&#8221; said Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&#8217;s Cyber Unit. &#8220;It is not enough to write a policy requiring enhanced security measures if those requirements are not implemented or are only partially implemented, especially in the face of known attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of the parties agreed to resolve the charges and to not commit future violations of the charged provisions, without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings. As part of the settlements, Cetera will pay a penalty of $300,000, while Cambridge and KMS will pay fines of $250,000 and $200,000 respectively. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Cambridge told TechCrunch that it does not comment on regulatory matters, but said it has and does maintain a comprehensive information security group and procedures to ensure clients&#8217; accounts are fully protected. Cetera and KMS have yet to respond.</p>
<p>This latest action by the SEC comes just weeks after the Commission ordered London-based publishing and education giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/pearson-to-pay-1m-fine-for-misleading-investors-about-2018-data-breach/">Pearson to pay a $1 million fine for misleading investors about a 2018 data breach</a> at the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.forumbrands.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forum Brands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an e-commerce acquisition platform, announced today that it has secured $100 million in debt funding from </span><a href="https://www.triplepointcapital.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TriplePoint Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing comes just over two months after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the startup raised $27 million in an equity funding round led by Norwest Venture Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brenton Howland, Ruben Amar and Alex Kopco founded New York-based Forum Brands in the summer of 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re buying what we think are A+ high-growth e-commerce businesses that sell predominantly on Amazon and are looking to build a portfolio of standalone businesses that are category leaders, on and off Amazon,” Howland told me at the time of the company’s last raise. “A source of inspiration for us is that we saw how consumer goods and services changed fundamentally for what we think is going to be for decades and decades to come, accelerating the shift toward digital.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we covered the company in June, Forum Brands says it has acquired several new brands, including </span><a href="https://bonzapet.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonza</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a seller of pet products, and</span><a href="https://simkarose.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Simka Rose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a baby-focused brand specializing in eco-friendly products. Simka sells in the U.S. and the EU and is an example of how Forum is expanding globally, Amar said.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Forum Brands raises $27M Series A as crowded Amazon roll-up space continues to heat up&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/forum-brands-raises-27m-as-crowded-amazon-roll-up-space-continues-to-heat-up/embed/#?secret=rUqsooCnQI" data-secret="rUqsooCnQI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howland and Amar emphasize that the Forum team continues to focus on quality over quantity when evaluating potential acquisitions. Although they meet with 15-20 founders a week, they are selective in which companies they choose to acquire.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We continue to be a quality-first buyer, and not quantity-driven,” Amar said, noting that the company will still help a company build its brand even if it does not yet meet Forum’s quality threshold or if the founders are just not ready to sell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new funds will be used to, naturally, acquire more e-commerce companies. As part of the debt financing, Sajal Srivastava, co-CEO and co-founder of TriplePoint Capital, will be joining Forum’s board of directors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are impressed not only by Forum’s long-term strategy and ability to leverage technology and deep collective e-commerce and M&amp;A experience but also by how Forum cultivates relationships with their sellers both before and after partnering with them,” he said in a written statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of its June raise, Forum had about 20 employees. As of today, it has about 40.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forum’s technology employs “advanced” algorithms and over 100 million data points to populate brand information into a central platform in real time, instantly scoring brands and generating accurate financial metrics.</span></p>
<p>On August 31, we covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/olsam-raises-165m-to-buy-up-and-scale-consumer-and-b2b-amazon-marketplace-sellers/">the news</a> that on the heels of Heroes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/uk-based-heroes-raises-200m-to-buy-up-more-amazon-merchants-for-its-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> a $200 million raise to double down on buying and scaling third-party Amazon Marketplace sellers, <em>another</em> startup out of London aiming to do the same announced some significant funding of its own. <a href="https://olsamgroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olsam</a>, a roll-up play that is buying up both consumer and B2B merchants selling on Amazon by way of Amazon’s <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBA fulfillment program</a>, closed on $165 million — a combination of equity and debt that it will be using to fuel its M&amp;A strategy, as well as continue building out its tech platform and to hire more talent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is launching a new version of its <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/beta/">Chrome Beta browser</a> today that&#8217;s introducing some fairly notable changes to its user interface and design. The browser will introduce an updated New Tab page, which will now include cards directing you back to past web search activities, instead of only a list of shortcuts to favorite websites. Other changes aim to make it easier to navigate search results and to highlight and share quotes from the web.</p>
<p>The New Tab page&#8217;s update will be one of the first changes Chrome beta users may notice.</p>
<p>The idea behind this design change is about getting you back quickly to past web activities without a need to dive into your browsing history to remember which sites you had been using for things like recipes or shopping. It can also help you to return quickly to your recent documents list in Google Drive, in a handy bit of cross-promotion for Google services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196948" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196948" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196948" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="411" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png 2250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=768,465 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=680,411 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=1536,929 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=2048,1239 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196948" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The page will now feature what Google is calling &#8220;cards,&#8221; not just links, which could direct you to things like a recently visited recipe site where you had been browsing for ideas, a Google doc you need to finish editing, or a retailer&#8217;s website where you had left your shopping cart filled with things you may like to purchase at a later date. The latter ties into Google&#8217;s larger investment in online shopping, which has already seen the search giant trying to grab more market share in the space by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/google-switches-its-shopping-search-service-to-mostly-free-listings/">making product listings free</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/">partnering with e-commerce platforms like Shopify.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bCUEp7TWGf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/">Google partners with Shopify on online shopping expansion</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google partners with Shopify on online shopping expansion&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/embed/#?secret=bCUEp7TWGf" data-secret="bCUEp7TWGf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Google is rightly concerned about Amazon&#8217;s surging advertising business, which is a large part of the retailer&#8217;s &#8220;Other&#8221; category that grew <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazons-advertising-business-surging-amid-industry-wide-ad-sales-boom-tech-giants/">87% year-over-year</a> to generate $7.9 billion in the second quarter. Now, it&#8217;s capitalizing on Chrome&#8217;s New Tab real estate to elevate shopping activity in the hopes of pushing users to complete their transactions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another change aims to make it easier to do web research. Google says that often, users searching for something on its platform will navigate to multiple web pages to find their answer. The new version of Chrome will experiment with a different way of connecting users to their search results by adding a row beneath the address bar on Chrome for Android that will show the rest of the results so you can navigate to other web pages without needing to hit the back button.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196952" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196952" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196952" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Webnotes_Mobile.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196952" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>A new &#8220;quote cards&#8221; experiment, also coming to Chrome Beta on Android, will allow users to create a stylized image for social sharing that features text found on websites. Taking a screengrab of a website&#8217;s text is something that&#8217;s already a common activity, and particularly for people who want to share a key point from a news article they&#8217;re reading with followers on platforms like Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. With this new feature, you&#8217;ll be able to long-press text to highlight it, then tap Share and select a template by tapping on the &#8220;Create Card&#8221; option from the menu.</p>
<p>All features are a part of the Chrome Beta browser. To enable experiments, you can type <em>chrome://flags</em> into the browser&#8217;s address bar or click on the Experiments beaker icon, and then enable the flags. The associated flags for these experiments are #ntp-modules flag (New Tab page), #continuous-search (search results changes) and #webnotes-stylize flag (quote cards).</p>
<p>Experiments don&#8217;t necessarily become Chrome features that roll out more broadly. Instead, they offer Google a way to capture large-scale user feedback about its new design ideas, so the features can be tweaked and fine-tuned before a public release.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter&#8217;s newest test could provide some long-awaited relief for anyone facing harassment on the platform.</p>
<p>The new product test introduces a feature called &#8220;Safety Mode&#8221; that puts up a temporary line of defense between an account and the waves of toxic invective that Twitter is notorious for. The mode can be enabled from the settings menu, which toggles on an algorithmic screening process that filters out potential abuse that lasts for seven days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to better protect the individual on the receiving end of Tweets by reducing the prevalence and visibility of harmful remarks,&#8221; Twitter Product Lead Jarrod Doherty said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196998" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196998" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196998 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196998" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Safe Mode won&#8217;t be rolling out broadly — not yet, anyway. The new feature will first be available to what Twitter describes as a &#8220;small feedback group&#8221; of about 1,000 English language users.</p>
<p>In deciding what to screen out, Twitter&#8217;s algorithmic approach assesses a tweet&#8217;s content — hateful language, repetitive, unreciprocated mentions — as well as the relationship between an account and the accounts replying. The company notes that accounts you follow or regularly exchange tweets with won&#8217;t be subject to the blocking features in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>For anyone in the test group, Safety Mode can be toggled on in the privacy and safety options. Once enabled, an account will stay in the mode for the next seven days. After the seven-day period expires, it can be activated again.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In crafting the new feature, Twitter says it spoke with experts in mental health, online safety and human rights. The partners Twitter consulted with were able to contribute to the initial test group by nominating accounts that might benefit from the feature, and the company hopes to focus on female journalists and marginalized communities in its test of the new product. Twitter says that it will start reaching out to accounts that meet the criteria of the test group — namely accounts that often find themselves on the receiving end of some of the platform&#8217;s worst impulses.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Twitter announced that it was working on<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/twitter-is-eyeing-new-anti-abuse-tools-to-give-users-more-control-over-mentions/"> developing new anti-abuse features</a>, including an option to let users &#8220;unmention&#8221; themselves from tagged threads and a way for users to prevent serial harassers from mentioning them moving forward. The company also hinted at a feature like Safety Mode that could give users a way to defuse situations during periods of escalating abuse.</p>
<p>Being &#8220;harassed off of Twitter&#8221; is, unfortunately, not that uncommon. When hate and abuse get bad enough, people tend to abandon Twitter altogether, taking extended breaks or leaving outright. That&#8217;s obviously not great for the company either, and while it&#8217;s been slow to offer real solutions to harassment, it&#8217;s obviously aware of the problem and working toward some possible solutions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Goodcall’s free cloud-based conversational platform leverages artificial intelligence to manage incoming business phone calls and boost customer service while assisting to other patrons.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even without staffing shortages, local merchants have difficulty answering calls while all hands are busy, and <a href="https://goodcall.com">Goodcall</a> wants to alleviate some of that burden from America’s 30 million small businesses.</p>
<p>Goodcall’s free cloud-based conversational platform leverages artificial intelligence to manage incoming phone calls and boost customer service for businesses of all sizes. Former Google executive Bob Summers left Google back in January, where he was working on Area 120 — an internal incubator program for experimental projects — to start Goodcall after recognizing the call problem, noting that in fact 60% of the calls that come into merchants go unanswered.</p>
<p>“It’s frustrating for you and for the person calling,” Summers told TechCrunch. “Every missed call is a lost opportunity.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Goodcall announced its launch Wednesday with $4 million in seed funding led by strategic investors Neo, Foothill Ventures, Merus Capital, Xoogler Ventures, Verissimo Ventures and VSC Ventures, as well as angel investors including Harry Hurst, founder and co-CEO of Pipe.com, and Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196344" style="width: 356px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196344" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2196344" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?w=346" alt="" width="346" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png 816w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=76,150 76w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=153,300 153w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=768,1510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=346,680 346w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=781,1536 781w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196344" class="wp-caption-text">Goodcall mobile agent. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Goodcall</p></div></p>
<p>Restaurants, shops and merchants can set up on Goodcall in a matter of minutes and even establish a local phone number to free up an owner’s mobile number from becoming the business’ main line. The service is initially deployed in English and the company has plans to operate in Spanish, French and Hindi by 2022.</p>
<p>Merchants can choose from six different assistant voices and monitor the call logs and what the calls were about. Goodcall can also capture consumer sentiment, Summers said.</p>
<p>The company offers three options, including its freemium service for solopreneurs and business owners, which includes up to 500 minutes per month of Goodcall services for a single phone line. Up to five additional locations and five staff members costs $19 per month for the Pro level, or the Premium level provides unlimited locations and staff for $49 per month.</p>
<p>During the company’s beta period, Goodcall was processing several thousands of calls per month. The new funding will be used to continue to offer the free service, hire engineers and continue product development.</p>
<p>In addition to the funding round, Goodcall is unveiling a partnership with Yelp to tap into its database of local businesses so that those owners and managers can easily deploy Goodcall. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/yelp-says-more-than-500000-new-businesses-opened-in-past-year.html">Yelp data shows</a> that more than 500,000 businesses opened during the pandemic. The company pulls in from Yelp a merchant’s open hours, location, if they offer Wi-Fi and even their COVID policy.</p>
<p>“We are partnering with Yelp, which has the best data on small businesses, and other large distribution channels to get our product to market,” Summers said. “We are bringing technology into an industry that hasn’t innovated since the 1980s and democratizing conversational AI for small businesses that are the main driver of job creation, and we want to help them grow.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Private equity firm Apollo Global Management this morning <a href="https://www.apollo.com/stockholders/press-releases/2021/09-01-2021-161530593" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced that it has completed its acquisition of Yahoo</a> (formerly known as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/05/i-come-to-bury-oath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verizon Media Group, itself formerly known as Oath)</a> from Verizon. The deal is worth $5 billion, with $4.25 billion in cash, plus preferred interests of $750 million. Verizon will be retaining 10% of the newly rebranded company.</p>
<p>“This is a new era for Yahoo,” Yahoo CEO (and former VZM head) Guru Gowrappan said in a release tied to the news. “The close of the deal heralds an exciting time of renewed opportunity for us as a standalone entity. We anticipate that the coming months and years will bring fresh growth and innovation for Yahoo as a business and a brand, and we look forward to creating that future with our new partners.”</p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/verizon-media-leadership-in-doubt-ahead-of-apollo-acquisition-on-sept-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that Gowrappan might not stay on as CEO of Yahoo for the long term now that the deal has closed; for now he&#8217;s still at the helm.</p>
<p>In addition to its titular Yahoo properties (Mail, Sports, Finance, et al.), the group includes us, TechCrunch; AOL; Engadget; and interactive media brand, RYOT. All told, the umbrella brand encompasses around 900 million monthly active users globally and is currently the third-largest internet property, per Apollo’s figures.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IwY1Pu8XQ2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/oath-brother/">Verizon to take a charge of up to $6.7B due to Oath and redundancies</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Verizon to take a charge of up to $6.7B due to Oath and redundancies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/oath-brother/embed/#?secret=IwY1Pu8XQ2" data-secret="IwY1Pu8XQ2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The deal puts to a close a years-long effort by Verizon to make a comprehensive move into online media, specifically around adtech, which ultimately proved to be too costly, mostly unprofitable and, finally, not core enough to the telco&#8217;s bigger growth strategy.</p>
<p>The news comes during a tumultuous time for online media, amid increasing industry-wide consolidation, many felt within Verizon Media. Verizon acquired AOL in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/23/verizon-completes-its-acquisition-of-aol-for-4-4b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 for $4.4 billion</a>, followed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/13/verizon-closes-4-5b-acquisition-of-yahoo-marissa-mayer-resigns-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buying Yahoo for $4.5 billion two years later</a>, combining the two legacy media properties into a combined group named Oath. At the end of 2018, Oath wrote down $4.6 billion, following the merger.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how a new owner will steer that large ship differently, but one strategy &#8212; standard practice for PE firms &#8212; could involve Apollo selling off parts of the business or rationalizing it in other ways.</p>
<p>However, for its part, Apollo has promised to continue investing in the newly acquired proprieties, and it has secured all jobs at the time of handover for at least an initial period. The bigger firm of Apollo has a massive set of TMT, holdings so it will be interesting to see how and if it leverages that, too.</p>
<p>“We look forward to partnering with Yahoo&#8217;s talented employee base to build on the company&#8217;s strong momentum and position the new Yahoo for long-term success as a standalone consumer internet and digital media leader,” Apollo Partner Reed Rayman said in the release. “We couldn’t be more excited about this next chapter for Yahoo as we look to invest in growth across the business, including accelerating its customer-first offerings and commerce capabilities, expanding its reach and enhancing the daily user experience.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Blueprint CEO Steve Berneman thinks that the $18 billion title insurance business should really be a $10 billion market. It was, we believe, the first time a startup discussed shrinking its market.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://blueprinttitle.com/">Blueprint Title</a>, an insurtech startup working in the title insurance space, announced this morning that it closed a $16 million Series B. The new round was led by Forté Ventures. The startup previously raised an $8.5 million Series A in the final weeks of 2019.</p>
<p>While Blueprint is an insurtech startup and therefore fits into the neoinsurance cohort that we&#8217;ve tracked in recent quarters as a number of companies from the group have gone public, it&#8217;s somewhat distinct. Blueprint is different from the Roots and MetroMiles and Hippos that debuted via traditional IPOs or SPACs; it largely sells to business customers and has a very different product on offer.</p>
<p>The neoinsurance companies that went public in the last year and a half sell to consumers. Blueprint, in contrast, sells to professional groups looking for a better title insurance experience. That means its customer base is not made up of consumers hoping to cover their main residence, Blueprint CEO Steve Berneman told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>That means that the company&#8217;s go-to-market activities are distinct from its mates in the consumer-focused cohort and that its loss profile is very different.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="eErw0xWi0F"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/">Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/embed/#?secret=eErw0xWi0F" data-secret="eErw0xWi0F" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Title insurance, Berneman said, has around a 1% to 4% claims rate, far lower than auto insurance, to pick an example. That means its risk profile is different, and its pricing less flexible; there&#8217;s less loss ratio to wring out of title insurance underwriting, so cost and delivery of service are even more important than in other insurance varietals.</p>
<p>According to the CEO, the title insurance market in the United States today is made up of four companies with around 90% market share. And thanks to rules requiring public pricing in many states, there&#8217;s alignment on pricing from some leading players. The result of market concentration and effective price harmonization is that Berneman thinks that the $18 billion title insurance business should really be a $10 billion market.</p>
<p>Our call with Blueprint was the first in which a startup discussed shrinking its market.</p>
<p>But the point is reasonable; if title insurance is mispriced, and Blueprint sells to corporate customers, it can likely offer profitable coverage at a lower-than-market price point &#8212; and grow quickly in the process. That appears to be the case, with the startup stating in a release that it anticipates 400% revenue growth in 2021 when compared to 2020.</p>
<p>That growth rate explains the Nashville-based company&#8217;s most recent round and what we presume was a stiff upsizing in its valuation.</p>
<p>As part of its funding round announcement, Blueprint also disclosed that it has purchased Southwest Land Title Insurance Company, an underwriting company. Berneman said that to shrink the title insurance market through more reasonable pricing, his company needs to be full-stack, i.e., both writing its own coverage and selling it. Otherwise, margins would leak on either side of its operations.</p>
<p>Blueprint, akin to Next Insurance, is a startup bet that selling insurance to business customers will prove to be a lucrative effort. Given that consumer-focused neoinsurance providers have seen Wall Street change its tune on their value, it will be interesting to watch this more B2B cohort grow and eventually debut.</p>
