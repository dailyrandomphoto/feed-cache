										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, autonomous driving startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amazon-to-acquire-autonomous-driving-startup-zoox/">Zoox was acquired by Amazon in a deal worth $1.3 billion</a>. Since then, Zoox has continued to pursue its existing strategy of developing and deploying autonomous passenger vehicles, revealing the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazons-zoox-unveils-electric-robotaxi-that-can-travel-up-to-75-mph/">design of its long-anticipated robotaxi late in December</a>. From concept to reveal, Zoox spent six years developing its built-for-purpose passenger AV, and the plan is to launch them initially with commercial deployments in Las Vegas and San Francisco following testing. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=mobility2021&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=zooxpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility</a> this year on June 9, we&#8217;ll have the chance to speak to Zoox co-founder and CTO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=mobility2021&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=zooxpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jesse Levinson</a> about the company&#8217;s progress towards those goals, and what it&#8217;s like for Zoox nearly a year on as an Amazon company.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=mobility2021&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=zooxpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Did you know? Early Bird Ticket Sales End Next Week! Save $100 before prices go up]</a></strong></em></p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch from last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/inside-zooxs-six-year-ride-from-prototype-to-product/">Levinson told us</a> that life under Amazon at the AV company has been essentially business as usual since the acquisition — with greatly expanded access to resources, of course, and potentially with even more autonomy than before, he said, since they&#8217;re not beholden to a host of outside investors as they pursue their goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, the natural assumption when considering Amazon and its interest in autonomous vehicles is package delivery — which is why it&#8217;s so interesting that Zoox is, and has always, prioritized movement of people, not parcels, in its AV development roadmap. Zoox&#8217;s debut vehicle has been designed entirely with passenger transportation in mind, though the company&#8217;s CEO Aicha Evans has acknowledged in the past that it could definitely work on package delivery in partnership with its new corporate owner in the future.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll hear from Levinson if there are any updates to Zoox&#8217;s plan or focus, and what Amazon&#8217;s ambitions are for autonomous vehicles in the long term. We&#8217;ll also talk about the AV industry overall, and the major shifts its undergone in the years that Zoox has been operating, and what that means for growing and attracting talent. Levinson knows the industry and the state of the art in AV technology better than most, so be sure to grab tickets to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=mobility2021&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=zooxpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> ASAP and check out our chat on June 9.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly four years ago, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/11/the-hunted-becomes-the-hunter-how-cloudflares-fight-with-a-patent-troll-could-alter-the-game/">wrote about a battle</a> between <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>, the San Francisco-based internet security and performance company, and <a href="http://www.blackbird-tech.com/">Blackbird Technologies</a>, a firm that quickly amassed dozens of patents, then began using them to file dozens of patent infringement lawsuits against companies, including Cloudflare.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The suit was typical in every way, except how Cloudflare responded to it. Unlike many targets of similar lawsuits that opt to settle, Cloudflare fought back, asking very publicly for help in locating prior art that would not only invalidate the broad patent that Blackbird was using to sue Cloudflare, but to invalidate all of Blackbird’s patents. The public answered the call, and two years and 275 unique submissions later, the case against Cloudflare was dismissed and Blackbird&#8217;s operations were diminished.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The hunted becomes the hunter: How Cloudflare&#8217;s fight with a &#8216;patent troll&#8217; could alter the game&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/11/the-hunted-becomes-the-hunter-how-cloudflares-fight-with-a-patent-troll-could-alter-the-game/embed/#?secret=dFQcY1vhug" data-secret="dFQcY1vhug" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One might surmise that given the stink that Cloudflare raised, other patent trolls might choose an easier target. Yet last month, Cloudflare was sued yet again, this time by Sable Networks, a &#8220;company that doesn’t appear to have operated a real business in nearly ten years — relying on patents that don’t come close to the nature of our business or the services we provide,&#8221; as says Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Cloudflare isn&#8217;t going to take this newest action lying down. This morning, after revealing the lawsuit publicly, it invited the engineering community to again &#8220;<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-jengo-redux-cloudflares-prior-art-search-bounty-returns/">turn the tables</a>&#8221; on patent trolls by inviting them to participate in a crowdsourced effort to find evidence of prior art to invalidate the &#8220;ancient, 20-year-old patents&#8221; that Cloudlflare says that Sable is is &#8220;trying to stretch . . . lightyears beyond what they were meant to cover.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cloudflare is also offering a $100,000 bounty to be split among entrants who provide the most useful prior-art references that can be used in challenging the validity of all of Sable’s patents, not just those being asserted against Cloudflare.</p>
<p>The idea is to deal a big enough blow to Sable that not only is its case against Cloudflare hobbled but also future cases against other entities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel fortunate that we didn&#8217;t run into one of these cases earlier in our history, where it might have really taken us off our path,&#8221; Kramer tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Blackbird came along when we had a bit more stability, and we have even more stability now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that position of relative strength, he says, &#8220;We want to go about this in a way that will force [Sable] to define their claims and stand on their claims, and we want to do it in a way that leaves something behind for other folks, particularly smaller companies that may come behind us, so we want to put [Sable&#8217;s] entire patent portfolio under scrutiny.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly, Cloudflare is not the only company to attract Sable&#8217;s attention. Indeed, a quick search shows that Sable has also sued the cybersecurity business Fortinet, the data platform Splunk, and networking giants Juniper Networks and Cisco Systems, among roughly a dozen other companies.</p>
<p>Eight of those cases &#8212; including with Juniper and Cisco &#8212; have already settled. The reality is that most companies see infringement cases by non-practicing entities like Sable as a nuisance to be quickly resolved because they are a distraction and because the expense of fighting is often equal to or even more than the cost of settling.</p>
<p>The companies also lose oftentimes. Though in 2017, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that patent holders suing corporations can&#8217;t seek out a friendly court &#8212; their venue of choice was long the Eastern District of Texas, where <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/supreme-court-ends-texas-grip-patent-cases">2,500 cases</a> were brought in  2015 alone, 95% of them initiated by non-practicing entities like Sable &#8212; business remains brisk in Texas, where legal teams bring in a lot of money and often successfully cast major corporations to local jurors as villainous.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Texas-regains-title-capitol-patent-litigation-15473273.php">report in the Houston Chronicle</a> last year noted that businesses and individuals filed 747 patent complaints in Texas during the first six months of 2020 — double the number from a year earlier and twice as many as any other state. To underscore the point, it noted that while patent infringement lawsuits jumped 16 percent nationwide in the first six months of last year, the number of new disputes in Texas soared 96%.</p>
<p>Some of those cases landed in the Eastern District of Texas (and mostly in Marshall, Texas, which boasts a population of 23,000). Some landed in the Southern District, which covers Houston and, according to that same Houston Chronicle report, experienced a 43% jump in new patent violation cases last year.</p>
<p>But Waco, the Western District of Texas, has become the new center for patent infringement cases. That&#8217;s largely because the district encompasses Austin, where many tech companies have offices, and notably, a key piece of that 2017 Supreme Court ruling limited filings to venues where the defendants have actual operations.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cloudflare beat a patent troll. What now?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/cloudflare-beat-a-patent-troll-what-now/embed/#?secret=GwzKE4NdCF" data-secret="GwzKE4NdCF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So-called patent trolls have also found a friend, seemingly, in U.S. District Judge Alan Albright, a former trial attorney who was <a href="https://www.statesman.com/NEWS/20180123/Trump-names-Austin-lawyer-Alan-Albright-to-federal-bench">nominated</a> to become a federal judge in Waco in 2018 by former President Donald Trump. In the two years following his confirmation by the Senate, Albright has come to preside over the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/patent-lawsuits-trolls-moving-texas-waco-new-judge-big-tech-2021-4">most popular court in the country</a> to litigate intellectual property disputes, with a very high percentage of plaintiffs winning their cases.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder that outfits like Sable continue on their path. Scoring early settlement agreements can add up to big business. (Their continued success is also why litigation finance funds continue to <a href="https://www.ipwatchdog.com/press/gls-capital-raises-345-million-litigation-finance-fund/">spring into existence</a>.)</p>
<p>Cloudflare is a much bigger quarry now, too. While Blackbird sued while it was still a privately held entity, Cloudflare went public in 2019 and currently boasts a market cap of $26 billion.</p>
<p>Kramer is acutely aware of the upward battle ahead. It&#8217;s why despite its resources, Cloudflare is reaching out to the public again. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to sound self-serving, but we have a very intense group of engineers and people in this space who read [our] blog regularly,&#8221; Kramer says of the detailed <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-jengo-redux-cloudflares-prior-art-search-bounty-returns/">post </a>he published this morning relating to the case. &#8220;I also think this really strikes a nerve with some people because they are so bothered by&#8221; the practice of patent infringement suits.</p>
<p>Kramer says it&#8217;s impossible to overstate the impact of these far-flung engineers in Cloudflare&#8217;s fight against Blackbird, &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t just people who thought, &#8216;Oh, it&#8217;s a chance to make some money and I&#8217;m gonna go do this.&#8217; There wasn&#8217;t a lot of junk in [what they submitted]. Instead, we had people saying, &#8216;Hey, listen, I worked on this back in the &#8217;90s when I was over at this company, and it&#8217;s crazy that they&#8217;re trying to say they invented this,&#8217; and they would send us articles that they had written.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had people doing research at libraries and stuff like that,&#8221; adds Kramer, &#8220;but we also had people who had worked in the industry and said, &#8216;I worked on this three years before they ever got that patent; there&#8217;s no way they should be able to create this [trouble] based something that I did.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Cloudflare is hoping again that a lot of its followers will get energized, but &#8220;also the exact right people, who are motivated by this and and who are very, very knowledgeable in this space,&#8221; says Kramer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re hoping to get the gang back together.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After everything was wrapped up at <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/2021-academy-awards-show-review-big-gambles-mixed-results">a very weird Oscars ceremony</a>, original films released by Netflix had won seven statuettes.</p>
<p>The streaming service&#8217;s awards include for two for &#8220;Mank&#8221; (production design and cinematography), two for &#8220;Ma Rainey&#8217;s Black Bottom&#8221; (hair/makeup and costume), documentary feature (&#8220;My Octopus Teacher&#8221;), animated short (&#8220;If Anything Happens I Love You&#8221;) and live action short (&#8220;Two Distant Strangers&#8221;).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;Sound of Metal&#8221; won the awards for sound and editing, while Facebook&#8217;s Oculus, EA and Respawn <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/facebook-wins-oscar-colette-1234959515/">won their first Oscar for &#8220;Colette,&#8221; </a>which won in the documentary short category.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This comes after a pandemic year in which theaters closing or operating at reduced capacity, forcing the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to delay the ceremony and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/oscars-streaming-coronavirus/">change its awards eligibility rules</a>. It also essentially erased the distinction between theatrical and streaming films — for example, Searchlight Pictures released Best Picture-winner &#8220;Nomadland&#8221; in theaters and on Hulu at the same time.</p>
<p>Netflix received <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/awards/netflix-oscar-nominations-2021-disney-plus-hulu-1234930905/">36 nominations total</a>, making it the most-nominated studio, with &#8220;Mank&#8221; the most-nominated film. And seven wins is a big improvement on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/09/netflix-oscars/">the two it won last year</a>.</p>
<p>Going into the evening, &#8220;Nomadland&#8221; was seen as the front runner for Best Picture, but Netflix executives still had reason to be  disappointed: In a nearly unprecedented move, Best Picture wasn&#8217;t the final award of the night — instead, it was Best Actor, which was widely expected to go to the late Chadwick Boseman for his performance in &#8220;Ma Rainey.&#8221; So when Anthony Hopkins (who wasn&#8217;t in attendance) won for &#8220;The Father,&#8221; it made for a pretty deflating end to the evening.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Luminar Technologies is expanding its lidar business beyond automotive and into aviation through a partnership with Airbus. The collaboration with the French aerospace giant, which was announced Monday morning, marks the latest in a string of partnership announcements between Luminar and companies like Daimler, Volvo and Mobileye. Until now, these have exclusively focused on applying its light detection and ranging radar to automated vehicles on the ground — not in the skies.</p>
<p>The partnership won&#8217;t bring lidar into commercial aircraft. Unlike Luminar&#8217;s deal with Daimler, Mobileye and Volvo this is not a production contract. Instead, the partnership is with Airbus&#8217; UpNext subsidiary, which is focused on developing and eventually applying new technological breakthroughs to aviation. The effort will be folded into Airbus Flightlab, an ecosystem that offers access to flight test platforms across Airbus&#8217; business lines, including commercial aircraft, helicopters, defense and space. Luminar and Airbus will develop and test how lidar can be used to enhance sensing, perception and system-level capabilities to ultimately enable safe, autonomous flight, the companies said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re able to directly re-apply what we&#8217;ve accomplished for the automotive industry into aviation, an established nearly $1 trillion industry,&#8221; Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell said in a statement Monday. &#8220;We believe that automation and safety enhancements will transform how we move across all modes of transport as we take our technology from roads to the skies. We look forward to accelerating our shared vision to define the future of flying.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lidar, which measures distance using laser light to generate a highly accurate 3D map of the world, is considered by most in the autonomous vehicle industry critical to commercial deployment. Automakers have also begun to view lidar as an important sensor to be used to expand the capabilities and safety of advanced driver assistance systems in new cars, trucks and SUVs available to consumers.</p>
<p>Airbus is interested in how Luminar&#8217;s lidar and perception stack can be used to automatically detect obstacles, a key step toward autonomous operation of aircraft such as urban air mobility vehicles. The companies said the sensor also has the potential to &#8220;substantially improve the safety of existing aircraft applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>Increasing helicopter safety is one of Airbus&#8217; missions. The company said Monday it will introduce a number of new features to its helicopter Flightlab through a project code-named Vertex. These technologies, which include lidar and other sensors coupled with software for obstacle detection, fly-by-wire for enhanced auto-pilot and a touchscreen and head-worn display for inflight monitoring and control, aim to reduce helicopter pilot workload and increase safety. Airbus said that when combined, the system will be able to manage navigation and route preparation, automatic take-off and landing, as well as following a predefined flight path. The incremental integration of these technologies onto the helicopter Flightlab has begun ahead of a complete demonstration in 2023. Airbus said its Urban Air Mobility project will also benefit from this technology as a step toward autonomous flight.</p>
<p>Luminar, which burst onto the autonomous vehicle scene <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/13/luminar-debuts-a-sensor-to-make-self-driving-cars-safer-than-human/">in April 2017</a> after operating for years in secrecy, became a publicly traded company in late 2020. The company announced in February that it would work with Volvo Cars to develop and eventually sell to other automakers an automated driving system for highways. The partnership, which is between Luminar and Volvo’s self-driving software subsidiary Zenseact, builds upon an existing relationship with Volvo. The two companies are combining their tech to create what Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell described as a “holistic autonomous vehicle stack” made for production vehicles. Volvo will be the first customer. Russell and Zenseact CEO Ödgärd Andersson said at the time that they plan to also offer this system to other automakers.</p>
<p>Last year, ahead of its public debut, Luminar also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/mobileye-taps-luminar-to-supply-lidar-for-its-robotaxi-fleet/">locked in a supplier deal</a> to furnish Intel subsidiary Mobileye with lidar for its fleet of autonomous vehicles. Under that contract, Luminar&#8217;s lidar will be part of Mobileye&#8217;s first-generation fleet of driverless vehicles, which are being piloted in Dubai, Tel Aviv, Paris, China and Daegu City, South Korea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sign language is used by millions of people around the world, but unlike Spanish, Mandarin or even Latin, there&#8217;s no automatic translation available for those who can&#8217;t use it. <a href="https://www.slait.ai/">SLAIT</a> claims the first such tool available for general use, which can translate around 200 words and simple sentences to start — using nothing but an ordinary computer and webcam.</p>
<p>People with hearing impairments, or other conditions that make vocal speech difficult, number in the hundreds of millions, rely on the same common tech tools as the hearing population. But while emails and text chat are useful and of course very common now, they aren&#8217;t a replacement for face-to-face communication, and unfortunately there&#8217;s no easy way for signing to be turned into written or spoken words, so this remains a significant barrier.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen attempts at automatic sign language (usually American/ASL) translation for years and years. In 2012 Microsoft awarded its Imagine Cup to a student team that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/09/enable-talk-imagine-cup/">tracked hand movements with gloves</a>; in 2018 I wrote about SignAll, which has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/14/signall-is-slowly-but-surely-building-a-sign-language-translation-platform/">working on a sign language translation booth</a> using multiple cameras to give 3D positioning; and in 2019 I noted that a new hand-tracking algorithm called MediaPipe, from Google&#8217;s AI labs, could lead to advances in sign detection. Turns out that&#8217;s more or less exactly what happened.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/PcZbajccCdU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>SLAIT is a startup built out of research done at the Aachen University of Applied Sciences in Germany, where co-founder Antonio Domènech built a small ASL recognition engine using MediaPipe and custom neural networks. Having proved the basic notion, Domènech was joined by co-founders Evgeny Fomin and William Vicars to start the company; they then moved on to building a system that could recognize first 100, and now 200 individual ASL gestures and some simple sentences. The translation occurs offline, and in near real time on any relatively recent phone or computer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140747" style="width: 739px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/slait-trans-asl-crop.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140747" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2140747 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/slait-trans-asl-crop.gif" alt="Animation showing ASL signs being translated to text, and spoken words being transcribed to text back." width="729" height="292" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2140747" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SLAIT</p></div></p>
<p>They plan to make it available for educational and development work, expanding their dataset so they can improve the model before attempting any more significant consumer applications.</p>
<p>Of course, the development of the current model was not at all simple, though it was achieved in remarkably little time by a small team. MediaPipe offered an effective, open-source method for tracking hand and finger positions, sure, but the crucial component for any strong machine learning model is data, in this case video data (since it would be interpreting video) of ASL in use — and there simply isn&#8217;t a lot of that available.</p>
<p>As they recently explained <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ1FJP7uO9Y">in a presentation for the DeafIT conference</a>, the first team evaluated using an older Microsoft database, but found that a newer Australian academic database had more and better quality data, allowing for the creation of a model that is 92 percent accurate at identifying any of 200 signs in real time. They have augmented this with sign language videos from social media (with permission, of course) and government speeches that have sign language interpreters — but they still need more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2143831" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Deaf-Understand-Hearing-1-www.slait_.ai_.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2143831" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2143831 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Deaf-Understand-Hearing-1-www.slait_.ai_.gif" alt="Animated image of a woman saying &quot;deaf understand hearing&quot; in ASL." width="400" height="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2143831" class="wp-caption-text">A GIF showing one of the prototypes in action — the consumer product won&#8217;t have a wireframe, obviously. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> SLAIT</p></div></p>
<p>Their intention is to make the platform available to the deaf and ASL learner communities, who hopefully won&#8217;t mind their use of the system being turned to its improvement.</p>
<p>And naturally it could prove an invaluable tool in its present state, since the company&#8217;s translation model, even as a work in progress, is still potentially transformative for many people. With the amount of video calls going on these days and likely for the rest of eternity, accessibility is being left behind — only some platforms offer automatic captioning, transcription, summaries, and certainly none recognize sign language. But with SLAIT&#8217;s tool people could sign normally and participate in a video call naturally rather than using the neglected chat function.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the short term, we’ve proven that 200 word models are accessible and our results are getting better every day,&#8221; said SLAIT&#8217;s Evgeny Fomin. &#8220;In the medium term, we plan to release a consumer facing app to track sign language. However, there is a lot of work to do to reach a comprehensive library of all sign language gestures. We are committed to making this future state a reality. Our mission is to radically improve accessibility for the Deaf and hard of hearing communities.&#8221;</p>

<p>He cautioned that it will not be <em>totally</em> complete — just as translation and transcription in or to any language is only an approximation, the point is to provide practical results for millions of people, and a few hundred words goes a long way toward doing so. As data pours in, new words can be added to the vocabulary, and new multigesture phrases as well, and performance for the core set will improve.</p>
<p>Right now the company is seeking initial funding to get its prototype out and grow the team beyond the founding crew. Fomin said they have received some interest but want to make sure they connect with an investor who really understands the plan and vision.</p>
<p>When the engine itself has been built up to be more reliable by the addition of more data and the refining of the machine learning models, the team will look into further development and integration of the app with other products and services. For now the product is more of a proof of concept, but what a proof it is — with a bit more work SLAIT will have leapfrogged the industry and provided something that deaf and hearing people both have been wanting for decades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disasters are, unfortunately, a growth business, and the frontlines that were once distant have moved much closer to home. Wildfires, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes — let alone a pandemic — has forced much of the United States and increasingly large swaths of the world to confront a new reality: few places are existentially secure.</p>
<p>How we respond to crises can radically adjust the ledger of mortality for the people slammed by these catastrophes. Good information, fast response, and strong execution can mean the difference between life and death. Yet, frontline workers often can’t get the tools and training they need, particularly new innovations that may not wind their way easily through the government supply chain. Perhaps most importantly, they often need post-traumatic care far after a disaster his dissipated.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.riskandreturn.com">Risk &amp; Return</a> is a unique venture fund and philanthropic hybrid that has set its mission to seek and finance the next-generation of technologies to help first responders not only on the frontlines, but even after as they confront the strains both physical and mental from missions they undertake.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The family of organizations sees a spectrum from emergency workers in the United States to U.S. military veterans, all of whom share similar challenges and need solutions today — solutions that can often be hard to finance for traditional VCs who aren’t aware of the unique needs of this community.</p>
<p>The group was founded by Robert Nelsen, who made his name as a co-founder and managing director of biotech VC leader ARCH Venture Partners, <a href="https://www.archventure.com/arch-venture-partners-announces-1-46-billion-raised-in-two-new-funds-to-invest-in-transformative-biotechnology-companies/">which last year announced a $1.5 billion pair of funds</a>. He’s joined by board chairman Bob Kerrey, the former co-chair of the 9/11 Commission as well as former governor and senator of Nebraska, and managing director Jeff Eggers, a Navy SEAL who served as senior director of Afghanistan and Pakistan on President Barack Obama’s National Security Council.</p>
<p>Nelsen had been thinking through the idea when he met Kerrey, who recalled the conversation happening during a fundraising event for Navy SEALs. “There has been a lot of suffering for those who have been on the frontlines,” Kerrey said. “Bob had this idea, and I thought it was a really smart idea, to try to take a different approach to philanthropic efforts.” They linked up with Eggers and the trio brought Risk &amp; Return to fruition.</p>
<p>The venture fund is $25 million, with about 35% of it already deployed. The fund has had a big emphasis on mental health for first responders, with 75% of the companies funded broadly in that category.</p>
<p>The fund’s first investment was into <a href="https://www.altoneuroscience.com">Alto Neuroscience</a>, which is developing precision medicine tools to treat post-traumatic stress. The fund has also invested in behavioral management startup <a href="https://www.neuroflow.com">NeuroFlow</a>; alternative well-being assessment tool <a href="https://qntfy.com">Qntfy</a>; Spear Human Performance, which is a brand-new spinout focused on connecting commercial and health data sources to optimize human performance; and <a href="https://xtremity.com">Xtremity</a>, which is designing better connection sockets for prosthetics. The fund has invested in another six startups including Perimeter, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/when-wildfires-rage-close-perimeter-wants-to-tell-you-where-to-go/">which I profiled a few weeks ago</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JvSg77dDCh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/when-wildfires-rage-close-perimeter-wants-to-tell-you-where-to-go/">When wildfires rage close, Perimeter wants to tell you where to go</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;When wildfires rage close, Perimeter wants to tell you where to go&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/when-wildfires-rage-close-perimeter-wants-to-tell-you-where-to-go/embed/#?secret=JvSg77dDCh" data-secret="JvSg77dDCh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This isn’t your typical venture portfolio, and that’s exactly what Risk &amp; Return wants to focus on. Eggers said that “We love that type of technology since it has that dual purpose: going to serve the first responder on the ground, but the community is also going to benefit.”</p>
<p>While many of the startups the firm has invested in obviously have a focus on first responders, the technologies they develop don’t have to be limited to just that market. Kerrey noted that “Every veteran is a civilian, [and] these aren’t businesses targeting the military market.” Given the last year, “it’s hard to find a human being in this pandemic that hasn’t suffered at least some PTSD,” referencing post-traumatic stress disorder. Sales to governments can be incredibly challenging, and the ultimate market for the kinds of specialized mental health services that frontline workers need may not be as commercially viable as one would hope.</p>
<p>While the government does research and innovation in this category, Kerrey sees a huge opportunity for the private sector to get more involved. “One thing that you could do in the private sector that is difficult in the public sector is look for alternative therapies for PTSD,” he said, noting that areas like psychedelics have intrigued the private sector even while the government would mostly not touch the category today. Risk &amp; Return has not made an investment in that space at this time though.</p>
<p>Half of the returns from the fund will stream into Risk &amp; Return’s philanthropic arm, which writes grants to charities along the same thesis of aiding frontline workers both on the job and after it. The organizations hope that by approaching the complicated response space with a multi-pronged approach, they can match potential needs with different sources of capital that are most appropriate.</p>
<p>We’ve increasingly seen this hybrid for-profit/non-profit venture model in other areas. <a href="https://www.norrsken.vc">Norrsken</a> is a Swedish foundation and venture fund that is investing in areas like mental health, climate change, and other categories from the UN Sustainable Development Goals. <a href="https://solve.mit.edu">MIT Solve</a> is another program that is working on hybrid approaches to startup innovation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/20/mit-solve-launches-global-challenge-around-health-security-and-pandemics/">such as in pandemics and health security</a>. While disasters are always looming, it’s great to see more innovation in financing this critical category of technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">iOS 14.5 — the latest version of Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system — is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/ios-14-5-goes-live-with-watch-unlocking-tracking-transparency-and-kissing-emojis/">launching today</a>, and with it comes a much-discussed new privacy feature called App Tracking Transparency.</p>
<p>The feature was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-ios-14-ad-tracking/">first announced nearly a year ago</a>, although the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/apple-delay-ios-14-privacy-ad-tracking/">delayed the launch</a> to give developers more time to prepare. Since then, support for the feature has already gone live in iOS and some apps have already adopted it (for example, I&#8217;ve seen tracking requests from Duolingo and Venmo), but now Apple says it will actually start enforcing the new rules.</p>
<p>That means iPhone owners will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/apple-app-tracking-transparency-details/">start seeing many more privacy prompts</a> as they continue using their regular apps, each one asking for permission to &#8220;track your activity across other companies’ apps and websites.&#8221; Every app that requests tracking permission will also show up in a Tracking menu within your broader iOS Privacy settings, allowing you to toggle tracking on and off any time — for individual apps, or for all of them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What does turning tracking on or off actually do? If you say no to tracking, the app will no longer be able to use Apple&#8217;s IDFA identifier to share data about your activity with data brokers and other third parties for ad-targeting purposes. It also means the app can no longer use other identifiers (like hashed email addresses) to track you, although it may be more challenging for Apple to actually enforce that part of the policy.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2143772" style="width: 496px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2143772" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2143772" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?w=486" alt="Apple App Tracking Transparency" width="486" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg 1463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2143772" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s been intense debate around App Tracking Transparency in the lead up to its launch. The pro-ATT side is pretty easy to explain: There&#8217;s a tremendous amount of personal information and activity that&#8217;s being collected about consumers without their consent (as Apple outlined in a report called <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf">A Day in the Life of Your Data)</a>, and this gives us a simple way to control that sharing.</p>
<p>However, Facebook has argued that by dealing a serious blow to ad targeting, Apple is also hurting small businesses that depend on targeting to affordable, effective ad campaigns.</p>
<p>The social network even took out ads in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">declaring that it’s “standing up to Apple for small businesses everywhere.&#8221;</a> (The Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/facebooks-laughable-campaign-against-apple-really-against-users-and-small">dismissed the campaign</a> as &#8220;a laughable attempt from Facebook to distract you from its poor track record of anticompetitive behavior and privacy issues as it tries to derail pro-privacy changes from Apple that are bad for Facebook’s business.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Others have suggested that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-eric-seufert-about-apple-facebook-and-mobile-advertising/">these changes could do &#8220;existential&#8221; damage to some developers and advertisers</a>, while also benefiting Apple&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>The full impact will depend, in part, on how many people choose to opt out of tracking. It&#8217;s hard to imagine many normal iPhone owners saying yes when these prompts start to appear — especially since developers are <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">not allowed to restrict any features</a> based on who opts into or out of tracking. However mobile attribution company AppsFlyer says that early data suggests that <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/blog/att-opt-in-rates-higher/">opt-in rates could be as high as 39%</a>.</p>

<p>The most long-awaited update from a purely user standpoint is probably the ability to unlock the phone using an Apple Watch. It’s another useful addition for the company’s wearable, but more importantly, it comes after a year of frustrated mask wearers hoping for a work around for face unlock.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>When wearing a mask, the handset will default to the Watch (once watchOS 7.4 is installed), sending a notification to the wearable, along with a haptic buzz.</p>

<p>A big new arrival on the security side, as well, with the addition of app tracking transparency. Anthony wrote about the feature in a post earlier this month, noting,</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple will actually start enforcing its new rules, meaning that iPhone users will probably start seeing a lot more requests. Those requests will appear at various points during the usage of an app, but they’ll all carry a standardized message asking whether the app can “track your activity across other companies’ apps and websites,” followed by a customized explanation from the developer.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, get ready for a lot of pop-up notifications – but for a good cause.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has spent years reinforcing macOS with new security features to make it tougher for malware to break in. But a newly discovered vulnerability broke through most of macOS&#8217; newer security protections with a double-click of a malicious app, a feat not meant to be allowed under Apple&#8217;s watch.</p>
<p>Worse, evidence shows a notorious family of Mac malware has already been exploiting this vulnerability for months before it was subsequently patched by Apple this week.</p>
<p>Over the years, Macs have adapted to catch the most common types of malware by putting technical obstacles in their way. macOS flags potentially malicious apps masquerading as documents that have been downloaded from the internet. And if macOS hasn&#8217;t reviewed the app — a process Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/apple-notarized-mac-malware/">calls notarization</a> — or if it doesn&#8217;t recognize its developer, the app won&#8217;t be allowed to run without user intervention.</p>
<p>But security researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/cedowens">Cedric Owens</a> said the bug he found in mid-March bypasses those checks and allows a malicious app to run.</p>
<p>Owens told TechCrunch that the bug allowed him to build a potentially malicious app to look like a harmless document, which when opened bypasses macOS&#8217; built-in defenses when opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the user would need to do is double click — and no macOS prompts or warnings are generated,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. Owens built a proof-of-concept app disguised as a harmless document that exploits the bug to launch the Calculator app, a way of demonstrating that the bug works without dropping malware. But a malicious attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely access a user&#8217;s sensitive data simply by tricking a victim into opening a spoofed document, he explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140253" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140253" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2140253" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/popping-calc.gif" alt="GIF showing a proof of concept app opening uninhibited on an unpatched macOS computer." width="900" height="710" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140253" class="wp-caption-text">The proof-of-concept app disguised as a harmless document running on an unpatched macOS machine. (Image: supplied)</p></div></p>
<p>Fearing the potential for attackers to abuse this vulnerability, Owens reported the bug to Apple.</p>
<p>Apple told TechCrunch it fixed the bug in macOS 11.3. Apple also patched earlier macOS versions to prevent abuse, and pushed out updated rules to XProtect, macOS&#8217; in-built anti-malware engine, to block malware from exploiting the vulnerability.</p>
<p>Owens asked Mac security researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickwardle">Patrick Wardle</a> to investigate how — and why — the bug works. In a <a href="https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x64.html">technical blog post</a> today, Wardle explained that the vulnerability triggers due to a logic bug in macOS&#8217; underlying code. The bug meant that macOS was misclassifying certain app bundles and skipping security checks, allowing Owens&#8217; proof-of-concept app to run unimpeded.</p>
<p>In simple terms, macOS apps aren&#8217;t a single file but a bundle of different files that the app needs to work, including a property list file that tells the application where the files it depends on are located. But Owens found that taking out this property file and building the bundle with a particular structure could trick macOS into opening the bundle — and running the code inside — without triggering any warnings.</p>
<p>Wardle described the bug as rendering macOS&#8217; security features as &#8220;wholly moot.&#8221; He confirmed that Apple&#8217;s security updates have fixed the bug. &#8220;The update will now result in the correct classification of applications as bundles and ensure that untrusted, unnotarized applications will (yet again) be blocked, and thus the user protected,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>With knowledge of how the bug works, Wardle asked Mac security company Jamf to see if there was any evidence that the bug had been exploited prior to Owens&#8217; discovery. Jamf detections lead <a href="https://twitter.com/jbradley89">Jaron Bradley</a> confirmed that a sample of the Shlayer malware family exploiting the bug was captured in early January, several months prior to Owens&#8217; discovery. Jamf also published <a href="https://www.jamf.com/blog/shlayer-malware-abusing-gatekeeper-bypass-on-macos/">a technical blog post</a> about the malware.</p>
<p>&#8220;The malware we uncovered using this technique is an updated version of Shlayer, a family of malware that was first discovered in 2018. Shlayer is known to be one of the most abundant pieces of malware on macOS so we&#8217;ve developed a variety of detections for its many variants, and we closely track its evolution,&#8221; Bradley told TechCrunch. &#8220;One of our detections alerted us to this new variant, and upon closer inspection we discovered its use of this bypass to allow it to be installed without an end user prompt. Further analysis leads us to believe that the developers of the malware discovered the zero-day and adjusted their malware to use it, in early 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shlayer is an adware that intercepts encrypted web traffic — including HTTPS-enabled sites — and injects its own ads, making fraudulent ad money for the operators.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s often installed by tricking users into downloading fake application installers or updaters,&#8221; said Bradley. &#8220;The version of Shlayer that uses this technique does so to evade built-in malware scanning, and to launch without additional &#8216;Are you sure&#8217; prompts to the user,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most interesting thing about this variant is that the author has taken an old version of it and modified it slightly in order to bypass security features on macOS,&#8221; said Bradley.</p>
<p>Wardle has also <a href="https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x64.html#detections">published a Python script</a> that will help users detect any past exploitation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time Shlayer has evaded macOS&#8217; defenses.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, when we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/filing-snap-paid-124m-for-fit-analytics-as-it-gears-up-for-a-bigger-e-commerce-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Snap paid $124 million for Fit Analytics, we also noted that, according to the <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001564408/9f8cb681-bb0d-474b-801f-4e85df9906eb.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC filing</a> that disclosed the value of the acquisition, Snap made another deal in the same quarter for a smaller amount, $7.6 million. We&#8217;ve now learned was that the acquisition was: Snap has confirmed to us that it has acquired <a href="https://pixel8.earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pixel8earth</a>, a company developing 3D mapping technology, specifically based on crowdsourced data.</p>
<p>Pixel8earth is based out of Boulder, Colorado, and four employees from the startup are joining Snap to work on map product development. Specifically, they will be building out tools that will work with Snap&#8217;s location-based augmented reality experiences along the lines of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/snapchat-boosts-its-ar-platform-with-voice-search-local-lenses-and-snapml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Lenses that Snapchat introduced last June</a> at its annual Partner Summit developer event.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve reported previously, we&#8217;ve heard that this year&#8217;s Partner Summit is likely to see some launches related to Snap&#8217;s wider e-commerce strategy, and we now understand that it will also feature some news on the AR mapping front, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if Snap (or Snapchat) will keep Pixel8earth going, or if it will roll selected technology and further development into products like Snap Map, but given the price of the deal, it&#8217;s most likely more of a talent acquisition.</p>
<p>For the record, Pixel8earth &#8212; co-founded by Sean Gorman and Pramukta Kumar, two repeat founders and mapping PhDs &#8212; had built a platform where it encouraged people (dubbed &#8220;ambassadors&#8221;) to join the platform and use their 360 cameras and other cameras to record and contribute information to the startup&#8217;s global mapping database. (In that regard, the tech was not unlike what Mapillary, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/mapillary-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got acquired by Facebook</a>, had developed.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2143767" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="386" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png 1868w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png?resize=768,436 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png?resize=680,386 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png?resize=1536,872 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-5.13.55-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Snap has largely been building its mapping experiences around the idea of using maps to increase and improve engagement with its users. One of the bigger deals it&#8217;s made on that front was its acquisition in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/snapchat-buys-zenly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 of Paris-based startup Zenly</a>, an app that let you opt in to be able to be discovered by your friends on a map. Other mapping acquisitions have included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/snap-acquires-streetcred/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StreetCred</a>, announced in January of this year. StreetCred&#8217;s service was shut down after the deal, but it was also based around the idea of crowdsourcing points-of-interest and other mapping data, paying contributors in crypto tokens and putting the information &#8220;on the blockchain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snap&#8217;s mapping efforts already have some decent traction and differentiation as a more &#8220;personalised&#8221; map &#8212; in contrast with, for example, the very much used Google Maps experience, which is about universal accuracy and being as thorough as possible, not exactly personalised (unless you are logged in and have locations saved, but even so, not with strong social features in mind).</p>
<p>At its <a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_downloads/2021/03/Transcript-(Full)-v3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor day</a> in February Snap noted that Snap Map was used by more than 250 million Snapchatters monthly. &#8220;On other platforms, everyone sees the same Map. But on Snapchat we are building the world&#8217;s most personal Map,&#8221; Jacob Andreou, VP product, said there. &#8220;Your Snap Map reflects your world; it features the people, places, and activities you care about, and no two are the same. The Map is built to see where your friends are and what they’re up to quickly and easily. This kind of sharing is at it’s best with close friends, a perfect fit for the best friends network that is unique to Snapchat. The version of the map in our app today is one that has been relentlessly improved in conversation with our community over the last two years leveraging this data-informed approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>While some of that usage and growth will have inevitably been curtailed in the last year, given the pandemic-enforced lockdowns and reduction in travel, Evan Spiegel, Snap&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, also said last week in its earnings that this might be turning a corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are optimistic about the engagement trends we are seeing as the world is beginning to open up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As things began to open up in the United States in late February, we saw inflection points in key behaviors like Story posting and engagement with the Map.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while engagement is definitely something Snap has developed, it seems monetization might well be on the cards, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Local, digital advertising is an established market – it has a playbook, and we’re confident that this will be an important part of our business in the future,&#8221; said Peter Sellis, senior director of product, at its recent <a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_downloads/2021/03/Transcript-(Full)-v3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor day</a>. &#8220;But we want to do it right.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has slowly been testing out some more commercial features like Promote Local Place to give smaller businesses, and specifically retailers, a boost, which was the first time Snap had put businesses on the Snap Map.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re going to spend a lot of time expanding these products to work for the largest multi-location enterprises in 2021,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;but they were honestly reactive to the pandemic, and we feel that we have yet to truly build on the potential of the Map.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems that Pixel8earth could be a sign of how Snap and its flagship app Snapchat plan to do that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.weav.co">Weav</a>, which is building a universal API for commerce platforms, is emerging from stealth today with $4.3 million in funding from a bevy of investors, and a partnership with Brex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded last year by engineers Ambika Acharya, Avikam Agur and Nadav Lidor after participating in the W20 YC batch, Weav joins the wave of fintech infrastructure companies that aim to give fintechs and financial institutions a boost. Specifically, Weav’s embedded technology is designed to give these organizations access to “real time, user-permissioned” commerce data that they can use to create new financial products for small businesses.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its products allow its customers to connect to multiple platforms with a single API that was developed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically for the commerce platforms that businesses use to sell products and accept payments. Weav operates under the premise that allowing companies to build and embed new financial products creates new opportunities for e-commerce merchants, creators and other entrepreneurs. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2143719" style="width: 616px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2143719" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2143719" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/weav_founders_2.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="606" height="455" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/weav_founders_2.jpg 3264w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/weav_founders_2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/weav_founders_2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/weav_founders_2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/weav_founders_2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/weav_founders_2.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/weav_founders_2.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/weav_founders_2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2143719" class="wp-caption-text">Left to right: Co-founders Ambika Acharya, Nadav Lidor and Avikam Agur; Image courtesy of Weav</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a short amount of time, Weav has seen impressive traction. Recently, Brex </span><a href="https://twitter.com/brexHQ/status/1369442191609913356"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched</span></a> <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/faster-payments/2021/brex-instant-payouts-live-shopify-sellers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instant Payouts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Shopify sellers using the Weav API. It supports platform integrations such as Stripe, Square, Shopify and PayPal. (More on that later.) Since its API went live in January, “thousands” of businesses have used new products and services built on Weav&#8217;s infrastructure, according to Lidor. Its API call volume is growing 300% month over month, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, the startup has attracted the attention of a number of big-name investors, including institutions and the founders of prominent fintech companies. Foundation Capital led its $4.3 million seed round, which also included participation from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y Combinator, Abstract Ventures, Box Group, LocalGlobe, Operator Partners, Commerce Ventures and SV Angel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slew of founders and executives also put money in the round, including Brex founders Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi; Ramp founder Karim Atiyeh; Digits founders Jeff Seibert and Wayne Chang; Hatch founder Thomson Nguyen; GoCardless founder Matt Robinson and COO Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas; Vouch founder Sam Hodges; Plaid’s Charley Ma as well as executives from fintechs such as Square, Modern Treasury and Pagaya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foundation Capital’s Angus Davis said his firm has been investing in fintech infrastructure for over a decade. And personally, before he became a VC, Davis was the founder and CEO of Upserve, a commerce software company. There, he says, he witnessed firsthand “the value of transactional data to enable new types of lending products.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foundation has a thesis around the type of embedded fintech that Weav has developed, according to Davis. And it sees a large market opportunity for a new class of financial applications to come to market built atop Weav’s platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were excited by Weav&#8217;s vision of a universal API for commerce platforms,” Davis wrote via email. “Much like Plaid and Envestnet brought universal APIs to banking for consumers, Weav enables a new class of B2B fintech applications for businesses.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How it works</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weav says that by using its API, companies can prompt their business customers to “securely” connect their accounts with selling platforms, online marketplaces, subscription management systems and payment gateways. Once authenticated, Weav aggregates and standardizes sales, inventory and other account data across platforms and develops insights to power new products across a range of use cases, including lending and underwriting; financial planning and analysis; real-time financial services and business management tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last few years, there&#8217;s been a rise of API companies, as well as openness in the financial system that&#8217;s largely been focused on consumers, Lidor points out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For example, Plaid brings up very rich data about consumers, but when you think about businesses, oftentimes that data is still locked up in all kinds of systems,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re here to provide some of the building blocks and the access to data from everything that has to do with sales and revenue. And, we&#8217;re really excited about powering products that are meant to make the lives of small businesses and e-commerce, sellers and creators much easier and be able to get them access to financial products.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of Brex, Weav’s API allows the startup to essentially offer instant access to funds that otherwise would take a few days or a few weeks for businesses to access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Small businesses need access as quickly as possible to their revenue so that they can fund their operations,” Lidor said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brex co-CEO Henrique Dubugras said that Weav’s API gives the company the ability to offer real-time funding to more customers selling on more platforms, which saved the company “thousands of engineering hours” and accelerated its rollout timeline by months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, the company liked what it saw, considering that its founders personally invested in Weav. Is Weav building the &#8220;Plaid for commerce&#8221;? Guess only time will tell.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Honest Company, a heavily venture-backed consumer goods company, announced an IPO price range this morning, telling investors that it <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001530979/000119312521130292/d27841ds1a.htm">expects</a> to sell shares in its debut at $14 to $17 apiece.

<hr />
<p>Honest&#8217;s IPO is not very large. The company&#8217;s own offered shares are worth $109.7 million at the top end of its range. Furthermore, because the company&#8217;s final private raise was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-honest-company-gets-200-million-investment-from-private-equity-firm-1528309613">worth $200 million back in 2018</a>, it&#8217;s a comparatively modest sum.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;re digging into the Honest Company&#8217;s IPO pricing: We&#8217;ll calculate its IPO valuation range across a few different share counts, bring to bear its final private valuations and compare the entire dataset to its preliminary Q1 2021 numbers.</p>

That&#8217;s an enormous bet.</p>
<p>Per its filings, Alba remains the company&#8217;s chief creative officer and chairs its board.</p>
<p>We owe it to our general understanding of the venture market to better understand what Honest is worth and why. Is this a company going public while markets are hot so it can try to limp across the finish line? Or is Honest something honestly more exciting? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>Honest Company&#8217;s IPO worth</h2>
<p>Using a simple share count of 90,518,137 outstanding after its IPO, Honest is worth $1.27 billion to $1.54 billion at $14 to $17 per share. On a fully diluted basis, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/81137/Natural-CPG-brand-The-Honest-Company-sets-terms-for-$400-million-IPO">Renaissance Capital calculates</a> that the former startup is worth $1.6 billion at its midpoint value, a figure that we estimate rises to around $1.75 billion at the top end of its anticipated price range.</p>
<p>Are those strong numbers? There are two ways to measure; against the company&#8217;s final private price, or we can use its recent financial performance as a yardstick.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mere weeks after rival corporate spend startup <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a> announced that it raised a two-part round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/">worth $115 million at a $1.6 billion valuation</a>, this morning <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> disclosed a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210426005623/en/Brex-Announces-Series-D-Investment-Round">$425 million Series D</a> led by Tiger Global.</p>
<p>The new capital marks Brex&#8217;s largest fundraise to date, and was compiled at a valuation that is more than double its most recent private valuation. According to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/brex/company_financials">Crunchbase data</a>, Brex&#8217;s mid-2020 Series C valued the company at just over $3.0 billion, including the investment&#8217;s $150 million in issued equity.</p>
<p>The dueling rounds raised by Brex and Ramp underscore how active their product category is proving to be. Far from its roots in merely offering perk-laden corporate cards to growing companies, Brex and its myriad rivals &#8212; including Utah unicorn <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a>, and others &#8212; are building software suites around their core plastic efforts to help companies manage all elements of their spending.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A growing rift is showing in how, compared to some rivals, the categories&#8217; largest players, including Brex, Divvy and Ramp, forgo charging for their software, content to eat off other revenue sources including interchange. Airbase, in contrast, charges for its software.</p>
<p><del>Don&#8217;t expect the software arms race between corporate spend startups&#8217; unicorns to lead to more corporate spend startups deriving software revenues in addition to their current income sources; each is growing their spend rapidly enough to warrant more time with their foot on the customer growth pedal over working to juice more per-customer revenue in the short-term.</del> Update: Boy was <em>that</em> wrong. Brex announced, in a separate release so we missed it at first, that they have put together a new service <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210426005625/en/Brex-Unveils-All-In-One-Financial-Solution-For-Businesses">called Brex Premium</a> that costs $49 per month. More on that shortly, but we wanted to update this article ASAP.</p>
<p>Ramp, for example, disclosed that it is nearly on a $1 billion spend-managed run rate. Brex, worth a multiple of the younger startup, is presumably above that mark.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Brex, curious about its 2020 and Q1 2021 growth results. The company provided a statement to TechCrunch, claiming that it is &#8220;onboarding thousands of new tech and non-tech customers every month.&#8221; Brex also said that it grew its &#8220;total customer&#8221; figure by 80% in the first quarter, &#8220;with total monthly customer additions increasing by 5x.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s precisely the sort of growth that makes late-stage investors excited. TechCrunch is speaking with Brex CEO shortly; more after that call.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As businesses continue to look for better ways to work more efficiently, a pioneer in the space of low-code tools to help automate how apps work together is announcing a round of funding on the back of impressive early traction.</p>
<p>Berlin-based <a href="https://n8n.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">n8n</a> &#8212; which provides a framework for both technical and non-technical people to synchronize and integrate data and workflows &#8212; has raised a $12 million in a Series A round of funding.</p>
<p>The startup plans to use the money to continue expanding its team, which now numbers 60 people, and to expand its platform and the services it provides to users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, n8n can help link up and integrate data and functions between more than 200 established applications, as well as any custom apps or services that you might be using in your specific organization. And since launching in October 2019, the startup has picked up an impressive 16,000 users &#8212; including both developers and &#8220;citizen developers&#8221; (those whose jobs might be described as non-technical but they are not afraid to be more hands-on in trying to build in ways to work better).</p>
<p>Now it wants to make the service easier for more of the latter group to get stuck in with using it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are still seen as a technical product and less of one for citizen developers,&#8221; founder and CEO Jan Oberhauser said in an interview. &#8220;Our plan is to make n8n simpler to use, so that it&#8217;s much easier to adopt. We want to give everyone technical superpowers, whether it&#8217;s the marketing team or the IT department.&#8221; That means for example building not just chatbots but more intelligent ones, or creating new ways of visualizing data in Slack or something else altogether. And n8n&#8217;s platform can also be used to build automation within products for example to monitor performance and flag when something might need maintenance.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Felicis Ventures, with Sequoia Capital, firstminute Capital and Harpoon Ventures also participating. Sequoia and firstminute <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/n8n-a-fair-code-workflow-automation-platform-raises-seed-from-sequoia-as-vc-firm-steps-up-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-led n8n&#8217;s seed round about a year ago</a>, which also included participation from Eventbrite&#8217;s Kevin Hartz, Supercell&#8217;s Ilkka Paananen, and unnamed early employees of Google and Zendesk, among others. The startup has now raised around $14 million and is not disclosing valuation.</p>
<p>There are a number of low-code and no-code startups on the market today and many of them have been seeing a surge of in interest in the last year. It&#8217;s a trend I suspect was brought about in no small part by the arrival of Covid-19.</p>
<p>The pandemic not only led to more people working remotely and relying on apps and other cloud-based services to get what they needed to do done, but in many cases it led organizations to refocus on how they were working, and what could be improved. In some cases, it also has meant a severe tightening of belts, and so companies are needing to do more with less human power, another factor leading to more proactive efforts to use software to get more out of&#8230; software.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s meant more strain on IT teams, and that too has led to more people within departments themselves getting proactive in improving their own workflows.</p>
<p>Other startups in the space include <a href="https://bryter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bryter</a> (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/berlins-bryter-raises-66m-more-to-take-its-no-code-tools-for-enterprises-to-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a $66 million Series B</a> earlier this month) and <a href="https://genesis.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genesis</a> (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/genesis-raises-45m-to-expand-its-fintech-focussed-low-code-platform-to-more-verticals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $45 million in March</a>), along with <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sequoia-buys-shares-in-elusive-startup-zapier-at-multibillion-dollar-valuation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/airtable-is-now-valued-at-5-77b-with-a-fresh-270-million-in-series-e-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airtable</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/rows-formerly-dashdash-raises-16m-to-build-and-populate-web-apps-using-only-spreadsheet-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rows</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/london-based-gyana-raises-3-9m-for-a-no-code-approach-to-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gyana</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/ushur-raises-25m-for-its-no-code-platform-to-build-customer-communication-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ushur</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/creatio-raises-68m-as-the-low-code-space-keeps-attracting-huge-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creatio</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/easysend-raises-16m-from-intel-more-for-its-no-code-approach-to-automating-b2c-interfaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasySend</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/captivateiq-raises-46m-for-its-no-code-sales-commissions-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CapivateIQ</a>, some of which are coming to the market with a variety of solutions targeting a set of generic tools, while others are building solutions for more narrow use cases.</p>
<p>In the case of n8n, the company might be considered a &#8220;pioneer&#8221; in the space not just because of its focus on the growing area of low-code tools, but because of how it views the world of software.</p>
<p>[gallery type="slideshow" ids="1958989,1958987,1958986"]</p>
<p>The basic approach n8n is taking is around the idea of &#8220;fair code.&#8221; This is somewhat similar to open-source, and is analogous to a freemium-style model for the concept. The code is available in a <a href="https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public repository</a> and the idea is that this will never disappear (one issue many enterprises face on the bleeding edge of tech: companies and their services sometimes shut down). However, n8n itself limits how much it can be used for free, before users start to pay to use it so that n8n can monetize its work, which it does in the form of consulting and integration services. (In the case of n8n, that limit <a href="https://community.n8n.io/t/doubts-about-fair-code-license/2502" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks to be up to a limit of $30,000</a> in support services revenues.)</p>
<p>Oberhauser was an early proponent of the concept of n8n and he <a href="https://faircode.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">runs a site</a> dedicated to spreading the word. (You can also read about the different approaches to fair code, and some of what led to the creation of the concept, <a href="https://fosspost.org/fair-code-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.)</p>
<p>While basic and limited access to the code will remain free, and even as a company like n8n aims to make it easier and easier for non-developers to build integrations, there will be areas that need attention to make those services accessible to the people within an organization. For starters, there is the issue of setting up the basic integration connectors, especially in cases where the software a company is using is proprietary or customized.</p>
<p>There is also another issue that is likely to become more prominent as low-code and no-code tools continue to grow in popularity, and that is security. While IT departments may not have oversight of every single integration, but neither will the security teams, which means that new data vulnerabilities might well become more commonplace, too. For all of these reasons, n8n is betting that there will still be some integration and consulting involved in implementation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost every company needs help connecting outside and internal systems, to make it easier for people to get started,&#8221; Oberhauser said.</p>
<p>Aydin Senkut, founder and managing partner of Felicis Ventures, who led the round, said that what attracted him to n8n was the extensibility of the platform &#8212; that it could be applied not just for app integration and workflow automation in those apps but a much wider set of use cases &#8212; and the very early traction of 16,000 users that it&#8217;s picked up with very little fanfare, a sign that the service has some stickiness and usefulness to it.</p>
<p>And the fact that it lets developers &#8212; &#8220;citizen&#8221; or otherwise &#8212; play with so many options is also a key part of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;W<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">e feel that data is the new oil, and one of the special things here is not just low or no-code <em>per se</em>, but how n8n is making it seamless and easy to connect tens or even hundreds of apps.&#8221; Senkut said that it reminded him a little of Felicis&#8217; early investment in Plaid. &#8220;Essentially, the more data and APIs you have the more valuable the company can be. I think to measure the potential of a company, look at the APIs. If you can connect disparate things together, that is key.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to building a successful startup, biotech and hardware happen to be two of the most difficult verticals in the tech industry. But Oura is doing it anyway.</p>
<p>The health and fitness tracking ring has been used in a number of studies around COVID-19 and been worn by NBA and WNBA players to help prevent outbreaks in the league. Oura has raised nearly $50 million from investors including Lifeline Ventures, Bold Capital Partners and Forerunner.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re thrilled to have Forerunner&#8217;s Eurie Kim and Oura CEO Harpreet Rai join us on a forthcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-forerunner-and-oura">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kim is herself a former entrepreneur and joined Forerunner in 2012. She sits on the boards of companies like The Farmer’s Dog, Curology, Attabotics, Oura Ring, Eclipse, Juni, among others, and found herself on the Midas Brink List in 2020.</p>
<p>Rai, for his part, is CEO at Oura, where he leads a team of over 150 employees. Before Oura, Rai was a portfolio manager at Eminence Capital for nine years.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-forerunner-and-oura">Extra Crunch Live</a>, the duo will talk about how Oura went about raising its $28 million Series B round and why Kim took a bet on the startup. We&#8217;ll also ask about tactical advice for founders looking to fundraise and grow their businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku is alerting its customers that they may lose access to the YouTube TV channel on its platform after negotiations with Google went south. The company alleges that Google is attempting to use its monopoly power to insist on unfair, anticompetitive terms with regard to how Roku handles search results for YouTube content, customer data and more. The email also urges Roku customers to reach out to Google to voice their concerns.</p>
<p>Details of the spat were first reported by <a href="https://www.axios.com/roku-google-youtube-tv-dispute-525316c1-4d66-44e3-a96a-40db7b10e05b.html">Axios</a>.</p>
<p>Roku says Google continues to ask for special treatment on Roku&#8217;s streaming media player platform, which today includes a dedicated search results row for YouTube that appear after a customer performs a universal voice search. Roku claims YouTube over a year ago threatened to remove the YouTube app if Roku didn&#8217;t comply with this particular demand. It now wants to ask Google to not preference its own service in the search results, as it believes this row doesn&#8217;t serve its customer base well. The row returns YouTube results at the top of the search results page, even when this isn&#8217;t relevant to what the customer was searching for in the first place, Roku explains.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition, Google is adding on to its earlier demands with a new series of requests to only show YouTube or YouTube Music search results when the YouTube app is open &#8212; even overriding Roku user preferences to do so. Today, Roku allows its customers to set their own preferred music service provider for their music requests. Google&#8217;s ask is that if a user presses the Roku voice search button while YouTube is open, that query returns only YouTube results. That means YouTube Music would play any music request, and YouTube search results would appear for any other request.</p>
<p>Roku says this also disadvantages the customer because it doesn&#8217;t honor the user&#8217;s preferences &#8212; like if their preferred music service is Roku, for example. Also, Roku couldn&#8217;t even use the search results to tell the customer if they&#8217;ve already paid for the content being requested &#8212; like showing them a movie they&#8217;ve already bought on another service or one of their paid subscriptions that carries the title.</p>
<p>There are other concerning demands as well, including asks for customer data that goes outside the realm of industry standard practices, Roku told TechCrunch. Roku says this data isn&#8217;t available to any other partners and it doesn&#8217;t want to share it with Google, either.</p>
<p>Finally, Google wants to reserve the right to ask for new certification requirements, as needed, for carrying YouTube &#8212; changes that could impact the cost of Roku&#8217;s hardware. By increasing the specs &#8212; say, asking for a faster processor speed or more memory &#8212; Google could close the gap between Roku&#8217;s low-end $29 device with Google&#8217;s new $50 Chromecast with Google TV. Roku admits Google has asked for those sorts of hardware changes before, but it now wants that in the YouTube TV agreement, too.</p>
<p>More broadly, Roku is concerned how Google is leveraging YouTube as it asks for these changes, even though the agreement being negotiated is YouTube TV. It says its deal with YouTube is not up for renewal at this time. We understand Google may have also issued similar requests to some TV platforms, but not larger companies like Apple (for Apple TV).</p>
<p>&#8220;Google is attempting to use its YouTube monopoly position to force Roku into accepting predatory, anti-competitive and discriminatory terms that will directly harm Roku and our users,&#8221; a Roku spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Given antitrust suits against Google, investigations by competition authorities of anti-competitive behavior and Congressional hearings into Google’s practices, it should come as no surprise that Google is now demanding unfair and anti-competitive terms that harm Roku’s users,&#8221; they said.</p>

<p>Roku declined to say whether or not it would bring its complaints before antitrust investigators, noting that, for now, its focus is on closing the deal for YouTube TV.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s common to see carriage disputes when contracts come up for renewal, those tend to involve requests for more money to allow a platform &#8212; like a pay TV provider, for example &#8212; to continue to carry a channel or group of channels. In this case, Roku says its not asking for any change in economic terms.</p>
<p>In the email sent to customers this morning at 6 AM, Roku says it won&#8217;t accept Google&#8217;s terms and its &#8220;anticompetitive requirements to manipulate your search results, impact the usage of your data, and ultimately cost you more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The full letter is below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Roku Customer,​</p>
<p>We are sending this email to update you on the possibility that Google may take away your access to the YouTube TV channel on Roku. Recent negotiations with Google to carry YouTube TV have broken down because Roku cannot accept Google’s unfair terms as we believe they could harm our users. ​</p>
<p>Ensuring a great streaming experience at an exceptional value is the core of our business. We will always stand up for our users, which is why we cannot accept Google&#8217;s unfair and anticompetitive requirements to manipulate your search results, impact the usage of your data and ultimately cost you more. ​</p>
<p>While we are deeply disappointed in Google’s decision to use their monopoly power to try and force terms that will directly harm streamers, we remain committed to reaching an agreement with Google that preserves your access to YouTube TV, protects your data and ensures a level playing field for companies to compete. We encourage you to contact Google and urge them to reach an agreement to continue offering YouTube TV on Roku and to follow standard industry practices pledging not to require access to sensitive search data or to manipulate your search results. ​</p></blockquote>
<p>Google has provided a comment, which claims Roku is making inaccurate allegations:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We have been working with Roku in good faith to reach an agreement that benefits our viewers and their customers. Unfortunately, Roku often engages in these types of tactics in their negotiations. We’re disappointed that they chose to make baseless claims while we continue our ongoing negotiations. All of our work with them has been focused on ensuring a high quality and consistent experience for our viewers. We have made no requests to access user data or interfere with search results. We hope we can resolve this for the sake of our mutual users.</em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The two founders of Crusoe Energy think they may have a solution to two of the largest problems facing the planet today &#8212; the increasing energy footprint of the tech industry and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the natural gas industry.</p>
<p>Crusoe, which uses excess natural gas from energy operations to power data centers and cryptocurrency mining operations, has just raised $128 million in new financing from some of the top names in the venture capital industry to build out its operations &#8212; and the timing couldn&#8217;t be better.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/climate/methane-leaks-united-nations.html">Methane emissions are emerging as a new area of focus</a> for researchers and policymakers focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keeping global warming within the 1.5 degree targets set under the Paris Agreement. And those emissions are just what Crusoe Energy is capturing to power its data centers and bitcoin mining operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The reason why addressing methane emissions is so critical in the short term is because these greenhouse gases trap more heat than their carbon dioxide counterparts and also dissipate more quickly. So dramatic reductions in methane emissions can do more in the short term to alleviate the global warming pressures that human industry is putting on the environment.</p>
<p>And the biggest source of methane emissions is the oil and gas industry. In the U.S. alone roughly 1.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas is flared daily, said Chase Lochmiller, a co-founder of Crusoe Energy. About two thirds of that is flared in Texas with another 500 million cubic feet flared in North Dakota, where Crusoe has focused its operations to date.</p>
<p>For Lochmiller, a former quant trader at some of the top American financial services institutions, and Cully Cavness, a third generation oil and gas scion, the ability to capture natural gas and harness it for computing operations is a natural combination of the two men&#8217;s interests in financial engineering and environmental preservation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2143695" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2143695" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2143695" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-467110070.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="716" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-467110070.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-467110070.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-467110070.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-467110070.jpg?resize=768,537 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-467110070.jpg?resize=680,476 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-467110070.jpg?resize=1536,1074 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-467110070.jpg?resize=2048,1432 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-467110070.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2143695" class="wp-caption-text">NEW TOWN, ND &#8211; AUGUST 13: View of three oil wells and flaring of natural gas on The Fort Berthold Indian Reservation near New Town, ND on August 13, 2014. About 100 million dollars worth of natural gas burns off per month because a pipeline system isn&#8217;t in place yet to capture and safely transport it . The Three Affiliated Tribes on Fort Berthold represent Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nations. It&#8217;s also at the epicenter of the fracking and oil boom that has brought oil royalties to a large number of native americans living there.

<p>The two Denver natives met in prep-school and remained friends. When Lochmiller left for MIT and Cavness headed off to Middlebury they didn&#8217;t know that they&#8217;d eventually be launching a business together. But through Lochmiller&#8217;s exposure to large scale computing and the financial services industry, and Cavness assumption of the family business they came to the conclusion that there had to be a better way to address the massive waste associated with natural gas.</p>
<p>Conversation around Crusoe Energy began in 2018 when Lochmiller and Cavness went climbing in the Rockies to talk about Lochmiller&#8217;s trip to Mt. Everest.</p>
<p>When the two men started building their business, the initial focus was on finding an environmentally friendly way to deal with the energy footprint of bitcoin mining operations. It was this pitch that brought the company to the attention of investors at Polychain, the investment firm started by Olaf Carlson-Wee (and Lochmiller&#8217;s former employer), and investors like Bain Capital Ventures and new investor Valor Equity Partners.</p>
<p>(This was also the pitch that Lochmiller made to me to cover the company&#8217;s seed round. At the time I was skeptical of the company&#8217;s premise and was worried that the business would just be another way to prolong the use of hydrocarbons while propping up a cryptocurrency that had limited actual utility beyond a speculative hedge against governmental collapse. I was wrong on at least one of those assessments.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Regarding questions about sustainability, Crusoe has a clear standard of only pursuing projects that are net reducers of emissions. Generally the wells that Crusoe works with are already flaring and would continue to do so in the absence of Crusoe’s solution. The company has turned down numerous projects where they would be a buyer of low cost gas from a traditional pipeline because they explicitly do not want to be net adders of demand and emissions,&#8221; wrote a spokesman for Valor Equity in an email. &#8220;In addition, mining is increasingly moving to renewables and Crusoe’s approach to stranded energy can enable better economics for stranded or marginalized renewables, ultimately bringing more renewables into the mix. Mining can provide an interruptible base load demand that can be cut back when grid demand increases, so overall the effect to incentivize the addition of more renewable energy sources to the grid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other investors have since piled on including: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowercarbon Capital, DRW Ventures, Founders Fund, Coinbase Ventures, KCK Group, Upper90, Winklevoss Capital, Zigg Capital and Tesla co-founder JB Straubel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company now operate 40 modular data centers powered by otherwise wasted and flared natural gas throughout </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado. Next year that number should expand to 100 units as Crusoe enters new markets such as Texas and New Mexico. Since launching in 2018, Crusoe has emerged as a scalable solution to reduce flaring through energy intensive computing such as bitcoin mining, graphical rendering, artificial intelligence model training and even protein folding simulations for COVID-19 therapeutic research.</span></p>
<p>Crusoe boasts 99.9% combustion efficiency for its methane, and is also bringing additional benefits in the form of <a href="https://dakotacarrier.com/crusoe-dcn-collaboration/">new networking buildout at its data center and mining sites</a>. Eventually, this networking capacity could lead to increased connectivity for rural communities surrounding the Crusoe sites.</p>
<p>Currently, 80% of the company&#8217;s operations are being used for bitcoin mining, but there&#8217;s increasing demand for use in data center operations and some universities, including Lochmiller&#8217;s alma mater of MIT are looking at the company&#8217;s offerings for their own computing needs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s very much in an incubated phase right now,&#8221; said Lochmiller. &#8220;A private alpha where we have a few test customers&#8230; we&#8217;ll make that available for public use later this year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Crusoe Energy Systems should have the lowest data center operating costs in the world, according to Lochmiller and while the company will spend money to support the infrastructure buildout necessary to get the data to customers, those costs are negligible when compared to energy consumption, Lochmiller said.</p>
<p>The same holds true for bitcoin mining, where the company can offer an alternative to coal powered mining operations in China and the construction of new renewable capacity that wouldn&#8217;t be used to service the grid. As cryptocurrencies look for a way to blunt criticism about the energy usage involved in their creation and distribution, Crusoe becomes an elegant solution.</p>
<p>Institutional and regulatory tailwinds are also propelling the company forward. Recently New Mexico passed new laws limiting flaring and venting to no more than 2 percent of an operator&#8217;s production by April of next year and North Dakota is pushing for incentives to support on-site flare capture systems while Wyoming signed a law creating incentives for flare gas reduction applied to bitcoin mining. The world&#8217;s largest financial services firms are also taking a stand against flare gas with BlackRock calling for an end to routine flaring by 2025.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Where we view our power consumption, we draw a very clear line in our project evaluation stage where we’re reducing emissions for an oil and gas projects,&#8221; Lochmiller said. </span></p>

<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>This weekend had a key story, earnings are on the way and there is a huge number of funding rounds to talk about. Ready?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Indian government&#8217;s move to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/india-orders-twitter-to-take-down-tweets-critical-of-its-coronavirus-handling/">remove a number of social media posts</a> critical of its handling of COVID-19 was the key news item this weekend. As the country&#8217;s healthcare system buckles, and deaths spike, the move by the current administration to censor the internet was just about as bad a look you could imagine. At least in terms of a tech response.</li>
<li>Also this weekend conversation continued about Substack&#8217;s recent push to hire away well-known writers from traditionally respected publications continued, with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-times-responds-to-the-substack-boom-2021-4">Insider reporting</a> that six-figure offers to join the paid newsletter platform are the norm.</li>
<li>This morning we&#8217;re focused on the impending earnings deluge. Major American tech companies, along with some key social media and e-commerce names, will report, giving us a look into how tech companies performed in the first quarter of 2021. We already know that the venture market was hot during the period. How business fared, however, is less clear.</li>
<li>On the funding round beat, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/mighty-networks-raises-50m-to-build-a-creator-economy-for-the-masses/">Mighty Networks raised $50 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/indias-lead-school-raises-30-million-to-reach-more-students/">LEAD School raised $30 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/yc-backed-kidato-raises-1-4m-seed-to-scale-its-online-school-for-k-12-students-in-africa/">Kidato raised $1.4 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/robo-advisor-stashaway-gets-25m-series-d-led-by-sequoia-capital-india/">StashAway stashed away $25 million</a> and <a href="https://containerjournal.com/news/news-releases/kyligence-raises-70-million-series-d-funding-round/">Kyligence put together a $70 million Series D</a> of its own.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Honest Company also set an early IPO price range after we stopped recording. More to come on the IPO front. Chat Wednesday!</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Those of us who read a lot of tech and business publications have heard for years about the cybersecurity skills gap. Studies often claim that millions of jobs are going unfilled because there aren’t enough qualified candidates available for hire.</p>
<p>I don’t buy it.</p>
<p>The basic laws of supply and demand mean there will always be people in the workforce willing to move into well-paid security jobs. The problem is not that these folks don’t exist. It’s that CIOs or CISOs typically look right past them if their resumes don’t have a very specific list of qualifications.</p>
<p>In many cases, hiring managers expect applicants to be fully trained on all the technologies their organization currently uses. That not only makes it harder to find qualified candidates, but it also reduces the diversity of experience within security teams — which, ultimately, may weaken the company’s security capabilities <em>and</em> its talent pool.</p>
<p>At Netskope, we take a different approach to staffing for security roles. We know we can teach the cybersecurity skills needed to do the job, so instead, there are two traits we consider more important than specific technical expertise: One is a hunger to learn more about security, which suggests the individual will take the initiative to continuously improve their skills. The other is possession of a skill set that no one else on our security team has.</p>
<h2>Overemphasis on technical skills creates an artificial talent shortage</h2>
<p>To understand why I believe our approach has helped us build a stronger security team, think about the long-term benefits of hiring someone with a specific security skill set: How valuable will that exact knowledge be in several years? Probably not very.</p>

<p>Even the most basic security technologies are incredibly dynamic. In most companies, the IT infrastructure is currently in the midst of a massive transition from on-premises to cloud-based systems. Security teams are having to learn new technologies. More than that, they are having to adopt an entirely new mindset, shifting from a focus on protecting specific pieces of hardware to a focus on protecting individuals and applications as their workloads increasingly move outside the corporate network.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple this morning announced a sweeping plan to invest north of $430 billion over the next five years. The company says the deal involves “economic benefits” in all 50 states and would create, all told, 20,000 additional jobs in the United States over that time period.</p>
<p>The plan is an extension of one it announced in 2018, raising the original $350 billion goal by 20%. At the center of the announcement is the long-anticipated creation of an additional campus in North Carolina. That involves a $1 billion investment in the Research Triangle, including 3,000 jobs that will focus on emerging fields like machine learning and AI.</p>
<p>“Innovation has long been North Carolina’s calling card and Apple’s decision to build this new campus in the Research Triangle showcases the importance of our state’s favorable business climate, world-class universities, our tech-ready workforce, and the welcoming and diverse communities that make so many people want to call North Carolina home,&#8221; state leaders said in <a href="https://governor.nc.gov/news/advisory-governor-legislative-leaders-hold-availability-after-announcement-new-apple-campus">a joint statement</a>. &#8220;This announcement will benefit communities across our state and we are proud to work together to continue to grow our economy and bring transformational industries and good paying jobs to North Carolina.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has also outlined a $100 million fund for community and schools in the surrounding Raleigh-Durham area, as well as a $110 million spend on infrastructure.</p>
<p>“At this moment of recovery and rebuilding, Apple is doubling down on our commitment to US innovation and manufacturing with a generational investment reaching communities across all 50 states,” Tim Cook said in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years/">a release tied to the news</a>. “We’re creating jobs in cutting-edge fields — from 5G to silicon engineering to artificial intelligence — investing in the next generation of innovative new businesses, and in all our work, building toward a greener and more equitable future.”</p>

<p>Other U.S. operation initiatives have been outlined for the company’s native California, as well as Colorado, Texas, Washington and Iowa. California gets the biggest initial boost here, with 5,000 more employees being added to its San Diego office and 3,000 more for Culver City. Indiana, Kentucky and Texas have already begun adding positions as part of the $5 billion Advanced Manufacturing Fund the company launched in 2017.</p>
<p>The news comes a week after Wisconsin announced plans to dramatically scale back the creation of a Foxconn plant set to manufacture flatscreen TVs. During his presidency, Donald Trump had called the planned factory “the eighth wonder of the world,” and central to his plans to return manufacturing to the U.S., while courting various high-profile tech executives, including Cook.</p>
