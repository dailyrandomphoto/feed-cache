										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency business that counts founder Moxie Marlinspike of the encrypting messaging app Signal as its earliest technical advisor, has raised $66 million in Series B funding from a long list of investors, including Alameda Research, Berggruen Holdings, BlockTower Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures, Vy Capital, and earlier backers General Catalyst and Future Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The all-equity round brings the four-year-old, San Francisco-based company&#8217;s total funding to $107 million altogether, including a $30 million round led by Binance Labs back in 2018. According to founder and CEO Joshua Goldbard, the newest round values the outfit at $1.066 billion.</span></p>
<p>As we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/mobilecoin-a-cryptocurrency-involving-signal-founder-moxie-marlinspike-just-raised-venture-funding/">reported</a> earlier this year, <span style="font-weight: 400;">MobileCoin is focused on enabling privacy-protecting payments made through “near instantaneous transactions” over one’s phone. Indeed, a month after we published that piece, Signal rolled out support for MobileCoin as a payment feature that its users (only in the UK for now) can use to pay for a service or product while enjoying greater privacy than might be possible otherwise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marlinspike <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-mobilecoin-payments-messaging-cryptocurrency">told Wired</a> back in April that because MobileCoin is a so-called <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-are-privacy-coins-and-how-do-they-differ-from-bitcoin">privacy coin</a> designed to protect users&#8217; identities and the details of their payments on a blockchain, that it&#8217;s an ideal fit for Signal. &#8220;There&#8217;s a palpable difference in the feeling of what it&#8217;s like to communicate over Signal, knowing you&#8217;re not being watched or listened to, versus other communication platforms. I would like to get to a world where not only can you feel that when you talk to your therapist over Signal, but also when you pay your therapist for the session over Signal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>According to Goldbard, MobileCoin is also being used to transact by users of <a href="https://mixin.one/messenger">Mixin Messenger</a>, is a China-based open-source private messenger based on Signal Protocol that enables individuals to send cryptocurrencies to their phone contacts.</p>
<p>MobileCoin&#8217;s actual digital coins have <a href="https://cryptopro.app/price/mobilecoin/">fluctuated wildly</a> in value since they began trading in December of last year on the cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, run by entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, who also founded the quantitative crypto trading firm Alameda Research (which just invested in MobileCoin).</p>
<p>It is also available to buy and sell on the non-U.S. crypto trading platforms Bitfinex, BigOne, and HotBit. Goldbard says there&#8217;s no reason that U.S. exchanges couldn&#8217;t also list the coin for trade, though that&#8217;s not the case currently.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s entirely up to [them] when they list assets, and no one knows ahead of time when your asset will be listed,&#8221; Goldbard offers, dismissing questions about U.S. regulators who&#8217;ve cracked down on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256407/telegram-cryptocurrency-shutdown-sec-gram">similar efforts</a> and pointing instead to MobileCoin&#8217;s relatively newness as its biggest challenge right now. &#8220;Most coins take a long time to list, to be honest.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for whether Goldbard or his early team members have sold some of company&#8217;s coins &#8212; they spiked in price this past spring &#8212; he says that &#8220;management has not sold any coins.&#8221; Asked whether the same is true of Marlinspike, Goldbard says that he &#8220;can&#8217;t speak for Moxie.&#8221; (Marlinspike told Wired in April that neither he nor Signal owned any MobileCoins at the time. We&#8217;ve since asked the company whether Marlinspike has ever owned any MobileCoins and also whether he owns or previously owned shares in MobileCoin as an early advisor to the company and have yet to hear back.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even assuming that MobileCoin is more secure than other options, it is still not foolproof. Among the risks involved in storing cryptocurrency on a phone are potentially losing it if the phone is left unlocked or the radio on the phone is hacked or if, say, iOS itself is hacked. </span></p>
<p>It does offer another advantage, though, argues Goldbard. He says MobileCoin is more environmentally friendly than  cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that rely on &#8216;proof of work,&#8217; where individuals on a network compete with computing power to solve cryptographic puzzles and consume<span style="font-weight: 400;"> large amounts of electricity along the way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MobileCoin instead relies on a mechanism called a &#8220;federated byzantine agreement,&#8221; wherein different validators &#8212;  people who agree to store data, process transactions, and add new blocks to the blockchain to earn more cryptocurrency &#8212; decide which other validators they trust, and when enough circles of trusted validators overlap, consensus is reached. The algorithm requires fewer people and less energy while remaining decentralized, says Goldbard.</span></p>
<p>MobileCoin currently has 40 employees and is &#8220;hiring as fast as possible,&#8221; says Goldbard. Tragically, the company&#8217;s head of engineering, Toby Segaran, who was previously an engineer with both Google and Reddit, passed away unexpectedly last week. Meanwhile, MobileCoin brought aboard is first head of compliance, David Ackerman, last month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fifteen years ago, Aydin Senkut, a former Google exec, was an outsider in venture circles that didn&#8217;t take seriously his ambitions to become a top VC. Now, his firm, <a href="https://www.felicis.com/">Felicis Ventures</a>, is announcing $900 million in capital commitments across two new funds &#8212; a $600 million early stage fund and a $300 million opportunities-type fund to back its fastest-growing winners &#8212; and its limited partners wanted the firm to invest even more.</p>
<p>Yes, a part of that is the current go-go market. Much more, however, ties to Felicis&#8217;s performance, which has been strong from nearly its outset and goes a long way in explaining how a firm that initially launched with $4 million from Senkut&#8217;s own pocket has, in recent years, has been roughly doubling how much it invests with every new fund. (Its seventh and last flagship fund closed with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/felicis-ventures-wraps-up-its-newest-fund-with-510-in-committed-capital/">$510 million</a> in March of last year. According to Felicis, across all funds, including losses, it has now produced 6x cash-on-cash returns for its investors.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to pinpoint how Felicis has managed to be right about so many of its investments, which include early bets on Shopify in Canada, Canva in Australia, and Ayden in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Shopify, which went public in 2015, is now a $185 billion company. Canva&#8217;s private market valuation hit <a href="https://www.canva.com/newsroom/news/canva-announces-usd-15-billion-valuation-launches-suite-presentations-products-workplace/">$15 billion</a> this spring. Ayden, which went public in 2018, currently boasts a market cap of $85 billion.</p>

<p>While the firm has long been willing to invest in far-flung places &#8212; a differentiator that more firms have begun to copy &#8212; it has also chosen well in the U.S., with bets on Plaid (valued at roughly <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/plaid-stockpiles-funding-with-investments-by-jpmorgan-american-express">$14 billion</a> right now); publicly traded Guardant Health; Credit Karma (acquired by Intuit for roughly $7 billion); and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-16/recursion-pharmaceuticals-jumps-in-debut-after-436-million-ipo">newly public</a> Recursion Pharmaceuticals (among others).</p>
<p>Asked about its approach, Senkut &#8212; who runs the firm with fellow general partners Wesley Chan, Sundeep Peechu, Victoria Treyger, Niki Pezeshki, and an incoming general partner, Viviana Faga &#8212; says the firm basically makes both safe and more ambitious bets, writing bigger checks to surer things so it can gamble on new ideas, like a company that makes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/has-a-startup-finally-found-one-of-food-sciences-holy-grails-with-its-healthy-sugar-substitute/">sugar substitute</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Has a startup finally found one of food science&#8217;s holy grails with its healthy sugar substitute?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/has-a-startup-finally-found-one-of-food-sciences-holy-grails-with-its-healthy-sugar-substitute/embed/#?secret=7DMtMibZae" data-secret="7DMtMibZae" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The partners also stress the importance to the firm of maintaining a high net promoter score. They treat founders well, and founders treat them well, in turn, is the gist, including giving the firm a glowing reference in a competitive situation.</p>
<p>Says Senkut, &#8220;We want founders to say, &#8216;This person has helped me so much, I would almost do anything to take money from this person or to put them on my board,&#8217; versus the traditional method [wherein the VC says], &#8216;We&#8217;re writing a $50 million check and because we invested that money, we&#8217;ll dictate who&#8217;s on the board and what to do.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Not last, says Peechu, who joined Felicis roughly 11 years ago, Felicis often jumps in when the water is still cold. &#8220;The fund strategy is not always to make the most amount of money,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Sometimes, we&#8217;re investing to 2% or 3% of a company because that 3% could potentially give us an incredible learning that might help us invest the next $30 million to $50 million in that category.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peechu points, for example, to an early bet on video game developer Tapulous that led to a bigger bet on game maker Rovio. &#8220;A lot of a lot of people will wait until the first big company is created in a category and they give that company a pool of money,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;But by that time, 10 years might have passed and you&#8217;ve lost a lot of economic opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Felicis tends to &#8220;risk adjust&#8221; instead, he adds. &#8220;We say, &#8216;Hey, I think this interesting category might be emerging,&#8217; Then we go in. Maybe we invest a bit earlier and own a little less, but we pay attention to what&#8217;s happening,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s the only way you can understand what&#8217;s happening on the field.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, it has far more capital to deploy toward that end. Indeed, its new funds will see Felicis double its investment range from checks that range from $1 million to $25 million to now upwards of $50 million in one slug.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Apeel developed a plant-based layer for the surface of fruits and vegetables, that is tasteless and odorless, and keeps moisture in, while letting oxygen out.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://apeelsciences.com/">Apeel Sciences</a>, a food system innovation company, is out to prevent food produced globally from ending up in the landfill, especially as <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/05/food-waste-coronavirus-pandemic-164557">pressures from the global pandemic</a> affect the food supply chain.</p>
<p>The company just added $250 million in Series E funding, giving it a valuation of $2 billion, to speed up the availability of its longer-lasting produce in the U.S. (where <a href="https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs">approximately 40% of food is wasted</a>), the U.K. and Europe.</p>
<p>Existing investor Temasek led the round and was joined by a group of new and existing investors, including Mirae Asset Global Investments, GIC, Viking Global Investors, Disruptive, Andreessen Horowitz, Tenere Capital, Sweetwater Private Equity, Tao Capital Partners, K3 Ventures, David Barber of Almanac Insights, Michael Ovitz of Creative Artists Agency, Anne Wojcicki of 23andMe, Susan Wojcicki of YouTube and Katy Perry.</p>
<p>With the new funding, Apeel has now raised over $635 million since the company was founded in 2012. Prior to this round, the company brought in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/preventing-food-waste-nets-apeel-250-million-from-singapores-government-oprah-and-katy-perry/">$250 million in Series D</a> funding in May 2020.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Preventing food waste nets Apeel $250 million from Singapore&#8217;s government, Oprah and Katy Perry&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/preventing-food-waste-nets-apeel-250-million-from-singapores-government-oprah-and-katy-perry/embed/#?secret=IQP6pJJ2hI" data-secret="IQP6pJJ2hI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Santa Barbara-based Apeel developed a plant-based layer for the surface of fruits and vegetables that is tasteless and odorless and that keeps moisture in while letting oxygen out. It is those two factors in particular that lead to grocery produce lasting twice as long, James Rogers, CEO of Apeel, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Apeel installs its application at the supplier facilities where the produce is packed into boxes. In addition to that technology, the company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apeel-acquires-imaging-technology-to-unlock-the-insights-in-every-bite-of-fruit-301288845.html">acquired ImpactVision</a> earlier this year to add another layer of quality by integrating imaging systems on individual pieces as they move through the supply chain to optimize routing so more produce that is grown is eaten.</p>
<p>“One in nine people are going hungry, and if three in nine pieces of produce are being thrown away, we can be better stewards of the food we are throwing away,” Rogers said. “This is a solvable problem, we just have to get the pieces to the right place at the right time.”</p>
<p>The company is not alone in tackling food waste. For example, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shelf-engine-raises-41-million-to-transform-the-grocery-supply-chain-quadrupling-retailer-profits-while-reducing-food-waste-by-one-third-301250109.html">Shelf Engine</a>, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/imperfect-foods-secures-95mm-series-d-investment-commitment-301212899.html">Imperfect Foods</a>, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200717005006/en/Cambridge-Crops-Rebrands-as-Mori-and-Raises-12-Million-in-Series-A-Funding-to-Combat-Food-Waste">Mori</a> and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/exclusive-phood-heats-up-2m-seed-to-reduce-food-waste/">Phood Solutions</a> are all working to improve the food supply chain and have attracted venture dollars to go after that mission.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, the amount of food people were eating was growing each year, but that trend is reversed, Rogers explained. Consumers are more aware of the food they eat, they are shopping less frequently, buying more per visit and more online. At the same time, grocery stores are trying to sort through all of that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We can’t create these supply networks alone, we do it in concert with supply and retail partners,” he said. “Grocery stores are looking at the way shoppers want to buy things, while we look at how to partner to empower the supply chain. What started with longer-lasting fruits and vegetables, is becoming how we provide information to empower them to do it without adding to food waste.”</p>
<p>Since 2019, Apeel has prevented 42 million pieces of fruit from going to waste at retail locations; that includes up to 50% reduction in avocado food waste with corresponding sales growth. Those 42 million pieces of saved fruit also helped conserve nearly 4.7 billion liters of water, Rogers said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over the past year, Apeel has amassed a presence in eight countries, operating 30 supply networks and  distributing produce to 40 retail partners, which then goes out to tens of thousands of stores around the world.</p>
<p>The new funding will accelerate the rollout of those systems, as well as co-create another 10 supply networks with retail and supply partnerships by the end of the year. Rogers also expects to use the funding to advance Apeel’s data and insights offerings and future acquisitions.</p>
<p>Thomas Park, president and head of alternative investments at Mirae Asset Global Investments, said his firm has been investing in environmental, social and governance-related companies for awhile, targeting companies that “make a huge impact globally and in a way that is easy for us to understand.”</p>
<p>The firm, which is part of Mirae Asset Financial Group, often partners with other investors on venture rounds, and in Apeel’s case with Temasek. It also invested with Temasek in Impossible Foods, leading its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/impossible-foods-gobbles-up-another-200-million/">Series F round</a> last year.</p>
<p>“When we saw them double-down on their investment, it gave us confidence to invest in Apeel and an opportunity to do so,” Park said. “Food waste is a global problem, and after listening to James, we definitely feel like Apeel is the next wave of how to attack these huge problems in an impactful way.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Canada Drives currently operates in British Columbia and Ontario. With the new funds, Canada Drives hopes to expand to Alberta in the next month, according to co-CEO Cody Green.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada Drives, an online car shopping and delivery platform, announced $79.4 million ($100 million CAD) in Series B funding that it will use to expand its service across Canada. </span></p>
<p>It was founded in 2010 as a car financing company but launched an e-commerce platform for new and used vehicles last year. Canada Drives currently operates in British Columbia and Ontario, two provinces that together comprise about half of Canada&#8217;s entire population, according to Canada&#8217;s 2016 census. With the new funds, Canada Drives hopes to expand to Alberta in the next month, according to co-CEO Cody Green.</p>
<p>The pandemic boosted online shopping in every industry, and car buying is no exception. And now that companies like Canada Drives are beginning to provide a platform to shop and buy, as well as next-day delivery, this market will only continue to grow.</p>
<p>Nobody likes going to the car dealership anyway, and the data support that: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/jd-power-sales-satisfaction-index/">A recent study by consumer intelligence company J.D. Power</a> found people are taking to digital car sales because they want to avoid face-to-face interactions and haggling with salespeople, and they like doing paperwork and financing at home. They&#8217;re also more likely to buy add-ons when they can shop at their leisure rather than experiencing the pressure of a commission-hungry dealer breathing down their necks.</p>
<p>While there are many online car shopping platforms in the U.S. that have grown in popularity over the past couple of years, like Carvana and Vroom, Canada hasn&#8217;t seen the same sort of growth. But with companies like Canada Drives and Clutch, another online car marketplace that recently raised $20 million CAD in seed funding, Canadian entrepreneurs are wising up to the model that&#8217;s already been proven across the border. The global chip shortage is also causing a growing market for used vehicles as it becomes more expensive and difficult to purchase new cars.</p>
<p>In order to meet those needs for Canadian consumers, Canada Drives is going to use its recent funding to keep enhancing the product, grow its inventory in existing and new markets, and hire around 200 people over the next year, particularly in product development, Green told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company owns its entire inventory of vehicles. It certifies, inspects and reconditions the used cars that come its way, stores them throughout its operating zones and delivers them to the customer&#8217;s door when they purchase. Customers get a seven-day trial with their vehicle, and if it&#8217;s not to their standard, they can have it picked up and returned with no questions asked.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Green said he expects to see an increasing amount of hybrid or electric vehicles on the platform, and a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch that Teslas and Nissan Leafs are already quite popular. Canada has a goal to ban the sales of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035, so it&#8217;s a roll of the dice whether the marketplace will be littered with used ICE or flush with used electric vehicles over the next couple of decades. Currently, around 5% of Canada Drives&#8217; inventory is hybrid or electric, said Green.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Our mission is to be the easiest place to buy or sell your car in Canada, and as consumer preferences change and as countries adopt forward-thinking policies with electric and hybrid, our platform is going to be able to evolve with that,&#8221; Green told TechCrunch. &#8220;As there&#8217;s more and more new electric vehicles, more will become used vehicles, and I think already that is a market that we&#8217;re over-indexed on versus the average dealer in Canada.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>This latest funding round brings Canada Drives&#8217; total funding to about $159 million ($200 million CAD) after a $100 million CAD Series A raised in 2019. The Series B round announced Wednesday was led by<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jeffrey Housenbold’s Honor Ventures with participation from KAR Global and other strategic investors. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has entered the financial services and insurance markets of India in recent years. Now it is paving the way to foray into the wealth management category.</p>
<p>The American e-commerce giant has backed Bangalore-based startup Smallcase in a $40 million Series C financing round.</p>
<p>The round was led by Faering Capital and Premji Invest as well as existing investors Sequoia Capital, Blume Ventures, Beenext, DSP Group, Arkam Ventures, WEH Ventures and HDFC Bank also participated in the new round, which brings its total to-date raise to over $65 million.</p>
<p>Founded by three IIT Kharagpur graduates in July 2015, Smallcase offers a platform to help introduce a new generation of investors to the Indian equity markets.</p>
<p>The startup offers an in-house team of licensed professionals who offer over 100 portfolios of stocks and exchange traded funds as well as provides its users access to independent investment managers, brokerages and wealth platforms.</p>
<p>The startup supports a dozen leading stock brokers in India including Tiger Global-backed Upstox, and Zerodha&#8217;s Kite.</p>
<p>Smallcase has amassed over 3 million users, who are transacting about $2.5 billion each year. It says a user can start making their investments in just two clicks after signing up for the service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We have created a new, fast-growing category of investment products by developing an ecosystem of 250+ businesses in the capital markets space including India’s largest and fastest growing brokerages, advisors, investment managers and digital wealth platforms,” said Vasanth Kamath, co-founder and chief executive of Smallcase.</p>
<p>“It has been both humbling and inspiring to see smallcases become the primary gateway to stocks &amp; ETFs for millions of new investors. This financing increases our responsibility to continue building simple, transparent and delightful experiences and platforms, while delivering more value to our users and partners. Our true success will lie in developing the core building blocks for every investor’s portfolio and becoming a key part of their toolkit,” he added.</p>
<p>The startup, which employs 200 people, said it plans to deploy the fund to broaden its technology platform and win more customers.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Amazon has backed an Indian startup. The e-commerce firm, which has deployed over $6.5 billion in its India business, has invested in ride-hailing firm Shuttl, invoice discounting marketplace exchange for MSMEs M1xchange, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/amazon-backed-indian-d2c-beauty-brand-myglamm-raises-71-million/">direct-to-customer beauty brand MyGlamm</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Amazon also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/amazon-announces-250-million-venture-fund-for-indian-startups/">unveiled a $250 million venture fund</a> to invest in Indian startups and entrepreneurs focused on digitizing small and medium-sized businesses in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson said the company invested in Smallcase through its $250 million venture fund. &#8220;As part of this Fund, we are excited to partner with smallcase in their journey to offer innovative consumer investment products. By increasing product selection and convenience, this will provide an additional channel for consumers to participate in the equity markets,&#8221; the spokesperson added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We sometimes take for granted that most anyone who wishes to become say, an Uber driver, can do so. But that assumption is a narrow view considering there are many people who would love to earn income in that way but can&#8217;t because of lack of car ownership (and all that goes with it) &#8212; especially in countries outside of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an attempt to remedy that problem, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">São Paulo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-based <a href="https://www.kovi.com.br/">Kovi</a> was founded in 2018 to give those people access to those opportunities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kovi today is announcing it has raised $104 million in a Series B round of funding co-led by Valor Capital Group and Prosus Ventures. Quona, GFC, Monashees, UVC Investimentos and Globo Ventures also participated in the financing, in addition to Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel through his family office. The round takes Kovi’s total equity raised since inception to about $145 million. The company also recently closed on a $20 million debt facility. It is not yet a unicorn, according to execs, who declined to reveal valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two former 99 (Brazil’s </span><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-you-need-to-know-about-brazils-first-tech-unicorn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first tech unicorn</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and also known as Didi) executives, Adhemar Milani Neto and João Costa, started the company, which rents vehicles to on-demand drivers who work for ride-hailing companies such as Uber, Didi and Lyft. It then expanded from on-demand drivers to food delivery workers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kovi operates its “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all inclusive” car subscription model </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">under the premise that more people in Latin America would work for these companies if they could afford to operate the necessary vehicle. In fact, an estimated 75% of Latin Americans cannot own a vehicle because of the high cost of acquisition and maintenance. Cars are </span><a href="https://www.globalfleet.com/en/taxation-and-legislation/latin-america/features/brazils-hurdles-car-ownership-fleet-management?a=DBL10&amp;t%5B0%5D=Localiza&amp;t%5B1%5D=FLeet%20LaTAm&amp;t%5B2%5D=LatAm&amp;t%5B3%5D=Brazil&amp;curl=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly more expensive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in countries like Brazil than in the U.S. and the difference is even greater when it comes to the average income of the population. Also, financing is often difficult and expensive to obtain, as credit is difficult to access in most Latin American countries. When applying for loans, 60% of applications are denied by traditional banking institutions, according to Kovi co-founder and CEO Adhemar Milani Neto. And even when approved, customers pay high interest rates that are up to 30% per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kovi gives drivers who don’t necessarily want, or cannot afford, to own a vehicle “quick access to quality cars” at what it says is “a fair price.” It operates an asset-light model, in that it does not buy vehicles but instead has inked rental agreements with OEMs such as Toyota and Volkswagen to offer vehicles to gig workers, including insurance and maintenance.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our mission is to promote a revolution in this market, making car ownership affordable, less complicated and accessible to an underserved population,” Neto said. “We want to offer a range of options to create a platform for urban mobility and create more possibilities for our customers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the startup saw its number of customers grow by more than 70%, and it now has more than 11,000 users in Brazil and Mexico. The company has 12,000 cars in its fleet and aims to add another 20,000 cars by the end of 2021. The company says its ARR (annual recurring revenue) is now roughly around $45 million, and that it is growing by at least 15% month over month. Kovi is “very close” to breaking even and plans to this year, according to Neto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our mission is to make car ownership more inclusive, human and efficient using technology and financial innovation,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What sets Kovi apart from competitors is that its cars are connected, so it uses data science and analytics to be able to offer “a better user experience and competitive prices,&#8221; believes Kovi co-founder João Costa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also over time has shifted from offering insurance through third parties to offering insurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We basically built an insurance company from scratch,” Neto said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the pandemic hit in 2020, Kovi &#8212; as did many other companies &#8212; at first saw its business slow. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the company quickly pivoted by changing its model to a pay-per-mile model so that it could act as a “Root Insurance for car owners,” Neto said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The model has worked very well for drivers, he added. The company also enhanced its B2C offering so that drivers can access a car, with “everything included,” from insurance to 24-hour road support and preventive maintenance through Kovi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once things got more back to normal, the on-demand economy scaled really fast,” Neto said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kovi also in the past year broadened its scope from a short-term car subscription to include a long-term option. That has proven successful so far, with that segment of its business growing to 35% of Kovi’s revenue already since launching in October of last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This also creates more profit for the OEMs Kovi is partnered with, Neto added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We provide a much better profitability model for them rather than just to sell to rental companies or end consumers. They make recurring revenue for 12-24 months and then resell used cars through their dealerships,” he said. “We’re now taking Kovi to the broader OEM market. We see this as a global business model that extends not only in Brazil and Mexico but across LatAm and to other developing countries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, Kovi will use its new capital to expand its service to new cities in Latin America and double down on existing operations in Brazil and Mexico. The money will also go toward technology development, specifically data management and the company’s pay-per-mile capabilities (which its founders say is unprecedented in Latin America). It also, naturally, plans to add to its 700-person team &#8212; including hiring developers, software engineers and data scientists. And, finally, Kovi plans to use some of its fresh capital to launch new financial services and products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the company began the buildout for some of those products earlier this year, launching its aforementioned auto insurance offering, dubbed Kovi Seguro &#8212; a tracked insurance for app drivers. It also plans to launch “to a rent to own&#8221; option, Neto said. So that drivers who want to own a vehicle will have a way to work toward that.</span></p>
<p>Prosus&#8217; Banafsheh Fathieh says that ultimately, Kovi is a financial services company that can offer consumers that may not qualify for credit under traditional models to incrementally work toward owning a car through a subscription plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because Kovi owns and manages their fleet during the rental period &#8212; and therefore can control the fleet remotely &#8212; it is able to cater to a severely financially underserved population that’s typically considered higher risk by creditors,&#8221; Fathieh told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valor co-founder and managing partner </span><a href="https://valorcapitalgroup.com/team/scott-sobel/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott Sobel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> believes that Kovi is “well positioned” to capture three major tailwinds that have the potential to disrupt the multibillion-dollar car ownership market of Latin America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first of those tailwinds is ride-hailing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Only in Latin America there are approximately 1.5 million on-demand drivers, and this number is expected to grow by ~2-3x this decade,” he said. “Take Uber as an example: three of its biggest markets are São Paulo, Mexico City and Rio de Janeiro.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second tailwind is car subscription. Less than 0.5% of Brazilian cars are under subscription offerings, and that number is expected to reach ~10-20% in the next five years due to consumer behavioral changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being one of the first movers in LatAm gives Kovi an edge,” Sobel told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third tailwind is auto insurance, which he thinks will be disrupted by more flexible (such as pay as you go, pay per mile, unbundled policies) customer-centric and tech-driven models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These global trends will provide greater access to millions of drivers in the region,” Sobel said. For example, as of now less than 30% of Latin American drivers have an active car insurance policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valor, he added, was impressed with Kovi’s traction and the “strong competitive moats” the company has built, including verticalized maintenance centers designed to reduce idle time and costs, a driver’s wallet, IoT systems integrating the entire fleet and “all the data.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kovi is a very smart company, obsessed with metrics, tech and product innovation,&#8221; Sobel added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A one-year-old startup that is attempting to build the railroads for e-commerce in Pakistan has just secured a mega round of funding in a major boost to the South Asia nation’s nascent startup ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.airliftexpress.com">Airlift</a> operates a quick commerce service in eight cities including Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad in Pakistan. Users can order groceries, fresh produce, other essential items including medicines as well as sports goods from Airlift website or app and have it delivered to them in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The startup said on Wednesday that it has raised $85 million in its Series B financing round at a valuation of $275 million. Harry Stebbings of 20VC and Josh Buckley of Buckley Ventures co-led the financing round, which is by far the largest for a Pakistani startup.</p>
<p>Sam Altman, former president of Y Combinator, Biz Stone, co-founder of Twitter and Medium, Steve Pagliuca, co-chairman of Bain Capital, Jeffrey Katzenberg, ex-chief executive of Disney and Quibi, and Taavet Hinrikus, founder and chief executive of TransferWise also participated in the new round, which brings the startup’s to-date raise to $110 million.</p>
<p>Stanley Tang, co-founder of DoorDash, Simon Borrero, founder and chief executive of Rappi, Baastian Lehman, founder and chief executive of Postmates, Quiet Capital and Indus Valley Capital also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>Airlift started as a transit business, building a service similar to Uber for air conditioned-buses in Pakistan. The startup quick amassed traction, clocking over 35,000 rides a day. And then the pandemic arrived, disrupting all mobility in the country.</p>
<p>That’s when Usman Gul, the founder and chief executive of Airlift, took the call to pivot to quick commerce, he told TechCrunch in an interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“This entire space of quick commerce is on the brink of global transformation. Airlift is in the forefront for leading that transformation in Asia and Africa,” he said. Gul said he plans to expand the service to many international markets in the next few months.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190961" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190961" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190961 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/airlift-pakistan.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="596" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/airlift-pakistan.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/airlift-pakistan.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/airlift-pakistan.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/airlift-pakistan.jpg?resize=768,447 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/airlift-pakistan.jpg?resize=680,396 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/airlift-pakistan.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190961" class="wp-caption-text">Airlift website</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Airlift’s early traction in Pakistan is a window into the future for how quick commerce will play out in the developing world,&#8221; said Altman in a statement.</p>
<p>Airlift today operates over 30 dark stores and processes hundreds of thousands of orders each month.</p>
<p>Gul said the startup has found that setting up these fulfillment centers is the most efficient way to serve the market. &#8220;The more middlemen you introduce in this chain between the items and the customers, you begin to compromise the experience,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Within the first twelve months of launch, Airlift has been able to reduce its cost of blended customer acquisition to $5 and unit costs to $2.50, it said.</p>
<p>Gul said the startup, which today employs over 100 people, plans to expand to more categories including electronics. &#8220;The idea is to expand to new categories and build the railroads to move consumer goods from manufacturers to consumers,&#8221; said Gul.</p>
<p>He left his job at DoorDash and moved back to Pakistan to start Airlift. “The idea was to create impact at the base of the pyramid and solve problems that would enrich millions of lives &#8212; for whom change is desperately needed. That drove my transition frankly,” he said.</p>
<p>“Transparently, when I first met Usman, I knew this was an entrepreneur who was going to create an industry-defining company. Humble, ambitious and strategic, Usman will be one of the great founders of this generation,&#8221; said Stebbings in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rara.delivery/">RaRa Delivery</a>’s ambitious goal is to offer same-day deliveries in Indonesia without burning cash like many on-demand logistics providers. The company announced today it has raised $3.25 million in seed funding led by Sequoia Capital India’s Surge program and East Ventures. Other participants included 500 Startups, Angel Central, GK Plug and Play and angel investors Royston Tay and Yang Bin Kwok.</p>
<p>Launched in 2019, RaRa Delivery relies on a proprietary engine that batches orders and optimizes delivery routes based on data like real-time traffic information. It currently operates in Greater Jakarta and is getting ready to expand into five other Indonesian cities this year.</p>
<p>RaRa Delivery’s goal is to integrate with all major marketplaces in Indonesia, so sellers can offer it as a delivery option to customers. It also partners with brands, small e-commerce businesses and seller aggregators. Some notable clients include e-commerce platform Blibli, coffee delivery startup Kopi Kenangan, Grab Merchant, healthcare platform Alodokter and grocery store Sayurbox. RaRa Delivery says its daily order volume has grown 15 times over the past year, due in part to increased demand for grocery and medical supply deliveries during the pandemic.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indonesian logistics startup SiCepat raises $170 million Series B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/indonesian-logistics-startup-sicepat-raises-170-million-series-b/embed/#?secret=6mTydrvJzu" data-secret="6mTydrvJzu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Before launching RaRa Delivery, co-founder and chief executive officer Karan Bhardwaj worked at Unilever, managing its e-commerce supply chain in Southeast Asia and Australasia. During that time, he dealt with many kinds of distribution channels, including marketplaces, e-commerce aggregators and last-mile delivery providers.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Bhardwaj watched customer expectations for deliveries change. Many are no longer satisfied with even next-day delivery. They want their orders delivered the same day, often within a few hours.</p>
<p>“A good experience over time becomes a need rather than a luxury,” said Bhardwaj. The United States has Amazon Prime, China has courier service SF Express and South Korea has Coupang, but “same-day delivery adoption has not reached its true potential in Indonesia because of the lack of the right supply solution, and that’s exactly what we are trying to crack.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bhardwaj added that people are willing to pay two to three times more for same-day delivery versus next day delivery, and even higher fees for deliveries within an hour.</p>
<p>But many traditional logistics players, with their hub-and-spoke distribution models, are not designed for on-demand deliveries, while on-demand providers have high operational costs because their drivers fulfill one order per trip.</p>
<p>“If a business has 10 orders, they are going to send 10 drivers and everyone is going to pick up one order,” said Bhardwaj. “They can do a three-hour delivery service, but there is no consolidation, no optimization, the cost per order is very high, there distance limits, weight limits and they don’t offer cash on delivery.”</p>
<p>RaRa Delivery’s real-time batching engine was created as a more scalable and sustainable alternative. The company’s driver fleet fulfills orders for many different types of businesses—food and beverage, grocery, healthcare and e-commerce—which all have different time requirements for their deliveries. For example, a restaurant needs deliveries to happen within an hour, but for grocery stores that timeframe can be three hours, and for e-commerce stores, up to eight hours.</p>
<p>Once orders are made, RaRa Delivery’s system groups them into batches, optimizing capacity, distance, time slots and driving routes based on real-time traffic data. A batch can have between two to 15 orders, and their composition is flexible. For example, some batches might entail a series of pick-ups followed by deliveries, while others might have pick-ups interspersed with deliveries, depending on what creates the most efficient route.</p>
<p>Bhardwaj said this increases how much RaRa Delivery’s drivers can earn because they perform multiple deliveries per trip, and reduce their downtime. Each RaRa Delivery batch takes about two to six hours to complete.</p>
<p>“In a normal on-demand scenario, a driver takes an order, finishes that order and waits for another order. That waiting time is what reduces the potential earnings of a driver,” he said.</p>
<p>RaRa Delivery also enables cash on delivery. Typically, when a delivery service offers COD, that means drivers need to go back to a hub to drop off the money. RaRa Delivery’s reconciliation product shows drivers how much cash to collect for each order. Once they are done, it generates a code that the driver can use a convenience store to deposit the cash, instead of a hub.</p>
<p>The startup’s plans for its seed funding include expanding its product ecosystem, which currently includes the batching engine, a seller portal, real-time order tracking, a chatbot for customers and the COD reconciliation.</p>
<p>It’s focused on Tier 1 cities in Indonesia for its initial rollout, before expanding into smaller cities and covering all of Indonesia within a couple of years. Then RaRa Delivery plans to expand into other countries. Bhardwaj said its batching engine is geography-agnostic, so it requires minimal localization for new markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Danggeun Market, the publisher of South Korea’s hyperlocal community app Karrot, announced it has raised $162 million in a Series D round of funding with a valuation of $2.7 billion. (By the way, Danggeun means carrot in Korean.)</p>
<p>This round of funding was led by DST Global, with additional participation from Aspex Management, Reverent Partners and existing investors such as Goodwater Capital, Altos Ventures, SoftBank Ventures Asia, Kakao Ventures, Strong Ventures and Capstone Partners.</p>
<p>The latest funding officially makes Danggeun Market a unicorn, with $205 million total raised.</p>
<p>The company plan to strengthen its capabilities in local commerce with Danggeun Pay, or Karrot Pay, which is set to launch this year, and Danggeun’s platform Karrot enables approximately 300,000 local SMB partners to go digitalized by offering offline to online (O2O) service. Danggeun Market’s consumers access everything from fresh local produce delivery to essential services, including cleaning, education, real estate brokerage and used cars in their local communities.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Danggeun Market, the South Korean secondhand marketplace app, raises $33 million Series C&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/danggeun-market-the-south-korean-secondhand-marketplace-app-raises-33-million-series-c/embed/#?secret=NMdqEiIgSg" data-secret="NMdqEiIgSg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The funding proceeds from the new round will be used for further global expansion, business diversification, R&amp;D, investment in advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning technology and recruiting team talent.</p>
<p>“Danggeun Market plans to focus on accelerating further overseas market expansion for the next two years after closing Series D funding, and in South Korea, we will diversify our business, aiming to be a super app,” co-founder and co-CEO Gary Kim said in an exclusive conversation with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Danggeun Market, which is short for &#8220;the market in your neighborhood,&#8221; was founded by Gary Kim and Paul Kim in 2015.</p>
<p>Danggeun Market also plans to launch its payment service Karrot Pay, expand offline to online (O2O) service for South Korean SMEs that use its platform Karrot and invest to develop advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning in its platform for suggesting personalized feeds for users to stay longer, Kim continued.</p>
<p>Danggeun Market is expected to get approval from South Korea&#8217;s financial supervisory service (FSS) as early as September for two licenses, such as payment gateway operator (PG) and prepaid payment means operator, to launch Danggeun Market’s payment service, Karrot Pay, this year, Kim said.</p>
<p>Danggeun Market, which already launched its global version of hyperlocal community app Karrot in the U.K. in November 2019, currently operates the Karrot app in 72 local communities in four countries: the U.K., the U.S., Canada and Japan.</p>
<p>“We see some active transactions in Manchester, Birmingham and Toronto,” Kim said. Danggeun Market launched Karrot in Canada and the U.S. in September and October 2020, respectively. In February 2021, it opened in Japan, Kim said.</p>
<p>When asked regarding the next foreign market location, “Danggeun Market will not designate a particular country this time. We will change our overseas penetration strategy slightly by opening the app Karrot globally and monitor the countries that show organic growth and then we will narrow down specific countries and cities to focus on more,” Kim said.</p>
<p>The company will still seek the high population density areas in foreign markets and keep the distance limit set, Danggeun’s unique feature that only shows people listings from sellers located within 6 km radius in South Korea and 10 miles (about 15 km) maximum for the U.K. for providing hyperlocalized community service.</p>
<p>For the next round, Gary Kim said it depends on its global expansion growth. If its global business works well and Karrot draws more global users and reaches active MAU and transactions the company has set, Danggeun Market will definitely raise another funding in two years, Kim said. “We are not in a hurry for an IPO at this stage since we can raise enough capital in the private market now. We want to consider going public after we make stable profits,” Kim said.</p>
<p>Danggeun Market now claims its total registered users exceed 21 million (South Korea has a total of 20.92 million households) and has consistently experienced over 300 % year-on-year growth since 2018.</p>
<p>The company reached 1.8 million monthly active users (MAUs) in 2019, 4.8 million MAUs in 2020 and finally increased to 14.2 million MAUs in 2021, growing 3x every year over the past three years. According to global app analytics platform App Annie, Danggeun Market users spend an average of two hours and two minutes per month on the app.</p>
<p>“Over the past few years, Danggeun Market has demonstrated overwhelming dominance in the Korean C2C market… with unique user behavior from location-based communities, Danggeun Market continues to showcase its potential as <em>the</em> hyperlocal super app,” managing partner at DST Investment Management John Lindfors said.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 highlighted the importance of people wanting to connect to their neighbors and community. When meeting a friend for a simple coffee can no longer be taken for granted, we realize all the more importance of our relationships and community. Danggeun Market’s service bridges the offline and online world, enhancing both in-person interactions as well as purely digital ones. The core of Danggeun Market’s growth is its digital end-to-end platform that allows consumers to feel both genuinely part of their communities as well as have the comfort and safety of being part of a larger network that can grow together,” co-founder and managing partner at Goodwater Capital Eric Kim said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has been extremely painful for many. But as lockdowns lifted and people began resuming their outdoor hobbies, mobile-first businesses have seen growth accelerate as consumers turned to digital tools to improve their time outdoors.</p>
<p>The Dyrt, for example, is the top camping app on the Apple and Google Play App Stores. The app sits at the confluence of two trends: An increased interest in outdoor recreation and travel, and an explosion in consumer subscription software (CSS).</p>
<p>The Dyrt launched its premium offering in 2019, The Dyrt PRO, in time to take advantage of the rising number of Americans making the great outdoors part of their lifestyle. A year later, it had a new subscriber every two minutes paying for features like offline maps and detailed camping information.</p>
<p>CSS businesses at the forefront of outdoor activities have closed major deals in recent years such as hunting app OnX (Summit Partners), hiking app Alltrails (Spectrum Equity), Surfline (The Chernin Group) and mountain bike leader Pinkbike (Outside Media). Companies like Netflix and Spotify have trained consumers to pay monthly or annual fees for software that enhances their lives, creating a business model investors view as reliable and poised for growth.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			I think of different outdoor activities almost like individual genres on Netflix. Dominating camping or surfing might be like capturing the streaming market for comedy or horror.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Fitness and the outdoor passion space is one of the most exciting CSS categories in a growing landscape that includes everything from family planning/management services to entertainment and education. I believe CSS is still in the early stages of its growth — perhaps where B2B SaaS was a decade ago.</p>
<p>So what sets apart the great CSS businesses from the good ones?</p>
<h2>Passion equals profits on the CSS flywheel</h2>
<p>The beauty of the CSS model is the complete alignment between the business and its customers. CSS companies don’t have to please advertisers, and they can design purely for their users.</p>
<p>This dynamic is particularly powerful for CSS companies in the outdoors space, which make your favorite outdoor activity better with performance analytics and enhanced information such as maps, reviews, air quality reports and fire warnings. Consumers are happy to spend money on the activities and hobbies they enjoy, and CSS companies are able to make pleasing those consumers their top priority.</p>
<p>The result is what I call the CSS flywheel, in which a quality CSS product attracts and retains loyal users. Those users contribute their data through posts, photos and reviews, which creates a better product that further attracts new users, and so on.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190507" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190507" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2190507" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CSS-flywheel.png" alt="The CSS flywheel shows the cycle that results when a quality CSS product attracts and retains loyal users." width="1024" height="497" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CSS-flywheel.png 1194w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CSS-flywheel.png?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CSS-flywheel.png?resize=300,145 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CSS-flywheel.png?resize=768,372 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CSS-flywheel.png?resize=680,330 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CSS-flywheel.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190507" class="wp-caption-text">The CSS flywheel shows the cycle that results when a quality CSS product attracts and retains loyal users. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> GP Bullhound</p></div></p>
<p>When companies get this flywheel right, it’s incredibly appealing to investors, because of the advantages of scale in CSS. Each niche will probably be dominated by one or two players, and a given niche can have tens of millions of consumers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 17, 2021. Today we have what struck us as the most interesting collection of startup news in some time. And we’re keeping an international perspective, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/as-its-startup-market-accelerates-brazil-could-be-in-for-an-ipo-bonanza/">diving into Brazil’s IPO market</a> and &#8212; see below &#8212; fintech industry, while also looking at what’s ahead for Nigeria’s burgeoning startup industry. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">Africa is busy</a>!)</p>
<p>Before we dive into all of the goodness, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/reserve-your-demo-table-at-tc-sessions-saas-2021-today/">demo tables are now live</a> for our October TC Sessions: SaaS 2021 event, and we’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/discover-all-things-biotech-with-mayfield-at-disrupt-2021/">got big biotech plans for Disrupt</a>. Now, the news. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/after-spending-28b-salesforce-announces-first-direct-integrations-with-slack/"><strong>Salesforce starts to integrate with Slack:</strong></a><strong> </strong>As Ron Miller notes, we’ve known that SFDC has big plans for workplace chat app Slack. You don’t spend $28 billion without a plan (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/is-slack-overpriced-now-that-the-market-knows-salesforce-might-buy-it/">the deal wasn’t cheap</a>). Today the CRM giant announced early integrations with Slack, which should be exciting to all you BigCorp denizens who use both tools. In the set of new tooling are things like “dedicated deal rooms,” which are like huddles, but for a particular sales effort.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/hopper-raises-170m-on-3-5b-valuation-as-travel-surges-and-its-fintech-tools-help-offset-variant-concerns/"><strong>Travel startups are fundable again:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the takeaway from news that Hopper, a startup that helps consumers book flights and hotel stays, raised $175 million in a new round that values the company at $3.5 billion. What about the COVID-19 resurgence that many markets are currently enduring? The startup’s products that facilitate more flexible travel are doing numbers, Hopper told TechCrunch.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/trading-platform-bitpanda-raises-263m-at-a-4-1bn-valuation/"><strong>Crypto exchanges are venture darlings:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today’s news that crypto trading platform Bitpanda has raised $263 million at a $4.1 billion valuation is merely part of a trend that TechCrunch has seen in recent weeks of crypto exchanges raising huge checks at high prices. What’s driving the trend? Coinbase’s simply enormous and very public success in recent quarters. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/everyone-wants-to-fund-the-next-coinbase/">Everyone wants to fund the next Coinbase</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>First up, TechCrunch has been covering the African startup market with much more focus in recent quarters, as you may have noticed. Sadly, per our own Tage Kene-Okafor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/a-leaked-bill-for-nigerian-startups-reveals-a-theme-of-licenses-fees-fines-and-sentences/">news from a key nation in the African tech scene is not good</a>. New regulations that could land in Nigeria are more “concerning than friendly,” he writes.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/onlyfans-promotes-its-sfw-app-as-it-seeks-funding-at-a-1b-valuation/"><strong>OnlyFans markets SFW app:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, OnlyFans is known mostly for its adult content and monetization thereof, but there’s more to the service than just that. The company is pushing a porn-free app that is devoid of monetization to highlight content from its creators that you could watch at work. Let’s see how it performs.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/mavens-comprehensive-approach-to-womens-health-earns-it-unicorn-status/"><strong>Maven earns unicorn horn:</strong></a><strong> </strong>On the back of a $110 million round co-led by Dragoneer Investment Group and Lux Capital, Maven is now a unicorn. The startup’s valuation is “a rare landmark moment for women’s health, and women-led startups more broadly,” Natasha Mascarenhas wrote for TechCrunch. Maven focuses on comprehensive women’s health support.</li>
<li>More on Brazil in a moment, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/brazils-nuvemshop-raises-500m-at-a-3-1b-valuation-months-after-last-raise/"><strong>Nuvemshop is now worth $3.1 billion after raising $500 million</strong></a> in a single round. Nuvemshop is a Brazilian e-commerce company that is often likened to a Shopify for the region. Its latest round was co-led by Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management, TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/aurora-propulsion-technologies-will-be-sending-up-space-junk-removal-tech-on-rocket-labs-electron-later-this-year/"><strong>Startup takes on space junk:</strong></a> The issue of space around our planet being full of, well, junk is being taken on by “Aurora Propulsion Technologies, a Finnish company that develops thrusters and de-orbiting modules for small satellites,” TechCrunch reports. Rocket Lab is handling the launch.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/split-io-announces-50m-series-d-to-continue-growing-feature-flag-platform/"><strong>$50M for better feature flags:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you are building an application, you may want to test new features with a limited set of users. Feature flags can help you do just that. The tech is big enough business that Split.io just landed eight figures of capital to keep building its business.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/monte-carlo-closes-60m-series-c-on-the-back-of-rapid-arr-growth/"><strong>Monte Carlo proves that the data market is more than just lakes:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Data observability startup Monte Carlo just closed a $60 million round at four times the price that it raised its Series B earlier this year. The company has seen 8x ARR growth in the last year. The company is a reminder that for high-growth software, there is no limit to available capital in today’s market.</li>
<li>And because you’ve read this far, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/picnic-launches-its-first-robotic-pizza-sytem/">how about some robot pizzas?</a></li>

<h2>What does Brazil’s new receivables regulation mean for fintechs?</h2>
<p>The Brazilian Central Bank made a major reform to the way payments are processed that may throw the doors open for e-commerce in South America&#8217;s largest market.</p>
<p>Historically, merchants who accepted credit card payments had two options: Receive the full payment distributed over two to 12 installments, or offer a deep discount to receive a smaller sum up front.</p>
<p>But in June 2021, the BCB created new &#8220;registration entities&#8221; that permit &#8220;any interested receivables buyer/acquirer to make an offer for those receivables, forcing buyers to become more competitive in their discount offers,&#8221; says Leonardo Lanna, head of payment products at Monkey Exchange.</p>
<p>The new framework benefits consumers and sellers, but for the region&#8217;s startups, &#8220;it opens the door to a plethora of opportunities and new business models, from payments to credit.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA["With these self driving cars, it's only a matter of time before a country song is written about a guy's truck leaving him."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2010, Google&#8217;s autonomous vehicle project placed self-driving cars on Bay Area streets and freeways, but practical applications were thought to be at least a decade away.</p>
<p>The futurists were right on schedule: In 2020, Mountain View-based Nuro was testing its second-generation R2 robotic vehicle, the first to earn a federal exemption to operate an autonomous vehicle.</p>
<p>But before Nuro could even consider reaching product-market fit, its founders had to overcome technological challenges, win over regulators and strike partnerships with a range of consumer-facing companies.</p>
<p>“Neither JZ nor I think of ourselves as classic entrepreneurs or that starting a company is something we had to do in our lives,” says co-founder Dave Ferguson. “It was much more the result of soul searching and trying to figure out what is the biggest possible impact that we could have.&#8221;</p>

<hr />
<p>Across four articles, reporter Mark Harris (The Guardian, Wired, MIT Technology Review) explores Nuro&#8217;s origins and operations, including the founders&#8217; decision to focus on creating autonomous delivery vehicles instead of entering the passenger EV market.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve lived inside the San Francisco Bay Area bubble for most of my adult life, so it&#8217;s interesting to see how people in Houston&#8217;s Woodland Heights neighborhood react to seeing Nuro&#8217;s R2 delivering pizza and prescriptions on a limited basis.</p>
<p>As one Redditor recently posted in r/houston: &#8220;With these self-driving cars, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before a country song is written about a guy&#8217;s truck leaving him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why bother to beat the competition when you can buy them outright?</p>
<p>&#8220;It used to be that if you were a fintech startup or, for lack of a better term, a digitally native financial services business, you might be eyeing an acquisition from an incumbent in the industry,&#8221; Ryan Lawler writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;But lately, fintech upstarts are the ones doing the acquiring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Salesforce announced last week that it plans to launch a video streaming service.</p>
<p>The industry analysts who enterprise reporter Ron Miller interviewed said the initiative has tremendous potential, but one noted that Salesforce will have to dig deep to compete in today&#8217;s crowded media landscape.</p>
<p>Salesforce hasn&#8217;t released details on the type of programming it plans to offer, but given its vast and diverse customer base, its options are many. Said Brent Leary of CRM Essentials:</p>
<p>“A customer could sponsor a show, advertise a show or possibly collaborate on a show. And have leads generated from the show [which could be] directly tied to the activity from those options and track ROI. And it’s all done on one platform. And the content lives on with ads living on with them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube announced two feature updates today to make it easier for people to find the content they&#8217;re looking for on the platform. This includes visual search features and easier discovery of foreign language videos that have captions in the user&#8217;s local language.</p>
<p>On desktop, YouTube users can hover over a video&#8217;s thumbnail and watch a brief clip play. This functionality will now extend to mobile with the added ability to browse the chapters within a video. From the search page, users can jump directly to the chapter they&#8217;re most interested in.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter wp-image-2190724 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubechapters.png?w=393" alt="chapters appear in youtube search" width="393" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubechapters.png 682w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubechapters.png?resize=87,150 87w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubechapters.png?resize=173,300 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubechapters.png?resize=393,680 393w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubechapters.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re looking for a good sourdough recipe and want to work on your kneading technique. With these new search results, you can see all the steps in the video, from feeding the starter to pulling the bread out of the oven — and skip right to the chapter on kneading,&#8221; wrote Pablo Paniagua, director of Product Management, in a <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/next-phase-searching-youtube">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The other product update recommends videos in other languages to the user, so long as the video has captioning available in their language. So, to extend YouTube&#8217;s sourdough example, if you speak Icelandic and can&#8217;t find a good sourdough tutorial in your language, YouTube might recommend an English-language tutorial with Icelandic subtitles. To start, YouTube will supplement search results with English-language videos, but it plans to expand to more languages.</p>

<p>In India and Indonesia, YouTube is also testing a feature to complement search results with links to other sites from Google Search.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Not all searches may have enough high-quality or relevant video content to fully address what you’re looking for,&#8221; Paniagua explained.</p>
<p>Google Search already had a feature that let users skip to select moments in a video. Even late last year, Google (parent company to YouTube) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/google-pilots-a-search-feature-that-aggregates-short-form-videos-from-tiktok-and-instagram/">experimented</a> with a mobile search feature that would recommend short-form videos from TikTok and Instagram. But, the video would open within the search engine to keep users on Google, rather than opening the TikTok or Instagram apps.</p>

<p>These updates to YouTube&#8217;s search feature emerge in the midst of ongoing controversy around the platform&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth">search algorithm</a>. Last month, Mozilla published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/youtubes-recommender-ai-still-a-horrorshow-finds-major-crowdsourced-study/">research</a> suggesting that YouTube&#8217;s algorithm continued to promote &#8220;bottom-feeding&#8221; content. Mozilla crowd-sourced data from participants who used a browser extension called <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/regrets-reporter/">RegretsReporter</a>, which asks users to self-report YouTube videos they wish they didn&#8217;t watch. Mozilla found that YouTube regrets were 60% higher in countries where English isn&#8217;t the primary language. Still, a representative from YouTube said that features that might potentially mitigate this &#8212; for example, recommending foreign videos with local language captions &#8212; were not developed in response to the Mozilla report.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our teams have been working on these features for months with the goal of helping users find what they’re looking for, from how-tos to DIYs,&#8221; a spokesperson from YouTube said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fortnite now boasts its own version of one of the pandemic&#8217;s hottest games.</p>
<p>Fortnite-maker Epic just introduced into the game a new limited-time mode called Impostors; it follows the hit format that sent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/among-us-launches-on-the-nintendo-switch/">Among Us</a> to Twitch&#8217;s front page — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/aocs-among-us-stream-topped-435000-concurrent-viewers/">and Congress</a> — during the pandemic&#8217;s earlier days.</p>
<p>Up to 10 people can play the new Impostors game mode simultaneously, divided into two competing factions: agents and&#8230; impostors. Eight agents work to complete tasks around the new map before the two impostors can sabotage their efforts by eliminating agents and undoing their work. And because it&#8217;s Fortnite, you can also teleport players randomly around the map and turn everyone into a banana.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1RNbUaCKHA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The game takes place in a new interior map location that properly conjures the claustrophobic paranoia that makes the social deception-style game intense to play and fun to watch. During each round, the players come together to vote on who they think is secretly working against the agents, which generally leads to a lot of spicy conversation. Players can stick with a smaller group (by picking the private game mode) if they&#8217;d like to keep things intimate.</p>
<p>Happily, you can still try it out if you don&#8217;t have a group of friends to play with, though this kind of game works best with people you know. While public voice chat is off in the new mode, players in open matches can communicate through a quick chat box and the game&#8217;s emotes to vote on who they think has infiltrated the group.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too early to say if Fortnite&#8217;s Among Us clone will take off in the same way as the game that inspired it, or how long it&#8217;ll stick around. But considering that Fortnite is still one of the most popular games in the world, a new hit whodunnit game mode that&#8217;s eminently streamable is just icing on the cake.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If you’re a tech company offering anyone a service, somewhere in your future is a security assessment giving you the seal of approval to manage clients’ data and operate on your devices. No one takes security lightly anymore. The business costs of cyberattacks have now hit an <a href="https://qz.com/2039599/why-the-cost-of-getting-hacked-is-higher-than-ever/">all-time high</a>. Government bodies, companies and consumers need the assurance that the next software they download isn’t going to be an open door for hackers.</p>
<p>For good reason, security certifications like the SOC 3 really put you through the wringer. My company, Waydev, has just attained the SOC 3 certification, becoming one of the first development analytics tools to receive that accreditation. We learned so much from the process, we felt it was right to share our experience with others that might be daunted by the prospect.</p>
<p>As a non-tech founder, it was hard not only to navigate the process, but to appreciate its value. But by putting our business caps on, our team was able to optimize our approach and minimize the time and effort needed to achieve our goal. In doing so, we were granted SOC 3 compliance in two weeks, as opposed to the two months it takes some companies.</p>
<p>We also turned the assessment into an opportunity to better our product, align our internal teams, boost our brand and even launch partnerships.</p>
<p>So here’s our advice on how teams can smoothly reach an SOC 3 while simultaneously balancing workloads and minimizing disruption to users.</p>
<h2>First, bring your teams on board</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Because we can’t expect employees to stack those hours on top of their regular workdays, as a leader you have to accept — and communicate — that the speed of your output will inevitably decrease.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As a founder, you’ll be acting as captain steering a ship into that SOC 3 port, and you’ll need all members of your crew to join forces. This isn’t a job for a specially designated security team alone and will require deep involvement from your development and other teams, too. That might lead to internal resistance, as they still have a full-time job tending to your product and customers.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s so important to start by being crystal clear with your employees about what this process will mean to their work lives. However, they have to embrace the true benefits that will arise. SOC 3 will immediately raise your brand&#8217;s appeal and likely see new customers come in as a result.</p>
<p>Each employee will also come out the other end with well-honed cybersecurity skills — they’ll have a deep understanding of potential cyber threats to the company, and all security initiatives will carry a far lighter burden. There&#8217;s also the sense of pride and fulfillment that comes with having an indisputable edge over your competitors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter introduced a new test feature Tuesday that allows users to report misinformation they run into on the platform, flagging it to the company as “misleading.” The test will roll out starting today to most users in the U.S., Australia and South Korea.</p>
<p>In the new test, Twitter users will be able to expand the three dot contextual menu in the upper right corner of a tweet to select &#8220;report tweet&#8221; where they&#8217;ll be met with the new option to flag a misleading tweet. The next menu offers users a choice to specify that a tweet is misleading about &#8220;politics,&#8221; &#8220;health&#8221; or &#8220;something else.&#8221; If they select politics, they can specify if the misleading political tweet pertains to elections and if they choose health they can flag a misleading tweet about COVID-19 specifically.</p>
<p>Twitter has added a way for users to report election-related misinformation before, though previously those options were temporary features linked to global elections. Back in 2019, the platform rolled out the option to report misleading tweets about voting to help safeguard elections <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/twitter-to-offer-report-option-for-misleading-election-tweets/">in Europe and India</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene temporarily for spreading vaccine misinformation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/marjorie-taylor-greene-mjt-twitter-suspension/embed/#?secret=nOhTx4UjRn" data-secret="nOhTx4UjRn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The intention is to give users a way to surface tweets that violate Twitter&#8217;s existing policies around election and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/twitter-coronavirus-covid-19-misinformation-policy/">pandemic-related misinformation</a>, two topics it focuses policy and enforcement efforts around. The user reporting system will work in tandem with Twitter’s proactive systems for identifying potentially dangerous misinformation, which rely on a combination of human and automated moderation. For now, users won’t receive any updates from the company on what happens to misleading tweets they report, though those updates could be added in the future.</p>
<p>While the new reporting feature will be available very broadly, the company describes the test as an “experiment,” not a finished feature. Twitter will observe how people on the platform use the new misinformation reporting tool to see if user reporting can be an effective tool for identifying potentially harmful misleading tweets, though the company isn’t on a set timeline for when to fully implement or remove the test feature.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YYiWGb7sMO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/twitter-coronavirus-covid-19-misinformation-policy/">Twitter broadly bans any COVID-19 tweets that could help the virus spread</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter broadly bans any COVID-19 tweets that could help the virus spread&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/twitter-coronavirus-covid-19-misinformation-policy/embed/#?secret=YYiWGb7sMO" data-secret="YYiWGb7sMO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For now, Twitter doesn’t seem very worried about users abusing the feature, since the new user reporting option will plug directly into its established moderation system. Still, the idea of users pointing the company toward “misleading” tweets is sure to spark new cries of censorship from corners of the platform already prone to spreading misinformation.</p>
<p>While the option to flag tweets as misleading is new, the feature will feed reported tweets into Twitter’s existing enforcement flow, where its established rules around health and political misinformation are implemented through a blend of human and algorithmic moderation.</p>
<p>That process will also sort reported tweets for review based on priority. Tweets from users with large followings or tweets generating an unusually high level of engagement will go to the front of the review line, as will tweets that pertain to elections and COVID-19, Twitter’s two areas of emphasis when it comes to policing misinformation.</p>
<p>The new test is Twitter&#8217;s latest effort to lean more on its own community to identify misinformation. Twitter&#8217;s most ambitious experiment along those lines is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/twitter-is-building-birdwatch-a-system-to-fight-misinformation-by-adding-more-context-to-tweets/">Birdwatch</a>, a crowdsourced way for users to append contextual notes and fact-checks to tweets that can be upvoted or downvoted, Reddit-style. For now, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/twitter-starts-rolling-out-birdwatch-fact-checks-inside-tweets/">Birdwatch is just a pilot program</a>, but it&#8217;s clear the company is interested in decentralizing moderation — an experiment far thornier than just adding a new way to report tweets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Growth marketing is often misconceived as a set of tactics when it&#8217;s much more: It is a process that startups need to put in place in their early days that will scale as their customer base and internal teams grow.</p>
<p>This is where British growth agency <a href="https://ascendant.uk/">Ascendant</a> shines, Robyn Weatherley, head of marketing at <a href="https://www.thirdfort.com/">Thirdfort</a>, let us know via our growth marketing survey. Ascendant&#8217;s consultants haven&#8217;t just helped the British legal tech startup execute growth tactics, she <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/growth-roundup-investing-in-community-targeting-developers-new-marketer-recs/">wrote</a>: &#8220;They’ve helped us set up the framework to keep executing on those whether we are five, 50 or 500 people.&#8221; (If you too have growth marketers to recommend, please<a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03"> fill out the survey</a>!)</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;If you don&#8217;t come from a growth marketing background, you don&#8217;t know how to even frame the problem, let alone fix it. This is why so much startup marketing is tactical rather than strategic.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We followed up on this recommendation by interviewing Ascendant co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fergus1/">Gus Ferguson</a> and partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssabc/">Alyssa Crankshaw</a> for our ongoing series of growth marketer profiles. If you are in the U.K., you might know them from the <a href="https://techlondon.io/">TechLondon</a> Slack community, or bumped into them pre-COVID at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Online-Marketing-London/">OMN London events</a>, the digital marketing meetups they co-organize. In the interview below, they share how they work with early-stage companies, including tactical planning and building out tools for marketers to use without taking up internal engineering resources.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: The interview below has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><b>Can you tell us about your background and how you came to work with startups?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>I&#8217;ve been a digital marketer for the last 15 or 16 years, and in 2009, I started one of the first content marketing agencies in the U.K. We did a lot of work with big travel brands, but the problem was that in big corporates, teams are in silos, so they weren&#8217;t able to take advantage of being at the forefront of marketing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>I was based in East London and I started working with a couple of startups. It&#8217;s also around that time that I partnered up with Alyssa. But we were looking at startups being hampered by traditional marketing &#8212; because traditional marketers were bringing big corporate problems to startups, when their key strength is their nimbleness and their agility and their ability to adapt.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when we started developing processes for basically building businesses from scratch &#8212; when you don&#8217;t have any historical data to base your marketing strategies on. We were saying to them: Don&#8217;t ask us for a 12-month plan, because it&#8217;s a waste of time. But because there was that mindset at the time, that&#8217;s just what people expected. So we were going in and saying: You need a broad three-month plan, maximum; then a one-month plan in detail, and ideally a two-week sprint.</p>
<p><b>What kind of clients does Ascendant work with?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>Thanks to the growth framework that we&#8217;ve built up over time, we can pretty much work with any new business where there&#8217;s no existing process for marketing. We work with fintech, healthcare and legal companies, e-commerce brands, and both B2C and B2B. So startups, but also startup-type businesses. For instance, we worked with corporate ventures like Canon and VCs like Forward Partners, which was really interesting learning, because we were working with earlier-stage businesses than we would normally.</p>
<p>One million in funding is our sweet spot for startups. The reason for that is that it costs money to bring experienced growth experts into business, and up to that point, I believe it is important for founders to understand growth themselves. Being able to understand how to do it at that early stage will create such a valuable foundation of audience centricity for that business moving forward. A lot of what we do is bringing audience centricity into product-focused businesses &#8212; and generally encouraging founders to think about why their audience should care that they&#8217;ve got a solution to their problem.</p>
<p><b>Right, &#8220;build it and they will come&#8221; is a mistake that founders make all the time! Could you give more details on how you help them?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>Generally we&#8217;ll look at whatever they have as a foundation, and at similar businesses, and we&#8217;ll create an initial growth model. We&#8217;ll start putting hypotheses in place as to which channels are going to be the most effective at hitting their short-term objectives if they have them ready. But often, part of the process is also defining which metrics matter for that business, and working out how to measure them.</p>
<p>We always start working with founders and sales, and generally before or with one first marketing hire in place. Part of our work is to come up with projected results based on their funnel, but very often, with product-centric businesses, it will be that funnel that&#8217;s missing. So we bring in a bit of funnel thinking to those businesses and get that in place.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/"><i>Respond to our survey</i></a><i> and help other startups find top growth marketers they can work with!</i></em></p>
<hr />
<p>And then there&#8217;s all sorts of what we call framework building that needs to be in place before you can start doing more traditional campaign-based marketing. So we&#8217;ll start looking at the specific frameworks around data, and how to form an objective truth for that business, with a shared understanding of the key metrics. When nobody knows what the fundamental data framework of that business looks like, for instance, because of team turnover or silos, we&#8217;ll tighten that up and make sure that everything is functioning together so that things like marketing automation are possible.</p>
<p><b>It&#8217;s perhaps a bit surprising about siloed teams at an early stage; how big are the startups you work with?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>We start when they are small, but we keep our clients for a long time. So, for example, we worked with <a href="https://www.elder.org/">Elder,</a> which is a health tech startup. When we started off with them, there were 12 people, and when we finished with them, there were hundreds of people. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/soldo/">Soldo</a> is another example: When we started the marketing team was one person, and by the time we left, they were spanning three floors at WeWork.</p>
<p>Our lifecycle ends at Series B, because at that point, all the frameworks will be in place and they&#8217;ll be bringing everything in-house. So that&#8217;s our happy ending when the clients get to huge Series B raises. And then we move on to the next one that needs our help to get there.</p>
<p>But to go back to your question, slips happen because these are very venture-backed companies with very high growth not just in customers but also in their internal teams. Everybody is doing everything, everybody is new at their jobs, and there aren&#8217;t very many internal processes, so there&#8217;s an element of chaos. That&#8217;s where the need for cross-functional teams grew from &#8212; to step out of everybody&#8217;s individual chaotic worlds and create an island of shared objectives and order.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189509" style="width: 280px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189509" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2189509" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-bw.png?w=270" alt="Alyssa Crankshaw - Ascendant" width="270" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-bw.png 306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-bw.png?resize=135,150 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-bw.png?resize=270,300 270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-bw.png?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189509" class="wp-caption-text">Alyssa Crankshaw. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ascendant</p></div></p>
<p><b>Alyssa Crankshaw: </b>It&#8217;s just important for us to make people communicate. We often end up actually becoming a reason for the whole team to talk to each other &#8212; because we are external, they see more value in these tasks that they wouldn&#8217;t do otherwise.</p>
<p><b>How does that work in practice?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>An example of that is the CMS system we are putting in place for one client that we&#8217;re working with at the moment, where salespeople use it, marketing people use it, customer services people use it &#8212; and those teams were fairly siloed beforehand.</p>
<p>We also know that probably one of the biggest barriers to growth is marketers being dependent on developers, which are such a rare resource. We address that by implementing marketing frameworks at a basic level of the business whereby marketers are able to at least control basic marketing operations directly.</p>
<p>But one of the most important processes that we bring in is the cross-functional team, with one stakeholder from each department. It means that there&#8217;s at least one person on each team who understands what the objectives are, and then people start problem-solving together.</p>
<p><b>Didn&#8217;t that become more difficult with COVID-19?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>Potentially it got easier with remote. Usually, we find one person on each team — generally the team&#8217;s leader — and we bring them as spokespersons into the cross-functional team. In a remote world, it&#8217;s actually easier because you can just all jump on Zoom calls.</p>
<p><b>Alyssa Crankshaw</b>: Even before COVID, we weren&#8217;t the type of consultants who sit several days a week in their client&#8217;s office. We are problem-solvers across the company, and we&#8217;ve always done that, whether it was from our old office or remotely now.</p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>Our own model also proved exceptionally flexible when we needed it to be during the pandemic. We are a core team of three people, and we are working with a network of specialized freelancers &#8212; so instead of worrying about fixed overheads, we can have agreements with trusted partners and morph into whatever our clients need at that time. Because of the nature of startups, as I said earlier, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to have long-term plans for businesses where there&#8217;s such a high rate of change. And from an agency perspective, it means that what we&#8217;re doing one month is always very different from what we&#8217;re doing the next month.</p>
<p><b>Alyssa Crankshaw</b>: It&#8217;s a conscious decision not to follow a traditional agency model, because it helps us be flexible and bring in the specialists when we need them, rather than just having to use that person that sits on your payroll just because you have them. It&#8217;s much more effective for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s a thing that people might not know about what you do?</strong></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>Growth marketing is a process; it&#8217;s really how I differentiate it from traditional marketing. A lot of people will say that growth marketing is the AARRR funnel, but is that really any different from traditional marketing? Not really. Maybe you&#8217;ve got a broader set of channels than a traditional marketer would focus on. But what&#8217;s really different is the process that gives our clients confidence that they&#8217;re doing the right thing, even if they&#8217;ve never done it before. Because that&#8217;s how you learn.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with doing something new for the first time, in a team of people who are also doing a new thing for the first time with no historical data, is that you quite often don&#8217;t even know how to frame that. If you don&#8217;t come from a growth marketing background, you don&#8217;t know how to even frame the problem, let alone fix it. This is why so much startup marketing is tactical rather than strategic, or even worse, tool-led. People think: &#8220;Oh, if I was using this tool, then all my problems would be solved,&#8221;  when, actually, you need to be able to create the hypotheses and understand the objectives that the hypotheses are answering.</p>
<p><b>Alyssa Crankshaw</b>: We give our clients the roadmap, the foundation and the operational structure in which to run campaigns, retention, acquisition or whatever the target may be, which is huge for them. Because when creating everything from scratch, that&#8217;s where we often see a lot of overtesting. We love a good test &#8212; we&#8217;re both marketers &#8212; but we only like to test the big things. And sometimes when working with inexperienced people, we see a lot of new tests about the smallest things, which is a waste of time and resources. And there are some other things that are foundational, and you just know which they are if you are an experienced marketer and you have done this so many times in your life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Among Apple&#8217;s more recent social good initiatives is the Impact Accelerator, an effort <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/apple-says-its-supply-chains-and-products-will-be-carbon-neutral-by-2030/">launched about a year ago</a> intended to find and elevate minority-owned small businesses taking on sustainability and climate change. The program now has its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-selects-15-black-and-brown-owned-businesses-for-impact-accelerator/">first 15 participants</a>, gathered from all over the country for a three-month program and a shot at an Apple contract.</p>
<p>The Impact Accelerator is part of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/apple-announces-new-projects-related-to-its-100-million-pledge-for-racial-equity-and-justice/">$100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative</a>, which is being divided between a number of efforts, some directly funding existing programs, some going to venture firms owned by people of color, and generally whatever the Initiative&#8217;s team thinks is a good investment.</p>
<p>These companies will take part in a three-month-long virtual program (the details are not discussed in Apple&#8217;s announcement post) and then will have the opportunity to become suppliers for Apple&#8217;s carbon neutral supply chain goals.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Volt Energy Utility</strong> (Co-founder: Gilbert Campbell III) — Developer of utility-scale solar projects with a focus on underserved communities.</li>
<li><strong>Bench-Tek</strong> (Founder: Maria Castellon) — A manufacturer of lab benches that focuses on using environmentally friendly materials.</li>
<li><strong>Vericool</strong> (Founder: Darrell Jobe) — Aims to make sustainable alternatives to Styrofoam and other packaging products, and makes a point of hiring formerly incarcerated folks.</li>
<li><strong>Oceti Sakowin Power Authority</strong> (Chairman: Lyle Jack) — Not a company per se, but an NGO formed by six Sioux tribes dedicated to developing renewable energy in the Midwest and on reservations.</li>
<li><strong>Mosaic Global Transportation</strong> (Founder: Maurice H. Brewster) — Supplies employee and event shuttles and other vehicles with an aim to replace gas-operated ones with EVs.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;The businesses we’re partnering with today are poised to become tomorrow’s diverse and innovative industry leaders, creating ripples of change to help communities everywhere adapt to the urgent challenges posed by climate change,&#8221; said Apple&#8217;s VP of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, Lisa Jackson, in the announcement.</p>

		Leonardo Lanna is head of payment products at <a href="https://www.monkey.exchange/">Monkey Exchange</a>, a Brazilian marketplace startup that enables sellers to offer receivables from sales in a single platform to many buyers at once, receiving the best price with low effort. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Something strange is afoot in Brazil, and it promises great changes for how merchants get paid.</p>
<p>This the story of one regulator, the Brazilian Central Bank, and how it has taken center stage in creating a framework that will have far-reaching effects across merchants and fintechs in this fast-growing Latin American nation.</p>
<p>But first, some background: Unlike in the rest of the world, when a credit card is used for payment in Brazil, the merchant does not receive the funds owed to them all at once. Instead, nearly 50% of card sales are completed in monthly installments, leaving the sellers to manage a difficult cash flow process.</p>
<p>The most common solution for merchants is that they end up selling the remaining receivable at a discount — taking less than they are owed — in order to get their money sooner. And we’re not talking about a small-volume market: Some R$2 trillion (Brazilian Reais) in card transactions were processed in 2020.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			This compelling new regulatory framework brings new opportunities for many players willing to participate in receivables discounting operations.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Here’s what this looks like in practice: Let&#8217;s say Maria purchases a few articles of clothing from retailer Clothing Incorporated. When paying via her credit card at checkout, Maria can choose to pay in two to 12 installments. Maria decides to pay the balance of R$620 over six installments.</p>
<p>While Maria is happy with the products in hand, Clothing Incorporated is without the full payment — and for small merchants in particular, the difficulties associated with limited working capital can be acute. Clothing Incorporated can either wait the full six months to be paid, receiving payments from their merchant acquirer each month until they are paid in full, or they can choose to dramatically discount the amount they are owed and not have to wait the six months.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say Clothing Incorporated merchant acquirer is ExMarko — instead of receiving R$620 over six months (net of any merchant discount rates), they could receive R$520 within days after the purchase, with ExMarko pocketing the rest when it comes in. This comes at a steep cost of doing business to the merchant, with an implied annualized interest rate that sometimes can reach  ~70% — for a risk-free operation, since the acquirer is only liquidating earlier its own obligation to pay the merchant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s no secret that Google is in the midst of a pretty massive overhaul of its Pixel division. The Pixel 6 offers the next major Hail Mary for the company’s hardware division, complete with its own custom chip, Tensor.</p>
<p>This is not that. The new flagship won’t be available until the fall. Meantime, here’s the 5a, the latest addition to the “budget flagship” line that’s proven a nice overall sales boost for a struggling department.</p>

<p>Google confirmed the phone’s existence back in April, mostly as a way of curbing rumors prematurely predicting the unannounced handset’s death. “Pixel 5a 5G is not canceled,” the company told TechCrunch at the time. “It will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan and announced in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced.”</p>
<p>And, indeed, here it is. The handset officially goes on sale August 26 for $449. <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel5a-with-5g-new-google-phone/">The Pixel 5a with 5G</a> is, in a word, “safe” &#8212; a fact highlighted by the recent announcement of the Pixel 6. This is very much not a phone from a company looking to shake things up, but rather, the remnants of a division that was content to play right down the middle in the smartphone wars. Safe isn’t a bad word &#8212; particularly not at this price point. It’s sturdy (now with IP67 water resistance!) and it’ll get the job done.</p>

<p>As the name very clearly implies, the price includes 5G connectivity. That’s coupled with a dual-camera &#8212; with the same 12- and 16-megapixel setup as the Pixel 5. Those perform a slew of software-enabled modes, including Night Sight, Live HDR+ and Portrait Light. The phone is powered by the same mid-tier Snapdragon 765G process, while the RAM has been reduced down to 6GB.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Storage is the same at 128GB and, interestingly, the battery has actually been bumped up from 4080 mAh to 4680. The screen, too, has been expanded from 6.0 to 6.34 inches, with the same resolution. It drops the Pixel 5’s wireless charging, but hey, there’s a headphone jack.</p>
<p>The Pixel 5a with 5G is up for preorder starting today.</p>
