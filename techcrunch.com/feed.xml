										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A California-based medical company that provides COVID-19 testing across Los Angeles has pulled down a website it used to allow customers to access their test results after a customer found a vulnerability that exposed other people&#8217;s personal information.</p>
<p>Total Testing Solutions has ten COVID-19 testing sites across Los Angeles, and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/flurotest-diagnostics-systems-and-total-testing-solutions-sign-pilot-program-mou-to-bring-first-high-volume-sars-cov-2-testing-system-to-california-301281753.html">processes &#8220;thousands&#8221;</a> of COVID-19 tests at workplaces, sports venues, and schools each week. When test results are ready, customers get an email with a link to a website to get their results.</p>
<p>But one customer said they found a website vulnerability that allowed them to access other customers&#8217; information by increasing or decreasing a number in the website&#8217;s address by a single digit. That allowed the customer to see other customers&#8217; names and the date of their test. The website also only requires a person&#8217;s date of birth to access their COVID-19 test results, which the customer who discovered the vulnerability said &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t take long&#8221; to brute-force, or simply guess. (That&#8217;s just 11,000 birthday guesses for anyone under age 30.)</p>

	</p>
<p>Although the test results website is protected by a login page that prompts the customer for their email address and password, the vulnerable part of the website that allowed the customer to change the web address and access other customers&#8217; information could be accessed directly from the web, bypassing the sign-in prompt altogether.</p>
<p>The customer passed on details of the vulnerability to TechCrunch to get the vulnerability fixed before someone else finds it or exploits it, if not already.</p>
<p>TechCrunch verified the customer&#8217;s findings, but while we did not enumerate each result code, through limited testing found that the vulnerability likely put around 60,000 tests at risk. TechCrunch reported the vulnerability to TTS chief medical officer Geoffrey Trenkle, who did not dispute the number of discovered tests, but said the vulnerability was limited to an on-premise server used to provide legacy test results that has since been shut down and replaced by a new cloud-based system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were recently made aware of a potential security vulnerability in our former on-premises server that could allow access to certain patient names and results using a combination of URL manipulation and date of birth programming codes,&#8221; said Trenkle in a statement. &#8220;The vulnerability was limited to patient information obtained at public testing sites before the creation of the cloud-based server. In response to this potential threat, we immediately shut down the on-premises software and began migrating that data to the secure cloud-based system to prevent future risk of data breach. We also initiated a vulnerability assessment, including the review of server access logs to detect any unrecognized network activity or unusual authentication failures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trenkle declined to say when the cloud server became active, and why the allegedly legacy server had test results as recently as last month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently, TTS is not aware of any breach of unsecured protected health information as a result of the issues with its prior server. To our knowledge, no patient health information was actually compromised, and all risk has been mitigated going forward,&#8221; said Trenkle.</p>
<p>Trenkle said the company will comply with its legal obligations under state law, but stopped short of explicitly saying if the company plans to notify customers of the vulnerability. Although companies aren&#8217;t obliged to report vulnerabilities to their state&#8217;s attorney general or to their customers, many do out of an abundance of caution since it&#8217;s not always possible to determine if there was improper access.</p>
<p>TTS chief executive Lauren Trenkle, who was copied on an email chain, did not comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As many companies shift to a hybrid approach to work where some folks are working in the office and some at home, it&#8217;s easy for the home-based workers to feel a disconnect, even with video conferencing tools like Zoom. Video Window is designed to give users a feeling of being connected to other offices as though you were looking through a virtual window. Today, the company introduced a companion app for iOS and Android called <a href="https://videowindow.com/#remote">Video Window Remote</a> aimed squarely at those remote employees.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the latest addition to the Video Window family is designed to involve not just intra-office remote communication, but also include those employees who are working offsite, whether at home or in another location, and make them feel like they are in the office.</p>
<p>While video conferencing allows you to meet virtually to discuss the business of your work, it doesn&#8217;t give that connection that you feel of being in the office and chatting with your colleagues. That can sometimes lead to feelings of isolation or that your ideas are not being heard.</p>
<p>With Video Window Remote, users download the app to their phone or tablet and use that as a visual connection to the office, getting both video and audio as desired. This gives the water cooler experience that many remote workers feel they are missing by not being in the office.</p>

<p>Company CEO Daryl Hutchings says he came up with many of the features in Video Window Remote based on his own experience working at home during the pandemic. &#8220;Using Video Window is exactly like looking through a window to see your colleagues. It enables you to really be present with the people you work with while successfully completing your projects and accomplishing your goals, making work better, more enjoyable, fun and leveling the playing field for all. Ultimately creating a happy hybrid workplace,&#8221; Hutchings said in a statement.</p>
<p>In case you are concerned about security or privacy with a tool like this, Hutchings says that he built in several safeguards including preventing guest access, audio and video off by default (you control when you want to be seen and heard), the ability for everyone to see who is present regardless of their video/audio status, and scheduled sleep mode, so the service only turns on during scheduled hours.</p>
<p>The tool is available for free starting today from the iOS and Android app stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swing Therapeutics, a digital therapeutics startup, has received an FDA breakthrough device designation for their 12 week smartphone-assisted fibromyalgia management program. This is the company’s first breakthrough designation, and precedes a deluge of clinical trials scheduled for this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swing Therapeutics was founded in 2019 and has raised a total of $9 million in seed funding led by JAZZ Venture partners. The company is focused on managing chronic pain, and specifically fibromyalgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This FDA breakthrough designation was awarded to the company’s smartphone adaptation of an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) program originally designed and tested at the University of Manitoba. Swing Therapeutics has exclusively licensed the program, and adapted it to form their own phone-based version. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We basically used [The University of Manitoba program] as a basis for our program and then really built on top of it, and adapted it to a sort of experience that would work great for a modern day smartphone interface,” says Mike Rosenbluth, the founder and CEO of Swing Therapeutics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This FDA designation will allow Swing Therapeutics expedited review at the FDA as the company conducts a series of clinical trials on the product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, there is no cure for fibromyalgia, but the FDA has approved three drugs that can help manage symptoms. Those include: Lyrica, which is usually prescribed to treat nerve damage, but is also used to treat fibromyalgia; Cymbalta, which was originally developed to treat depression, anxiety and diabetic neuropathy; and Savella, an SSRI that’s similar to treatments for depression. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of the drug world, there’s some evidence ACT can help patients who live with chronic pain (including fibromyalgia). </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="272smn94vL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/neuroglee-gets-2-3-million-to-develop-digital-therapeutics-for-neurodegenerative-diseases/">Neuroglee gets $2.3 million to develop digital therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Neuroglee gets $2.3 million to develop digital therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/neuroglee-gets-2-3-million-to-develop-digital-therapeutics-for-neurodegenerative-diseases/embed/#?secret=272smn94vL" data-secret="272smn94vL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26818413/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meta-review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 25 studies on ACT and chronic pain, for instance, found that ACT therapy had small effects on pain intensity. But the therapeutic process of teaching patients to accept their pain (but not ignore it) was linked with moderate and long-term improvements in depression, anxiety and quality of life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What ACT does is it tries to help people accept those symptoms and things that are uncontrollable. It helps people think about their values – what is really important to them,” says Rosenbluth. “And then they try to make behavior-based changes aligned with those values.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that vein, Swing Therapeutics’ platform is designed to be prescribed by a doctor as a treatment management tool. Once prescribed, the patient would enter a 41 session acceptance and commitment therapy program that’s run entirely on their phone, and broken into “daily doses.” A &#8220;daily dose&#8221; might include a prompt for a mindfulness session or a short writing prompt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Manitoba program that Swing’s smartphone program is based on</span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29481976/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does have</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a randomized controlled trial to its name. It was initially validated in a study on 67 participants who either received treatment as usual or their regular treatment plus ACT delivered via an 8-week online course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Completing the course was linked with improvements in depression symptoms and improvements in patients’ scores on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R), which measures the effects of fibromyalgia on sleep, pain perception fatigue, or psychological distress.  The course appeared to help patients improve their “pain acceptance” and through that mechanism the experience of fibromyalgia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, the Swing Therapeutics program does differ slightly from the University of Manitoba program – namely, it’s designed for almost daily use, over 12 weeks on a smartphone, as opposed to 8 weeks on a computer. Even these small changes warrant their own independent clinical trials to ensure this approach also helps fibromyalgia patients benefit from this specific ACT therapy program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swing Therapeutics has several of these clinical trials at different stages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This spring, Swing completed enrollment of a 67-person pilot study on their adapted treatment for fibromyalgia (patients were assigned to an active control or the ACT digital therapy). This study is ongoing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Swing also launched a large-scale study called <a href="https://react-fm.com/welcome/003">REACT-FM</a>. This study, currently recruiting, aims to enroll about 100 to 150 patients who will use the ACT product for two weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the company is also in the development phase for a Phase 3 randomized controlled trial. After completion of that study, the company plans to submit to the FDA for full approval of the platform. That study, says Rosenbluth, is planned to launch at the end of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDA breakthrough therapy designation has already helped shape these studies. As the trials continue, this designation means the device will continue to enjoy expedited review, which could smooth the platform’s journey through clinical trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We found it really useful to be able to have that channel dialogue with the FDA, so that we can make sure that we&#8217;re aligned in clinical study design and our approaches are in line with things that the FDA expects,” Rosenbluth says. </span></p>

<p>The Daft Punk-ian &#8220;harder better faster stronger&#8221; mantra of the sports car industry is great for those with deep enough pockets to participate or for those who enjoy cheering from the sidelines, but anyone looking to get in on the action on the ground floor these days would be hard-pressed to find a sub-$30,000 performance-specific ride that isn&#8217;t the Mazda Miata.</p>
<p>The misnomer too that &#8220;performance&#8221; refers exclusively to the high-speed, high-horsepower machines is enough to scare away the inexperienced or drive off those who just don&#8217;t need that. Hello again, Miata.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why the Introduction of the first-generation Toyota GT 86 (née Scion FR-S) was an important one and why its next iteration, the GR 86, is an exciting prospect: Performance for the people; a sports car for everyone.</p>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p>The GR 86 is a 2+2 coupe powered by a 2.4-liter flat four-cylinder boxer engine that produces 228 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with this configuration, it&#8217;s a layout that delivers more balance than the Vs-and-straights that you may be used to. Power is sent to the rear wheels by way of a six-speed transmission, manual or automatic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It rides on an independent suspension with MacPherson-type struts at the front and multilink setup in the rear. Depending on the trim level, the GR 86 is saddled with 17- or 18-inch wheels.</p>
<p>Speaking of trims, the GR 86 comes in two flavors: base and premium, with the latter bringing a handful of upgrades such as the aforementioned 18-inch wheels, a duckbill rear spoiler, adaptive front LED headlamps, a smattering of visual accents, plus an upgrade to eight stereo speakers from the standard six.</p>
<p>All trims come with an 8-inch touchscreen display for entertainment and connectivity purposes, as well as a host of standard safety equipment that includes seven airbags and the Toyota Star safety system that&#8217;s made up of the stability control, anti-lock braking systems we&#8217;ve come to expect, plus brake assist and brake-force distribution.</p>
<p>GR 86s fitted with the automatic gearbox have the added benefit of an active safety system that handles pre-collision braking, lane-keep assist and adaptive cruise control.</p>
<p>Connected services requiring a subscription give the GR 86 remote connect abilities via an app that can start the engine, lock the doors and honk the horn, but can also provide vehicle health reports and set up what are essentially parental controls for the car: geofencing, speed alerts and even a curfew setting.</p>
<h2>Race-bred tech</h2>
<p>A keep-it-simple sports car like the GR 86 lacks the luxury luster of a tech-laden Lamborghini Huracán or its close cousin, the Audi R8.</p>
<p>While these cars have more hardware than a gaming PC, the GR 86 is light on computational muscle. Indeed, branded as a &#8220;purist&#8217;s sports car,&#8221; it&#8217;s scant on too many assists when it comes to spirited driving sessions.</p>
<p>Stability can be switched off and drive modes &#8220;Sport&#8221; and &#8220;Track&#8221; will increase input response on the brakes and throttle. These modes will also make the automatic gearbox punchier in kind to the more aggressive engine mapping.</p>
<p>With the GR 86 being such a small package, finding the tech that makes a difference requires some keen scrutiny in specific areas. Toyota states the car earns its &#8220;GR&#8221; (for Gazoo Racing, Toyota&#8217;s motorsport branch) branding through the car being developed with race-bred technology.</p>
<p>On the outside, this is notable in the aerodynamic touches that make big differences in stability. It starts at the front where functional vents channel air at high speeds to aid in the car&#8217;s control and is continued at the rear, where the molding above the rear wheel well is shaped to continue this work at the back end.</p>
<p>Structurally, the GR 86 is improved over the previous version by increasing the frame&#8217;s rigidity, implementing reinforcement in key areas in the front and rear, as well as using more high-strength steel.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the car manages to gain a few pounds over the outgoing model, from 77 to 117 pounds depending on the transmission. A number of weight-saving measures such as an aluminum roof and fenders mitigate this. However, the efforts were more to carefully distribute weight than shed the pounds.</p>
<h2>Strapped in</h2>
<p>From behind the wheel of the GR 86, it&#8217;s clear to see the interior as an upgrade more than a drastic change. Gone is the analog gauge cluster in favor of a 7-inch TFT digital screen that changes depending on drive mode.</p>
<p>For the 86s fitted with an automatic, there are three distinct screens that shift the visible information around for optimal usage and two in the manual.</p>
<p>For instance, the &#8220;normal&#8221; screen will have the miles-per-hour stat front and center, while the &#8220;track&#8221; screen will put the current gear at the top, above a three-color rpm indicator. This is useful for those who will take the Toyota out on a closed course since this is more critical info to know &#8220;in the moment&#8221; over the current speed. Bumping this up and giving the interface a distinct amber glow helps deliver that data with either a quick glance or even just through the driver&#8217;s periphery.</p>

<p>The infotainment screen is also slightly upgraded. Visually speaking, it looks better integrated and free of the piano black plastic bezel that mars the older one.</p>
<p>The interface is simple, with icons giving access to the radio, media sources, maintenance data and to call roadside assistance, as well as other integrated apps that may be installed, such as a music streaming services.</p>
<p>Apps can be arranged to preference but overall, it&#8217;s reliant on external devices to be truly functional. For the hyperconnected audience that this car is targeted for, there&#8217;s a sense that Toyota&#8217;s betting on most users to primarily utilize Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, which is compatible on all models.</p>
<h2>Performance playground</h2>
<p>Heading onto the track with the GR 86 feels like returning a captive creature back to its native environment. Toyota brought the GR 86 and its predecessor for testing and back-to-back comparison to Monticello Motor Club, a 4.1-mile course with 20 turns to pit against the car&#8217;s performance. Though the GR 86 is very much a street car, it&#8217;s on the track where it can run wild and fully express its capabilities.</p>
<p>The power output of the previous car was a divisive issue, with fans feeling it right-sized for the intent of the vehicle while others found it lacking and hoped that Toyota would finally affix it with the turbocharger they felt it deserved.</p>
<p>The improvements to the GT 86&#8217;s boxer engine are palpable and should satisfy both camps.</p>
<p>The increased displacement and other enhancements does indeed up the power slightly and does so without adding a turbo, keeping things simple and uniform, particularly to application of the power.</p>
<p>More importantly, the power is usable earlier in the rev band, so the GR 86 gets up to speed with more immediacy. In comparison, the heavier GR 86 feels lighter while the outgoing car feels like it&#8217;s dragging a load of bricks.</p>
<p>All of the weight balancing and suspension refinement has given the car an increasing amount of control. One of the defining attributes to the older 86 was how it felt incredibly planted to the ground.</p>
<p>It was difficult to push the car beyond its limits and that was encouraging to drivers old and new to drive without worry that it would go out of sorts beneath them. This still holds true in the GR 86 but the sharper agility takes some adjustment.</p>
<p>It feels like playing your favorite video game and then upping the controller settings way higher than you&#8217;re used to. After getting a handle on it and combined with the rebalanced power output, the GR 86 can glide around corners in a wonderfully rewarding manner.</p>

<p>Steering and throttle may respond to a light touch, but when it comes to the brakes, it&#8217;s a different story. The otherwise lithe GT 86 demands a heavy foot when it comes to slowing or stopping to any significant degree. It&#8217;s not just for deep high-speed braking, either, but even in usual instances of a quick speed adjustment, stepping on the brakes elicits the same incredulity as pushing through a door that wasn&#8217;t as light as it appeared to be.</p>
<p>Between the different transmissions, it boils down to preference, either for the track or the streets.</p>
<p>The manual is slick and light, if a little loose-feeling. Like the car&#8217;s handling, the gearbox itself has been designed for quicker movement throughout the pattern, be that forward, back and diagonal, and the tradeoff for this slippery shifter is a drop in confident gear selection. Otherwise, it&#8217;s a manual, and thus the driver is in full control, as opposed to the automatic.</p>
<p>In general, the automatic transmission is fine for casual to sporty driving, but go beyond that and it starts to become a system to overcome rather than to work with.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sport&#8221; mode handles the throttle response and gearbox behavior in the automatic-affixed GR 86s, and the difference is dramatic in practical application. Trying to drive fast in &#8220;normal,&#8221; nets drivers bursts of speed when the pedal is planted but the gearbox will hurry to return to higher gears as soon as it can, rather than staying low for the driver to maximize acceleration. Even in Sport, it&#8217;ll stay in gear for a bit longer, but will ultimately call its own shots, much to the frustration of the person behind the wheel.</p>
<h2>Street beat</h2>
<p>Taking a spirited drive on the street, the GR 86&#8217;s talents far outshine its shortcomings.</p>
<p>The transmission behavior is still intrusive with the automatic but backroad curves differ from track bends, and its boisterous acceleration and handling almost guarantee a good time no matter what the road ahead looks like.</p>
<p>In between the fun sessions, the Toyota feels competent. It drives better than what one would expect from a sub-$30,000 vehicle, but there&#8217;s no &#8220;wow&#8221; factor here. At worst it feels like an inexpensive commuter car with decent interior touch points, but it&#8217;s far from insufferable.</p>
<p>With the automatic, drivers can use its suite of driver assistance features like adaptive cruise control, which behaves with an eagerness to maintain the set speed in the face of elevation changes or when cars are detected.</p>
<p>Most other settings like lane departure warning are tucked away in a menu accessed through one section of the digital gauge cluster, and its usage is clumsy, particularly while on the move. When it&#8217;s activated, the detection is hit or miss, sometimes ignoring very clear and, in my case, deliberate lane deviation, only to be hyperactive on my journey back on the same road.</p>
<h2>Contenders</h2>
<p>At its price point, the GR 86 doesn&#8217;t have many other sports cars to compete with, apart from the obvious Mazda MX-5. They are similar in their accessibility, affordability and dynamic behavior, but they differ in mission and in attitude.</p>
<p>The Miata is a plucky roadster that endears itself to drivers with its playful drop-top energy. The GR 86 is just as playful, but it&#8217;s slightly more serious, without being comically so or intimidating.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s user preference and use case; I&#8217;d take the Miata on a coastal drive, but I would make the GR 86 my track toy.</p>
<p>Indeed, the GR 86 is only really competing against itself. In one regard, it does this as it endeavors to be better than its outgoing self, and I think most drivers will agree that it succeeds there.</p>
<p>In another, it does this as it goes head-to-head with the Subaru BRZ, its mechanical twin, as Toyota and Subaru famously partnered to make this and the car&#8217;s previous iterations happen. There are certain things that set the cars apart like looks and tuning, but not much else beyond that, and it will be interesting to see which way enthusiasts gravitate.</p>
<p>The GR 86 is an important vehicle to Toyota&#8217;s commitment to its current motorsport endeavors as well as its sports car heritage, which in turn carries a substantial cultural significance. Anyone questioning this need only look to the very top of the company&#8217;s structure. Toyota&#8217;s president Akio Toyoda is not only enthusiastic about sports cars, he&#8217;s an experienced driver and had a personal hand in the development of the GR 86. In short, the car wouldn&#8217;t move forward unless he himself was happy with it, and that degree of personal investment isn&#8217;t spent on things that are unimportant.</p>
<p>Being an entry point to the GR sub-brand (joining the Supra), the GR 86 gives new and experienced enthusiasts a great starting point for a performance driving journey. As drivers, the GR 86 comes with a one-year membership to the National Motor Sport Association, which includes one high performance driving event.</p>
<p>The 86 is also a blank slate for aftermarket tuners, who still modify and maintain cars like the Supra and even the AE86, the GR&#8217;s progenitor. At the end of the day, the GR 86 might not be the fastest or most powerful car on the road or on the track, but its accessibility in both learning curve and price point make it a winner.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Forward Foods, Starday raised $4 million in seed funding to take on “big food” incumbents.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Forward Foods, <a href="http://stardayfoods.com/">Starday</a>, a healthy and sustainable food products company, raised $4 million in seed funding to take on “big food” incumbents.</p>
<p>Equal Ventures and Slow Ventures co-led the round and were joined by Haystack, Great Oaks Venture Capital, XFactor Ventures, ABV and a group of angel investors.</p>
<p>Chaz Flexman, co-founder and CEO, started the remote first company in late 2020 after leaving Pattern Brands. He watched digital grocery go from a single-digit market to double digits overnight.</p>
<p>“It feels like a ‘Napster moment’ in the way consumers are now coming online to discover and buy,” Flexman told TechCrunch. “We are measuring their interest and using data to drive outcomes so we can go up against the Nestlés of the world.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/insights-on-the-food-and-beverages-global-market-to-2030---identify-growth-segments-for-investment-301202729.html">global food and beverages market</a> is expected to reach $7.5 trillion by 2023, with growing demand for foods that are more clean and sustainable, according to market research firm Research and Markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Starday’s technology turns data like that into products based on current trends and customer preferences. It is able to test new concepts, gather feedback and make adjustments before putting new food items on the market, Flexman said. It is also able to cut the time a product takes from idea to market down to six months (from 18 months), while also using feedback to plan for other potential brands.</p>
<p>“We use data to let consumers tell us what they want now rather than how Big Food has operated over the years: to follow consumer demand and create nutritionally bad food that is also bad for the environment,” he added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190133" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190133" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190133" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png 6912w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png?resize=2048,1024 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Press-Landscape-3.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190133" class="wp-caption-text">Gooey Snacks. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Starday</p></div></p>
<p>Its first brand is <a href="https://gooeysnacks.com/?utm_campaign=preorder&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=ffoods">Gooey Snacks</a>, an all-natural, low-sugar chocolate hazelnut spread that is made without dairy or palm oil. Flexman expects to develop four or five brands in the next 12 months, including one more later this year.</p>
<p>Starday went after the seed round so that it could launch more brands like Gooey Snacks, grow the team, develop new retail partnerships and build out its data and forecasting capabilities. The company has four employees currently, and Flexman plans to be at seven in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Rick Zullo, partner at Equal Ventures, said he knew Flexman from his firm’s investment in Pattern and said Flexman’s vision for a new type of food company was aligned with what Equal’s vision was for the food industry.</p>
<p>Rather than being just a product company, Zullo sees Starday being a platform company, able to drive a new way of eating and way of bringing new products to market.</p>
<p>“Starday is able to provide granular data to understand what consumers want and what will perform best,” he added. “This wasn’t possible when digital grocery was still a nascent concept. They don&#8217;t have to do focus groups or testing launches, so it is truly a fraction of the time it takes and is cheaper.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I watched a lot of skate videos growing up. At some point, failures became as important a fixture as perfectly executed tricks. The spills and the injuries could be downright gnarly (there’s a reason, after all, that skateboarding culture gave the world &#8220;Jackass&#8221;), but as an aggressively mediocre skater myself, there was something comforting in seeing the best in the world fall flat on their face and (short of actual injury) dusting themselves off and trying a trick for the fifteenth time.</p>
<p>For the dozens or even hundreds of perfectly choreographed videos we’ve seen from Boston Dynamics, we’ve very rarely gotten a glimpse at the slipped-footed tumbles that happen between takes. Today, the firm is pulling back the curtain a bit on what goes into making its humanoid Atlas robot look good in front of the camera.</p>
<p>There’s a reason, after all, so many of the company’s in-house systems bear scuffs, scratches and discoloration on their middle and lower bodies.</p>

<p>“During filming, Atlas gets the vault right about half of the time,” the company<a href="https://blog.bostondynamics.com/atlas-leaps-bounds-and-backflips"> writes in a blog post</a>. “On the other runs, Atlas makes it over the barrier, but loses its balance and falls backward, and the engineers look to the logs to see if they can find opportunities for on-the-fly adjustments.”</p>
<p>The company challenges the robot to run a mini parkour course, noting in an accompanying video, “Parkour is a useful organizing activity for our team, because it highlights several challenges that we believe to be important.” Parkour is a challenge to both short-term and longer-term problem solving for the robot, which must both execute a series of individual moves and, more broadly, determine how to get from point A to point B by stringing them all together.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EezdinoG4mk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Boston Dynamics says these sorts of videos can take months to get Atlas to complete in one go. “Although this most recent attempt was nearly perfect, it was not precisely perfect, not quite,” the company writes. “After the robots completed their backflips, one was supposed to pump its arm like a big-league pitcher after a game-ending strikeout &#8212; a move that the Atlas team calls the ‘Cha-Ching.’ ”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2190181" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Recording-2021-08-16-at-4.10.33-PM.2021-08-16-16_14_39.gif" alt="" width="800" height="417" /></p>
<p>In addition to the hashtag greatest Atlas fails video compilations that definitely don’t exist on the Boston Dynamics computers, missed footing can result in some pretty nasty injuries for the &#8216;bots &#8212; not unlike their human counterparts. Sometimes it gets back up again, like so many robotic Chumbawumbas. Sometimes not. The video is worth checking out for both of these, as well as some insight into what goes into making one of those videos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GSK Next, the innovation arm of GlaxoSmithKlein, is launching a new mentorship and business development program. Called the Re/Wire Health Studio, the program will eventually select six startups who will win access to nine weeks of mentoring, business development expertise, and cash grants. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://rewirehealthstudio.com/#focus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Re/Wire Health Studio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is designed for growth and early-stage startups focused on “everyday health.” That means products that aid in detecting long-term health problems, incentivize proactive care, or help someone manage a condition, for example. Under the umbrella of “everyday health” the studio will work with startups applying everyday health principals to three areas of focus: oral health, mental resilience, or women’s health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies from all over the world can apply, but they must be prepared to launch in the U.S. with a minimum viable product, or be ready to perform in-market development. Applications close September 20, 2021, and the full cohort will be announced in October. </span></p>
<p>The Re/Wire Health studio is a joint project between the GSK and R/GA Ventures – which will act as the Studio&#8217;s operational partner and help select the cohort.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch spoke with Nick Tate, the Vice President of Global Digital Innovation at GSK Consumer Healthcare and head of GSK Next, to talk about what he looks for in a startup, what selected companies will gain from participation, and the types of projects he’s excited to hear more about. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. </span></i></p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: </b><strong>Just to start off, I’d love to have you expand on what you’re looking for in applicants to the GSK Re/Wire Health Studio. What are two or three things are you looking for?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><b>Tate: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">GSK consumer healthcare is extremely ambitious when it comes to our consumers, the science we are trying to drive and the solutions we are trying to create. One of the big things we look out for is people who really have got an ambition to make a significant positive dent on the world, and have surrounded themselves with people to create that energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drive and excitement is one aspect of it. Then there’s technical capability. We’re looking for companies that are prepared to launch in the US with at least a minimum viable product in service or in-market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for that is [Re/Wire Health Studio] is about taking a service or a platform and saying:  How can we genuinely help? How can we deliver value so these propositions can really live in the world and make an impact on everyday health?  </span></p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: What are the hard and soft skills you want to see in a leadership team?</b></p>
<p><b>Tate:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I think we’re looking for people who have that rare mix of ambition, and reality. You can look at their proposition and believe they’re excited about it – but as we all know [running a startup] is very hard stuff. The ability to be data driven in how they look at propositions is important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it&#8217;s absolutely important that the consumer experience is at the heart of what they do. Putting ‘care’ into everyday healthcare is incredibly important to the sorts of propositions we think are going to make a tangible difference today and into the future. </span></p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: What are two or three things that you hope companies will gain from participating? </b></p>
<p><b>Tate: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d want them to have a genuine understanding of route to scale and what that means. At GSK I think we’re in a really unique position to offer a real perspective on what it takes to have a proposition that can travel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d also want them to leave with a better understanding of themselves, their business, their business model, and what it takes to succeed in the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last 18 months have taught us amazing things do happen when partnerships really work. I&#8217;m excited about bringing this understanding of what it takes to really make something global through GSK. </span></p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: What elements do GSK and R/GA Ventures each bring to the Re/Wire Health Studio? </b></p>
<p><b>Tate:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> From a GSK perspective, we think about what it takes to get into the market in a very changing and dynamic environment of everyday health. We think about manufacturing, regulatory processes, designing for the right kind of outcomes, and of course the science – that’s what we’re known for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are things a business needs to think about down the line, but they don’t have the bandwidth to consider right now. These are very specific skills that the GSK does day in and day out with our existing brands that we think are incredibly important for startups to consider. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From an R/GA perspective, we talk about this notion of creative capital. They’re bringing this team of award winning strategists, technologists, designers, and consultants because we know that a business is just more than a brand, a product is just more than one interaction. </span></p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: I like to hear you expand a bit on why Re/Wire Health Studio is interested in propositions related to oral care, mental resilience and women’s health. Why did you highlight those three focus areas? </b></p>
<p><b>Tate: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the expertise we believe we can bring to the table today, we see all of these areas as extremely exciting unmet needs with the ability to create a genuine impact on people’s everyday health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They address multiple issues for consumers across the world (both today and tomorrow) and will fundamentally be emboldened by better data, insights, and human-centric solutions.</span></p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: When was the last time you were really blown away by a pitch or proposition? What really made it stick in your head? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think, without naming and particular names, it’s when people have really taken a proposition and turned it on its head. Or, the nature of their endeavor is just so ambitious. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all been in those meetings where you meet people and you’re like ‘my goodness, what you are trying to achieve is absolutely incredible.’ I take a lot away from people from purpose, ambition, drive and the audacity to try something. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I find so incredibly exciting about everyday health is that there’s nothing more important than it, and it’s one thing we tend to sleepwalk through. When it’s all said and done, you don’t sit on your deathbed wishing you had slightly different luggage or a nicer watch, you wish you had probably taken better care of your health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when I meet startups who have an ambition to solve those sorts of problems for people all around the world, the hairs at the back of my neck go up. I get incredibly excited about working with those types of people. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic pizza has proven a surprisingly popular goal for startups. Over the past several years, some of those dreams have been more successful than others. Zume is probably the most notable story of a company that fell short, ultimately abandoning its robotic pizza trucks in early 2020 to pivot to sustainable packaging.</p>
<p>Picnic has been making itself known more recently, announcing a $16.3 million raise back in May. Another $4.2 million back in July helped push the company north of $38 million. Today, the startup announced that it’s finally ready to launch its first device, after various pilots across various industries, including restaurants, hospitality, entertainment and theme parks. The announcement was made at the International Pizza Expo and Conference, which apparently is happening in Las Vegas, as we speak.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190148" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190148" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190148" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Precision2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190148" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Picnic</p></div></p>
<p>“The team has been working tirelessly with customers and strategic partners over the past year to fine tune the Picnic Pizza System,” CEO said Clayton Wood said in a release. “We’re very proud of the solution that we have created. The validation we’ve received from industry partners and customers reaffirms the need for kitchen automation solutions like ours, and we are looking forward to an excellent year ahead.”</p>
<p>Pizza is a clear early target for food robotics systems, because 1) it&#8217;s relatively straightforward and reasonably uniform in its construction and 2) people eat a lot of it. In 2015, Americans <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/01/20/we-eat-100-acres-of-pizza-a-day-in-the-u-s/">reportedly ate</a> 100 acres of the stuff &#8212; daily.</p>
<p>The company will be fulfilling existing customer orders through the end of 2021 and will start shipping new orders to customers next year. Pricing will be available as a robotics-as-a-service (RaaS) model, charging customers between $3,500-$5,000 a month to effectively rent the system. The sliding scale is dependent on things like specific configurations of the modular system and output. Fees include maintenance checks and remote monitoring.</p>
<p>The system is up for preorder starting today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Micromobility company Bird has officially joined the ranks of e-scooter and e-bike operators that are integrated with Google Maps, which now surfaces nearby vehicles for users in the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bird&#8217;s announcement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/spins-electric-scooters-and-bikes-are-now-on-google-maps/">comes just a day after Spin also announced its integration with Google Maps</a> and just a few weeks after Lime, which has been integrated with Google Maps since 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/moovit-integrates-lime-electric-scooters-bikes-mopeds-into-transit-planning-app/">announced an integration with transit planning app Moovit</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bird already works with mobility-as-a-service platforms including Skipr, Tranzer and soon Whim in Antwerp and throughout Belgium. The company has also recently partnered with major national rail companies SNCF in France and Trenitalia in Italy. It plans to expand its Google Maps integration with Bird&#8217;s partner cities outside of the U.S. in the future, according to a spokesperson for the company. These sorts of integrations are par for the course as micromobility companies seek to become further entwined with the broader transportation ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As demand for sustainable transportation increases, Bird is committed to meeting this need while simultaneously reducing street traffic in already congested cities and towns,&#8221; said Bird CEO and founder Travis VanderZanden, in a statement. &#8220;Through our integration with Google Maps, we are making it easier for individuals to embrace new modes of eco-friendly travel and to ultimately eliminate our collective reliance on congestion inducing, gas-powered cars – especially in urban settings across the globe where a majority of trips are under five miles.”</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">As with Lime and Spin, Bird&#8217;s vehicles will show up as an option under the bike toggle of the Google Maps app. The app will show information such as estimated travel time, cost and environmental impact. Bird did not respond in time for publication to a request for information on whether estimated battery range would also be available, which is displayed with Lime and Spin&#8217;s vehicles on the app.</p>

<p>Users who choose to take a trip with Bird will have to click on the &#8220;unlock&#8221; button displayed on the bottom of the Google Maps screen, which will direct them to the Bird app, available on iOS and Android, to unlock and pay for a vehicle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bird&#8217;s news about its integration with Google Maps comes on the same day that the operator, along with Veo and Lime, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2021/pr21-030.shtml">launch New York City&#8217;s first e-scooter pilot in the Bronx</a>. The timing of this launch alone would make this integration beneficial for Bird, but the scooter company potentially stands to gain even more in NYC. Last month, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/google-maps-now-show-yorkers-131847888.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAH7zjBAW6fl0FzRmRMLIqFnBQ1NbTUAgfCHerbx4dH4bkmRXAiG_YQvutv7tbkaKC83yXyYvRd3yB97_5rHvvewEv07djFcKX6QchEMqbub6b6NI41aF2Dkv47LoI3yxkU5HB5P06UJ91LhLVEwCyg14IcgUZIHgz1BzNvyymrPK">Google Maps began trialling a feature in the big apple</a> to show users which train cars were the busiest in order to help riders social distance better. Now, those users can ostensibly choose to seek out a Bird or Lime vehicle via the app rather than cram into a packed subway car.</p>

They use a technique called a feature flag, and <a href="http://split.io">Split.io</a>, a startup that has built a platform to help manage feature flags, announced a $50 million Series D today.</p>
<p>Owl Rock was lead investor with participation from Northgate Capital and existing investors Accel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Harmony Partners, Microsoft’s venture capital fund M12, Atlassian Ventures, and ServiceNow. The company raised $110 million in total including its $33 million Series C last summer.</p>
<p>CEO Brian Bell, who came on board at the end of 2019, says the company helps development teams deliver controlled rollouts of new features. &#8220;What we provide is essentially a platform that allows development teams to separate the deployment of code from the release of the feature, so that you can turn the feature on and off as needed, essentially toggle the feature and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s called the feature flag,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Bell says that when you can control the release of new features in this way, it can free up development teams to be more experimental. &#8220;The feature flag in many ways sounds so basic, but it&#8217;s an incredibly powerful concept and it allows development teams to turn features on for different users, and to control the rollout. And that fundamentally changes the way you build and release products,&#8221; Bell explained.</p>
<p>He says the real power of this approach comes into play when you combine this ability with data like performance data, user behavior data and business analytics to see the impact of a change on the application and users. What&#8217;s more, the platform helps manage flag bloat by alerting you to turn them off once a feature is rolled out to 100% of users and is no longer needed.</p>
<p>The company is growing fast and expects to be between 200 and 250 employees in the next 12 months. He says that it&#8217;s a tough hiring environment, but that he is cognizant of building a diverse and inclusive company in spite of the challenges. He says that when he came on board, he formed a DEI task force shortly after taking over, and brought in an outside consultant to help guide the conversation.</p>

<p>He believes that creating an inclusive environment will help drive diversity. &#8220;One of the things I believe in that I&#8217;ve learned is that if you focus on inclusion, you will create diversity because an inclusive culture will attract a diverse applicant pool because people will recognize that they can be successful in this company,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Bell says that with strategic investors on board like Microsoft, Atlassian and ServiceNow, all solid public companies, it gives him more credibility in the marketplace and should help him continue to grow the platform. And that doesn&#8217;t just involve money. These companies are also partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the developers that we serve want to make sure that we coexist within the workflow of those application development platforms. So for example, with JIRA which is part of Atlassian, we have a bi-directional integration that allows a ticket within JIRA to show a feature flag content right on the ticket.&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>While the company is a Series D, Bell isn&#8217;t thinking exit any time soon. He wants to continue to build the company. &#8220;If you think about markets, this is absolutely massive. So our focus right now is just on growth. My focus personally is on how do I scale the team, how do I hire the right people, and how do we deliver value to our customers and if we do that, there will be opportunities and strategic options moving forward, whether it takes the form of an IPO or being part of something larger.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/">Monte Carlo</a> has returned to the capital well for the second time this year, adding $60 million to its accounts thanks to a new, ICONIQ Growth-led Series C. The company helps customers monitor their data inflows, finding issues and errors that could foul downstream data analysis.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/monte-carlo-raises-25m-for-its-data-observability-service/">raised a Series B earlier this year</a>, a $25 million round led by GGV and Redpoint. Both Series B lead investors participated in Monte Carlo&#8217;s Series C, joined by Salesforce Ventures, a new investor in the company.</p>
<p>The company declined to share what it is now worth, but did tell TechCrunch that it is now worth 4x its previous valuation. Given that the company&#8217;s Series B likely sold for between 15% and 25% of the company, valuing it somewhere around the $100 million to $175 million range, we can infer a new valuation range of around $400 million to $700 million from its new investment. That&#8217;s back-of-the-envelope math, but it&#8217;s the best we can do.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190189" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190189" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190189 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png" alt="" width="1600" height="802" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png?resize=768,385 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png?resize=1536,770 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Monte-Carlo-Lineage-Dashboard.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190189" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Monte Carlo. Shared as too often we cover enterprise software from a purely textual perspective. Here&#8217;s what it looks like!</p></div></p>
<p>In slightly more concrete terms, Monte Carlo told TechCrunch that it doubled its ARR in each of the last four quarters, or that it scaled its annual recurring revenue by around 8x from the one-year period between &#8220;summer 2020 [and] summer 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given its growth rate, it&#8217;s not hard to see how the startup managed to put together another round of capital.</p>
<p>However, as is common with young tech companies raising rapid-fire rounds of capital these days, Monte Carlo did not need the money. According to Monte Carlo co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/BM_DataDowntime">Barr Moses</a>, she was on the receiving end of investor interest and still had the majority of her company&#8217;s Series B in the bank.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Monte Carlo has raised $101 million to date, and, given Moses&#8217;s comment, has north of $70 million in cash on hand.</p>
<p>Given the company&#8217;s dearth of impending cash-flow issues, we asked Moses why she raised more capital. She said that Monte Carlo is perceived as a market leader in its category and that she wants to build the biggest company that she can. Monte Carlo wants to pull on all available levers, she explained; with the new capital, it&#8217;s going to hire more folks, build more product, support more use cases and take on new markets.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s market is growing in tandem with the larger world of big data and data-focused analysis. More simply, Monte Carlo sits upstream from data lakes and the analytical tools that data scientists use to extract insights from reams of information.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch noted at the time of the company&#8217;s Series B, by monitoring data ingestion for its customers, Monte Carlo can prevent crunched data from being skewed due to inbound issues. Its software can detect various divergences from historical patterns, for example, alerting customers to which of their inbound data sources could be providing faulty information.</p>
<p>If we think of data science as a steering wheel of sorts, data observability is the work of keeping the car&#8217;s windshield clear. That way when you steer, you aren&#8217;t accidentally driving in the wrong direction. Into a wall, for example. Sure, it&#8217;s not a perfect analogy, but it&#8217;s workable.</p>
<p>Widening our lens, Monte Carlo is a good example of the current startup fundraising market. When an upstart technology company can demonstrate rapid growth, investors are willing to fund it far in advance of its needs, hoping to secure a share of its future success as early as possible. This practice goes against old-fashioned venture capital thought, in which too much capital was believed to engender focus risks. Excess capital for investment has shaken up venture logic, or at least venture behavior.</p>
<p>Regardless, the market for analytical work in the data world has proved to be a simply massive market. Databricks&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/">latest valuation underscores that fact</a>.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo is riding a similar wave. Expect to hear from the company again in early 2022 if it keeps its growth rate even close to what it managed in the last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> acquired <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> at the end of last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">for almost $28 billion</a>, you had to figure that they had some big plans for the company, and today the CRM giant announced some initial integrations that should prove useful for Salesforce customers.</p>
<p>Rob Seaman, SVP for Slack at Salesforce sees Slack as the communications platform for Salesforce moving forward. &#8220;We really want Slack to be the primary engagement surface for our users, their communications, their work, their workflows and the processes and the apps they support,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re announcing are these new capabilities to support that Slack vision for sales, service, marketing and analytics. And for each of those areas what we&#8217;re doing is a combination of articulating, both in best practices and codifying, how you can and should model your sales, service and marketing organizations in this new world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The hope is that by taking advantage of Slack&#8217;s ability to integrate external enterprise apps inside the application, working together they can find ways to speed up and automate various Salesforce tasks, making it faster and easier to use without switching context to make it happen.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/embed/#?secret=lPeaQkvo6f" data-secret="lPeaQkvo6f" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For starters, the Sales Cloud gets dedicated deal rooms, where all of the parties involved in a complex sale, whether internal departments like finance and product people or external partners, can come together in Slack throughout the sales cycle and stay on top of the ebb and flow of all the sales activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the deal room is an expression of an opportunity from Salesforce into Slack in a way that makes it very simple to connect with everybody to effectively get a deal done, including customers and partners,&#8221; Seaman explained. &#8220;That&#8217;s where Slack Connect is extremely powerful [to connect with external partners]. We think we should be able to dramatically reduce sales cycle lengths as a result of this…&#8221; he said. Slack Connect is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/slack-announces-connect-an-improved-way-for-companies-to-talk-to-one-another/">the service introduced last year</a> that enables Slack users to connect with people outside of a company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition, through integrations members of the sales team involved in a more complex deal can get daily updates, which are automatically pulled together in Slack and include personalized daily task lists, meetings and priority deals.</p>
<p>Service teams can meet together in a room Salesforce is calling a swarm, a place for the team to help one another with specific questions or problems they may be having. In a company with a large product catalogue this could be particularly helpful to get an answer quickly. While <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/salesforce-update-brings-ai-and-quip-to-customer-service-chat-experience/">Einstein recommendations</a> helps with related content, a swarm can come in handy when there is a more specific question involved and a human with that knowledge may be just the ticket. Service team members will also be able to search for experts to invite to the swarm, who may be able to help answer the question or solve the problem more quickly.</p>
<p>Not to be left out, marketing gets intelligent insights delivered with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-salesforce-com-m-a-datorama/salesforce-agrees-to-acquire-datorama-idUSKBN1K61U5">the help of Datorama</a>, the company Salesforce bought in 2018. Marketers also get regular updates inside of Slack when a change is made to a marketing campaign.</p>
<p>Finally there are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/salesforce-is-buying-data-visualization-company-tableau-for-15-7b-in-all-stock-deal/">integrations with Tableau</a>, the company that Salesforce bought in 2018 for $6.5 billion &#8212; Salesforce is a highly acquisitive company. In a similar way that marketers get updates to campaigns, other users can get Slack updates whenever data they consider important gets updated in Tableau, and they can also get daily digests of key metrics that matter to them right in Slack.</p>
<p>Seaman promised that these announcements were just the start, and we will be hearing about more integrations with Slack at the Dreamforce customer conference next month &#8212; and in the coming months. &#8220;This is just the beginning, and so you&#8217;ll continue to see expansion of the integrations between Salesforce and Slack for the four areas that we&#8217;re announcing today around sales, service, marketing and analytics, but also every single cloud and industry solution in [the] Salesforce [family of products] is working on this,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hamburg&#8217;s state government has been formally warned against using Zoom over data protection concerns.</p>
<p>The German state&#8217;s data protection agency (DPA) took the step of issuing a <a href="https://datenschutz-hamburg.de/pressemitteilungen/2021/08/2021-08-16-senatskanzlei-zoom">public warning</a> yesterday, writing in a press release that the Senate Chancellory&#8217;s use of the popular videoconferencing tool violates the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) since user data is transferred to the US for processing.</p>
<p>The DPA&#8217;s concern follows a landmark ruling (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Schrems II</a>) by Europe&#8217;s top court last summer which invalidated a flagship data transfer arrangement between the EU and the US (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/privacy-shield/">Privacy Shield</a>), finding US surveillance law to be incompatible with EU privacy rights.</p>
<p>The fallout from Schrems II has been slow to manifest &#8212; beyond an instant blanket of legal uncertainty. However a number of European DPAs are now investigating the use of US-based digital services because of the data transfer issue, and in some instances publicly warning against the use of mainstream US tools like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/german-government-bodies-urged-to-remove-their-facebook-pages-before-next-year/">Facebook</a> and Zoom because user data cannot be adequately safeguarded when it&#8217;s taken over the pond.</p>
<p>German agencies are among the most proactive in this respect. But the EU&#8217;s data protection supervisor is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/eu-bodies-use-of-us-cloud-services-from-aws-microsoft-being-probed-by-blocs-privacy-chief/">investigating the bloc&#8217;s use of cloud services</a> from US giants Amazon and Microsoft over the same data transfer concern.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0r2vQkNnBv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/german-government-bodies-urged-to-remove-their-facebook-pages-before-next-year/">German government bodies urged to remove their Facebook Pages before next year</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;German government bodies urged to remove their Facebook Pages before next year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/german-government-bodies-urged-to-remove-their-facebook-pages-before-next-year/embed/#?secret=0r2vQkNnBv" data-secret="0r2vQkNnBv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At the same time, negotiations between the European Commission and the Biden administration to seek a replacement data transfer deal remain ongoing. However EU lawmakers have repeatedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/no-quick-fix-for-transatlantic-data-transfers-says-ec/">warned against any quick fix</a> &#8212; saying reform of US surveillance law is likely required <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/eu-us-privacy-shield-is-dead-long-live-privacy-shield/">before there can be a revived Privacy Shield</a>. And as the legal limbo continues a growing number of public bodies in Europe are facing pressure to ditch US-based services in favor of compliant local alternatives.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the Hamburg case, the DPA says it took the step of issuing the Senate Chancellory with a public warning after the body did not provide an adequate response to concerns raised earlier.</p>
<p>The agency asserts that use of Zoom by the public body does not comply with the GDPR&#8217;s requirement for a valid legal basis for processing personal data, writing: &#8220;The documents submitted by the Senate Chancellery on the use of Zoom show that [GDPR] standards are not being adhered to.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DPA initiated a formal procedure earlier, via a hearing, on June 17, 2021 but says the Senate Chancellory failed to stop using the videoconferencing tool. Nor did it provide any additional documents or arguments to demonstrate compliance usage. Hence the DPA taking the step of a formal warning, under Article 58 (2) (a) of the GDPR.</p>
<p>In a statement, Ulrich Kühn, the acting Hamburg commissioner for data protection and freedom of information, dubbed it &#8220;incomprehensible&#8221; that the regional body was continuing to flout EU law in order to use Zoom &#8212; pointing out that a local alternative, provided by the German company Dataport (which supplies software to a number of state, regional and local government bodies) is readily available.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the statement [translated with Google Translate], Kühn said: “Public bodies are particularly bound to comply with the law. It is therefore more than regrettable that such a formal step had to be taken. At the [Senate Chancellery of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg], all employees have access to a tried and tested video conference tool that is unproblematic with regard to third-country transmission. As the central service provider, Dataport also provides additional video conference systems in its own data centers. These are used successfully in other regions such as Schleswig-Holstein. It is therefore incomprehensible why the Senate Chancellery insists on an additional and legally highly problematic system.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the Hamburg DPA and Senate Chancellory with questions.</p>
<p>Zoom has also been contacted for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Travel tech company Hopper has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/hopper-raises-170m-and-partners-with-capital-one-on-a-new-cardholder-travel-booking-portal/">raised a $175 million Series G</a>, the company said today. That&#8217;s nearly the same amount it raised in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/hopper-raises-170m-and-partners-with-capital-one-on-a-new-cardholder-travel-booking-portal/">Series F round</a> that closed earlier this year. These are indeed new funds, however, bringing its total raised to date to nearly $600 million, with the company now valued at over $3.5 billion. This latest round arrives as Hopper is seeing impressive growth as travel starts to surge on the recent downswings in cases in North America following large-scale Covid-19 vaccination campaigns.</p>
<p>Hopper says that its revenue is on track to surge 330% vs. last year, which is hardly surprising given that 2020 saw the depths of the pandemic and a widespread screeching halt to the bustling global travel industry. The more impressive stat is that Hopper&#8217;s revenue is already up 100% vs. its last pre-pandemic quarter, indicating the tough choices and aggressive re-prioritization of its products and business it underwent as a result of the pandemic are working well.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a looming spectre threatening the overall narrative of a travel industry bounce-back: Delta and other Covid-19 variants, which are currently driving another wave of resurgence of the disease in North America. I asked Hopper CEO and co-founder Fred Lalonde about Delta&#8217;s impact on Hopper&#8217;s business so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently, we have not seen an incremental impact of the Delta variant on Hopper’s domestic bookings,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In recent weeks, we have seen higher domestic bookings and lower international bookings on Hopper, as travelers look to stay closer to home. Since Hopper’s customer base is predominantly younger, leisure travelers and the majority of our bookings have been domestic throughout the pandemic, our domestic bookings still remain stable. &#8221;</p>
<p>Regardless of the impact on the nature of bookings, though, Lalonde notes that Hopper&#8217;s line of fintech products (something the company increasingly sees as its key differentiation) are in increasing demand as elements of uncertainty like the impact of the Delta variant enter into customer travel planning considerations.</p>
<p>We are, however, seeing increased demand for our flexible booking products in recent weeks,&#8221; Lalonde said. &#8220;In fact, purchases of Hopper’s Cancel for Any Reason are up 33% from early July, Change for Any Reason is up 9.3% from early July, and Rebooking Guarantee is up 12% in the past month, as travelers look for more flexibility and protection over their trips.&#8221;</p>
<p>These AI-powered tools offer protections against pricing fluctuations and volatility, no hassle rebooking even up to the day prior to your trip, cross-airline rebooking for missed connections and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2190388" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190388" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190388" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PR-General-Products-A-01.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190388" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hopper</p></div></p>
<p>Hopper is also looking to use these newly-raised funds to further reinforce its business through increased customer support hiring (it&#8217;s already scaled the team by 200% and rolled out a suit of new automated tools that Lalonde says resolves 60% of its inbound requests &#8220;instantly&#8221;). The company intends to bring on 500 new employees in the near future, with 300 of those dedicated to customer service roles.</p>
<p>Another area of interest for Hopper with this funding is acqui-hiring: Lalonde says specific targets include teams focused on &#8220;travel, data science or engineering-heavy startups to help introduce new product offerings and fuel its international expansion.&#8221; The company&#8217;s product expansion goals include opening up home rentals on the platform, and its global ambitions include expanding to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>When it raised its Series F in March, Hopper also announced that it would be white labeling its booking products through <a href="https://cloud.hopper.com/">Hopper Cloud</a>, and partnering first with Capital One to launch a travel booking portal for its cardholders, which is on track to debut later this year. Since then, Hopper has also revealed that it will be <a href="https://amadeus.com/en/insights/press-release/amadeus-hopper-expand-relationship-to-stimulate-return-to-travel-with-fintech">working with Amadeus</a> to roll out its fintech products to any travel provider that wants to use them, including airlines, online travel agencies and more.</p>
<p>Covid-19 was obviously a shock to the system across all industries and almost every aspect of daily life, but the travel industry likely experienced some of the most dramatic upheaval. Hopper&#8217;s ability to attract significant pools of new funding in the wake of the pandemic, including this new round led by GPI Capital, reflect the impressive flexibility and speed with which it&#8217;s been able to shape an entirely new kind of digital travel company that anticipates and even thrives on volatility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unbundling financial data through APIs and driving data-driven insights with value-add products in Africa keeps getting more exciting as major players continue to raise more money for scale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than a year after its $3 million seed round, San Francisco- and Africa-based fintech <a href="https://pngme.com/">Pngme</a> has snapped up another $15 million for its financial data infrastructure play</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company is also describing itself as a machine learning-as-a-service platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octopus Ventures led the Series A round, with follow-on investment from Lateral Capital, EchoVC and Raptor Group.  Other investors like Unshackled Ventures, Future Africa and Two Small Fish Ventures participated too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme also received checks from angel investors; some include Hayden Simmons of RallyCap, Plaid&#8217;s Dan Kahn, Richard Talbot of RBC Capital and Kyle Ellicott of Intersect VC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme&#8217;s platform caters to fintechs and other financial institutions across sub-Saharan Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the founders, Brendan Playford and Cate Rung, last spoke with TechCrunch, Pngme was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">heading out of stealth mode in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cSuHt5i2rx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/pngme-a-financial-data-platform-closes-3m-seed-to-accelerate-growth-in-sub-saharan-africa/">Pngme, a financial data platform, closes $3M seed to accelerate growth in Sub-Saharan Africa</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pngme, a financial data platform, closes $3M seed to accelerate growth in Sub-Saharan Africa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/pngme-a-financial-data-platform-closes-3m-seed-to-accelerate-growth-in-sub-saharan-africa/embed/#?secret=cSuHt5i2rx" data-secret="cSuHt5i2rx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Pngme has three core products for clients in these three markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to its already known API and mobile SDK, Pngme has added a customer management platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says combining the three products will drive its customers&#8217; adoption and use of personalized user experiences and financial products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a conversation with TechCrunch, Playford references building personalized user fintech experiences to what Alipay and WeChat have done in the past couple of years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When users sign up, both platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the right recommendations on every financial service before offering the right product when they make up their minds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data-driven user experience. And every fintech or bank wants to provide that same data-driven user experience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From instant loans or savings, or overdrafts, or whatever it might be, it&#8217;s all </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like a user experience around a product,&#8221; Playford said, referring to both Chinese super-app juggernauts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;If you get to the core of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the business problems for financial institutions, they&#8217;re looking at doing two things. One is they&#8217;re looking at lowering their customer acquisition costs. And then they&#8217;re looking at increasing the lifetime value of their customers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playford says Pngme wants to mirror this playbook. But why has it become important for the company all of a sudden?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most African financial institutions and fintechs are racing to offer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customized user experiences and financial products tailored to their customers’ needs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To fuel these products and user experiences, data infrastructure </span>is needed<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Machine learning models </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are supposed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be trained</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and maximize the lifetime value of a customer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These processes can be expensive and time-consuming, leaving them with the difficult task of choosing between building the infrastructure or serving their customer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme allows financial institutions and fintechs to collect and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> financial data at scale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says its mobile SDK and data processing pipelines collect alternative financial data and unify it with other data sources to create a holistic picture of an individual&#8217;s financial behavior</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The pain point we solve is the cost of building the infrastructure is very high. And the data science, the data engineering talent, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> globally is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">hard to find. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So building a data infrastructure as a service works </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> well because it&#8217;s a subscription to get those services which you&#8217;d </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">normally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need a five- or six-person team to build this structure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The close of Pngme&#8217;s Series A brings its total investment to $18.5 million, making it the most funded in this fintech category across the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other prominent startups include South African-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/stitch-emerges-from-stealth-with-4m-for-its-api-fintech-play-in-africa/">Stitch</a>, and Nigeria&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/nigerian-fintech-okra-raises-3-5m-backed-by-accenture-ventures-and-susa-ventures/">Okra</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/nigerias-mono-raises-millions-to-power-the-internet-economy-in-africa/">Mono</a> and OnePipe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although each platform has morphed into providing more complex data offerings, Playford says one of the important things Pngme has considered since February is clearly distinguishing itself from these other platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we do is that we&#8217;ve kind of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> differentiated ourselves to be not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> collecting the data that we can see but also, we can connect to Mono data, Okra data, and we can connect with banks&#8217; data</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> merge all that data and then put machine learning models on top for the clients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That can be predictive credit models, segmentation models and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> positioning ourselves as a data processing infrastructure for banks and fintechs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playford&#8217;s explanation of how he thinks Pngme is different resonates with the way other founders think of their own platforms. But time will tell how long these products can keep being dissimilar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme&#8217;s proposition has found traction with some unnamed tier-one banks in Nigeria and South Africa; fintechs Kuda, Umba, Renmoney, CredPal and credit bureaus like TransUnion Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme will use the investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more customers, it says. One way the company plans to make this happen is by expanding its executive team. Pngme is hiring Lorraine Kageni Maina as the CSO and Nick Masson as the CTO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside key executive hires, Pngme is expanding its data science, engineering and sales teams globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">COO Rung says Pngme’s infrastructure has processed billions of data points from hundreds of financial institutions across sub-Saharan Africa. The next plan is to double down on its Insights Library product and expand its third-party data connections to other markets over the next year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Octopus Ventures, the lead investor in this round, Pngme shows the need for actionable data to drive the explosion of digital fintech services for Africans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On why the VC firm invested, Tosin Agbabiaka said, &#8220;The elegance of the technology solution, combined with an exceptional team and strong market traction with large institutions underlines our belief that Pngme will power the next generation of financial services in Africa, helping to give millions of more people access to banking and lending</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.molocoads.com/en/">MOLOCO</a>, an adtech startup that uses machine learning to build mobile campaigns, announced today it has raised $150 million in new Series C funding led by Tiger Global Management, taking its valuation to $1.5 billion. This is separate from the $20 million Series C round MOLOCO <a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202105040008">announced three months ago</a>, which brought it to unicorn status. Co-founder and chief executive officer Ikkjin Ahn told TechCrunch that MOLOCO raised again so soon because “as we gear up for a potential IPO, we wanted more funding to help us grow faster.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2013 and based in Redwood City, California, MOLOCO has now raised $200 million in total. The company claims it has “consistently grown in excess of 100% annually,” and has an annual net revenue run rate of more than $100 million.</p>
<p>Its clients range in size from mobile developers who have less than 100,000 users to more than a billion, Ahn said in an email, with some spending more than $1 million a month through MOLOCO Cloud, its demand side platform (DSP). MOLOCO’s customers include King Digital, Playrix and Netmarble.</p>
<p>MOLOCO already serves mobile app developers in a wide range of industries, like gaming, social networking, e-commerce, ride-sharing, food delivery and fintech, helping them turn their first-party user data into marketing, monetization and user acquisition campaigns. The new funding will be used to expand MOLOCO’s machine learning engine to more use cases by focusing on research and development, product and engineering. Part of the raise is earmarked for hiring, adding to MOLOCO’s 200 employees, who are spread across the world in eight offices: San Francisco, Seattle, London, Beijing, Seoul, Singapore and Tokyo.</p>

<p>MOLOCO is getting ready to launch its Retail Media Platform, currently in beta, which helps e-commerce companies create revenue streams like sponsored ads.</p>
<p>Before launching MOLOCO, Ahn was a machine learning engineer at YouTube from 2008 to 2010, then Android from 2010 to 2013. Back then, MOLOCO’s founding team “noticed that a lot of mobile businesses struggled to generate sustainable growth and monetization,” Ahn said. “A big reason for that was that they offered very unique services and therefore generated very unique data—data that traditional tools were incapable of helping make use of.” MOLOCO’s machine learning engine was created to help companies turn their first-party data into growth campaigns and monetization strategies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eight years later, mobile developers now view machine learning “as an essential part of their tech stack in order to advertise and monetize their apps effectively,&#8221; Ahn said.</p>
<p>Some try to build their own machine learning algorithms, but this can be a drain on their resources. Others outsource the work, but that means losing transparency and control of their data. Ahn said MOLOCO’s goal is to help app developers maintain control of data while giving them access to the same quality of algorithms as tech giants like Facebook and Google, which he describes as the startup&#8217;s main competitors.</p>
<h3>Beyond walled gardens</h3>
<p>“Let’s face it, most ad spend today is going to Facebook and Google, because they have excellent machine learning and they make it easy for advertisers to scale their campaigns,” Ahn said.</p>
<p>But a major drawback for businesses is that first-party data generated on Facebook or Google Ads for targeting and optimization can’t be used on other platforms, creating walled gardens. On the other hand, MOLOCO allows businesses to retain full access to their data. “We believe they should own it and do with it what they want,” Ahn said.</p>
<p>This also helps businesses adapt to new consumer privacy laws. Stricter regulations make it important for companies to gather as much of their own data as possible, since they will get less of it from other sources, and make sure that they keep that data secure. Ahn said MOLOCO’s platform and cloud service “are built with security and privacy in mind, so our partners can simply plug in their data and trust that we handle all compliance matters.”</p>

<p>Part of MOLOCO’s new funding will be used to expand MOLOCO Cloud, which programmatically bids on ad exchanges like Google AdX and Twitter Mopub, into new verticals and geographic markets.</p>
<p>To make the most efficient use of ad budgets, MOLOCO Cloud analyzes signals like in-app purchases or in-app activities that allow businesses to gauge the effectiveness of a campaign.</p>
<p>“For mobile games, those activities often include level completions or friend invites; for ride sharing apps, it’s likely to be a ride order; for e-commerce apps, it’s likely to be a purchase,” Ahn said, adding “the strength of our machine learning is that it is flexible enough to automatically adjust to an advertiser’s unique KPIs and embrace different, diverse data sets.”</p>
<p>MOLOCO’s Retail Media Platform was created to help e-commerce companies make more money off their sites through features like Recommended Products and Sponsored Ads. “For example, our machine learning can tell them, in real time, which products a visitor is most likely to purchase next, so that they can make intelligent recommendations that drive incremental revenue,” Ahn said. The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/amazon-ad-revenue-now-twice-as-big-as-snap-twitter-roku-and-pinterest-combined.html">massive growth of Amazon’s ad platform</a> also demonstrates how sponsored ads can be a significant source of revenue for e-commerce businesses, he added.</p>
<p>In a statement about Tiger Global’s investment in MOLOCO, partner John Curtius said, “The volume of digital data produced is growing exponentially yet the tools available for taking action on that data remain relatively limited. We invested in MOLOCO because its machine learning algorithms have proven to be among the best available and the level of transparency and sophistication the company brings to data-driven businesses is paramount in today’s world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech </span><a href="https://www.brex.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first partnered with </span><a href="https://www.weav.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weav</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a developer of a universal API for commerce platforms, last summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, Brex </span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/faster-payments/2021/brex-instant-payouts-live-shopify-sellers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched Instant Payouts for Shopify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sellers using the startup’s technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results were impressive enough that by April, Brex co-founders Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi participated in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/weav-raises-4-3m-to-knit-together-a-universal-api-for-commerce-platfofrms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weav’s $4.3 million seed round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as strategic angel investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few months, the pair determined that Weav’s technology &#8212; and team &#8212; was too good to share. So today, the fintech is announcing that it is acquiring one-year-old Weav for $50 million in its first significant acquisition, TechCrunch has learned exclusively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, the deal was forged without the founders of either company having met &#8212; which may have been more unusual before the COVID-19 pandemic but is likely more commonplace these days. (Although they have since met.) Brex has previously made &#8216;acquihires&#8217; but has not previously acquired both a company&#8217;s team and technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brex started working with Weav “pretty early on” in the company’s life as a partner, Dubugras said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were so impressed with [CEO] Nadav [Lidor] and his team, how fast they were building and how good the technology is, that we wanted to expand to a more strategic partnership,” he told TechCrunch. “Then, we started talking about an acquisition.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch talked with Dubugras and Weav CEO and co-founder Lidor to find out the details of the deal, and why it’s significant for both companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, as part of the acquisition, Brex will be expanding its global presence by building an “innovation hub” and hiring employees in Israel beyond Weav’s nine-person team, which is located in Israel and New York. CEO Lidor will head up Brex&#8217;s new Israeli office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides expanding its global reach, the technology that Brex is acquiring will help accelerate the fintech’s connectivity of its platform, Dubugras said. Currently, Brex offers credit cards, business cash accounts, spend management and bill pay software together in a single dashboard for its customers (mostly startups). Its goal is to continue expanding its product and services portfolio to become “a fully-integrated and holistic financial platform for businesses.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Weav’s technology helps make Brex even better for our customers,” he said.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Weav raises $4.3M to knit together a universal API for commerce platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/weav-raises-4-3m-to-knit-together-a-universal-api-for-commerce-platfofrms/embed/#?secret=HjKKAo3IEa" data-secret="HjKKAo3IEa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded last year by engineers Ambika Acharya, Avikam Agur and Lidor after participating in the W20 YC batch, Weav was among the wave of fintech infrastructure companies that aimed to give fintechs and financial institutions a boost. Specifically, Weav’s embedded technology was designed to give organizations access to “real time, user-permissioned” commerce data that they could use to create new financial products for small businesses.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its products will allow customers to connect to multiple platforms with a single API that was developed specifically for the commerce platforms that businesses use to sell products and accept payments. Weav has operated under the premise that allowing companies to build and embed new financial products creates new opportunities for e-commerce merchants, creators and other entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception last year, Weav’s API call volume has grown by 300% each month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increased adoption of cloud and SaaS technologies has led to data being stored in a variety of disparate systems. Weav’s API aims to build digital connections that enable automatic sharing and analysis, thus (as mentioned above) allowing commerce platforms to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">access their customers&#8217; standardized transaction data in real time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is important to Brex because it believes that by using Weav&#8217;s technology, businesses which use its platform will be able to get financial services and new products “more quickly and precisely.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to build this all-in-one finance platform,” Dubugras told TechCrunch. “That was already the direction we were headed with the partnership but this acquisition helps us so that we can build a better integration across all our financial products, and we can do more, and a lot faster than what we were originally planning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, he added, Brex integrates with platforms such as Shopify. With the acquisition of Weav, it intends to build more lending, visualization and insights products for its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Weav team will basically m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">anage any third-party integration,” Dubugras said, “so that Brex can be your financial operating system no matter where your data is. You can have everything in one place.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidor admits that Weav did not expect to be exiting so soon after founding. But the companies found themselves on the same page, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Our goal has always been to connect businesses, creators, and other entrepreneurs with fintech to expand financial access, and this aligns with Brex’s mission,” Lidor added. “After working with Henrique and Pedro, we realized they couldn’t be a better partner. We too were so impressed with the Brex team, and had a great time learning from them, and building with them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company did not disclose its valuation at the time of its $4.3 million seed round earlier this year. The $50 million price tag represents a “healthy multiple for all involved,” Dubugras said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion into Israel is also exciting to the Brex team, which went remote last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic with operations in the United States, Canada and Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017, San Francisco-based Brex earlier this year was valued at $7.4 billion after raising a $425 million Series D led by Tiger Global. The company has raised $1.2 billion in debt and equity financing, according to Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/brex">data</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the company announced it had put together a new service </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210426005625/en/Brex-Unveils-All-In-One-Financial-Solution-For-Businesses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called Brex Premium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that costs $49 per month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The number of premium subscribers that we now have definitely blew away our expectations,” Dubugras said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, Brex was the latest fintech </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/brex-applies-for-bank-charter-taps-former-silicon-valley-bank-exec-as-ceo-of-brex-bank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to apply for a bank charter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which sells a credit card tailored for startups, with Emigrant Bank currently acting as the issuer,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">had submitted an application with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI) to establish Brex Bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, the company said it would <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/brex-will-withdraw-applications-for-industrial-bank">voluntarily withdraw</a> its bank charter and federal deposit insurance applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will permit us to modify and strengthen our application and resubmit at a later date,” the company said. “We appreciate the support and thoughtful guidance from the Utah DFI and FDIC.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise Resource Planning systems have traditionally been the preserve of larger companies, but in recent years the amount of data small medium sized businesses can generate has increased to the point where even SMEs/SMBs can get into the world of ERP. And that&#8217;s especially true for online-only businesses.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/germanys-xentral-nabs-20m-led-by-sequoia-to-help-online-facing-smbs-run-back-offices-better/">covered</a> the $20 million Series A funding of <a href="http://Xentral.com">Xentral</a>, a German startup that develops ERP for online small businesses, but it clearly didn’t plan to stop there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now raised a $75 million Series B funding from Tiger Global and Meritech, following up from existing investors Sequoia Capital, Visionaries Club (a B2B-focused VC out of Berlin), and Freigeist.</p>
<p>The cash will be used to enhance product, hire staff and expand the UK operation towards a more global ERP market, which is <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/cloud-based-enterprise-resource-planning-erp-market">expected to reach</a> $32 billion by 2023.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, Benedikt Sauter, founder and CEO of central, said: “We hook into Shopify, eBay, Amazon, Magento, WooCommerce, and also CRM systems like Pipedrive to collect the software together in one place, and try to do it all automatically in the background so that companies can really focus. Our goal is that a business owner who decides on Friday that they need a flexible ERP can implement and configure xentral over the weekend and hand it over to their team on Monday.”</p>
<p>The German startup covers services like order and warehouse management, packaging, fulfillment, accounting, and sales management, and, right now, the majority of its 1,000 customers are in Germany. Customers include the likes of direct-to-consumer brands like YFood, KoRo, the Nu Company and Flyeralarm.</p>
<p>John Curtius, Partner at Tiger Global, said: “Our diligence has uncovered a delighted customer base at xentral and a product offering that has evolved into a true mission-critical platform for ecommerce merchants globally. We are excited to partner with such product visionaries as Benedikt and Claudia as the business scales to serve customers not only in Europe but around the globe in the future.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Xentral was Sequoia’s first investment in Europe since officially opening for business in the region this year. Sequoia backed other European startups before, including Graphcore, Klarna, Tessian, Unity, UiPath, n8n, and Evervault — but all of those deals were done from the US. Sequoia and its new partner in Europe, Luciana Lixandru, is understood to be joining Xentral’s board along with Visionaries’ Robert Lacher.</p>
<p>Alex Clayton, General Partner at Meritech said: “Meritech invested in NetSuite in 2008 with the vision of bringing ERP to the cloud… We believe that xentral will bring automation to hundreds of thousands SME businesses, dramatically improving multi-channel processes and data management in an ever-growing e-commerce market.”</p>
<p>Sauter and his co-founder Claudia Sauter (who is also his wife) built the early prototype of central originally for their first business in computer hardware sales.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a while, there have been talks about revamping the outdated 2007 Act of Nigeria&#8217;s information and technology body, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA).</span></p>
<p>The bill which established NITDA as the agency to oversee Nigeria&#8217;s technological transformation is quite outdated. This past decade, Nigeria has arguably become Africa&#8217;s most attractive destination for venture capital. It is also home to two unicorns (Flutterwave and Jumia) and billion-dollar fintech company Interswitch.</p>
<p>To keep up with the pace of innovation that has swept the country, NITDA tasked itself to review these laws and make them more beneficial for startups. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, in March, the director-general Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi <a href="https://nitda.gov.ng/nitda-to-realign-its-2007-act-with-digital-economy-ideals/">proposed the realignment of the Act</a> with &#8220;tenets and ideals of the fourth Industrial Revolution&#8221; and Nigeria&#8217;s Digital Economy Policy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we might</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have caught a glimpse of what that <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fOTMidYbICS10aIwWpjdDdgyCBhGUNM7/view">amended bill</a> looks like, and its details are rather </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">concerning than friendly towards startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, the bill states that NITDA wants tech companies operating in Nigeria to get a license, pay pre-tax profit levies, and sanction whoever (person or company) that operates contrary to the new Act&#8217;s provisions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, the World Bank ranked Nigeria 131 out of 190 countries on its <a href="https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploreeconomies/nigeria">Doing Business Index</a>, which measures the ease of doing business through a comparative assessment of regulatory environments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the <a href="https://home.kpmg/ng/en/home/insights/2019/10/nigeria-ranks-131-in-world-bank-s-2020-doing-business-report.html">report</a>, Nigeria was one of the top 10 countries with the most notable improvements during the review period of May 2018 to April 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granted, the country made some improvements during this period but since last year, any talk of progression from the country has been on paper</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reality, businesses, especially those focusing on technology, have faced harsh regulations and policies detrimental to their growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/after-vcs-spend-millions-nigeria-restricts-ride-hail-motorbike-taxis/">operations of motorcycle-haling companies in Lagos</a> were halted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">indefinitely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in early 2020, forcing them to switch business models </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> survive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March this year, the country&#8217;s apex bank <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1985223/nigerias-crypto-ban-has-startups-and-traders-in-a-frenzy/">barred people from trading cryptocurrency through banks</a>; crypto startups haven&#8217;t looked the same despite using peer-to-peer methods</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more recently, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">Twitter ban</a> has affected small businesses in general and how tech startups communicate with customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>What&#8217;s in the bill?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Section 6 of the amended bill details the powers accrued to NITDA. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of them include the powers to fix licensing and authorization charges, collect fees and penalties and issue contravention notices and non-compliance with the Act</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency says it also reserves the right to &#8220;enter premises, inspect, seize, seal, detain and impose administrative sanctions on erring persons and companies who contravene any provision of the Act&#8221; subject to a court order</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In section 13, NITDA proposes establishing a fund (The National Information Technology Development Fund) to carry out the country&#8217;s digital economy objectives</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How will this Fund </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be financed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Grants-in-aid, fees, accrued money under administrative payments, and levies charged from tech companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill declares that tech companies making an annual turnover of N100 million (~$200,000) will have to pay a levy of 1% of their profit before tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In section 20 of the leaked bill, NITDA says it will issue licenses and authorizations for tech companies regardless of their size. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The licenses </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are classified</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into three &#8212; product, service provider, and platform provider. The bill provided no </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> information</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">about</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what these licenses entail and how startups qualify to get them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the agency is more concerned about stating what will happen to individuals or companies that do not get these licenses or pay the 1% levy fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Any person or body corporate who operates an information technology or digital economy service, product, or platform contrary to the provisions of this Act, commits an offense,&#8221; the agency said in the statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals found guilty by the agency will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be fined</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not less than N3 million (~$6,000) or placed into custody for a year or more. The bill states NITDA can also decide to charge such a person both the fine and imprisonment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a fine of not less than N30 million (~$60,000) will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be charged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against corporate bodies. The &#8216;principal officers&#8217; of the companies may also serve a prison sentence for two years or more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And individuals or corporates that deny personnel from the agency to carry out duties </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">under</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Act will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be fined</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not less than N3 million (~$6,000) and N30 million (~$60,000), </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Prison terms range from a year to two in this section for individuals and members within a corporate body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further offenses and penalties </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are mentioned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later in the bill. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, any company which falls into the category of paying levies and does not pay after two months will be liable to a fine of 0.5% of the total amount to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be paid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every day after the default</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch reached out to the agency for comment regarding the validity of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaked bill but did not receive any response as of press time.</span></p>
<h2>Startup bill v. NITDA Act</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NITDA&#8217;s leaked amended bill is coming when the Nigerian tech ecosystem has rallied around to engage policymakers in the country to <a href="https://medium.com/@startupbill_ng/whats-going-on-with-the-nigeria-startup-bill-577efc21603f">enact a Startup Bill</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Startup Bill is geared toward creating an enabling environment for tech startups through co-created regulations with the Nigerian government</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This month, the first draft will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> public towards a first reading in the country&#8217;s National Assembly in October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Momentarily, uncertainty hovers around the stakeholders&#8217; next steps following the content revealed in NITDA&#8217;s revised bill because the agency is supposed to play a major role in bringing the Startup Bill to fruition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leaked NITDA Amendment Bill also presents a whole new level of threat. It is heads and shoulders above what tech companies might have faced in recent memory. If passed, it will alter how they operate and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">drastically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affect the ease of doing business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many have called for startup leaders and tech companies to lobby the legislators behind passing bills to law. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the general sentiment is that lobbying is a dead-end for now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sources say motorcycle-hailing companies tried to lobby with important stakeholders before the Lagos state government banned them from operating on its roads</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it still ended in a ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being one of the pioneers of the Startup Bill, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, co-founder of Andela and Flutterwave, also thinks lobbying might make for a futile effort</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a tweet, he says Nigerian legislators are not &#8220;lobbyable,&#8221; and startups should prepare for the worst while hoping for the best. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also offered advice to Nigerian startups to start building for a global audience and incorporate their companies outside the country if necessary</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News is vital to society, but it’s also incredibly expensive to produce. As ad rates have suffered across the industry (minus a positive blip this summer), publishers have increasingly turned to paywalls to make ends meet. There’s just one problem: the open internet which allowed readers to range over the entire thought of humanity has transformed into row after row of walled gardens locked down by angry sentries. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/06/subscription-hell/">subscription hell</a> I talked about three years ago has indeed only accelerated.</p>
<p>Fixing hell is going to take some doing, but three veterans of news and media in Europe are ready to take a crack at it.</p>
<p>Benjamin Mateev, Martin Kaelble, and Axel Bard Bringéus have come together to launch <a href="https://www.informed.so">informed.</a> (official branding: no caps, mandatory period). The Berlin-based startup wants to be a layer on top of prominent paywalled news services, connecting readers with curated “playlists” of news and opinion stories called Read Lists and augmented with an original summary. The company was founded in January, is currently in beta, and has raised a “significant pre-seed by modern standards” from local shop <a href="https://www.468cap.com">468 Capital</a>.</p>
<p>What’s interesting here is the team. Bringéus previously spent six years at Spotify where he ultimately worked as global head of markets during the company’s rapid overseas expansion. He has most recently been a deal partner at prominent European firm EQT Ventures. Meanwhile, Mateev was a lead engineer on to-do list platform Wunderlist <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/02/microsoft-purchase-of-wunderlist-confirmed/">through its Microsoft acquisition</a> and head of product at opinion news site <a href="https://www.theeuropean.de/en/">The European</a>, and Kaelble has been a long-time business journalist at places like <a href="https://www.capital.de">Capital</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189944" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189944" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2189944" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg 4942w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/informed-founders.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189944" class="wp-caption-text">informed.&#8217;s founders Martin Kaelble, Benjamin Mateev, and Axel Bard Bringéus. Image Credits: informed.</p></div></p>
<p>The trio, who have seen success in their varied careers, took a step back to explore how they could fix the varied challenges of the news industry circle 2021. They did “diary studies” where they asked people to track what they read in the news, ran surveys across thousands of people, and also talked to media executives and investors.</p>
<p>They found that paywalls have been mostly successful the past few years for media companies, but that growth is flagging as core readers have purchased subscriptions. “Almost all publishers post-COVID and post-Trump have hit a wall with their paywall strategies,” Bringéus said. “Many were able to monetize their content directly in their core geo, so they are very open to working with non-cannibalizing third parties like us.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Simultaneously, young readers in the Gen Z crowd increasingly want to peruse quality news, but lack the means to pay the exorbitant subscription fees at some of the most prestigious sites. “They want to read but financially they can’t afford [it],” Mateev put it. I asked somewhat skeptically whether our illustrious progeny actually want to read quality news over viral TikToks, but Mateev said the evidence pointed strongly to yes. “That’s where the interesting thing lies … the old publishers do have a lot of good standing with the younger audience,” he said.</p>
<p>Informed, which is working with the Washington Post, The Economist, Financial Times, and Bloomberg, will group articles from those sources among others onto Read Lists, while adding its own news summary to the event. For example, you could imagine today that the platform would have a Read List on Afghanistan that would include breaking news stories from the Kabul airport as well as a curated selection of deeper-dives and opinion pieces that talk about the history and perspective of the crisis in the Central Asian nation. “You can snack or you can eat if you want to,” Bringéus said of the design.</p>
<p>He noted that while there are similarities with Spotify playlists, a subject with which he is very familiar, news doesn’t have the same properties as music. “In news, you don’t need all the news and it is perishable, [so] you want to cluster it,” he said.</p>

Image Credits: informed.</p></div></p>
<p>The company will launch its mobile-first product later this year, although you can sign up for the beta test today. Ultimately, the company is looking to pursue a freemium model with all the licensed content behind the paywall, while its own news summaries will be free.
